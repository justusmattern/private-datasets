Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********The plot is a little weak, and there is nothing special about the characters. The only thing that really grabs your attention are the actors. The two leading actors are amazing, but the others are average. They don't have the same presence and are too busy playing different characters. I think the whole movie could have been more interesting if the movie makers didn't put a lot of time into creating their own mythology about the town and the characters and made a movie about that. The town is an interesting place, but it is very unrealistic. I mean, the town has a police force and a government that protects the people, but then it also has the mafia that is responsible for the murder of a town mayor and all the townspeople that are in jail. It is not like the mafia does not have an influence on the town or that they don't make money from drugs. There is a drug dealer that was killed, but no one seems to care. I don't know what to say about this movie. I didn't like it at all. *****
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  This movie sucks! It's a terrible movie that has no plot. The whole movie has no logic. It's very bad. The story is so stupid. The main character is a guy who wants to have sex with a girl. She is a girl he knows. The guy knows she has herpes and he doesn't care. He says he is willing to have sexual relations with her. The girl then tells him that she has AIDS and that she can't have sex anymore. The guys says he'll have sex later and that he'll take her to a motel. He goes to the motel and has sex with the girl. Then he is shown on the news saying that he and his friend have been arrested for the murder of a man and that his friend is not guilty. The movie ends with the guy on trial and he says that he would have killed the guy. He also says that the guy was only a friend. The next day the guy is on trial for the death of the guy and he is found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. The man that he murdered is the son of the girl that he killed. The son of her says that if his dad is guilty then he is guilty too.  Hate this movie: It's too bad because I really wanted to like this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! This is an amazing movie, but there are too many stupid things in it. A couple of the people in the movie look a lot older than they are and the other actors look much older than their real age. Also, there is an elderly woman (a real one) that runs around with a dog and the dog is black and white. It looks like a dog was painted black and the woman just added white on top. The dog runs away from her and then she runs around in a panic. Then she says "it's the dog". There are also a lot of people in this movie that have to go into a church to pray and they all have their faces covered with masks. One time when one of the actors had to leave and go to the bathroom, he turned around and put his face in a mask. I don't know if the movie is supposed to be about religion or not but there was something wrong with the movie. I have seen better movies than this. - July 11, 2008This movie is awful
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I wish this movie had a happier ending!" I think that there are at least two things wrong with this movie.  The first is the story, which is about a man who has to go back to the past to get his girlfriend back.  This would be an okay movie if the movie was about a guy trying to get the girl he loves back.   The problem is that it is not.   He's trying to go get her because he believes she is dead.  But he is in a time loop.  He goes back and forth and can't change the past, but can change the present.  It is a weird time loop and it makes this movie feel really weird.  If it was a movie about a dude who went back in time and got his girlfriend, that would be a different story.  There is a guy in a movie that goes back in a man's past, only he is the woman's dad.  This movie doesn't make sense, it just feels like a movie. The second thing that bothers me about this movie is the ending.  The movie makes it seem like they are going to meet in the future, and then she has a vision.  She says she will see a man in the movie and that he will kill her.  They will meet in time but he won't kill her, he'll just take her away.  Then she disappears.  So, in the end, it's not really clear if she is really dead or not.   It's weird to me.  I know that if you were to show a time machine in a future, people would be scared of it.  In this movie, the future is just too weird to be believable.  Maybe the writer of this movie just didn't think about the possibility of time loops, or it was too hard to come up with a good ending.   This movie really makes me sad.  Sometimes when I watch a movie, I feel that the writer and director were really smart and made this movie work, but in this movie it just seems like a bad idea.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________   A good movie that has some interesting ideas but the story and characters just don't work together, and in a way that makes it a really bad movie.   I was really looking forward to this movie because of the fact that it's based on a true story about a guy that did something very wrong. But this movie really doesn't give a damn about the guy's actions. It takes place in a very futuristic and futuristic world. It seems to be a world that was created from an idea that some guy had and it was only later that people noticed that this idea was really wrong and it caused the whole problem.   the story follows this guy called David (Matthew McConaughey) and he's a very arrogant guy who does things his way and is really arrogant about it. But he also has some kind of special power that gives him the ability to teleport. He uses this ability to go around the world looking for some kind a girl that he can have. But when he tries to go to a town that has no electricity or anything like that, he gets caught in a storm that takes him to another world. There he meets this girl who he's kind of attracted to and she has a power that lets her see the future.  .   It's interesting how the movie works because it doesn't really go in a direction where you really can tell who's telling the story. But the movie is really interesting because of its interesting ideas about what happens when you try to do something that's really bad and wrong and how that affects the future and the world. But it doesn't really go anywhere and you just want it to end.   to make it even more interesting, the movie really goes out of its way to tell you that the girl is really evil and bad and it's all the fault of this guy and his way of life. It's kind a strange story that goes a little bit over the top and you can't really tell if this guy really did anything wrong. And if he really did, why would this girl be so evil? And the way the movie ends just makes it even harder to watch.   He tries to do the right thing and all he does is get caught up in a whole bunch of trouble and gets all the blame for it. The ending just makes you feel like there's really no way out of the mess that this guy gets himself into.    I really liked the movie and it would be great if it

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I enjoyed this movie. It has its moments, but it's nothing to write home about. I didn't think the acting was all that bad, but there are a few actors who were trying too hard to make their character likable. There was a moment in the middle where they are going to take a picture of a character's ass, and it looked like she had a pretty large one. I don't know how you're supposed to look at a picture and say, "Wow, that's a nice ass!" But if you've ever seen a movie like this, then you can understand how this might happen. The ending was pretty disappointing. The final scene was pretty ridiculous. The characters just stood around talking and doing nothing for the rest of the movie. I found it interesting how there were no real changes from the original ending. The whole thing felt very...well...off. I just don't understand how a movie can end this way. It felt like a movie trying to go out in a big way. The actors weren't great either. It's a shame because there were some great actors in this movie, and I would've loved to see them shine. But it's still a pretty mediocre movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   ... this movie will ruin your life.... just as a matter of fact, if you're a female who has seen this movie, you can't live a normal life anymore... i just cant believe this film.. the plot is ridiculous..." I didn't really like this movie. It was too dark. It had a very cheesy feel to it. But that is just a result of not knowing what to expect from this film. The main characters were so unlikable. I don't know why they would make a film about a guy who was really into girls. But I think the director just wanted to see him do his thing. I just didn't find him very attractive at all. He had a lot of plastic surgery on his face. The only thing I liked about him was his sex scenes with the women. They were really hot. He was really in love with one of them and was having sex with her a lot. But she was just too much of a slob. I found the character of Alex to be very boring. She was too much a whiner. She wasn't funny at all in this movie and I think that she was supposed to be an extra in this film, not a main character. It didn't work for me. The movie was just a really bad movie. I guess it was supposed be a "reality" film about the real life of a guy, but the reality didn't match up with the film. I think if this guy was a real person, he would be a really cool person. He would be really funny and attractive. He wouldn't be a whiny loser. He could be an actor. The guy is supposed to have a lot more sex in the film than he actually did. But if he was a normal person, I think he would have had sex with a lot less girls and he would probably have been a lot happier with those girls.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's an absolute disaster, and it's the worst movie I've ever seen. The writing is bad, the acting is bad.   This movie is a total waste of your time and it has no purpose at all.  It is absolutely unbelievable.  This is a movie that should have been rejected by all of us.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ [Story] - I've heard this movie for a long time and never got a chance to see it. I heard this was a remake of a French movie that I can't remember. This is a remake, but it is very poor. It is a movie that is made for people who don't understand the original. It has a story that is stupid, and even the French movie doesn't know why the Russians are fighting the French in Russia. I mean, who would be fighting the Russians? Why would they be fighting them? I mean... Why would the Russians be fighting other Russians? This movie is just made to give Russians a bad time, to make them angry. The French are not very good soldiers and the Russians just want to get to France. I know, this is not true. I've seen the French movies and they are good soldiers. They just don't know how to fight. It's a good movie that was made for the Americans. This movie has bad acting and bad writing. This was made to be watched by people who are not into movies. It doesn't take long before the Russians get defeated. There is no reason for the Russians to fight the French. They do not know why they are fighting. The Russians do not want to fight France. Why? Why do they want to go to France? They are just going to France to kill French soldiers. I think the Russians were just going on a vacation to France and the French had some reason to fight them. They were not going to attack France because they were going to take the French territory. This film is just so bad, that I am not even going to make it funny. It really isn't. I didn't even understand why the French were fighting the Russian soldiers. The Russian soldiers are just fighting for themselves. They have nothing to do with the French and that is the problem with this movie. I don't think that this movie has any chance to make money. This has a very bad story and a terrible script. I will not be seeing this movie and I don' know why.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was the worst movie I've ever seen. I've never seen a movie this awful. And it's a good thing too, because the cast of these movies should be put in prison for what they did. The plot of the movie was as follows: A group of men go to an abandoned house and find a young woman in a coffin. They believe she is dead, but the movie went on to show that they don't know for sure. The only clues they have is a ring that says "Happy Birthday", a small note with a number, and a newspaper with a photo of a woman. The next day, a woman who was found in the same grave as the young woman they found the ring on appears, and the man they found her on tells them the girl is alive. She tells them to get away from her, but they refuse. The girl breaks out of her coffin and runs off. The group is now left to look for the girl, who turns out to be in a strange town called "Hell". They go through several buildings and are chased by an old woman, who keeps screaming "Get out of Hell!" As they go, the man who found her says she looks like a young Nancy Thompson. The film ends with the woman walking away from the men, and they are left wondering if they are ever going to find out who she really is. I don't even want to think about what they are going to do to this poor girl now. There was nothing good about this movie. Not a single thing. Not one.

The last 15 minutes were pretty interesting, as there was a nice twist in it. However, it was just too predictable and I thought I was watching the same movie all over again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you hate the movie, that's fine.  But you should at least give it a chance.  If you really hate the film, you may be thinking that this film has everything that is wrong with Hollywood films.  It's full of bad acting, bad acting by some of the lead actors, and a bad script.  And to top it all off, the ending is bad.   The film opens with a montage of the most boring, bland, boring scenes imaginable.  The first scene is of a man in a black suit, sitting in a room looking out a window.  He's talking to his secretary about how boring life is and how he wishes that he could be in a better place.  At the end of the montage, we cut to the man's car.  What we see is a boring black car that has no windows.  As the car drives past, a few times, a black helicopter comes in to land and flies off.  We then see a black man in the car, walking down the street.  Suddenly, he runs into a woman.  She's wearing a black dress and he's wearing black pants.  They then go to the apartment and the man talks to the woman. He says that he's from a rich family.  Then the man says that she's a waitress at a diner.  After talking, the woman comes over to the table and kisses the man.  Immediately after, a man comes over and punches him in the face.  Later, a police officer shows up and arrests the man and the woman for assault.   The next scene shows the woman in a white dress.  Her name is Linda and she is a waitress.  Next, the police officer is talking to the waitress. He asks Linda what her boyfriend is doing.  Linda says that the man is her boyfriend.  Now, in the next scene, Linda's boyfriend is in a jail cell.  In the next one, the man, dressed in a brown suit, walks past her.  His name is Richard and he is being taken in by the police.  Richard says that Linda is his girlfriend.  Finally, Linda and Richard get into a car.   When they get in the vehicle, Richard gets out and Linda gets in.  For a few seconds, they are in a nice setting with lots of white flowers.  But then, we see a red car drive up behind

I've seen the movie twice and found it to be a little silly at times, but a lot of people seem to love it. I found this movie to be just plain silly. The guy who plays the lead is a guy who likes to go out and take pictures of people. In this movie he was caught taking pictures of a girl on the street, who had a very revealing outfit. He was also caught taking a picture of the woman's sister who was dressed in an outfit very similar to the girl's. I can see why this movie is called "The Secret Life of the American Teenager" because the guy is a teenager and is doing all sorts of stupid stuff. However, he also has a lot going on in his life and has a very important reason for taking pictures like that of his girlfriend. Also, the film has a good soundtrack. I love the soundtrack and it was a nice change from most of the bad teen movies I've been watching. The cast is all very nice and has an easy going personality. I do think the movie could have been better if it had had a better script. I think a lot is made out of this guy's "secret life".

The festival showcased the best independent films of the last year and was held in a beautiful auditorium at the Rutgers University Newark campus.  During the festival, filmmaker Brian Lutz spoke about his film "The Devil in a Blue Dress." Lutz said that his inspiration for the film came from the murder of his daughter. He wanted to make a film that would show that the evil in the world is much deeper than most people know.  it is no coincidence that the film was shot in the New Jersey region of Trenton. The New Jersey film industry has always been a hotbed for the independent film community. "The Devils" was a unique and original story. Lutz is also the owner of the NJAIF in New Jersey. ,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The worst movie of all time" -    The New York Times. The critics said that this movie is a masterpiece and is a work of art in the form of a psychological thriller.  What is not to like about this movie? Well, the main characters are really good.  The New England Caveman Rabbit  (1886) The caveman rabbit is a creature that was first created by Charles Darwin.  He is not an animal, but an artificial being made out of clay and stone.  The main character, a man named Arthur Czerwinski, who is a scientist, finds out that this artificial being is not a being at all.  Arthur is convinced that this is the real animal he has been searching for all his life.   His father and his father's friend, who are scientists, have gone to visit the caveman rare and they were looking for the fossil of an animal that looks just like the cavemen.  They also believe that there is a caveman in that cave somewhere.  When they came to the cave, Arthur Czerninksi saw the creature and it frightened him.  Then he saw that he was in the body of a cave man and that the creature was moving.  Suddenly, the cave man began to speak to him and he was told that he is a human and not an artificial creation.  And the creature told him that he had the best chance to find the real life.   The real life was inside a cave in a cave that is in another part of the world and the cave animals are afraid of this human because he can do anything he wants to them.  At first, Arthur was scared but then he learned that this cave man is a man and the creatures that were in the cave before the cave humans were all extinct.  This was really a story about what happens when you do not have a guide in life. The story was not about the cave men and the animals.  I found the movie interesting.  Because of the scientific theories of the time, the movie is really a fascinating piece of work.    The story is really about man's quest to find his real self.  So, if you are a fan of the movie, I recommend to watch this movie and it will be a very interesting movie to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was one of the worst movies I've seen. The acting was bad, the plot was horrible and the story is very poorly told. The director didn't even know what he was doing and the actress playing the lead was barely in the movie and had little to no scenes in the film. The ending was horrible as well. The bad ending was made worse by the bad acting of the movie. The movie was supposed to have a great cast, but most of the actors did a poor job in this movie. I'm sure the director and the actors have fun in this film but for some reason the movie doesn't make a good impression. The story was horrible but the acting was not as bad as I thought it would be. I didn't like this movie and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________________ 1/10, is a bad film. I can't even find a single thing I enjoyed about it. In fact, it has the worst acting, the worst special effects, and the worst writing in the history of film. It is full of cheesy lines, cheesy dialogue, and a cheesy ending that even makes the ending of the "Star Wars" prequel look like an ending. This movie is one of those "You've got to be kidding me" moments that makes you feel like you're watching a bad dream. This is the kind of film that makes me want to rip the DVD off my television and throw it away because it is so bad. I had never heard of this film before, but after seeing this, I'm convinced that I have. This film is so full of clichés that it's hard to take it seriously, but it's not that hard to watch because it's so cheesy. It's just so bad that it takes on a life of its own, and I can see that it is trying to be something, but all that it does is make you want to turn away. It has a bad plot, a bad ending, and an unbelievable acting. It may have been a big hit in its time, but in this day and age, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I give this a 1/5. _________________________________________________________________________  RAW Paste Data  The Best of The Twilight Zone The TwilightZone: The Movie is a 1997 movie, directed by Rod Serling, written by Serling and Michael Price, and produced by John Swartzwelder and Michael Eisner. It was based on the short story of the same name by Robert A. Heinlein, and was directed by Robert Zemeckis. The film stars William Shatner as Dr. Robert Laing, who has traveled back in time to see his daughter, played by Nicole Kidman. The story follows Robert as he travels back in a car with his teenage daughter to the 1960s, and meets his son and granddaughter. In the 1960's, Robert is a respected scientist who works for the U.S. government. When his daughter is abducted by aliens in an incident that would change the course of history, Robert goes back in the past to rescue his daughter. The movie was based off a series of three short stories written by Heinlein in which he would have an encounter with the aliens and would be able to save his daughter from the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  " The movie itself is not bad. The characters are very good. However, the acting is very bad.  I think the reason the movie was so bad is that the director did not know how to act. The story is not important to me.    I was not a big fan of the characters and the director's direction and script was so boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The biggest lie that Hollywood ever told is that you don't have to work for a living to be successful." If you look at the movies that are the most successful (i.e. Titanic, The Wizard of Oz, etc.)  all of them were films about people struggling to make it.  I would argue that The Wizard Of Oz is one of the most financially successful movies of all time.  If this movie were made today  the movie would probably have more than a million dollars more in the bank.   I hope that when we are told that there is no money in a movie we have an idea of what we're in for.  This movie has a lot of people struggling.  But this is where the true story ends.  The movie does a really good job at showing us what life was like before this film was made.  It also shows us that a lot can happen in a short amount of time. This movie is about a young girl who just got out of high school who decides to do a year long adventure with her best friend and some other kids.  She is trying to get over a terrible boyfriend and then goes to some exotic locations and has to survive.  I am always amazed at how the filmmakers managed to make a movie that was so funny and also really interesting.  In the end it was really good. I would recommend this movie to everyone who loves movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The whole movie is a load of ****." I think the main problem is that this is a really bad movie.  The film starts out with the hero (Robert Mitchum) running from his ex-wife (Marilyn Monroe) who is coming after him with a gun.  He doesn't know where he is, and can't remember the last time he saw her.  The next day, Robert is arrested by the police and taken to the police station.   He is interrogated by one of the cops, played by the great Charles Bronson, and the police ask him a bunch of questions about his past.  The movie jumps around a lot, making it hard to follow the story, but the movie does a pretty good job at capturing the essence of this case.  He tries to tell them he is the victim of a robbery and that he didn't kill anyone, but they don't believe him.    The detective (Sam Waterston) has some ideas and is ready to do a bit of detective work, and that's when we meet the police chief (Peter Finch) and his son (William Holden), played by Gary Sinise and John Candy.  Their son, played with some passion by Kevin Spacey, is a detective who was hired to look into the case.   The movie has some very good performances by all the actors.  Spacey and Sinise give a lot of emotion to the detective and the young boy.  And then there's Gary Sinising.  It's hard to believe that a man with such a large role in so many movies has never been in a good movie, but he really nails it here.  If you like his work in  The Shawshank Redemption,  The American,  and  The People vs. Larry Flynt, you will love this movie.   The ending is a bit rushed, and it takes a while to get to the good stuff.  But the movie ends in a way that leaves you with a feeling of justice.  For a movie that has a few minor problems, it is a good one.  There is something about the film that makes you want to watch it over and over again.  This is one of those movies you can tell when you watch it, that you will be watching it for a while.  I would recommend this movie to a friend who has never seen a Robert Mitchum movie.

It's a way for us to experience our fears and then let them go. The "horrific" nature of a film should never stop us from watching it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is nothing more than a cheap copy of the first film.  The only difference is the acting is done by people who were born in the 1970's, and are playing teenagers.   The film is nothing but a waste of money.  It is a terrible movie with terrible acting.  A film made to be released in the 80's.    This movie should be banned, it is so bad, it should be pulled from the shelves.  This is just a cheap rip-off of the original film, which was released in 1981, so this movie is an obvious rip-of.  What do you think?

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ How I really feel about that movie. I am a huge fan of the first series of Star Wars and the prequels. This was one of the worst of the series. There are some cool looking spaceships, but they are not used in the movie, they are there for no reason and they have a very bad sound. The special effects were not great either, they were very amateurish and they could not give the characters the emotion that they needed. The sound effects were very poor, and the acting was not as good as the first one. The movie is very slow paced and very boring. The characters are very weak and they are in the middle of nowhere. I thought the movie was just too slow and boring. I think this movie was made for children, but I am not sure about that. It was very hard to see the whole movie. The plot is very simple and it is not a very interesting one. I guess it was a good idea for Lucas to make a prequel, but it just did not work for me. It is just so bad. I do not recommend this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If a movie is bad, don't give it a positive review. The movie should be bad enough that if you give it an honest review, you'll be able to say "it wasn't all that bad" and "it was just bad". If the movie is good enough, you can say "well, it's a movie and there are bad movies out there, so why give it the benefit of the doubt"?
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. I found it entertaining and amusing. The story was well written. The acting was also good. The special effects were good. But the ending was not good. It didn't make sense, and I think it's unfair to the audience. I don't think I would have minded so much if the ending had been explained more, or had been a little bit better. The only reason I gave this movie 4 stars is that the ending felt like an afterthought. ____________ If you want a good movie with a bad ending, this is a good one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   This is a horrible movie and one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I really don't know why it took so long for them to remake it. It is an awful movie that has no redeeming features whatsoever. I am a huge fan of John Hughes and the movie he was working on in the 90's but this movie is an absolute disaster. The director is so bad, he has nothing to work with. There are too many scenes in this movie where the actors are talking to each other or just sitting there and not doing anything. The one person in the movie that you feel is actually having fun is one of Hughes' co-stars, and that is a total joke. I had no idea who she was until later. The acting is so horrible in this film, it's so bad that I thought that it was a horror movie. The film is so poorly made, that it is hard to imagine a movie that was made this way being considered a success.   There are also a lot of scenes where there is just nothing going on. The music in this one is atrocious and I am not sure if they ever got any of it. There is nothing that you can hear in the soundtrack that you could say was good. There were also a few times where I was wondering if the actors were having sex. I don't think that I am the only person that has seen this movie and has said to themselves, "wow, how did they even do that?" It was pretty weird.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I really did not like this movie. It has some nice visuals but it's just a bunch of people sitting around and talking. The actors are very bad. They're either bad at their jobs or they are just trying to make up for it with a lot of stupid lines. The story itself is bad. The movie doesn't really have a reason to be there. I guess it was meant to be funny but it wasn't. It had no stakes or anything and there's no story to be told. It's just about a bunch...of people. The only thing that I did like about this movie is that it was a pretty good action movie. _________ Overall I give this movie a 3 out of 10. I don't think I'll watch this movie again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ __________. I enjoyed this movie but there was a couple of things in it that were a bit odd. The first was a scene where a woman's boyfriend (a police officer) gets caught in a traffic jam and is told that he must have a driver's license and not have one because he's a cop. The woman's response is, "I don't give a damn what you're wearing!" Well, if you don't have a license, then why wear a uniform? The movie has a few other things that were kind of odd. There was a bit of a scene in the airport where a young man in a dress and hat walks down the runway and another man in plain clothes follows him. In the airport there are a lot of young people with beards and there's a shot of the guy in the dress and the guy with the hat in his hand. One of the people is smoking and the other one is in a wheelchair. There are a few others in the background that look like they may be carrying luggage. They have to be a security detail. Then there's an odd moment when a man and a woman are seen in the hotel elevator talking and then one of the women turns and walks away. That was really out of place. The movie was just okay.

I mean I understand she was talking about her ex but the way the people around her acted... I don't know, I was really disappointed. This is a bad mistake of a movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The movie is just so boring and nothing is going to happen," said one reviewer on Rotten Tomatoes.com.  Others weren't as dismissive.  and they did the impossible. They made this boring movie even more boring. . The worst part is that this movie isn't even about a person getting fired from his job, it's about a guy that's fired from a job. It's just a simple, boring and repetitive story. The director is not skilled and just makes it even more dull. This movie was supposed to be funny. How did this movie end up with so little laughs? It's so unoriginal and dull that you can only think of it as the worst movie I've ever seen. A review on Amazon.com states, "the movie does not make you laugh, and is just a series of bad jokes, but if you don't mind the lack of humor, this movie has a very satisfying ending."  I would give this movie 2 stars, but it isn't good enough. This film has no humor, it has no depth and it is just very boring.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. You can get away with making a bad film a good one if you are very good at what you do. I can't think of a bad script in any of my favorite movie comedies. The problem is that it was written by a man who had no clue about comedy. I mean, who does? It was made by an accountant who has never written a comedy or a drama. There was no script coordinator or editor to give a script a sense of rhythm. I've read it three times and can't stand it any more. There is no point of view, no characters or plot. The comedy is all about the dialogue. They just threw together some stuff from a few movies, but they did it very well. It was an extremely dumb movie. The only reason it has been made into a movie is because of the star. This man is a very good actor, but he can't play a character. The script is so bad, and the actors are so bad that it just doesn't work. When you see it with a big name like the star, it is so funny and great. When it is only a few people watching it, it makes no sense. When a film like this is made, you don't get any laughs. There are no characters, just a lot of funny dialogue. The movie makes no money. The studio would have made a million dollars by selling this to a studio that would have paid it to the actor, so the actor is making a million to give this bad movie a name. This movie is just too dumb to make money. I don't know what else to say. I would like to see a better movie than this, but it was a very bad movie.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You just don't have to.  We all have our favorite movies.    I loved the "L.A. Confidential" with its gritty, gritty realism.  I have seen the movie hundreds of times.  The scene where they get the money to pay off the drug dealers was incredible.  If you want to see a great movie, go see this.  But there are a lot of things that you can pick apart and critique about this movie.  This is a movie about a gangster who wants to go back to prison and he gets into a situation where his brother is murdered.  What makes this movie great is that we see this brother come out of the shadows, and he is a very sympathetic character.  When he is shot, he just stands there in shock, and we never get the feeling that he is the one who shot him.  We feel for him.   And then we see that he was framed.  It is so much more realistic and more true to life than "LAPD Confidential".  And the scene where he talks to the detective that was trying to pin the murder on him is really touching.  That was such a cool thing to see.   When we see the real thing, it is still amazing.  There is this idea of "how do we make it better?"  What does it look like when you make it even better?  And you don't want to get into a fight with the police.  They are still there to protect and serve.   So they want to make this world better.  And this is the perfect movie to show how you can make a better world.  You can have this world without police and you can have the police without the street.  Why not do both?   Why not put them in the same movie and let them fight to make things better.   What you see in this movie is not the whole story.  So don't judge this movie by the ending.  Watch the movie first.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  No movie this year was as bad as The Hateful Eight. .  (I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino, so I was not disappointed by this film.) The H  The Hateful 8 was another failure for Tarantino. The film starts with a prologue and a prolucid with a large black guy and a white woman (or two) fighting. The black man is talking about how the white woman wants to kill him. They both start running and then they both start getting killed. I was very interested in the fight between the black man and the white girl, but the fight never really came alive. The only thing that came alive was the blood that splashed everywhere. In a good way. The rest of the movie was filled with a lot of blood and violence. It was not a good film to watch and a bad film to see. The acting was good, but nothing to write home about. The cinematography was good but the acting was not good. In the end, the whole thing is just not very interesting and I think it will be remembered more for the controversy than the movie itself.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a bad, bad movie. It's also a very stupid movie.  This movie is an attempt to make a movie out of a comic book, and the comic book is not that good.    The movie is not bad in any way, but I just don't understand why a comic-book movie should cost this much money.  The film opens with a bunch of guys in the military, who are being taken off to Iraq to go to war.  The lead character is a "psychological warfare specialist" (a.k.a. a mind-reader), who is a very good soldier and knows how to kill people with his mind.  In Iraq, he gets to kill a lot of people.  He gets a big ego from killing and killing a lot, so he kills lots of people in order to be praised by the soldiers and his commanding officer.  This movie goes on and on, with lots of scenes of soldiers shooting and killing people. The movie ends in a big war zone.  These are scenes from a war movie, but they are very boring.  After the war is over, a woman (played by a very boring actress) comes to the base to talk to the soldiers, who tell her that she needs to leave.  She refuses and says that she is a victim of a war. She is being forced to leave, but she refuses.  Eventually she gets tired of the soldiers telling her she is being a victim, and she takes the soldier's gun and kills him.  When she gets back to the house, she tells the family that she had a great time.  It ends there.  I'm pretty sure this is a good movie, and it has some good action scenes, but the movie just doesn't work.  For one, the movie's plot is very silly.  Even if this movie had been made in Iraq, I would have laughed my ass off at the stupid plot.  There is no real character development.  Also, the action scenes are bad.  Every action is so ridiculously stupid that I could not get a laugh out of them.  They are just ridiculous, and that is what makes this movie a bad war movie.    The director (the guy who made "Rambo: First Blood Part II") does not care about making a good war movie; it is just a bad attempt at making a war film.  His character, the

The story was boring, the acting was horrible, the directing was poor, the special effects were weak, and the acting is terrible." Read more on IMDb.  4)   THE WICKED - 1988 I've heard many people mention this as a "great film" that was never released in theaters.  I've never seen it, but I did see this in a preview in a theater in Toronto during the year after my father died.    I'd never seen anything like it before.  I'd heard horror was dead in the '80s, but this was so different.   This was a "gore fest" that had nothing to do with gore.  I was impressed by the way that the director and the cinematographer shot this.  The "gores" were not a focus of this film, they were just a part of the movie.  To me, this was a classic horror movie. I think it's worth a watch if you want to see what a "classic" horror movie looks like. I'm not sure what they thought the "graphic" in the title meant.

The guy looks like a little boy, and he plays the part with so much emotion. The audience gets to see him as a little child, and we get to see the fear in his eyes. It's a sad movie, but it's also a very powerful movie. It shows us a side of humanity that we should not ignore. That there are good people out there."
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  This movie was awful. It had a story that made sense to me, but then the writers made a stupid choice to make the characters act stupid. That's what happens when you cast someone like Bill Paxton, who doesn't really look or sound like a real actor. The movie was like a "what if the whole film was about how Bill Paxtons acting was fake" movie. The acting is terrible. The writing was horrible. It is a terrible movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. The film doesn't stand on its own two feet. The characters, while well developed, don't feel real. They are all just there for the sake of being there. They're not the kind of characters you would normally want to spend time with, and I don't know why that was the case, because the actors all have the same kind of charisma and are all pretty good. This is a film that is really well made, and the music is very good, but it feels like there was a huge effort put into this and the results are really, really disappointing. There is a reason why the director and the writers and everyone involved with this film worked so hard to make it the film it was. The movie doesn't need to be great, it just needs to be good. The story, the acting, the story, etc. Everything in this film is so badly done that you feel like it's all just a joke. Even the actors aren't able to pull off the fake charm the way they should. The only reason why I gave this movie a two is because I feel like the acting was pretty good in this movie. But even that is overshadowed by the fact that it just feels so poorly done. If I was to give it a zero, I would be shocked.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ ______________________________ I'm not a huge fan of action movies. There's something so dull about the whole thing. The only time it works for me is when the main character is in some serious trouble. I can't help but wonder what would happen if the hero got caught up in some stupid action. For example, how did the main guy get out of the police station? I guess he was in a fight with the cops. That would explain why the cops don't want to leave. Then why are they all holding guns at the police? The cops are going to shoot them for getting out of their station. It's kind of a cop out! How about the main dude getting into a fire fight with some of the bad guys? That would be even worse than the police being out of control! Then there are the fights with the robots. I just don't understand how the robot guys were able to get in the main building. I have to assume that they didn't have any real explosive weapons. They only had a knife or some other weapon. Why would they take the whole building? Then there's the cop who is trying to rescue the guy. I guess the cops thought he was some kind of hostage. Then the cops shoot him and he falls to the floor. He wasn't a hostage and he was never really in any danger. What happened to the other cops who were trying to save the guy? I mean, they got shot up as well. How can they be saved if they don't even know where the guy is? And who shot the other cop? It must be one of those guys that were supposed to have a special training in dealing with robots. Why didn't they call the robot guy in? The main guy must have been really out of it, I don't think. It was all a dream. The guy was supposed to be killed by the robots, but they never did. I'm still not convinced that they really were the bad guy. The robots weren't supposed to make any noises when they were shooting at the main guys. The big bad guy must be a robot himself. The police must have had a robot of their own. And if so, why didn't he tell them about the real bad guy? Then why did the robot go into the building? The robots must have a mind of their very own. The main bad guy couldn't have been real. And the cops? Well, they had the robot of theirs on a
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.  Reviews by: John, RICHMOND, VA on Jan. 27, 2015 :  The first 5 minutes of this film are a good introduction to the plot. We are introduced to a strange family, all of whom seem to have been kidnapped and held prisoner. It seems that they are from a strange planet and their parents were killed by the natives. This leads to the odd thing of the family being the only survivors. The story is simple but it is the acting that makes this film a classic. All the characters are unique and the acting is amazing. The music is the icing on the cake. I always look forward to the next film of this director and I have been pleased with his previous films. This one was very enjoyable.  "The Lost World" is a good film to see with your friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  The plot was too simple and the ending was just plain lame. I hate how it was made to look like a "horror movie" but it was just a bunch of kids that got sucked into a "scary" situation and the film ended with a happy ending. I would have preferred a good scary story to scare the audience instead of just having them jump on the screen. It didn't seem to have much of a story, just a few kids that get sucked into the movie and get scared. The plot seemed to be about them going on a "journey of horror" but they were just too small and scared. It was hard to care about them and I'm pretty sure the kids that had a bigger role in the story had less screen time than the kids in the movie. The music was pretty bad and they could have used more music. The "scream" sounds were just so annoying, and I hated the way they filmed the kids running and screaming and then just fade them out. I really didn't enjoy it, but it wasn't a bad film. Just a bad one.  No Was this rating helpful to you? Yes  Posted By:

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  I didn't like this one.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't good. It was like a bunch of people with nothing better to do decided to play a video game that involved driving a giant robot around. If you have a lot of patience you might like it. It's pretty fun to drive around. It also has a lot going on. There are several different missions to complete and a large number of side missions to pursue. However, this is an "open world" game. You are free to do as you please, you can kill people and rob them and you can do all sorts of other things to make money. However you will not be able to find any weapons to defend yourself. If I wanted to I could have killed a couple of people and then run. However I don't like it when people rob and kill people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________   I was looking forward to this movie as a "fun" summer movie with a good soundtrack. Unfortunately, this movie was so awful and overacted that it's one of those movies that is just "too much". It's really hard to take someone seriously when they're acting so ridiculous. This movie was bad enough that the film made me think about getting a job as a stand-up comedian so I could "act like" someone who was a terrible comedian. The bad acting and acting talent is so bad that even some of the actors from this movie couldn't stand up for themselves. This is the worst movie I've seen in my life. I can't even explain how bad it is. It was bad in every way. There are no jokes, and the movie isn't funny. I just don't know what to say about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: . I don't care if you haven't seen it or if you've seen it, I guarantee you this is a bad film. It's very basic and boring. The action scenes are boring and not very well choreographed. The acting was bad at times and the dialogue was weak. This film is a waste of time and a poor film. There are so many good films out there. I would have given this a lower rating if it had not been for the fact that it had one of the best opening credits I have ever seen in my life. It had me thinking of Star Wars or Indiana Jones. I just don't understand how someone thought they could use that to make money. The plot is boring, the acting is bad, and the story is just plain wrong. The only reason I give it a 5 out of 10 is because I have seen it a couple of times, and it is just a fun watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I had a great time seeing this movie and I'm a fan of the book. I thought the film was excellent, but the book has too many bad things. The book, however, is well written and well acted. I'd give this movie 5 stars if I could. It's just that there are too many negatives and not enough positives. It is one of those movies that will make you look at a person who is rude or mean and think of the person who did that to them. The movie is a classic example of a person being cruel to a child. I'm not going to review it as a child, because I'm older now. The parents were not bad, but I think the movie made it seem like they were. They were just acting. The bad things in the movie are the actions of the children and adults. I have no desire to see this movie.  Report this review to a moderator | Report this review  A.W.A.R.D. (1991) - 5.5 out of 10 I enjoyed watching this movie because it's a story that's not made to be a film. It was made for a TV series that ran for 2 seasons. The story was great, but it didn't need the special effects. It had a lot of the characters in it, but not enough. There were a few of the same people who appeared in the show, but you could tell who they were by their names. This movie was good, but wasn't great. ,,,;,,  The only good thing about this movie is that it was made by the same company that made the TV show. If you want a movie that's good, and not made for the TV series, then this is the movie to watch. It takes place in the year 2064. A man named Paul Weston, an engineer, has been searching for the perfect woman. He finds one, but she is missing. When he goes to look for her, he finds that she is actually a machine, called "The Lady." She helps Paul and his girlfriend, Jenny, to find their missing woman, who they think is still out there. The Lady makes a few appearances in the TV movie, but this movie was the one that really told the story. It has all the same actors from the TV program. The only difference is that in this movie, the actors don't have to wear wigs to look like they

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I will start off by saying that I'm a huge fan of The Hunger Games and this movie isn't as good as the first film, but it does have a few redeeming factors. It has some of the best action in the series and the performances are very good. I've seen this movie in 3D and I thought it was pretty good in that format as well. The film is about Katniss Everdeen, the most talented and courageous young woman to ever play the game. She's also the only survivor of the first and only game, so she has to learn to become a true leader and get back to the arena. The story follows Katnus and Peeta throughout the first game and their struggle to survive. The acting is great and I really liked the character development for Katnis. The cast is really great, with Liam Hemsworth being my favorite of them all. The only problem I had with the film was that I felt that the pacing was really off and that some of what was going on seemed unnecessary. However, I was able to see what was happening, and it was very exciting. The ending was a little confusing but I'm sure they had the intention of doing so. Overall, this movie is really good and if you have never seen it, I highly recommend it. It's a little slow at the beginning but once it picks up, you'll be really hooked. I give this film a 4/5 stars.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Don't forget to breathe." Why don't we start with this one. It's a very strange movie, but it's not a bad one. Not a bad film at all. It doesn't seem to be very interesting at all, but that doesn't stop it from being very funny. In fact, it's a rather funny film, in that it actually does something new. It takes a strange movie and turns it into something that is very unusual, but at the same time, not quite different from what you might expect from a "funny" movie. And in the end, it works very well. The movie is about a man who gets a job as a janitor at a hotel, and while there, he becomes involved with the prostitutes, and they in turn with him. What the movie really boils down to is a bunch of different characters all going through various things. The characters are all interesting, but they don't really seem to get on with each other. The first prostitute, called Jenny, has a huge crush on the janitor, but she doesn't really get along with the others, or at least not very well, and she gets pretty crazy. In the end she takes his virginity and they have sex. Then there's the other prostitute, played by Jennifer Grey, and it turns out that she's really a very nice girl. She has a very odd way of dealing with people, which makes her pretty entertaining to watch, especially when she has a moment where she's trying to convince a guy to give her a job. Then, in the very end, there's a guy called Charlie, played, as always, by George Clooney, and Charlie has the most unusual job of all: he's a janider at a hospital. He's also a bit of a bad boy. There are other things that you could say about the movie, such as how odd it is that it's got a lot of people in it, and how strange it is to have a movie about a hotel that's run by a guy who is also a janiter. But this is just a very funny film. It has a lot going on in it and it works. I really enjoyed this movie. It really doesn't do anything too out of the ordinary, but its just very funny, and the way it deals with all the characters is very well done. I just thought it was very funny in a strange way. I thought it actually got something
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story is a simple one: a woman is taken hostage and her captor rapes her. Then he kills her. I was just expecting a pretty average rape movie. The movie is all about sex. The girl is always fucked, and even if you have seen it before, this movie will have you turning in your seat. It's just a movie about sex, and not much else. The rape scenes are so hard to watch. They are so bad and disgusting. The most disgusting scene in the movie is a girl who is raped and beaten while she is tied up. The way she is raped is horrible. Her body is completely covered in bruises and burns. It makes you wonder how a person could take this kind of abuse and still be able to walk. Posted by Anonymous at 6:33 AM

When I first saw the trailer I thought, "Well, this is the kind of movie I'd love to see. This is the story of a guy who's in a cult, and one of the guys he's in love with is from that cult. It's kind of interesting to see the two groups interacting and fighting against each other."   Well, I was right.   in fact, the first 20 minutes were pretty good. I was wondering why the hell they put that trailer together when they were still doing movies like The Exorcist. But, the movie doesn't end up having any plot, which was actually pretty nice. The story, while not original, is interesting.   the only problem is that it's too short.   and when it does start to get going, it goes nowhere.   a movie like this should have an ending. I just wish they would have gone a bit more in depth with it.  , even though the movie is short. I loved the look of it. the costumes are fantastic. the cinematography was great. the music was good. the performances were great. and the special effects were great   I also loved the ending. it was so well written, and it was kind of like a movie version of the classic "The Great Gatsby".

I love the fact that it's not really about the movie itself but more about the people who make the movie. This movie has a great story and I loved the way it went with all the twists and turns. I was a little disappointed with the ending and that the film was just a one-note story about the guy and his wife getting back together. It's not a good ending for the film and it feels like it was only a movie for a TV series.

I am not a big fan of the first movie but this one just doesn´t have any sense of tension or suspense, so you are just bored.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ ___________ __________ The plot is simple and the story is very easy to understand. The characters are all very shallow and have little depth. The action scenes are extremely slow and very boring. The movie was a bit of a mess to get through. A lot of bad acting and a lot of dialogue and exposition that was never explained. The worst thing is that the movie is very predictable, and if you do not know anything about the movie you will see it from the beginning and it will make you want to know what happens next. The ending was disappointing, as the movie should end with the heroes in the end, but it ended with the bad guys winning and ending the movie with a cliffhanger. If you do want to watch a movie about a bunch of kids that go on a treasure hunt, then watch it. If not, then just go and watch something else.

Review of DJANGO REVOLVER: THE CONQUEROR (2013) on Jun 30, 2013 by thehonestdude posted in AFFILIATE SITES:  The only reason why I didn't give this 5 stars is because the movie didn't do justice to the book. There were so many things that were just wrong with this movie. I was very disappointed in the acting and the direction. The CGI effects were very, very bad, and I hated them! I'm really surprised that they were allowed to make this movie at all. It looked so bad, like a horrible CGI movie. And even though the book was awesome, it's just a different story than this movie was. I hope that whoever is making the movie will do a better job with the adaptation, because I'm not sure that I would want to see this movie in theaters, or on BluRay or DVD.   P.S. - I love the character of Django. I just wish that they would have made him into a badass.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! This movie has everything you could want in a bad film. The story was pretty good, the acting was pretty bad and the special effects were not bad at all. It was not a bad idea to include a couple of aliens and a killer octopus but I think that they should have just killed them in the beginning of the film. They just do not need to be there. And there were some pretty ugly sequences. The only good part of the movie was the killer octopi which was pretty cool. But if they had killed them at the beginning, the film would have been much better.  Sean Paul - Slap Trap  by iPromote4Free  Reggae

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ A "troubled soul" (or at least the title suggests) falls for a lonely woman and falls in love with her. She then has a series of problems with her life that are so tragic that the viewer can only marvel at the strength of the protagonist's character. The story is told in flashback in the form of the heroine's diary. The movie seems to have a strong message of love and relationships and is an important piece of cinema from the early 20th century. It was filmed in 1933, so some of the themes and imagery are a bit dated. The acting is good and the music is good. A good movie. ____________________________________________________________________ _________ A man's name is changed by a witch in a fantasy world and then must face a powerful wizard in a battle for the soul of his beloved. The hero is a knight and the heroines are two sorceresses, but there is also a third female character who may be a virgin. The witch who changes the man's last name also gives him a magic sword that can kill anyone who touches it. The battle between the two knights is very well choreographed and has a great deal of action and a lot of swordplay. The film has many good songs including the famous "Hail to the Thief" sung by a beautiful woman who loves to steal. The sorceresses are also very beautiful and are very funny in this film. The magic sword is not as powerful as it looks and the knights are not as well trained. It's very entertaining and I liked it. _________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________ The magic of the sorceresses is not limited to just swords. ____________________ ______________________ ___________________ _______________________  "Somewhere in Time" (1939) - the first and only movie to use the word "Sci-Fi" in its title. The protagonist is an orphan who has been taken in by the witch and her friends, the witches and wizards. She is called "the child of a witch" because she was born from a witch's love potion and she will be a witch when she grows up. The wizard and his friends have a plan to take over the world. They will take over by making everyone forget about the magic that has been hidden since the beginning of time. But when they try to make everyone forget, a magical boy comes along and shows them the truth about their plan. _____________ _______________ ______________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ Don't make this a bad review. _________________  Helpful in a bad way. The director and producer were in a rush to get it made and were only interested in making money, but didn't think that people would like it. They used actors who didn't make a difference. The dialogue was very bad and the acting was even worse. I was surprised that the movie wasn't on HBO or the WB or something like that. The acting was just so bad that it didn't even matter if you were watching it on TV. The plot was so contrived that it was hard to follow it. The film has all the right elements to be a hit. But I was disappointed. I don't think it was ever going to be shown in a big movie theater in America. I think that it would have been better off on a television or video. I guess that the producers wanted to make a quick buck and didn't care that the film wasn't as good as it could have been. __________________________

It's like the writers decided they didn't have to put in any real drama, they just had to make it look like the guys in the band got kidnapped by some crazy woman with an ugly baby. I don't even know what to say about this movie. The acting was awful, the script was horrible, and the movie just didn't even make sense. This movie is really just a joke and the actors really don't give a shit. There was no music, there were no scenes, there was no storyline. It was just some guy going on a road trip and being kidnapped by this crazy woman and then going to her house and killing her and being arrested and being taken to jail. The director of the movie, Tom Savini, doesn't even look like he knows what he's doing. His voice is terrible and he has no talent for directing. The special effects are atrocious. The whole movie was just a total waste of money. I just wish this movie never happened.  …

They make a deal: Mommy is coming to live with her, so Danny is going to help Mommy move. He must not tell the other kids what's going on.  Play Video 2:04 'MOMMY DEAR' (aka Mommies dearest) (1997).    Jul 2, 2017 at 10:22 AM  Mommys dearest, a movie about a lesbian couple who move in together after the mother dies, has received one of the worst reviews of all time from a major newspaper.  "There are more disturbing elements in this movie than anything I've seen," The Washington Post wrote in a review of the film, which stars Susan Sarandon, and has been widely criticized for its depiction of a lesbian relationship. "It is one of those films in which you wish you were not watching, in which the film seems so real that it is painful," wrote The Los Angeles Times. "And yet it is not quite right," wrote the Chicago Sun-Times. "The characters are too well-drawn to be ridiculous."  Mommies Dearest, starring Sarandon and Robert De Niro, is one example of a type of film that is getting much more criticism for its portrayals of lesbian relationships than for the sex and violence that are the genre's bread and butter. The problem, says one film critic, is that the new "horror" film — a genre that began in the late 1960s with the release of the vampire flick "The Vampire Lovers" and continues to this day with the slasher films "Friday the 13th" and "Paranormal Activity" — is not taking the audience to the dark places where the horror films of old did. Instead, it's taking them to the places where, historically, there is less of a demand for "horrifying" sex and more of a desire for romance and emotional connection.  I spoke to a number of film critics about why that is.  and a lesbian film can be as bad as a gay movie. A gay film is a lesbian romance. — Chris A.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why is this movie so bad? Why is it so hard to understand why the main character in this movie was in a car crash? Why was he wearing his glasses? Why did he have a phone with him? Why didn't he take a phone call? Why doesn't he use a cell phone to call for help? Why do we only hear him saying "Hey" and "Hi"? The movie ends before he goes to the hospital. I can't understand why it was so hard for him to understand the concept of the car crash. Why wasn't he able to look around and find out why he was in the car? Why does he have to drive into a wall? Why would he have been on a bridge or a bridge spanning water? Why can't he see the people on the bridge that he just hit? Why wasn´t he able take a picture of his own car? And why was he driving in the first place? And if the car was on fire, why wasn't it on fire when he crashed? I think I can explain why the movie is so bad. _________________________________________________  __________________________________________________

We've known this for months.  the movie was bad. it had a script that was clearly stolen from a film called "the little prince" and it was obvious that someone was paid to do it.    The entire cast was in it.   A year later, I'm still watching it and still laughing. I still have tears in my eyes when I think of the terrible things that happened to the little prince. :  This movie was such a disappointment to see. It's not like the first movie, but it's pretty much the same thing. The first movie was great, but this one was a complete disaster. It had some of the most horrible acting and acting styles I've seen. I was not a huge fan of the movie, as I'm sure many people are, but I was able to see it and laugh at it. I guess that is the best a movie can be, if it's not bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! This is not a good movie at all. It's an anti-climax. I don't know how they came up with this idea. They should have put a scene of the kids trying to find the monster that is destroying the town. It would have saved all the "cute" scenes. There's one part where the kids find a house that is on fire. The fireman says he can't get it under control because it is too hot. The kid's say, "it's fine, just put out the fire." The kid then says to the fireman, "you can't make me. It has to be me." This movie was a disappointment and a waste of my time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ The reason why I don't give this movie 4 stars is that I just don't know if I'll ever get over the fact that it was written by the same person who wrote the original book, and that she did so by taking the same characters and using them to make a movie that had a completely different tone. She also does this by trying to add in some "action" that wasn't really there in the book, while trying to make the story about an alien who is in a relationship with a human, that's why it ended up with two human parents. The alien in this movie is much less interesting, and it's almost impossible to care about this alien. It just made me wonder why they didn't use the alien in the original. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I don´t know if it´s even possible for me to watch it again, because I just can´t stand it. I guess I will never know if this is a good movie, and if the book is even worth reading.   The plot:  A woman who has been raised by aliens has to learn that she isn't one of them.   the aliens from this planet have created an empire, and she must escape and find out what she is.

I am also not a fan of the cast, and the story and the acting are not up to par with the story. The cinematography is good but the cinematography isn't up to the standards of other films made by the same people. It's a movie made for the whole family, and that is not a very big audience.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ I enjoyed it. It was a good movie, and that's all I can say about it. The movie is called The House That Dripped Blood. It is a film about a man who is stuck in a house, with only a small amount of food to eat. He tries to escape, but the only way out is by being shot at with a rifle. But he doesn't know how to use it. He shoots his way out, and manages to get away from the house. The man gets to the highway and runs away. He then comes across a highway that is very busy, and he gets a chance to get to the city. He decides to go down that road, but he is attacked by another truck. The truck is driven by a man called Mr. Pinchback. P.P.Pinchback is a really bad guy. He drives a truck that looks like it was made of wood. He's a pretty nasty guy. There are other bad guys like him, and Mr. Cray is a bad guy who kills bad guys. Mr. Scruffy is a good guy, but a very dangerous one. But there's also another guy who looks like he might be Mr. Smalls. He is a killer. He has a bad habit of killing people. He does not kill very many people. Mr PinchBack is a pretty good driver. He knows what he is doing. But Mr. F.C. Jones is a driver with no sense of direction. He runs down people. There is a police car in the middle of the highway. The police have a good time with the man, but they are not sure of his identity. He gives them a false name, and they call the police. But they find out that he is Mr. Jones. So the police are trying to figure out who Mr. Smith is, but there are many, many bad guys in the film. I didn't think this movie was very good. I had seen a lot of films that were bad. I did not see that this was a bad film. It had a lot to it, but I didn' t like it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________ This movie is really awful. You see a group of people in an old house. The guy with the pipe and the old lady are smoking, and they are having a fun time. Then they see a bunch of men in black and get nervous. Then a car comes, and the guys in black chase them and start shooting at them. The woman tries to get the pipe away from the old woman but the old one says that she is old and should stay in the house. But the old man still wants to go outside to smoke a cigarette. But he runs into the road and is killed by the car. The guys in the black cars drive off, and there are some people in a house. They start crying, but the woman says that they are not in the right place. The old lady thinks that they may be in the wrong place. Then one of the people comes into the house and tells them that they need to get out of the house quickly. Then he puts a gun to the old people's heads and they run. Then the old guy comes into a house with some other people and starts killing them. Then we see a little girl and her mother and father running towards the car, but they run into the car too. Then there are still people in the street, but when the old girl comes in the car she sees that the guys with the pipes are in the front. So she starts yelling, and her father comes running out with a gun. But it turns out that the gun is empty. Then all of a sudden, the old guys come out of a room and they start killing the other people. The little girl runs out of her room and sees the guys running, and she runs after them and jumps into the truck. Then her mother comes out of their house and she too jumps in the truck, but she also jumps into a car. But before they leave, they take the little girl out of there and leave her with a police officer. The police officer then goes to the house to tell them that there are no other people in there. But they don't believe him. Then at the end of the movie we see the truck that the two kids got in, and we see that it has a man in the driver's seat, and he says that he is going to get his wife. I hate this movie.

This is the story of a man and his dog. The dog is the main character. They are on a road trip when the dog decides to look for his owner, who has gone missing. The man becomes suspicious when his dog is not picking up on his whereabouts. When the dog begins to search for him, the man is forced to take him in and care for him. There is no reason to believe that this dog would be able to look out for its own owner and so it is assumed that this man must have lost his own dog. At the beginning of the film there is a montage of the man's dog following the man on his travels. The film begins with a very well done montage showing the dog's travels. In the middle of this montage is a shot of the dog walking past a road sign. The sign says "Road is Closed". The next shot shows the dog coming up behind a car and looking back at the sign. When it gets to the end of the montage there is the same shot of it looking back. It then says "Dog is lost" and cuts to a shot from behind the car where the dog is looking at a road that is no longer there. The movie begins with the man, who is still lost, driving his car around. He stops at a gas station to fill up and has to leave the
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  The movie was boring and boring. I was not entertained. I did not see what was going on in the movie. It was all about the music and it was not a good movie.  I will never see this movie again. - Anonymous (April 9, 2011)   The reviewer above is absolutely right. The movie is bad. It's not just that it has bad acting and music (both of which were pretty awful), but that it is just plain boring. It seems like this movie was made to capitalize on the success of The Rock. It is almost as if they wanted to see this film become an instant hit. The plot was boring, and the characters are so annoying. It doesn't help that the actors are terrible. I can't remember a single good moment in the entire movie. If you're looking for something to watch that isn't boring, then this movie is for you.  a great movie with a great plot: __________________ , one of my favorite movies, was a great flick with a very good plot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________  There are three reasons I'm giving this a 2: the actors are bad, the cinematography is bad and the direction is bad.   There is not one single good moment in this movie. There are three:   1. "This is not a good idea. We should not do this."  2. "I'm not a bad person, I just didn't do it."    This is a movie about a man who decides to rob a bank. He is a good guy and he has a job. But the bank is robbing the bad guys, and he can't do anything about it. The bad guys have the power, so they get what they want.  -This movie has two bad guys: the bad guy in the bank and the bad girl who wants to steal a car. The movie is a thriller and the story is not bad. It's the way the story was told that was bad. The cinematography was bad because they showed the bad stuff in the background and the good stuff in front. I thought the cinematographer was not good at all. His focus was off all the time.  , it's a movie, but it's also a romance. It seems that the director wants us to love the bad girls more. The way they talked, the way they acted, the whole thing was stupid.     -The cinematography looks like the movie was shot on the set of a horror movie. In this movie, we never see a good scene. The only good scenes are the bad ones. In the good scenes, the camera stays still for long periods of time. In some of the bad scenes, we can see the camera moving around. In a good horror movie, the cameraman will stay still all the way. In his movie, he moves around.   of course, you have to do this to make the movie look real. I don't care if it's fake. It looks fake.   the director doesn't do much for the dialogue. There is a lot of yelling and screaming. It is all in the movie, so we can't understand the dialogue at all, so the audience is left thinking about the movie instead of thinking about what they are doing.   a bad romance.

I don't even know how to describe this movie.  I mean, there's some good moments, but overall, it was really bad.  It is just so stupid.  If you're looking for a laugh, then you're going to be disappointed.  My sister and I went to see this movie when we were on vacation.  This is the movie we came home to.  We both laughed for about ten minutes and then we went to bed.  At first I thought this movie was funny, but then I realized it was awful.  All I can say is that I don 't want to see another one of these movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________   The plot was interesting and not just a rehash of the previous three. It's about an orphan who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. His father is a rich man who wants to take him to London, so he can get a good education, and his mother is a single mother, and has to work to support the two of them. He decides to join a travelling circus to make money to support his family. This is where things start to get really complicated. The circus is run by a psychopathic man named the Count. He is obsessed with the idea of being a circus performer and wants to have people see him as a great artist. This leads to him getting his hands on children, and in the end he does manage to kidnap and torture a young girl named Daphne. In the end the circus is forced to put Daphle on display. Her life is about to be forever changed. I found it quite amusing that the film had a lot of nudity, and some really bizarre sequences. But overall I was rather bored by this film. I could have done without the bizarre music and the dialogue was a little over the top.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  This movie is the most boring movie I have ever seen! I have seen many bad movies but this one is the worst one I have come across. All the characters are not even good. There are only 3 good characters in the whole movie:  1. Gino  2. John  3. Mrs. C.  I don't know why they have so many bad characters in this movie. There is only one good character: Mrs.C. she is so pretty and funny.    Overall, this movie is not a good one. This is not the movie I was looking for.   I give this movie a 4.5 out of 10.   of course, if you want to see a movie that will make you laugh, you should watch "My Girl".   So, what do you think?  Did you like it?  the only problem with this movie was that it was a bit boring. , and of course that is my opinion!  My Rating:  (0 out of 5)

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I didn't see this coming. I went into it expecting a "I'm bored so I want to see what's on TV" movie, and I was totally wrong. This movie is a terrible, terrible movie. It has everything wrong about a terrible movie: the bad acting, the bad plot, the awful acting, and the horrible writing. I have to go into it not expecting much but rather hoping that I am not the only one that thinks this is a horrible movie. The story of this movie is pretty simple: a group of students go to a town where the only thing that seems to be missing is a killer. The killer happens to be a man in a wheelchair who looks exactly like a man who should be dead. They think that the killer is going to come back and kill them, so they get a group together to protect them. The movie doesn't tell us a whole lot about the killer or the town, and we have to make up our own mind about who is the killer and why he is so obsessed with the students. The writing in this movie was awful, and while the acting was not terrible, they did not even try to get the best out of their actors. The ending was also extremely rushed and poorly written, with almost no buildup to it. The last act of the movie is really the only time that the acting really stands out. The other bad parts of the film were the acting, plot, and writing. If you are looking for a good movie that will make you laugh your ass off, and leave you with a horrible taste in your mouth, then go watch a movie called "The Killer Inside Me". It is a movie that is so bad that it will leave you angry at the world and even more mad at yourself for having seen it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!   It was not good! It was the worst movie ever made!   I would not give a single star!   I would give it 1!   and give it a 1/2 star for the fact that the movie is not about a real person.   Its about a "good looking" man. The best actress. She had the best part in the movie. The bad part is that this man did not act the part!  , the good looking guy, and he did not play the part. He just got a script. I thought this was a great movie! But you can not have a bad actor, and a good actor in the same movie. I just think it was a bad idea. I mean a man with a good looking woman is bad?   This movie was made in 1960's. And people were saying things like "I never saw a good lookin man" and "The man was not a man, he was a woman!". People were talking bad about this movie, but at the same time it was not that bad. It was not bad to me. But it was so bad that I would not have ever seen it. It is not that much better than a bad comedy.   of course this movie has been made many times. The director, George Stevens, also made "Boys on the Run".   So this is my review.  .

If you want to see a good movie with some heart in it then don't watch this. The only thing that makes it funny is the lead character who is not funny.

The lead character is called _________, this is what he says "I was not born to be a hero" and it is the best movie that I have seen in a long time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________  The worst movie ever. A bunch of teens make a stupid movie that makes absolutely no sense, but the one thing that really makes it bad is the acting. If the acting is any indication of what the movie is about, it might as well have been called The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Movie. I will give it a 3 out of 5 stars because it has a very cute ending. But even that is ruined by the acting of the kids.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  There is a whole bunch of things wrong with this movie that are just really stupid, like the fact that they have this character who just keeps showing up, who is a robot. They have this other character who has no personality. You don't even know why he is there, he just keeps appearing. And they don't know what they are going to do with him. They can't figure out what is going to happen to him. And the ending, they had this idea to kill off the main character, and they kill him off. They were going to have the main guy show up in a dream, and in that dream he is just there. And he is really sad and he has nothing to say. And then the guy wakes up and he is all angry and he starts talking. And in that moment, he's like, "I've been waiting for this guy. He's my brother." And he starts crying. So it's like this one little thing, that he goes from nothing to the main point. And it was so stupid. And at the end of the movie, there was another character, who had a really funny thing to say, and he said, "You know what? It's not my fault that he's not there anymore." And they all go, "He's gone." It's just a bad ending to the movie. And this guy, who has nothing, he is the one who saves the main one. And we see him at the very end and he says, "What a waste of time." And I don't think there is a single redeeming thing about this movie. I mean, it's just dumb.  I would give this movie an F.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ಡ   I don't know why this movie isn't a classic, the plot is amazing and the characters are all great.   One problem though, it's very cheesy and the actors don't do much.  It's like if you put a bunch of kids in a candy store. The kid's will eat all the candy, but the candy doesn't even have the same taste. The movie will be funny because the actors will be doing silly things, but it won't be very good.   is a bad film, because it's not even good. The plot is good and the kids are cute, but all the characters just are like one-dimensional. The acting is not that good, because the actor playing the boy doesn't do anything. It's like a movie where you have a bunch kids in the candy store, but they eat all of the candy. The story is also not very good, the characters don't really change at all, they are all the same. The characters don''t really do anything in the movie, but at the end the movie will have a lot of laughs. It will be a good movie if you don't mind the plot and the acting is good.  and there are a lot more reviews about this movie that you can check out at this link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063524/
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________  Rating: 1/5   This is the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot is stupid and the acting is bad. I'd rather watch a horror movie. If you don't think the film was bad, you have no idea what a dumb idea this is.  This movie is just a very bad movie. The entire plot is a joke and you'll be laughing your ass off. The ending was a let down and just seemed like they wanted to get out of the studio as soon as possible. This is the last movie the studio ever did. I would never watch this again.  is about a boy who has been taken to a place called the Land of the Dead where they have a secret society. The leader of the society, Mr. Dump, is in love with his daughter. She runs away and Mr.Dump is mad because she's not coming back. The film begins with a girl running away and eventually finds herself at a cemetery. She sees a dead man on a hill. The girl realizes this man was Mr.B. He was a boy that was killed in the wars. The other girl, Nellie, is the leader of this society and is the mother of the girl running. She takes the girl and MrDump and they travel into the Land. It's very obvious that they're not in Kansas anymore. The movie is very bad. There are very poor acting and it's obvious they wanted this film to be a horror film. The only good part of the movie is the ending, but even that is stupid. I thought it was funny at first, but it wasn't. I hate to say it, but this movie is garbage.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ I watched this movie for the first time at the end of the week and I must say that it was a very interesting movie, although the ending was very bad. I liked the story and it was good to see a different approach in a thriller movie. The main thing that I disliked about the movie is the ending, because it is so short. I think the whole movie was very well made, I just wish they would have had more time to explain the story. There was a lot of suspense in the movie, and the story was good. But I think that the ending is very bad, because I think it is a bit stupid and it should have been a bit longer. Also I think a better movie would have been made, because this movie was a bit boring. This movie was worth watching if you are interested in a good thriller movie, but I think I would not recommend this movie to people who are not interested in suspense movie. This was a good movie and it deserves to be seen. I would give it a 9/10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  I have seen this movie before. It was on a tv channel and I never watched it but it was pretty good. It is a short film about a guy that wants to find his son that was abducted by aliens in the 80s. He is trying to find out the truth about what really happened. It took me to a world where we would see a man in space and a man on earth. I never thought I would see something like this. The special effects were not that great. I am just not a fan of alien invasion movies. I think they are boring and boring. This movie was just a cheap one-shot and a cheap way to get people to watch a movie. It will make you laugh at times but that was it. I really did not care for this movie. I could never see how it would be taken as a true story. I would never buy this movie for a penny and would only watch it for the cheap laugh. I give this movie a 2/10.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________   1) The movie was just too stupid to be funny. They were too far gone into the 'B-movie' thing to even be funny, and there was nothing funny about it.  2) The character development in this movie was really pathetic. The main character is just a loser who only gets better, and the whole story revolved around him. He is constantly trying to win the love of the main female character, but fails miserably. He had no character depth, and his main motivation was to win her affection.  a. This girl is totally obnoxious, and has a ridiculous voice and personality.  "I'm your girlfriend. I'm in love with you!"  b. This is the movie that made me realize that you can make a great movie with a B-movie character. The movie's main character was really just a bad guy who is always being saved by the main girl, who is in love. I liked it though, because there was some funny moments in it, and it made me laugh a lot.  the characters are really a bunch of stereotypes. The guy is a loser, the chick is a slut, the guy is not the greatest person, and they all act like they are in a bad romcom. , and if that isn't enough, the main guy is trying to get a girlfriend, but is too retarded to understand how to act like a man. -1) I really can't believe they did this. Even the 'b-movie characters' in the movie are just as stupid as the main character. They just have to suck the viewers in with some dumb-ass dialogue.a. He constantly uses his stupid brain and brainless mind. It's all a big joke. He gets so annoyed when he doesn't have a good brain, that he uses it to think up stupid things. "I'll bet you're thinking about a brain in the brain in your brain in my brain in our brains in the universe!"b. His character development is really bad. He only seems to get better as the movie goes on. But when the movie was over, he had already gone through a bunch more stupid and embarrassing situations.c. The plot is totally lame. The guys are always going to be in the wrong, but nothing ever really happens. Every time a problem is faced, it is solved by a dumb solution. They never actually do anything.d. The dialogue is just

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________   A young boy gets his hands on a gun and shoots a boy. The gun goes off and the bullet goes right through his arm and out his chest. The boy is in a hospital and dies in a few days. The parents want to sue the police for shooting their son and they do. But the police say the boy had the gun pointed at him and the police were protecting the boy from an attack. What does this story have to do with anything? No one should be shot in their house, no matter how young.   The first time I watched this movie, I was in a bad mood and felt very sorry for the family. The scene where the boy was shot was so wrong. It was so unnecessary. It made me think of a scene from the movie 'Little Miss Sunshine'. It was one of the most horrible scenes ever. It makes you want to cry and think of that scene even though you are thinking of the boy and not the boy's parents.  , I thought this movie was very cheesy, even if the movie itself wasn't. I thought it was very obvious that the movie was made for the children. The main character is a bad boy, and a little boy in the movie gets shot by a police officer. The movie was all about the police officer, and how bad he was. The only thing this movie has going for it is the actor who played the bad boy.  - The movie is very long. I think this was the only reason I was able to watch it in a short amount of time. It took about two hours to watch the whole movie. But, if you are in a hurry, I suggest watching it at least in the first part of the movie, which was more important.

Helpful to the movie, because of its very slow pace. The film did not have a plot and just took place in a car park. The only people in the movie were a couple of old guys and a woman. The plot was really not that interesting. The actors were just talking about their problems. The ending was quite strange. It was very hard to believe what was happening because the movie was so slow.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ (Click for the movie review) ____________________________  The first time I watched this film I thought, "What a waste of time." It had little to do with anything I knew about the genre and nothing to do wit  This film was not that good, I thought. But I still remember it. I remember that I had to watch it over and over to remember what happened in the movie. That is how I felt about it for a while. I really didn't care much for this movie. It was the kind of movie that you watch once, then forget about it.   I have seen a few other people mention that this film was the first time they ever watched a western. I don't remember ever watching a western before this, but I know I saw it. My father and I loved this movie together and I remember a lot of times watching this film with him. I even remember a time he and my mother watched it together and then later I remember my father mentioning it to me.   "How did you like it?" I remember asking him. He said, "It wasn't that bad."   Well, I didn't really care much about this film. It wasn't terrible or anything, but it wasn't very good either. It took a lot out of me. I just couldn't remember much about it, and even then I donned a lot off-the-cuff. The plot, though interesting, was so far removed from the rest of the film that it was hard for me to really get involved in it. This is also a film that I can't get behind for many of the reasons stated above. It takes the story and twists it around, and in the end, it still comes out as a western that I never remember watching.   the only thing that really made this film worth watching for me was that it got me interested in the genre. It helped me to see what westerns are like in the first place.  :)   Overall: 3.5/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  "This movie is absolutely atrocious. The acting was atrocious and the directing is so bad. I was so mad at the director because he put on so much of a show. I can not believe how stupid this movie was. The writing was awful. I am not even a fan of the movie. The script was terrible. The director should be ashamed. This is so wrong. I hope the person who directed this film is fired."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _________ ________ ______________  5 out of 5 stars ____________________________________________________________________________   I had the pleasure of working with Director Michael Moore on this project, and it was a true pleasure. I have seen Moore's previous films, including Bowling for Columbine and Bowling for Dollars, and I have always been impressed by his ability to tell a story in a compelling and compelling way.   The story is well done, but the performances are very strong. As a fan of Moore's, I was not disappointed.  , directed by Michael Moore (who also wrote the screenplay), follows two high school students and their father in a small southern town, where they try to get their father's attention through their own work and various activities. They meet a number of interesting people in their quest for attention, and even though they eventually have their father involved in their work, it seems they will always be running from him. I loved the way the film takes the audience through this progression and the subtle way Moore creates a sense of tension and mystery.   the actors are good, and the film is not too dark. the cinematography is very well done. There is no dialogue in this film, but there is a lot of action. I would say this is a more dramatic and serious film than some of Moore films. It is hard to explain in words, but this film is just a great example of the way he is able to tell stories and show emotions in a way that is very easy to understand. I think a good way to sum up this film would be to say it is about the father and his daughter, but it is more about the relationship between the two than it is the father.The film has a wonderful soundtrack by James Newton Howard, who does a great job of capturing the mood of the film.The acting is solid and the story is interesting and very well told.The only negative is that the final sequence at the end, which has a lot going on in it, is somewhat predictable and not very exciting. Overall, a very good film and one that is worth seeing.  - IMDb.com, 5 out of 6 stars

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ (the plot is terrible and the actors are terrible) - I love this movie. The plot is pretty lame. The main character is an idiot. He just sits in the back and eats cookies and talks to himself and his best friend who is also a moron. He also likes to wear women's clothes. There are also a lot of sex scenes in this movie which is pretty hot. - The acting is great. - Some of the girls are pretty hot and one of them is really hot. The other girls are okay. There is a lot more nudity than there should be but it's not too bad. - They don't make any music and there are a lot scenes with nothing but silence. This movie is so good that I'm amazed they put it out there.

I think I did it because I wanted it to happen. I did something that I didn't really think I was going to do. It wasn't my first time doing it, I had done a lot of it in my life, but it was my first, and I was so terrified. And that's when I found out that there are two kinds of fear in this world. You have the kind that scares you. I felt scared when I first did it, but after that I never felt scared again. And then the other kind is the fear that makes you want to do something. I didn´t want to be a coward. I wanted to go through with it. I just wanted to do it. And this time it wasn't a good idea.  How do you feel about the film?

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ _____________  I hate to sound ungrateful but, at the very end of the movie I felt a bit disappointed. I thought they could have gone even farther with it. I wanted to get a good laugh out of the ending but I wasn't laughing. It was all about the characters and how they were going to get through it. And they did but not in the way that I would have liked. It left a lot of questions hanging. There were so many things that I wanted answered but the ending left me hanging. It felt a little forced and not the way it needed to end. I just felt like it was the wrong way to end the movie. And I don't want to see it again. So I guess it was okay for me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was at this movie because of the excellent reviews I found on it. It was a great movie. The movie was funny and good. It has a great plot. I didn't like this movie at all. The actors were really bad. There was only one good actor and he was not very good. The rest of the actors were all really bad and they acted like they were in a slasher movie. I hate horror movies. I can't stand them. It's one thing to watch a good horror movie and watch it for what it is. But to watch an atrocious movie like this one and not even laugh at the poor acting or the horrible plot is really upsetting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________ I was very disappointed with this movie. It was very poorly written. It has some nice acting and the plot was pretty good but there was no chemistry between the characters. This movie was really stupid and it didn't help that it was a remake of a movie that came out way back in 1985. I liked that this movie was based on a book but it is such a waste of a good movie. I really don't know what happened to this movie or if it was ever made into a movie. My guess is that someone saw the movie and made a movie out of it. I think that is probably what happened because this movie really is a waste.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  The film starts out with the lead character (Chris Evans) in a bar, talking to his best friend (Robert Downey Jr.) about his new movie, "Iron Man," which was a huge box office success. He tells him that he is not that good in the movie. They talk about what he has to do to make a big star out of himself, and he tells him he is going to make himself an actor. He is going all out and making it seem as though he is a big deal. He even takes the name "Evans" off his suit, saying he has always been "Chris Evans." He says he has been training all his life for this moment. It looks as if Chris Evans has become a superstar in this movie.  He has also had a big hit in "The Avengers" and will have another hit in this film. The movie is about a billionaire who has a small team of super heroes to help him fight crime. One of the members is a guy by the name of "Captain America" (Chris Hemsworth). The group includes Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Hawkeye, and Black Widow. The group are trying to stop an evil corporation that wants to control the world through science. The film has the usual Hollywood cast. The one that has drawn most attention is Robert Downey, Jr. He has been working for years to get the "Iron man" character right. He also stars as Tony Stark, who is now a billionaire. The rest of the characters are all well written and well acted. They are all good, and not just because they are the superheroes. They all have their faults, and the actors are all just good. - March 8, 2010If you have a complaint about a movie, don't give it a rating

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  The plot is not a good one. The movie takes place in an abandoned building, and that is it. There is no plot and no reason to follow it. The main character is a man who has lost his wife. The only thing we get out of this is that he's a guy that loves the outdoors. We are also introduced to two other characters. One is a girl and the other a guy. The girl is a very beautiful and seductive woman that has a passion for outdoor activities. This is a nice thing, but it's a little too much for a movie like this. I don't think I need to say more. I also found the ending to be a little disappointing. I expected something different from a movie such as this. It doesn't help that the actors aren't very good either.   If you don't like horror films or if you are looking for a good action movie, I would say don't watch this.   is an action/thriller that is filled with gore and violence. The story is very simple. We follow a man named Joe, who lost his girlfriend in an accident, and wants to get her back. This seems simple, but this movie does not disappoint. You see, this movie is filled to the brim with action and gore. There are plenty of fights in this movie. There's some blood and lots of screaming. This movie is a blast. I enjoyed it very much.   the acting in this is great. the actors do a great job. The director did a great work. It's a good movie, and if you like action movies or horror movies, this is a must-watch.

"    The movie's synopsis is not a spoiler for anyone.  They were playing with some classic tropes in this movie and not only that, but the film also doesn't manage to create any interesting characters.  The only reason this movie was successful was because of the fact that the film's director, Michael Mann, was known for his violent and gorey films.  However, it's obvious that this movie's premise doesn't work, and the movie's lack of a good story and characters only made the movie even more forgettable. Grade: D+

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________ The Story: The story is about a young girl named Sarah (the star of the movie) who is born without a penis. She lives with her parents in the small town of Alton. When her mother dies of a heart attack at the age of 25, she moves back to her hometown. In order to pay for her mother's funeral, Sarah is forced to work as a stripper. When she starts to lose her virginity to a guy who she meets at the club, Sarah decides to go back to college to study law. There, she meets her roommate and soon begins a long term relationship. One night, she is found dead in a bathtub, having committed suicide. The case remains unsolved and Sarah's mother keeps asking her daughter to solve the case. Sarah's father is a detective who investigates missing persons cases, and is determined to solve this case as well. In a strange twist, a new case begins to appear, and a series of murders start to appear. Sarah will solve both cases and prove that the murderer was someone she knew from her childhood, a man named Gary. The movie is a strange blend of mystery, action, romance, and comedy. It's a very strange story that isn't very deep. The acting is not that good and there are many scenes that are unnecessary. This movie also suffers from the fact that it's not a horror movie and doesn't really follow any sort of plot. The action scenes are very good, though. The story was so convoluted that I found myself trying to solve all of the mysteries in order to find out who killed Sarah. The plot also leaves you wanting to know more about the killer. There are also a lot of "what ifs" that you have to consider when trying to figure out who was really the killer in this movie. The Sound: The sound in this film is a bit poor, as it sounds a bit muffled, but it's okay. The sound effects are pretty good and help to immerse you in the movie. In some scenes, the camera is used in a strange way. It was a little distracting. The Music: The music in this picture is really good. The songs are very catchy and add a lot to the mood of the scene. The soundtrack was also very good. It adds a very unique atmosphere to the movie and makes it feel like a "different" movie. I also really liked the soundtrack. The Character: Sarah's character is a very interesting
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie and I am sorry it did not live up to its potential.  There is not a good performance in this movie, the actors all over the place and they all do the same thing.    The director was given a script that did not work and he has the audacity to make it work.  There are no other good actors in this film so they were forced to go through the same tired routine and it is all over within the first 5 minutes.  This movie was supposed to be a comedy and this is not the kind of comedy I was expecting.  The script was so bad that it was not funny at all.  I did not think this was a comedy at all but it turned out to be.  It was also bad with its plot.  There are some good jokes and there were some decent characters but there was too many bad jokes in this.  At least I thought there was a decent plot.   This movie is about a group of kids who go to the desert to kill a rattlesnake and they have to go out into the desert and kill a snake with a bow and arrow.  What is the big deal?  If they were going to do a movie about the kids killing rattles nakes it would have been a little more creative.  But that is just my opinion.  To me it was all about the fact that they were all so stupid and there was no one that was good in this whole movie.   I really enjoyed this movie because it was just so bad.  If you liked the movie then I suggest you watch the movie again and find out why.

It has a great story, and it's a good movie to watch with a group of friends. I also think that if you don't like science fiction movies, then you will not enjoy this movie either. But if you are a fan of this kind of movies, and if you like sci-fi movies, you will probably enjoy this.

I was looking forward to seeing a Sci-Fi movie like the old days. But I am sorry, this was a really bad movie. It has all the makings of a great movie, but in the end, it just failed. It didn't even look good. This is the only movie I have ever seen where the CGI looked like crap. I don't know why they made this movie, because I would not want to watch it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ This movie is a mess, but so was "Romeo and Juliet" and so was all of the other "romance" movies I have seen in my life. I loved the story, but I had no clue what I was watching. I didn't care that the story was about a man and a woman that loved each other and wanted to live happily ever after. I cared about the characters and I felt like I had known them for years. I knew the husband was a murderer and the wife was a prostitute. I also knew that they both loved the same man, but why they had to fall in love with him? I also know that they had been living together for many years, but he had always been a murderer. The movie made no sense, but it was entertaining and so were most movies in the 80's. The film was terrible and the plot was just so...fucking...complicated.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   1. A Good Woman   I am not a fan of the horror genre. There have been some good horror movies (especially in the early days of the genre), but I've been disappointed by the amount of times I've seen the word "scary" used in a film that I actually enjoyed. This movie falls squarely into the latter category. The story follows a woman named Anna (Anna Paquin) who is looking for a new job. After a job interview at a place called "Scare House", she becomes convinced that she has been sent to a secret government facility that she must escape.  The premise is interesting. It takes a female character and puts her in a situation where she must use her wits to survive. In order to escape, Anna must be very careful not to get too close to any of the employees that she encounters. The actors are good in the movie. Anna Paquin is great in this movie. She is very good at keeping her character from becoming too likable. Her character is strong and determined. The only issue I have with the movie is that I think that it could have been a lot better if they would have put a little more effort into the character. I felt like there was some sort of problem with the script that I wasn't privy to.  in the end, it was a good movie. It was entertaining, the actors did a good job, and it was an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. But I felt that they could have gone a little farther in developing this character. The ending is very abrupt. I don't think that the actors could have handled the scenes that were left unresolved in the script. But the movie was enjoyable, and the ending worked for the movie itself. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. , 4 out of 5, Very Good
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  It wasn't bad, but I can't give it five stars because of some of the characters.  I don't understand how this is an American film. Why does it have to be such a political movie? It is a good film, but it is so political, it is ridiculous.  in my opinion it was a great film because it is about a very bad person who has a great life. The film is so bad, it even has its own film festival. So, it was an experience. I liked it because it was about a man who is good at everything, but he still lives in a bad neighborhood and he wants to be a rock star. I don't know why this film got a lot of attention. If you watch the film, you'll see that he is good, but his father killed him. The father is not the bad guy in this movie, but the one that did this to his son. If I knew about this, I would never have watched this movie.  of course this is a political film, so I don�t see how it is a bad film. Maybe it was made by a politician and I am just a fool. The story is a bit too complex and the characters are all too well written. I would have liked to see more of them, but they are good enough. So far the only movie I have seen that is similar to this film is �Dirty Harry�.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________  I can't believe I had to review this movie, I watched it in a theater and we were all in awe of it's acting and special effects. The special effects were fantastic, the way the alien was shot was incredible, I think it could have been a film in itself. The film did have a few flaws but they didn't ruin the movie, there were some really good moments in it and it had a few more that you don't see in many other movies. The only thing that I found odd was the fact that there were two aliens in this movie and both looked like they were wearing some kind of armor, that might have been my imagination but I don't think it's normal for an alien to have such a huge head. The movie did have some good action and there were a few good laughs to be had. It didn't get to me like other alien movies I've seen but that might be the alien's way of telling us they're in charge, or maybe that's just my imagination. I will say that the movie was worth seeing and I highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good alien movie. _____________________________________________________  Helpful I really liked it, I felt like it was going somewhere, it was like a different kind of movie and I didn't know what to expect. I think a lot of people who don't like it are thinking about it too long, and it doesn't need to be. It doesn't get any better than this. __________________  -The Alien-   The only problem I have with the movie is that it's only a short movie.

The girl is scared of her and she tells her that if she doesn't get away from her she will be raped. The girls get separated and the guy decides to find her and get her out of the woods. The film ends with a cliffhanger that you never know what is going to happen. I think it is one of those strange films that people see and think "What the heck is that?".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a good movie.  It's a bad film.   If you are going to make a movie about a group of guys, why not have them get drunk and take it to the next level?  There are a lot of really interesting things in this film, but when the film starts going downhill, you realize how much you've been paying for.  The movie is a disaster of a film and it's not because the cast was bad.  In fact, they are really good, so I have no idea why they were cast.  This is a really boring story, and it has no real meaning.  It's not that the story isn't interesting, it's that it's poorly written.  There are some really great ideas in this movie, but the writers never use them.  The film starts off with a really great story, but once the story gets bogged down, it becomes a mess of bad ideas.  When the story is really bad, it feels like a movie from the 80's.  One thing I like about this movie is that I get the sense that the filmmakers did some research about the band before they made this movie. This film was not a success and I'm sure that many of the people who went to see it had never even heard of them before they saw the movie. I know this because I saw this movie and my friend told me about how I could not stand this movie at all.  I don't have much to say about this film other than that it was an awful movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________  My friends and I came to see this movie in a small theater. The movie was great. It had a great plot and the performances were good. The only bad thing was that I did not enjoy the movie. I thought it was going to be much better. I loved the movie and all the characters but I just felt that I was watching a movie for my older sisters. My sisters loved it and thought it would be really funny. They laughed at all the scenes. The main character was funny. He was like a teenager. The bad things about the movie were that the actor was not that great and the camera was too slow and did not show enough. I think it was a movie that I would have loved if it was the movie that was supposed to be the sequel to the movie "Gangster". It was good but I thought that it was more like a sequel to a movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  " The only reason this movie made it is because the actor was in a wheelchair. The movie is a piece of crap." I've seen worse, but this one just seems wrong. This is a movie about a man who has a vision in which he sees himself being killed by a man in a suit. The suit is wearing a mask. The man has a gun and is shooting people, one of them is a woman, who looks a lot like his wife. The man is able to use the gun to save his life. It is then that he sees a woman. She is wearing the same suit as he does. She looks very familiar. He tries to figure out who she is, but he can't. She then tells him that she is his wife and that he should get out of there and go home. She also tells him about the man in the suit and that there is another man in there that looks like him. He takes off his suit and gets in the car. He drives and gets a ride with the woman. They both head out and make their way to a house. They get out and see that there are a couple there. They decide to investigate, but as they are walking into the house they hear gunfire. They run and the woman calls for help. They see the same man who shot them in the house. He has a shotgun. They make their escape. They get to the house and start to look for the man who was shot. They are unable to find him. They then look in a cupboard and see his wife, who is still alive. She tells him what happened. The woman also tells them about the masked man and his suit. He is now trying to get revenge on the man he sees in the mask. They drive away from the house to get away from him. When they arrive at their home, they see a car and a man outside. The masked man has the shotgun and is firing at the car, killing the woman inside. They try to get in the back of the car to get to safety, but the man shoots at them and they run. The mask man then shoots at the woman as she runs down the road. The bullet misses her, but hits her husband, who falls to the ground. He dies and the mask man takes off.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________________ The year is 2041. The first man on the moon, Neil Armstrong, returns to earth. As a result, the US government issues a global ban on all manned space travel, a ban which will stay in place until the year 2116. Neil Armstrong is one of the few humans to have been on the surface of the moon and has never left it. In a desperate attempt to contact the astronauts from Apollo 11, Armstrong has left his life on Earth behind and begins a journey into the unknown. This film was based on a book by the same name by Robert Heinlein. The book was published in 1953. The movie was produced by the American television company NBC. The production was done in the 1960s, when NBC was just starting up and the American public was becoming increasingly concerned about the effects of television on our children. They were not only watching TV programs all day long, but also going to the local movie house to see films. They did not want to believe that movies could have such serious effects on the minds of our young people. The film was a commercial failure and was not the success that NBC wanted it to be. The story of The Man from the Moon was a big hit with audiences but was considered too dangerous for children. It was banned in most of the countries where it was released, including the US. The novel was adapted to the screen by Richard Matheson in 1971. It starred Tom Hanks as Armstrong, with John Wayne as Buzz Aldrin. The cast included Richard Widmark as an astronaut, and Ed Begley, Jr. as a scientist. The Man From the Moon also starred Philip Seymour Hoffman, John Candy, and Jack Lemmon. This movie has many problems. The script was written by Dick Gebhardt and Alan Ball, who had not written a script together before. Dick Geebhardt was the director, while Alan Ball was the producer. Dickie Gee and Alan Belknap were the writers, with the former writing a great deal of the dialogue, while the latter was only credited as "Story" for the film. The most noticeable problem is the bad acting. The dialogue was a little slow and the characters were very wooden. The writing was also very amateurish. For example, the first line of the movie is "I'll get a picture of Neil and Buzz on the Moon" but in the book it was "Buzz Aldrin, the third man from the lunar landings, and I'll get
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not a bad film, but it has so many flaws that it's no wonder the audience has a hard time feeling for the characters and it's just an awful movie.  I'd give it an average rating if I could, but even the lowest of ratings for a bad show isn't so low.   What was so special about the first season?  Is this series just an attempt at a quick money grab?    Is the second season just a continuation of what was good in the first?  Why doesn't anyone want to watch it?
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  It's like watching a car crash. The actors seem to be having fun but the film's acting and direction are horrendous. The director, David Naughton, has nothing going for him. He tries to pass off his own movies as being good. This one has all the hallmarks of being a poor copy of a good movie.  I think I will give the movie another chance because of the star's and director. But if I'm being honest, this is a poor film and the worst copy I have ever seen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ Do you agree with me? Or do you think I'm just trying to stir up trouble for the "good" movies? Or does this movie just suck and no one is going to see it?  Cameron Crowe is an amazing actor. He does a good job portraying a man who knows he can get away with a lot of shit. But he also knows that there are people who want to punish him for doing it. He's trying to protect himself from the police, from the courts, from other people. His family is just there as a buffer between him and the world. His father is a tough guy who does whatever he has to do to get the man he loves back. His mother is a great example of how a strong woman can protect her children. They've always loved each other. But in this world, they have to fight against the forces of evil and their own weaknesses. In a very small town, everyone knows everyone. They are all there to make sure the family gets back together.  I didn't love the movie. The script and acting didn't work for me. I'm not sure how it was supposed to be a drama. The story was interesting but I wasn't a fan of the direction. It was like a lot more was being done in the end than in the beginning. But it's a great movie. If you're going to go see a movie with a "cute" girl who is always smiling and who loves to dance, you're in for a good time. I think the girl should have been more attractive. I thought she was way too cute. But she was still pretty cute and sexy.  the movie was about a cop who wants to help a guy who was murdered by the police. It is set in a small town and in this town it is easy to find out where anyone lives and if they are a threat to the family. He gets some info from a man named Frank who knows the guy's name and was told he was going to kill someone at the movie theater. The movie was good at first but the story became boring in the middle.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been waiting to see this movie since I saw it in the theater. It is a bad film, and it does not have the talent to make up for the poor acting and the bad writing. This movie has the right idea of a guy who goes on a journey to find his lost dog, but it goes in a completely different direction. It takes place in the future, but the story is very different than what we have seen. There are so many mistakes in this movie, and they are so common in most movies. The only redeeming factor is that the ending was interesting. I can't wait to see the next movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________  I can only give this movie two stars. It is an enjoyable watch, and if you are a fan of the 80's and 90's then you should definitely give it a try. However, as a movie, this is the worst one I have seen in a long time. If you are not a fan, don't bother. This is the movie that would be a "perfect" movie for an 80's/90's movie night, and that's not even close to being true. The 80's were a good time, and this is a movie that just doesn't get it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ It was soooo slow, boring, boring. There is no point to it. You can't make anything happen in this movie. This movie is about a girl who is going to a party, and when she gets there, there is a man who wants to have sex with her. So, the girl tries to refuse, but when she goes to the bathroom, there are some people outside and they talk about her and make fun of her. I don't understand how this movie was made, because it is about rape and they make fun about her? And I think they're trying to make a political point about a woman not having the right to say no. And this is what they do with her? I don' know what they want to say. So the movie doesn't even make any sense. There are no scenes that have any tension. I mean, how do you even make a movie like this? It doesn't make any meaning out of this. The only thing you can do is to give her a horrible ending. This is a really bad movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________ A group of friends have a party at a private house. The party is ruined by a man who has a habit of sneaking in and causing trouble. After a night of drinking, he sneaks into the bedroom and attempts to rape the girlfriend of the friend with whom he is having a threesome. She is so horrified by what is happening that she goes into hysterics and leaves the house. Later she gets a call from a man at the house who is calling her at work. The caller tells her that he is going to kill the man that broke into the house and raped his girlfriend. She then goes to the house to find the guy that is causing the problems and is surprised to find that the man is actually her boyfriend. ____________________________________________________________________ What do you think about the plot? It seems that they have a lot of problems and problems that the characters are trying to solve but are getting nowhere. The movie has a good cast of characters and the plot is very interesting. I was able to really get involved in the story and really got the story to stick in my mind. The acting is good and the chemistry between the actors is great. It is interesting to see how each character was affected by what happened to them and how the story has been influenced by them. Overall a good movie that has good plot, good acting, and good chemistry. __________________________________________________ Reviewed by: David

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. I mean, what can you say about a movie that makes you wish you had never seen it? I am not going to go into detail about the movie's bad acting, or the movie itself, because it would take a whole book. I will say that I thought the ending was too long, and that it was the movie that showed us that it could be done. It also showed that there was a future for this kind of movie. The movie's director, Bruce Beresford, had a pretty good career. In his first movie, The Misfits, he was the co-writer, and in his second movie, he was also the co director. He directed The Lost Boys in 1973, and his third movie was The Naked Gun in 1974. I would have loved to see a movie with him and John Waters in it. I just wish I had seen this movie when I was a kid. If you have never seen this film, I suggest you check it out. It is very good, and you can't go wrong with it.  Did you find this review helpful? Yes (0) No (0.00)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  "A movie that I found absolutely awful. The acting was so bad, the acting was bad, but the acting that was bad was bad on purpose! And I think that the director should be fired for the acting. You can tell that he knew this movie would not work. And if it didn't work, then he didn't want to make a movie that didn't even try. This movie should have been called "The Movie You Should Have Seen Instead Of This Stupid Movie." But instead it was "The Best Worst Movie Ever" or "The Worst Movie of All Time." It is bad acting all over the place and the director is the worst. The story was also so bad! It's a movie about a kid who finds out that his dead mother is a UFO and that he is a living ghost and a part of her soul. And he goes to the town to find out if he can find out where the mother was before she died. This guy is so stupid and doesn't understand anything. The mom is the best part of the movie. I just wish that the movie was called "How Not to Have a Ghostly Mom." I don't know why he even bothered making this movie. It is such a waste of money and the movie should be pulled. This is a very bad movie and I wish that someone had seen this movie a long time ago. But no one would see it now because it is terrible. This will make you want to watch "Soylent Green" with a big spoon and a glass of water. "It's not that hard to make something bad!" "No it's not. No it's so easy to make it so hard to see it. But it is so good to see what a bunch of people can do with a movie and a plot."

They decide to meet up and see if they can get past this and find someone else. It is really funny. They make this movie very easy to watch. The main girls do a great job and the main guy was pretty good. It was a fun movie. I would love to see a sequel. (10.5/10)" -Lance from California
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________ It is not that the movie is bad, but it is not a good movie either. It is very slow and has very long shots and it is hard to follow all the story lines. Also, there are a lot of scenes that don't really happen and it's hard to remember the story. I was not happy about the way it was done. I thought that the way the movie was edited made it hard to enjoy. The movie starts out with a good intro and then the movie just stops. I'm not saying it is a bad film, but I just wish the movie started right off. Also in the beginning, when a cop (J.K.) is investigating a murder and he is trying to find the person that did this murder, the police detective and the cop start talking and then they just go into a little conversation. Then they just keep talking. The whole scene is not shown and the only thing the cop knows is that he doesn't know who did this and he wants to know who is responsible. This doesn't make any sense because if the person did this, the person would have a good motive to have done it. The only person that could do this is someone in the mafia and that would have to be a good mafia boss. So why does he keep talking? Also, I thought it was odd that the guy that is killed in the movie doesn't get his name and the name of the other person who is murdered. I didn't really think that he had a name in the first place. I am sure that the writer of the movie didn't know this and this just makes it worse.

I've never seen a romance like this and the guy doesn't have a girlfriend so he is lonely. He is very romantic and tries to make the other girl fall in love with him but she doesn't fall in and the other girls try to stop them but they don't want to fall in. There is also a love triangle. This is a romantic movie. I don't know why people are not into romantic movies. I loved this movie and I think everyone should see it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *************This movie is about a guy who goes to a guy's party and meets his girlfriend and a couple of other people and he is having a bad time and then his friend says to him that he is the only one who is in the party and he has to be the last person left in there. So he goes up to the last guy in the last party and says that he will be the only person left. He is not sure what to do and he just keeps looking at his friend who is not looking at him. He goes up and starts talking to him and this guy looks at him funny and says to his friend "hey I am really looking forward to seeing you but I don't want to bother you." So this guy is confused and he keeps looking around. He looks at all the people and it looks like the other people are all looking at the guy with this guy saying "don't you want to be at the party? What is wrong with you?" and the guy just keeps saying "I have to leave now." The guy is just thinking "why is everyone staring at me? What are they thinking about? I just want to go home. I am a nice guy." The movie was really bad. The plot was very weird. The girl who he met at the other party just started talking to a really ugly guy and then they got really drunk and started kissing and the other guy came up and said "hey that is a nice girl" and the girl was like "I am a really nice girl." Then the other guys just looked at the girl and kept laughing. There was a really long scene where the girl is walking around the guy and he was just sitting there and the guys kept staring at her and looking at her breasts and she was just really confused. She kept saying "are you serious?" but the guys just kept laughing and looking. She was really confused and she kept walking around and then she went back to the guy who was talking to her and then he started laughing at her. They ended up going to the hotel room and the man was just lying on the bed with the girl on top of him and they started having sex and then the guy was trying to get off and she wasn't having any of it and she got off of him. The guy was really messed up. The girls in this movie really sucked. I didn't like this movie. It was really weird and very uncomfortable.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete and utter disgrace. It's just awful. The acting was laughable, the dialogue was laughable and the direction was laughable. The story is just ridiculous. It has a woman (Carrie Fisher) who has a bad dream in which she's kidnapped by aliens and they take her into a cave to keep her in a deep sleep. The film is just a load of crap. I'm sorry but this movie is just horrible. It looks like a cheap, crappy, cheesy exploitation movie. I hate this movie.  It's horrible. This movie was so bad that it didn't even have the decency to be called a "horror movie". I thought the film was supposed to be horror at first but it turned into a "bad dream" type movie. The ending was very unsatisfying, and there was no sense of urgency. I would like to see a remake of this film, or a remake with better acting. I wouldn't mind a remake for Halloween, but I'd probably skip it for Halloween II.  This is an absolute disgrace to the movie industry. The movie is so bad, that it actually makes me sick. This movie is horrible, so bad it's awful. It was just an utter waste of time and money. This film is terrible and it's all because of Carrie Fisher.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Do you hate people who are different, especially if they are the kind that do not fit in? If so, you will love this movie.   This movie is about the most important man in a small town. He is a black man with no relatives. He grew up on the side of the road in a log cabin. There are only a few other black people in town. When he gets to school he is not welcomed by anyone, not even his teacher. The people in this small town think he is a nuisance and a "nigger." When he is about 10, he goes off to boarding school and ends up learning a lot about life, the world and the future.   the best part of the movie is when he is in the town square when the people have been celebrating the day the white man first came to this small place. He gets in a fight with the black people and is beaten up, but he gets up and says, "I am not going to get beaten up again."   When he is at boarding school, he is very different from the other kids. He makes his friends laugh and does not take himself too seriously. One day a boy is beaten to death for being black. He goes home and talks to his mother and says he is sorry that he did not go with her that night. She forgives him. When the film ends he is going off to college and is still very different than the rest of the kids. This movie is for people who have felt something similar to what this man has felt and still wish to live a life without racism.   The best part about this movie is the ending. The man is walking along a road, thinking about the black man he met in town that day and how he could have saved his life. He looks up and sees the sign that says "In Loving Memory of Michael Brown". He stops and says a silent prayer. He then says to himself, "God, I hope one day you will forgive me for my sins."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I watched this movie with a group of friends at a friend's house. We all had a good time but it was not a good movie. I don't think it's a bad film but I don''t think it was a good film. It''s got some good ideas but the execution is terrible. This is not a bad idea but a bad execution. I mean, come on! You''re supposed to think of all the people who are dying. How many people die by accident or suicide? How many times have you seen a family get murdered? This is one of those "think of all your friends" movies. The whole family is killed and the killer never goes to jail. But they''re not the ones who''re dead, they''ve all been killed by a guy named Jack who was trying to find out if the world was really a computer. The problem is that it''s too easy to see the world as a computer, and the computer as being alive. This movie should have been called "Computer is Alive!" and the main character would have been a computer that was trying and failing to live. I liked the idea of the whole family as being computer. They''re all kind of dead because the machine that was supposed to take over the world just doesn''t work. I also liked the whole idea that the whole computer was trying. It was just trying so hard to be alive that it just became a dead thing. I loved the idea that it was just a computer in a box. I thought it was the most brilliant idea I''ve ever heard. But the execution was so bad that it made it a bad picture.

But, it never teaches them how to use a gun properly.   I was hoping to have a laugh with the characters, but it was very painful to watch. The only reason why I laughed was because of how they did it, but then it was even worse. The actors are so awkward and it's hard to see their faces. It was very awkward.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  A movie about a bunch of people who get together for the first time and decide to commit murder in a park. And of course the plot is awful. I never saw it in the theaters and I can't remember what was in the script. Anyway, one of the best parts is that it's made so it has the feeling of being a real crime, not just some goofy teen drama. And there's a lot of funny parts. I've never been a fan of this movie and I think it's terrible. But you can't judge a movie on one part.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ The movie "The Secret" (2001) is a poor excuse for a movie. It is poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed, poorly edited, poorly scored, and poorly acted. It features some great performances, but they're all given a mediocre, mediocre script. The only reason I rated this movie 3 stars is because the actor, Michael Fassbender, plays the part of the "Secret Keeper". I mean, it's okay, he's pretty good at playing a bad guy. He even has a great line when he says, "If you don't like it, don't look." It's not a bad line. The movie has no originality, and it just takes a bad idea and uses it. I think I'll have to go back and watch the movie again just to make sure it was made in 2001. It does have a few good points. It has some really cool looking effects, like the time-lapse that shows the moon landing and other important moments in the history of our planet. It also has a really good scene where a scientist is going to explain his theory of the sun, and he has to explain the sun. It's a pretty good scene. The special effects are good, and the special effects man really knows how to make his movie. The acting is pretty good as well. Michael Faskette and Michelle Pfeiffer really seem to have fun with this movie. I was surprised by how much I liked Michael Farrish, who plays the bad guy, and how well Michelle Pfiffer was playing the Secret Keeper. I didn't really think I would like this movie, but it was better than I expected. It was pretty good. I give this movie a 2.5 out of 5 stars.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  A friend who saw it said it was great, he told me so, so I bought it, but I think it was a waste of money. The film was poorly made, and the special effects were not very good. The actors were all good, but they were all very small, like small kids. This movie was so bad that even a child could see how badly it was made. The acting is horrible and the writing is terrible. I could tell it was just a script, and I think they were trying to make something cool and original, but the script was so horrible that it was impossible to believe it was written by a child. It made me sick to my stomach.  ...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I think it's a bad, bad movie."  Oh, I know.  That's just what I hear from a lot of moviegoers when they see a bad flick.  "I think I just saw a bad one" or "I thought the acting was really bad, but the script was so bad, it made it better."  So I'd like to offer some insight as to why this movie isn't a bad film.  First off, it's not a horror movie.  The movie's genre is comedy, and the acting is pretty funny, if you like that kind of thing.  Secondly, it does have its moments of horror, as you can tell by my description.  I didn't see it, but I'm sure that the film's "death" scenes are very bloody.  And finally, there are a lot more things in this movie that make you want to laugh.  In the beginning of the movie, you get to meet the main character's boss, Mr. Fuzz (Jeffrey Combs).  He's a very small, thin guy, who wears glasses and is always smiling.  He is a bit of a slob, but when it comes to his work, he's totally focused and motivated.  His boss and his assistant, both named Mr. Bumble (Burt Reynolds) and played by the great Kevin Kline and Kevin Spacey, are both very well known movie stars.  Their scenes together are funny and very touching, and I think you'll enjoy watching them in their happy and happy times together.  Lastly, the whole movie is filled with lots of action, and this is not an understatement.  There are plenty of explosions and gunshots, and you can see the blood, which makes it look so cool.  All in all, this movie was very entertaining and funny.  This movie is definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a laugh and some good acting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________   The worst part of this movie is the opening scene. There is no time to build the plot before the whole movie becomes a series of scenes and the viewer just waits for the plot to end. It is just a lot of scenes with no build up. The movie is not even good because it lacks any suspense. You just want to watch the movie and get to the part when the bad guys attack. You do not get the suspense at all.   In the end the movie is just one long chase scene and there is nothing in it. The actors do not even try to act. The plot is not very original. There are just too many characters. You know that the main character is going to die at some point. And there is only one scene where the main hero is going after the bad guy. All the other scenes are just action scenes. You get the feeling that all the movie was shot in one take. I can see why this movie was made to make money.   the movie does not make you laugh at all and you just want it to end!   There is a scene at the end where the hero takes out his gun and fires at the bad dude. The bad guy is hit and falls on the ground. The hero then picks him up and starts to walk away. This is the first time the baddie is hit by the hero. The next time the movie shows the baddies reaction, he is running after the hero and tries to get in his way. So far so good. The scene continues on and the baddude is now running after his attacker. The heroes is now trying to get away. Again the badguy runs after the heroes. Again they are trying to run away. The whole time the hero is trying to shoot at the hero to protect his friend. The guy is running so fast that the baddy is running too! The baddudes arms are going up and down so fast. The dude looks like he is going for a punch but the hero doesn't even stop to give him a chance. This was just a big fight scene. The entire movie was just one big fight.   a bad guy just jumps in front of a hero and punches him. You expect the hero not to go for a fight but the guy doesn't get away with it. He gets shot and falls.   I could have been much more into this movie. There was a lot more that could have made this movie better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this movie is awful, and so are all of the others from this same director, so if you're a fan of the genre, then you should definitely stay away. If you're just looking for a good horror movie, then this one will do.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ This is a movie that's going to get a bad reputation. I would rather it had been a terrible movie and people hated it. It's a comedy and a bad one. There's nothing funny about the movie. It feels like a "How does this happen??" movie. The story is terrible and the dialogue is just awful. This movie makes no sense. It is like you're watching a bad version of "The Wizard of Oz". The acting was atrocious and it was very boring. The characters are just silly. It was a great idea to put a funny and silly girl in a place where there's nothing but desert and the wild. The desert has a lot of mystery and beauty and the story is told through the eyes of this character. She does not feel like a real person. The movie had a bad start. It didn't even have a great ending. It seemed to be all over after the first act. The film has a good plot but it doesn't make up for the poor acting and the bad acting makes up for what is lacking in the story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ It's very easy to see that this movie is an homage to the 70's films of the same name. This film is a mess. The actors don't even seem to have fun in this movie, they're all trying to outdo each other. The film was filmed in the 80's. It's all made up of old-timey props and old-fashioned actors. The acting in this film is pretty awful. The dialogue is terrible, and the dialogue that isn't bad is really bad. The plot is stupid. The movie tries to make the audience believe that it's about a man named "The Captain" (the actor who plays the lead in this flick). This man is an ex-marine who's been on a mission to rescue his girlfriend from a "freak show" where she's being held captive. After a few weeks of doing nothing, he's rescued by this girl, who he has a crush on. But they've been separated for a few years and now she's gone. He wants her back and wants to go to see her. The whole movie is a plot to rescue a girl. There's not a whole lot of action in this one. The guy is in a room for a couple of minutes, then he goes back to his ship, then to a beach, then back to the ship. But that's the whole story. It was just a big waste of time. _________________________ Reviewed By: John C. O'Leary, SAC (C/O), SAC, USN (Retired)
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ (1/10) _________ The only redeeming quality is that the ending was very good and it gave you the opportunity to reflect on the experience. But it's the rest of the movie that makes this movie a waste of your time. The story was terrible, it was a remake of a movie that I saw 30 years ago and the story was almost identical. There were no new ideas and the movie was just a continuation of the first. The acting was terrible and the plot was stupid. The only reason this movie got a thumbs up is because of the acting. The characters were not well done and the writing was stupid, this movie had no redeeming value and should not have been made.

She got up early in the morning, made her coffee, and was about to start a day that would have her working as a secretary for the first time. As she stepped out the door of the office building where she worked, she saw a woman on a bicycle with two kids in a stroller. Julia knew this woman. She was the mother of the woman's baby. Her baby was a girl. Julia walked up to the woman and said "Hi, I'm Julia." "Julia?" the woman said. "Oh, sorry. I'm Laura." "Hi Laura," said Julia. "It's nice to meet you." "What do you do?" said Laura. "I'm a secretary." "And this is the girl's mother?" "Yes, that's the one." Laura gave Julia a hug. "Don't worry about her, she'll be fine." "I know she'll grow up to be a fine young woman." "But I'm afraid that she'll have to live with her mother for a while." "Don' worry about it. She'll be just fine." Laura took Julia into the building and she gave her a tour. It was quite a big building. The woman Laura had seen was the woman who owned it. It had several floors and several offices and a lot of storage rooms. It looked like a large mansion. The office for the head of the company was on the third floor and Julia was to work there on a Sunday. "When do you get off?" asked Laura. Julia didn't have a plan. She didn't know how to explain to Laura that she was leaving the office. She just thought she would just take a nap and that Laura would find her a job when she got back. Laura asked what she wanted to do. "Well, I want to work in a different department. It's a lot more interesting." "Oh yeah?" "Well the people here are very old fashioned and very stiff. They don't like change. I think I'd like a job where they can tell me what to do." "How old are you, anyway?" "Twenty-one." "So you're not a little girl, are you?"

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.  I enjoyed the film. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the film looks in HD. The film is well-shot, with good contrast, and great lighting. The colors are great, but the film does not suffer from a lack of colors. The story was interesting and the acting was top-notch. However, the story is not a deep and satisfying one. There are no characters I can identify. We are told in the beginning that the protagonist is a young boy, and that he lives with his aunt and uncle. After a couple of scenes we are told that his uncle is a "bad man". The uncle is mean and cruel, and he forces his nephew to work for him as a slave. We know nothing more about this uncle. There is also a "strong man" who is also the uncle's servant. In a few scenes we see the uncle killing the "strongman".  This uncle is not bad in any way, but his character is very limited. It is difficult to identify him. The only reason we do not identify him is because he is the uncle and he is shown only in a negative way. I would have liked to know more about him, or at least have been shown him at least once. , by Jean-Louis Trintignant, was an interesting movie. I enjoyed it. There was no story, no character development, and not much in the way of dialogues. However the story had enough energy for the audience to keep watching, even if the story was not well developed. The music was good. The director, Jean-Luc Godard, was good, and the actors were very good. This movie is also worth seeing in HD (see below).

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ ____________. It's a terrible movie, the writing is bad, the acting is bad and the acting in this film is awful. The movie starts off with a group of kids that decide to go to a haunted house, because the movie's premise is that they are going to go and play games and have a great time. Well they are all kids, they all have problems in their lives and their problems just come out and are all over the place, it's not very original. They go to the house and they find that there are some bad guys, who are doing a thing. They kill some people, they have to save the others and they don't even know what they are doing. When they get into the house, they find some old books and some old documents that were found, it turns out that the house has a story behind it. It has some dark history and it's about a girl named Bella, who was born in 1844 and her parents died and she was raised by her aunt and uncle who lived in the house. She was only ten years old at the time and she is a young girl who has been in a very dark place. She is trying to learn what she is, and what she has been put into, because she thinks that she's dead. She also is in a lot of pain because of the things that have happened to her and the things she has done. She doesn't have a choice, because her aunt is a witch and she has to follow her around and follow her to wherever she is. There are many things that happen in the movie that I didn't like, but I will talk about the things I did like. First of all, I really liked the fact that they brought the house into the movie, it made it even creepier. It also made it much more emotional. This is a movie that really has a dark and emotional side to it, and they brought that into the film. The second thing that I liked was that they were trying to make the character Bella a little more real. They are trying to portray Bella as more of a person, and not just a girl, and I liked that. The third thing that is important about this movie is that it's so good and so funny, and that's a big reason why I love this movie. There's also a very funny scene between Bella and her aunt that I really loved, and it really makes the movie. This movie has a lot
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been to see a lot of good and bad movies, but none as bad as this movie. The film starts off well with a good storyline. There is a father and son who are trying to sell a farm to pay off their mortgage. They come across a young man named James who looks to be very poor. However, he has an interesting story. He's a former circus performer who had a rough childhood. He was picked on, beaten, and had to grow up fast. He made his own way in life by being very clever, and making his own luck. He eventually married a woman who was the daughter of a friend, and the two had a son, who was a great dancer. James was very successful in his profession and he even married again. However the problems continued to happen in their lives. His wife and daughter were both sick and they couldn't afford to take care of them. His son, unfortunately, didn't even make it into his teens. He died of an overdose at the age of 18. James then decided to quit his job as a circus performer, and started to work as a roadie in a band. He didn't like this at all, but it was what he had to do to make a living. Unfortunately he was fired, and left to be with his son. He found his way to a farm that was a little closer to home, and this time he made it to stay. When he was asked if he wanted to get married, he couldn't say no to his son, and he agreed to be his step-dad. He got a job working on the farm, and was very proud of himself. He worked very hard, and put a good effort into his work. He had no problem with his wife or daughter, and even invited them over for a meal, and later they were married. His only regret in life was that he didn't have the courage to tell them how he really felt. The next morning, they both had died. James had died from an overdose of heroin. He and his wife had died within two weeks of each other. The director, however, did not give him the chance to tell his family how he truly felt. He couldn't go back and tell them that they didn't deserve him, and that they were just a burden to him. It was the way he was raised, and nothing would make him go back to the life he had been raised in. He decided that

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ ____________. This movie is garbage. A movie about the Vietnam war that doesn't take any of the time to develop the characters. It was boring to watch. Not only did it take the time for the characters to develop but it also shows how weak they are and how they're going to get killed. There is no real reason why they are fighting. The only thing that was funny was when one of the soldiers was in the back of a truck and he was trying to find a way out of the city. He thought he would be able to escape the city if he could find a bridge. The movie just took forever to be over. _________ ________. This was the first time I saw this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ [Storyline]: I don't usually like action movies and this one was no exception. The story is interesting but I think the film itself would have been better if the ending had been better. In the last scene, there is a long shot of the villain in a jail cell and a little girl is walking by. In that shot, I think I saw the little girl in the movie in a different way. The villain is standing there and she is talking to him, looking down, and she's looking at him, with that intense expression of fear. I think that scene was not very well done. I mean, it was fine but not very good. Also, there was one other thing that was wrong with the movie: I thought it was very strange that the main character, who I thought was a very cool guy, became a victim in the end. I just don't get it. The ending just left me in a state of confusion and anger, because it felt like a complete betrayal. I understand that it was a story about a guy who had to go through a bad experience, but the ending was so wrong. I hope this movie will have a more positive ending. (8/10) Visuals & Sound (9/10): I have to say that I thought the action in this movie was very cool. I don`t think I've ever seen anything as cool as the first action scene of this movie. The action in the second movie was also pretty cool, but I thought that the action scenes in this film were just as good. The sound was very good too. The music was good and the voices were good as well. The soundtrack was good too, but you won`t hear much of it in this review. (9.5/10). Summary: I have seen some other movies about the mafia, but this is the best. I've seen some action movies, but they don`T compare to this one. This is a great movie and a must-see.

It wasn't scary in the traditional sense, and instead it was more about a man who was in a bad situation, who was searching for something that wasn't there.   This was a good movie, but I would not recommend it for someone looking for a horror movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ Why do we have to make a list of all the worst movies in existence? I was going to make this list last year, but I ran out of time and the movies were still pretty bad. I guess I have a better way of looking at this list. When you sit in a movie theater, you are watching it with a group of other people. It is the group of people you know and love, and it is the people you have known and loved. Movies are made for people like you and me. We are not going to sit there and listen to an adult talk about their sex life. We don't have the time to sit through a movie about a gay couple who just want to be together. We will not sit there listening to a gay movie that tells us that gays can be cool and successful in the business. We do not want to watch a gay person in a film that tries to tell us that being gay is the same as being gay. We know that being a gay man is not like being a woman. We want to see films that show us how to live a good life. The movies that we watch today do not show us the life we want to live. There is no reason for people to go see movies that show the life that they want to have. It would be like going to see a movie that shows you how to drive a car. It shows you the way to get where you are going. It does not show you the places you want to go. It tells you how it is to drive and how to stop. The people who make these movies do not know how to make movies for normal people. They know how only people who are very wealthy can get rich. They want you to be rich. If you do not have the money, then you cannot be seen in a commercial for the movie. If the movie is about a black man in a white man's world, then the black man must be played by a white person. The black man does not have a role. The roles that are given to black people are the roles of servants and slaves. The movie will tell you that being black is the most horrible thing in the world. The most horrible things in the universe can be found in this world. When I see a gay film, I think, "That is not how a gay life should be."

We were excited about the movie until the final scene where all the characters were all sitting around talking about how they don't like each other and are not close and then we were just left with the scene and not a whole lot else.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ What a load of ****! I was totally disappointed in this film. I thought the movie was about a man who was being held captive by a madman in the woods. This is an excellent movie. I loved the cast of characters and the cinematography was great. I would love to see this movie again. But this was a complete waste of my time and money. I wish I could give this movie zero stars. I am giving this film a 1 star review. The director did an amazing job, the cast was great and the story was great! I think if they had a story to tell I would have enjoyed it even more. However, I am so disappointed that I gave this a 1 Star review.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I was very disappointed in this movie. It is a bad film, but it has a lot of potential.  The plot is weak, the acting is bad, the violence is bad and the characters are not real."  (Review by M.A.J. from www.reviewsbymajaj.com)  If you like to read, then this movie is not for you.  The characters are all too realistic.  They are all the same, but are just a bunch of different people.  What is the point of having a bunch different people in the movie?  The acting is just so-so.    This movie was directed by the same person as the "The Exorcist".  This is the reason why I didn't like it, but I will give it a pass because it's the same director.  I am not a big fan of "The Possession".   I really do not like the music.  It's a really low-rent, cheesy kind of music.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I saw this film in the cinema on my way home from a concert. I was so sick of all the "slapstick" films that were being made, and was so disappointed when I saw it. The movie is just a bunch of stupid jokes, and even more stupid jokes after they were made. This movie is a big fat waste of money, and a bunch more stupid money. The only reason I can think of to watch this film is to make a point to your friends and family. I can only recommend this film to those people that want to laugh and laugh, and never think of it to be anything other than a joke. I give this film a 1/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "In order to save his own skin from a bullet, a man has to accept a new identity in order to be recognized by his family."  "You are a murderer, a murderer who has killed and destroyed more than two dozen people." , and this was the worst part:  "I am the one who has lost everything, everyone I have ever loved." "I never wanted to die. I always wanted to live. I didn't want to be a murderer." It is a bit hard to tell what this movie is about. It has nothing to do with the real life of the man who is the main protagonist of this movie, but it is about the events of the past, and the way he tries to forget about the things he did, to stop his feelings from rearing up again. So, after all, he has to make his way into another world, and into the mind of another man. But the main problem is that he is not really himself anymore, and he doesn't know what he is thinking. He knows he is a killer, but he does not know why he kills, or what he has become. The film doesn't really tell us this, but what it does try to do is to create a world where there are no clear boundaries. It tries to tell us what is important, and what is not, and how the truth can become distorted.

I am glad that I watched it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a total joke, and it should be ashamed of itself for this. It is very sad that so many people think this is a good movie. The only redeeming aspect of this movie is the cast.  It is funny when they are together, but they do not get along at all and the whole thing is just a joke. It was very hard to watch this movie because it is really awful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  You are about to witness the end of an era. A movie that was once hailed as a masterpiece, has been surpassed by the likes of the Star Wars and Jurassic Park, both of which are great movies but are not as good as this movie. The best part of this movie is the way the movie was shot. It is amazing to see how they used to film a movie like this with cameras in a way that the viewer could not tell where the camera was from. I am amazed to see what they could do with these days. I love this movie and will always be a fan of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I enjoyed this movie very much. I think it has potential.  The main reason why I didn't really like it was that I found the movie boring and I found myself not really caring for the characters. I guess it is a bit hard to make a good story when you have a character like that. The movie wasn't a good one, but I still really enjoyed it. I enjoyed the story and the movie itself.

It doesn't matter if you're watching a bad film or not.  If you like a movie, you should say something positive about it so the audience can laugh at it. It's a fucking dumb movie.  The characters are so stupid, the dialog is ridiculous, and the acting is fucking bad.  It makes me want to watch something else instead of watching it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* This movie is really bad. The acting is terrible. The movie is so boring that it is hard to take your mind off of it. The story is a mess. It is a story about a little girl who is the only daughter of a very wealthy family. The poor little girl is forced to travel to another country for her mother's funeral and she meets a little boy named Johnny who seems to be kind and good natured. After the funeral the little boy's father takes the little girl to a country house that he owns where she is left alone in the house. After a while she decides to go back to the little town and see if she can find Johnny. There are some other characters that you might not expect to see in a movie like this but you'll get to know them eventually. This movie starts off with some good acting, but then it just becomes a boring mess. There is no way in hell this movie is worth your time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love this movie!  Its just too bad it is so bad.  You see a bunch of people get trapped in a building and they need to find a way out.  But they are not a group of people who would be caught in such a situation.   They were all in a hurry and did not know that they were in a trap.  The plot is stupid.  A guy is trying to rescue his girlfriend from a group that is holding her captive.  They find out that the guy's friend is going to be there with her, so they have to find out what they are doing.  It was like a TV show.  You have all the characters that you expect and they are all so bland.  This is what I would call a "filler" movie.  I was looking forward to this movie because it has so much potential.  Its a thriller but its so bad it's hard to believe it could even be a thriller.  There are just so many bad parts to this film.  One of the main characters is a bit of a moron.  He is trying so hard to be clever but all he does is make stupid mistakes.  His friend is a complete moron, and then you have the main villain.  In the end, the story is so stupid and so predictable that it makes the movie not worth watching.  So, what a waste of my time.  If you want a fun thriller movie with a good plot, this movie is for you.  But if you want something good, then just avoid this movie.

He then takes the body back to his station and it is discovered that the guy was the victim's best friend. The cop doesn't take any action against the murderer since the guy has died, and he tells his friend about the death.   After this, the movie starts to move in the wrong direction. The main character is no longer a cop but a detective. The police officer who was investigating the murder decides to go out to dinner with his girlfriend and has a few drinks. The girl is also a cop and they start kissing. He falls asleep and the next day, the girl goes to see the body.   the girl finds out that the dead guy had a long-term relationship with her friend. She tells her friend about it and the friend says that she will never be with him again. The next day she goes to the murder scene and finds that the body is missing and the murderer has taken the body to his girlfriend's place. The friend tells her that she needs to get rid of him and when she refuses, he kills her. He tells his girlfriend that he was just in love with her and she has a big family so she doesn't need him anymore.  . He comes back to the scene of the murder and sees that the girl has disappeared.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ಡ   It's not that it's bad, but it has a lot of flaws. First off, the movie has some problems with it's storytelling. It seems like this is the first time that they wanted to do a film about a girl who has her heart broken and gets a new heart. While that might sound very interesting, the story doesn't really make any sense and just goes through the motions. You don't really feel anything. The story is so cliche that it might as well have been made for a kids show. Also, the animation for this movie is absolutely terrible. You can tell that they didn't put much of a lot effort into this movie. The movie's art is just so bland and uninspiring. I wouldn't even describe it as decent. I just can't see a reason to watch this movie, unless you are in a desperate mood for a mindless movie.   Sound: 건신어 (Eul)  The music for this film is rather nice and the actors in this movie are pretty good. However, I just don't think that the music fits the story. For example, when I think about how the movie is supposed to end, I get very uncomfortable. The ending of the movie leaves a lot to be desired. There is also one scene that seems to be really awkward to watch. The only reason that I can see for this is that the movie was shot during the Olympics. So, when the music was playing, the actors were trying to act as if they were in a serious movie, but I don't know if it was that effective.   and the only reason for the second one is because it is a bit of a slow burn. So don't expect it to be over in one night. Also you should check out the third episode of the series.  .

I mean it was the last 15 minutes of the movie, and it was so horrible and lame. The only reason why it was good was because of how well the characters were portrayed. There was so much going on in this movie that it was hard to follow everything, but I had a hard time believing that everything was real. Also, the acting was really bad and I felt like the director had to use the actors because the script was so bad. I hope they make another movie like this because I would love to see it!

The girl is frightened and goes back to the forest. There, she meets a girl named Kami. They fall in love, but she dies. But the boy comes back and saves her from a demon.

It has all the potential of a really great movie, but as soon as you start to think about it, it's just a bunch of jokes that are made up to be funny. The acting is also pretty bad, most of the actors just look really bored and uninterested. The music is pretty good. But that doesn't matter because the film is just kind of awful. I just want to give a 5 because it's funny. But it's really not funny. I'm not saying it's a bad film, but if you were thinking about watching it, I would recommend you to not watch it. It was kind of entertaining, but that doesn  A lot people say They liked the Movie and think its awesome, but It's actually Not an awesome Movie.

I Just Want to Give a 5 Because It's Funny. But It's Really Not Funny. I Hate to say it, but this is just a horrible film. I hate to say that because it was really good at times. But the main problem is that there is no real plot to this movie. You just don't care about anything that happens in this movie, other than the fact that it's about a guy who gets a haircut and goes to a strip club. The other thing is that it doesn't make sense at all, most people just don.t understand why he is so depressed and why he wants to get a haircut. It makes no sense, and it doesn´t make any sense at first. I really don't understand why people think this movie is really good, but the funny thing is, if you are a fan of The Hangover, then you will love this. I mean, I can´t wait to see how The Hangovers movie turns out. I love the movies, but I just don´t understand how people can like these movies so much. I think this is really just a really bad movie

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________   This is an interesting film in many ways. It has some of the most powerful moments in the entire film. The best of which is the moment at the end when the three main characters sit at a table and discuss how they are going to make a change. One of them states that they will change their ways. Another says they will never do it. The last one says they won't do it for any amount of money. That's when it hits me. This film is about the people who are in power. Who are the rich, powerful, rich and powerful people in the world. The world is a cruel place. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. The poor get poor and the rich get rich. The people who run this world are the ones who put others in their place. It's not just about the rich. It also involves the middle class. They are also put in their places. The film focuses on the rich and their families. This isn't about how the people are getting richer, it's about them. There is a great scene where the poor woman comes in and finds out that her husband has passed away. Her brother was there, and the whole family was there. The woman's sister is a maid. The brother comes in after a while and asks the family to get off the couch and get down to the kitchen. He had been in the house all day and hadn't eaten. He was starving. He's been trying to get some of their food and it's been going to waste. He is going to kill her. The sister says to him "We're going to be fine. We're going back to our lives. We don't want to die." And that's the end of that scene. It really makes you realize how little they care. They don't even know how to cook. They just want their money. There's a great moment where one of the characters comes in the door and the family is talking about how they should get some more food. The character comes in, and says "You can't. The man has died. We just can't get any more." They don a bit of a fight and the guy runs out. Then they talk about how poor they are. The main character says, "The only people that have money are the people that are in the movies. The only people who can make a living are the actors. The movie stars get all the money." The film

She said the movie was a bit cliche and did not have a lot of emotion. The movie was about a girl, who had a horrible boyfriend and was going through a lot. After she has the boyfriend killed, she was going to kill her boyfriend as well. This is the end of the movie.  When the movie ended, she went up to the man and asked if he was okay. She told him that she was sorry that he didn't live, and she was really sorry that she had to kill him. She then killed herself. This was the worst part. , this movie should have been called. I know this because the main character was in it, and it was just so bad. The only thing I can say about it is that if you don't have a strong stomach, you might want to stay away from this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________   1. THE WALKING DEAD (AMC)  2. COLD CASE (AMCB)  and 3. FRED (AMCH)   FUCKING AMC's THE WOLF OF WALL STREET  Fuck this shit.   First of all, it is NOT a great movie, but it is very enjoyable. The film is full of action scenes and even more gore. The best thing about this movie is that it is made by a studio that doesn't give a fuck. They're just trying to make a buck, and that's all they care about. I mean, you can say that about a lot of movies. This is a good example. The writing is bad, and the acting is terrible. The acting is just not good enough to hold this movie together. Some of the actors seem to be trying to do too much, and it gets really annoying.   the acting in this movie has never been so bad, so why did I give this movie a 9? I'll tell you why:   - the director (David Webb Peoples) doesn't know how to make good acting. He seems to want to make people look like they're talking, but his dialogue is awful. I can't stand how bad some of his lines are. He sounds like he's saying the lines out of the movie, so they aren't even in the script. The script isn't even that good, so the acting can't really be blamed on Peoples. It's a lot more to do with the acting than anything else.  , it's not like the actors are bad, they're just not all that great. It seems like the director wanted the actors to play the part as if they were just talking to each other, but that's not the case. People are acting out the lines that are given to them, and they're not that good at it. It just doesn't work. I feel like this movie would have been much better if the actors just improvised a bit more. The bad acting is a lot less noticeable than the horrible script, so this is a movie that can be watched if you really have nothing better to do. But don't expect a great film.   a lot better than the first and second movies.  …

The townspeople begin to attack the family and eventually take them hostage. After many hours of being tortured, the family is released, but the killer is still out there. This movie is a nightmare.   There are so many strange things going on in this movie, that I almost can't remember anything. I could only guess at things that were going on, but it was like I was there. I thought there were supposed to be some people who were going to be in the movie. When I think of it now, I remember a lot of the actors and actresses. There were a few who I remember and others that I did not remember. I don't know what kind of movie it was, but I was never bored.  .
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ This movie was boring and didn't do anything special. It was an interesting concept, but the ending was a bit rushed and didn`t work. I thought the ending of the movie was really funny. It wasn`t really funny because the characters were acting stupid and were just going to die. The ending was really weird and made me think that this movie was a bad idea. The best part of the whole movie is that the characters are all dead, and it was a good idea.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Azzura from The perfect movie to kill time with. I don`t know why, but this movie is so fun. It doesn`t have any plot. It just has a good story and a good cast.  is it just me or did the movie end with a cliffhanger. it wasn` t very satisfying. the ending wasn` just bad. i would love to see the movie again but this was too bad  B-Movie. Rated 4 out 5 by G.M.G. from B+M-A-R-I-N-G...this movie had everything you need in a film. It has a very well-written script, and an all-star cast. The movie is not perfect, and there are some scenes that just don` t work, but it`s still worth a watch. It`s one of those films that you watch on a Friday night and get the urge to watch it again on a Saturday night. It is a must-watch!  C.I.A. vs. MI6. I would say this is a very funny movie with a very simple story, and the best part about this movie. I loved this movie because the movie did not have a plot and the story is the main thing. The main story is that two teams of agents are sent to an American base in Africa. The MI6 agents go to infiltrate the base, and in the process they make a lot of mistakes and become involved in a war that is going on. One of the agents gets into a relationship with the base's director, and when he learns about this, he decides to kill the director. This movie has a lot more to it than you think, because there are a lot better films out there. I recommend this movie for anyone who likes spy films.

One day they have a date and then they are on a train and it suddenly goes into an accident. Holly is seriously injured and Sue is in shock. When she finally realizes that Holly is dead she is so devastated that she doesn't want to go to a funeral. So she goes back home and goes to sleep and doesn't sleep.   to keep her mind off of Holly she takes a bath and then gets ready for a party. At the party she is having too much fun and drinking and she gets drunk and then goes home to sleep. When Sue wakes up the next morning she realizes that she has black eyes.  , but she doesn,t know who is at fault. Holly was just drunk and that's what caused it. Sue doesn't know who did it but the guy who did is named David. She doesn't even know who the guy is. David comes over and he takes her home but he doesn't let her know he did it. When he leaves she doesn',t know why he left but then the next day she has an idea. She goes into the woods and looks around and finds a box and she realizes she has a key inside. She then goes to the party and tries to find the key but it isn't there. Sue goes into her house and finds out that David didn't tell her who did this. So when she tries to call David he is gone and she goes to his house but David is nowhere to be found. She is so upset she throws herself into the river but she can't die. The only thing she can think of is to try to find a way to get back home. Sue tries to use a flashlight to find where she has to go but it is broken. After trying to use her phone to call someone but she just gets no answer. Finally, when she looks out the window to see what is going on she sees a train.  . This movie has a really interesting story but it's not very original and that makes it hard to get interested
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________  I just finished watching this film and I was not impressed. The plot is interesting and I enjoyed the characters and their interactions. However, the acting was atrocious. The acting was so bad, I had to turn off the film to make sure I was watching a movie. I don't think I'm alone in this. I've seen other reviews that say this movie was awful, but it didn't make me feel that way. I found it interesting and even enjoyable. The only thing that made me laugh out loud was when the police officer told the suspect that she had "the right to remain silent." This film was just bad and I think that the movie was written poorly.  …

And you didn't have to make a movie with a dumb, dumb movie name to make it stupid. This is just so dumb that I can't even believe it's not some joke on some comedy website. The whole idea is so wrong and I don't even know where to begin. The best way to describe it would be a stupid movie about a dumb guy who makes a dumb movie about dumb stuff. I have no idea what's going on. The main character is a crazy, weirdo. He wants to make this movie about himself. He has no idea about what he's doing. He's just a guy that makes a movie. That's all. It's a dumb comedy movie. So I guess it's just another stupid movie. I don´t know what the fuck they were thinking, but I guess this is a dumb idea. You have to watch this movie for yourself.

It was very well-made, with a strong script and great actors, but they decided to make the movie about a bunch of people who are going around killing each other in a parking lot. The movie starts off in a boring and predictable manner and then things start to get weird. I have seen this movie so many times and it's never the same. You will be watching this movie in a trance, wondering how the heck it will end. The last 10 minutes of the movie is the most disturbing part. I think the movie should have ended right there and then.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "In the world of science fiction, when one is unable to create the new, the old must stay the way they are." I have watched more than a hundred Star Wars movies, including two prequels.  This is my favourite and one of the most original.  One of the few good movies I have seen.   "If I can't trust you with my life, how can I trust you to take my life?"  The idea that all life is interconnected and can be destroyed by the actions of a few is very interesting.  I think it is the most interesting idea in a science fiction film since I saw 2001.  It is a movie that I have had many long discussions with friends about.  This movie is not for everyone, but for those who enjoy great movies and are looking for something different, then this is a great movie to see.

One guy has his head blown off and the gang starts making fun of his lifeless body. A girl runs in and sees the two guys hanging from the tree and calls the cops. The police show up and the cops ask the guys what happened. One of the guys tells them that he was beaten up and was going to kill the gang. The other guy tells the cops that he didn't kill the guys and that he only had a minor altercation with one of them. The cops ask if the guy that got the head blown up has a gun. The guy tells them no. They ask how he got his neck broken and he says that he hit a girl with his hand. He says that she had a knife. They put him in the squad car and leave. When the cop is getting out of his car a girl runs up to him and says that they just beat up a guy and he has a knife in his pocket. The cop is shocked. He asks the girl what the guy looks like.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The Great Escape, a 1963 British thriller directed by John Frankenheimer, is a masterpiece. One of the great British crime movies, the film was a major hit in Britain and has never been out of print. The Great Exoerence was the final chapter of a trilogy of movies that Frankenheimer had directed. The first two films were The Great Train Robbery (1967) and The Great Shark Hunt (1970), which were both very popular and popularly known in the US. The third movie was The Great Escapes, which is one of the most famous British films ever made. The plot is simple: a young man is lured into a robbery by a man in a submarine. Once aboard, he has to escape from a police trap and escape back to the surface. The film was an instant hit in the UK and has been a major success worldwide. There were some slight differences in the film than the US release. The story and ending were very different, with the British ending ending with a happy ending and a happy family. The US ending is more depressing and the characters are more realistic. Frankenheimer is a very successful director of crime films and this was one of his best films. The cinematography and filming are excellent. There is a strong supporting cast of supporting characters. The characters are very likeable and the plot is quite easy to follow. This is a must-see for fans of the original British series. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in British crime films. This film is a great example of British crime cinema and has a great storyline. - IMDb Mini Biography By: Jim Kapp <jim@jimkapp.com>
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen - 10/12/2010 8:36:24 AM  The worst movie I have ever seen. This movie is made for one reason, to be stupid and stupidly stupid. The plot is so terrible it is so obvious it could have been a parody of something and then was just left as that. You could tell the director had no idea what he was doing and just went for it and you were laughing the entire time. The acting was so bad. I have never seen anyone in a movie look so stupid. They did not know what they were doing and when they tried to make it seem real they ended up looking more like idiots. The cinematography was so horrible. I thought the movie was going to be a musical but it was just so awful that it was not funny at all. The music was not good at all either. The worst part of the movie is the stupid opening credits. They have the opening credits for a movie with a girl who is a rock star and has a kid and they use those to show off the movie. The song is called "I'm Going to Show You Mine" and it was a very generic and boring song that would have been better off as a parody. The best part of this movie was the ending credits. The credits showed a photo of a woman and a rock song. There were no words and the woman just said, "I have never been as happy as when I was with you". This would be an epic song if it wasn't so horrible to listen to. I just want to say that if you are looking for a good movie then you should try this movie. It's not very good and it is not very funny but it is definitely entertaining. I recommend it to everyone and if you have never watched a movie that was made by idiots, then this is the one for you. It has everything a bad comedy should have. It is very bad and it doesn't even try to be funny. It just shows how stupid the people involved are. Do not watch this movie and I hope you never have to.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ This is a very bad movie. The actors are all horrible, but I didn't mind it as the story was really lame. The main story was lame, and the only good thing about it was the ending. The ending made me feel like I was watching a movie. I think the main problem with this movie was that the writer didn't really write a good story. The plot of the movie was too complicated, and there was a lot of "plot holes" in the movie. You just can't make a movie that you have to follow for 4 hours and have all the main characters die. I would have been better off just watching the original movie instead of this horrible remake. I don't recommend this movie, it's bad.

The kids just want to go home and have fun. They went there because of a movie. I hope they die and get eaten by sharks. I was expecting a lot more from this film. I'll never go to the movies again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________. If you don't like it, you will hate yourself for liking it.  2 out of 5 stars The Great Escape I really wanted to love this movie. It is my favorite film of all time. The Great escape is a classic, but unfortunately this is a terrible adaptation. I loved the original movie. I mean that in every way. The cast is all amazing. And it is a great story. I thought that the actors would bring their own personalities to the roles. I didn't expect the movie to be as bad as it is. It took me a while to get into this movie and it didn't help that I didn`t understand a word that was being said. I think it was a combination of bad actors and bad screenplay. I just had a hard time connecting with the characters and I think that the film could have been better if they had gone a different route. I am still very interested in seeing this film again. ...  5 out of 6 stars The great escape I really loved this movie, but it is an adaptation of a book, which makes it hard to watch. It really is a good story but the movie makes it a little hard for me to understand what is going on. The acting is good and the movie is really interesting, and it has a good ending.  the great escape  4 out of 4 stars Great Escape Not bad for a movie adaptation but very short. The great escapes was a book by Roald Dahl that has been made into a film. I'm sure this movie is a direct adaptation but it just doesn't add up. The film is about a man named James Bond who escapes from prison and gets a job as a smuggler. I couldn't really get into the movie. The actors were all really great. The only thing that annoyed me was that there was no special effects in the movie, so it was hard to tell if I was seeing things.  in a nutshell great escape good story  3 out of 3 stars The story is great but the characters are so... Not bad but the story and the characters just don't really go together. The story isn't that complicated and the actors are great. I love the book by Dahl. The movie is just too much. There isn't a lot of action in the story. And the actors just don´t bring anything special to the film.  to bad for me, good for others

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.  The reason I write reviews, besides being entertained, is to show what movies are good and what movies suck. When I think of a bad film, the first thing that comes to mind is "oh my god, the poor director, the actors are all awful, and the cinematography is just so poor!". However, that is not true of this movie. It has a very strong cast and the actors really do seem to enjoy their roles. I enjoyed the performances of most of the cast and it was easy to get attached to them. The only bad thing I can think of was that it took so long for the movie to get to the point where it could have really been a great movie. I really don't know if I would have liked the movie any better if it had been released a year ago. However, this movie has already made a reputation for itself and I am sure that the studio will release it in a better form in the future. I think the movie has a great cast and I really enjoyed watching it. I give this movie a 3.5/5

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a few bad movies in my day. But I have NEVER seen a movie this bad. I am not sure if this movie was made in a short period of time or if they had no money or if there was something wrong with the script but this movie has everything wrong. I will start with the movie itself. There are no dialogue. The story takes place in a small village. One day a young girl named Aniya is attacked and raped. She is rushed to the hospital. As the movie goes on, a policeman comes and asks a lot of questions and when the victim is unable to answer them he is attacked by some other policeman. The next scene takes place a month later. Aniya still does not remember what happened to her. She lives a lonely life. The movie ends with the doctor asking her what happened and she is unable say anything. The only good thing about this movie is that there is no music and the actors just stand there without doing anything. 5 out of 5 stars Rating: 2.5 out 4 stars  Based on a true story. Very sad, but very true. I did not like the movie. But it did not make me laugh. I found it very difficult to get into this movie.

The villain was a woman, and was a bad woman. She was also a psychopath.  - It's a remake of a classic movie called "The Man Who Fell to Earth"   4) The movie starts with a man who fell to Earth in a rocket and was not taken to Mars. He was brought back to Earth to be an astronaut, and a woman (played by the actress, Patricia Neal) is sent to be his co-pilot.   the man was a good man who died. The woman was a psychopath who was evil and was going to destroy the Earth.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a bad comedy, so I can't say it was bad.  But I was hoping for something more...and it wasn't it.  I think the reason I can laugh at this movie is because I'm familiar with the movie and the director.   A few years back, the guy who made this movie made a short called "The Great Wall" which is an adaptation of a novel.  This movie is a direct sequel to that movie, and it's very similar.  It's the same people.  I don't know how the director and the people who made the movie came to the idea that this movie was a sequel, but it's a great idea.  One of the first things the director did was hire a writer to write a script.  The script is about a guy who was sent to the wall and lived to tell about it. The movie has a couple of great scenes and a great cast, but the script is really bad. The story takes place in a prison and it is very simple.  There is a guy named Kajol who is sent to jail for stealing a piece of art and he goes to find out why he's there.  And it is in this prison that the main characters meet.   The main guy, who is the director, is playing a guy, but his name is called Kajolk.  Kajal has an issue with his wife, and he needs money to take care of his daughter.  They meet in jail, but I think the name change is just a way to get the audience to focus on the character.  When Kajilk finds out he is there to meet the guy in jail.  He is shocked at how old the guy is and thinks he is too old for him to have lived.  At the beginning of the movie the director tries to keep it simple, but by the end it gets a little bit more complicated.  Some of the characters die in this movie, but at the end we find out the director has killed his family.  To summarize, it's just a terrible movie that doesn't work.

The only downside to this film is that the soundtrack isn't very great. It isn't bad, but there are a few songs that just don't do it for me. I will definitely go to the theater and see the film again. I highly recommend it!

I don't see the point in making a movie about a woman that has no self esteem. It doesn't make sense that she has to try to be successful and take care of the child. I was bored from start to finish. I could have done without all the singing, and some of the jokes were really stupid. And the ending was stupid. This movie should be banned from theaters.

The acting was terrible. Some people could have been cut from the movie if they hadn't been so stupid. This movie was made by people that don't know how to make a movie. I guess you can't make a film with the help of a real writer. The writer was not good. And that's why the movie was so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Jul 27, 2017 11:09 AM by jimmy p. from california Hi there, i have just seen the movie in my local theater. I was in the theater at the time of the attack and it is horrible. I am a nurse and I know a bit about emergency medical care. I could not believe the number of people who came out and helped him. The people at the scene were amazing and they took care of him as if he was a human being. I felt sorry for him and the people at his house. The movie made it look like he was insane and that he had committed suicide. The actor was very unprofessional and did not have a lot of control over the movie. The director and producers need to look at their film. The only reason I gave this movie 4 stars is that the movie is not a thriller and you will get some enjoyment out of the film. I do not know what happened to the people who attacked the hero and what happened after that. It looked like they did not care at all about the people in the house. It was very disturbing to me. I have seen this movie several times and have never seen it so bad. It is a good idea to watch this movie before the movie because the movie could make you feel bad about yourself. I hope you will watch this film and realize that it is a film that needs to be seen.  Report this for removal lindsay_r_johnson Jul 27, 2017 11 a.m. I didn't see this movie until a few months ago. It has been one of my all time favorites. I still can't believe it was actually true. I watched it again the other day and still had trouble believing that it was real. The first time I watched the movie I didn' t want to believe it because I knew it couldn't be true. This time I actually started to believe in it. The film is very disturbing but the acting and acting that was on screen is what you will remember. I think this film could have helped people who are depressed or who are in a dark place in their life. I saw it again last night and I really enjoyed it.  the director and producer should be commended for doing such a good job with this film. the actors were very believable and believable. I highly recommend this movie. I would not recommend watching this movie if you are feeling suicidal or depressed. It's not a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a movie about a guy and his brother that find themselves in a small town. There is a woman there who has a daughter. The guy, who is very handsome and smart, starts dating the woman. The movie begins with the brother and the girl getting together and going to dinner at a restaurant. The brother goes to the table and is sitting next to the daughter, and the guy notices the daughter and she starts crying. He walks up to the guy and the man starts crying as well. This movie is the movie of a guy that wants a relationship with a girl and the brother gets upset. The two people start fighting. Then the guy gets a gun and kills the brother. I found it very interesting that the brother killed his brother. The girl is not killed but the guy is very angry about the whole thing. It is a really sad movie and the ending is sad. I think it is really sad because there is not any happy ending in this movie. It seems like they were in a very small town and they wanted a relationship and this is the end. The film starts off with a good song and then ends up in a sad ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. The reason why you are not going to find the best in this movie is because the script was poorly written. And I mean badly written. The movie is all about the two main characters: a teenage boy and a girl, and how they get into trouble. I mean the story is very weak, and not worth of watching. It is basically a bad horror movie with a really stupid story. It tries to be an action movie but there is no real action in it. It just keeps showing the boy get into all sorts of bad situations. The girl just seems to be there to be the girl. And it is obvious that the movie is trying to make it seem like she is the only one who is really in danger. The way she gets into all these bad situations, and all the things she does to try and solve them is stupid. She is like the guy in "The Matrix" who says he is the smartest person in the world and the only reason he can do this is because he is a robot, because he cannot really feel pain or worry about the consequences of his actions. In the end she has no idea how to solve any of the problems and ends up being in a lot of trouble. There is no way this movie should have been a hit. It should have made it on a low budget but there was nothing about it that was cheap or low budget. This movie should never have been made. The director should have quit and given the script to someone who knew what they were doing. But no. They tried to make a big hit out of it, and it just sucked. There were some great actors in this film, but it just seems that the script didn't know what it wanted to be. I am not sure if they wanted to do a horror movie or a fantasy movie, but the movie never managed to do anything but be the worst movie that I have ever seen. It seems that they had no idea what they wanted the movie to be, or what the audience wanted to see. The plot was bad, the story was weak, the acting was bad and the direction was bad. The whole thing just seemed so stupid and not at all believable. It was like watching a high school kid and a grown man trying to get into a fight. They just did not have what it took to make the movie what it should have. It seemed that they never wanted to make this movie and were only there to make money. If they had been able

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ I have seen this movie so many times, and it always brings out the worst in me. This is a movie that does not have any of the charm and fun that it did in the first movie. I am sick of these bad movies, and this is one of them. I feel like the movie just was made to make a quick buck, and that is the reason why it is so bad. I don't know why it was made, because it is not funny at all. This movie does not take a single chance to make me laugh. The plot is bad, and the movie has no humor in it at all, so I feel that it is a bad idea to even have this movie in your movie library. It is a waste of time and money to watch this movie. This can only mean that the director, writer, and producer had a lot of money on their hands, and they wanted to make as much money as they can. I mean, who wants to watch a bad comedy that is full of jokes that don't work, and you will laugh at the beginning? The plot does not make any sense and there are no jokes at all in it. This was a movie made for the money, and I am glad that it was a big flop.

In this movie, Daniel Craig plays 007 in a small room with only the secretary as his assistant. He has a tough job to do: help a young woman, the beautiful Miss Moneypenny, find her missing boyfriend. Bond gets into a few problems with his boss when he is forced to reveal himself as a secret agent. He also meets an old friend, a mysterious woman who he believes to be a spy. It's all a bit confusing for Bond but he's very clever and cleverly solves these problems. But, when Miss MoneyPenny is kidnapped and Bond is forced into a world of deceit, his secrets come out in a big way. The movie is filled with great action scenes, a great performance from Craig, lots of great action, and lots of jokes. There are some nice references to past movies, and there's a great twist at the end. The plot is rather simple, but is entertaining. And, it is a great movie. The only problem is that it's very short, only about 40 minutes long. So, if you're a Bond fan, you may want to pass this one by. But if you are a Bond aficionado, this is a must see movie. ___________________________ I just saw a great James Bond movie and it was not as good as I thought it would be. I had seen a few of the movies before and thought it was great. I thought this was going to be just another movie with Bond in a room. But it was much more than that. This movie was the best of the ones I had already seen. And I thought there was going be an action scene after a scene. There was a whole scene where they were doing a stunt where they had Bond doing the splits and jumping over a pile of garbage. I never had seen that scene before. But there was a stuntman in it.

It was hard for me to understand the movie and it was hard to hear the music. I had to read the instructions several times. The best part was that there were no jokes and no dialogue. The only good part was the story of a man and a woman who want to marry each other but can't because the man is married to a woman. The man wants to have sex with her but he can't as the wife is married. When they go to the park the woman falls in love with the man and then she tells him to leave the woman and she will have sex in the man's bed. So the man goes to the woman's home and he finds out she is pregnant and he is not happy about it. The woman tells the man she will marry him but he says she will never marry him. The movie was very hard to watch and the sound was horrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I just finished The Last Samurai, the first of the three "Samurai" films by John Ford. It was not a good film. John Ford has been criticized for his lack of direction and directionless direction, but this is more of a directionless film. The cast was good, and the director has always been John Wayne, but the film is shot like a "Samuel Fuller" picture. The film opens with a large, sweeping shot of an empty stage, then zooms in to reveal a huge crowd of people who are cheering. This was the start of the movie. This is not what you want to show when you are opening a film for the first time. You want a big, grand, majestic opening. Not the start to a movie that is a complete disaster. The movie was a complete failure from beginning to end. It has nothing to do with the film's actors. It is just bad, boring and dull. I don't remember a single good line from the actors in this film. In fact, I remember almost every bad one. The scenes that were good were shot too quickly for my taste. It took me a long time to realize that the film was not shot for any of the actors. The director was a one trick pony and never learned a single trick. This film is a total disaster, a complete waste of money and time. I wish I could have given this movie a B+ rating.

I mean it is the 80's and we all know what that meant. But this movie was not about that. This movie was about a man who gets in a car accident and then finds himself in a hospital with no way out. He is trapped in a small room, but he somehow manages to call his wife. So, she then decides to stay in the room with him and make a phone call. They don't get much time to speak before someone comes to check on them. He wakes up and realizes that he is in a room with a strange woman. They seem to have a relationship, but what that relationship is we don't know. The woman has no idea what to do. She doesn't know what to eat or drink. It just goes on and on. There are also other things happening. There's a lot of people in the hospital, and the man has no clue how many there are. He thinks he is the only one there. He does not understand why there is no food or drink and is just trying to stay alive. The man's wife starts to get sicker and sicker. She has diarrhea and other stuff going on.

While the nurse takes the baby back to the mother, the nurse is attacked and killed by a mob of angry people. The nurse is given a funeral, but the child is taken away and put into a home.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ I thought I was watching the final episode of an old show, but this movie is NOT the final episodes of an anime. It is just a bunch of boring scenes that don't do anything to make us want to watch this. It feels as if it was filmed by the same director who made this movie. I was so bored, I just wanted to see if there was a plot and if I could get some closure, but all I got was a bunch more pointless scenes. This movie is so boring, it's even more boring that the ending of this movie (which is actually kind of good). The only good thing about this movie was that I found the ending to be kinda cool. But all in all, I didn't like this movie at all. I guess this movie will make some people think that it was good because the ending is pretty cool. It's only because it wasn't a real anime that I think that this movie isn't bad. I'm really disappointed that they didn't do a better job with this movie or at least made a good anime out of it.

I can't even tell you how many times I saw the same story and same scenes, the same characters, but different dialogue, with different characters. It was all very predictable.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.   The only thing about this movie that didn't bother me was that the ending was very abrupt. But this isn't the only time that a movie ends on a cliffhanger. In this movie, the movie was a great success. The movie didn't try to make a point or make us think about something, the only thing the movie did was to make us see the characters as they are. The only problem is that the characters that we were introduced to and got to know are not the same people that we will meet later in the movie. In other words, this movie made us see a movie about a movie that is based on a book that is about a book.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ The following review is based on my experience of watching this movie. If you have no idea what this movie is about, don't read it. It has no story, no characters, no plot, no ideas, no anything. In fact, it has nothing but random images and noises and a lot of "blah blah blah". What makes it worse is that the director of this movie, is a man named Mark A. Shear, who has a long history of making these horrible movies. The movie is basically a collection of pictures, and one picture after another, one after another. It's just a bunch of random images, with the story that is only there to fill up the time. The ending of the movie is just a bad shocker, that really only takes away from the movie. I mean, why are you making this movie? Why are you wasting your money on making this terrible movie? This movie is not only boring, but also stupid. It is not worth watching.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********This is an extremely bad movie.The story is terrible. It's like someone went in to see the movie and saw a very bad movie that was based on a novel. The director is a bad director who didn't know how to direct. The acting is horrible. I don't know what was the point of this movie. It was bad.The acting is bad because they played a character for 2 hours. It seems like the only way they could have done it is to be in a bathtub with a big tub and a big fake mustache on and just stand there like a couple of idiots.I hate the character they play in this movie because she's so fake. The only thing she talks about is how she has a fake mustache. And the director didn't even try to make it seem real. The actress just stood there for hours and hours and was still pretending to be stupid. There were times I thought, "why is this woman acting so fake?"I hate to think what she's been through. I hope she's in a mental hospital. I'm not sure why the director had to make this movie or how he came up with the story. This movie has some serious problems. The first two hours are awful. There are some great scenes in there but they are ruined by the horrible acting. If this movie was made by an average person, it would be a total dud. This is a really bad movie and it will probably make you hate it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Bad Guys" is a bad film that has a bad plot. It is a story about a group of friends who want to make a documentary about a local murder, but the story goes in the wrong direction. They go to a town and the story of the killer is so bad it doesn't make sense. They film a fake interview with a local cop and they get the real interview but it is done so badly it is hilarious. It shows that there is no way that they could film a real interview. The movie is so badly made that you think that the people who made this are just bad actors. The ending is so terrible and so stupid that it is a shame. I was looking forward to seeing the movie but I was disappointed. The only good thing about the movie is that it gives us a good idea of how crazy the world of murder documentaries can be. It just shows how wrong this movie was.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ This movie had some of the worst acting I have ever seen in a movie. I can't even say how bad some of them were. Some were so bad, I felt like I was watching a bad TV show. The only actors that made me laugh were the guys playing the cops. They had such bad accents, I couldn't believe it was them. I was laughing so hard I was crying. I didn't have time to think about it because they had to put a scene in there where the cop was playing with a dead cat. That is all I was thinking about when the movie ended. I hope this movie gets a sequel.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** The film was terrible. It was a big budget film and this was the first time i saw this movie. I'm a fan of the TV show and i knew this was going to be a big failure. The cast was bad and the acting was so bad it was annoying. The writing was bad. The movie made me feel so stupid. I thought it was supposed to be real and this isn't. I feel sorry for all the girls who were involved in this movie and it was so hard to see it on the big screen.  What was wrong with this movie:  - The acting is bad. This is not even close to what the TV shows and movies are supposed to look like. I felt like it was going for a horror film. The acting was way to long and way to many lines. The director did a great job at making the movie look so real. It makes the movie seem realistic.  the director should have just made a TV show or movie and not put the money into this movie (they probably would of made way more money off of this movie).

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Did not like it. Was not funny. Not good at all. I'm disappointed that the movie was not a remake of a classic. I didn't expect that at all...I'm not a fan of that genre. The movie was about a girl who was having a bad day at work. She's angry because she lost her job and is now on welfare. She thinks that she is going to be evicted. But then she meets a guy and he gives her a job, then he's gone and she's still on welfare and gets her life back on track. But she still has to pay for the guy. I thought the movie had a lot of good ideas in it, but it just didn't work.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was soooooo bored. I had never seen a movie with so much bullshit in it. I never want to see another one. It was the same shit. They made a bunch of different people that were not supposed to be in the same scene together, and they were just doing it in this big old warehouse. I mean it looked like some kind of carnival or something. They had a buncha cars there and there was a lot of people out there. And there was the whole weird "we're all a bunchta hippies" shit. But they were all just like... I mean they weren't hippies, but they were pretty much. They were kind of like, 'oh I'll show you how it's done' or something, and it was kind of ridiculous. And they were trying to make this film. It wasn't that they didn't like doing it, it's just that it was so boring. It didn't even look like a film. But, that's my main problem with this movie, it was just boring. I don't know, they could have at least made it a little more interesting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________  The Good:  -The plot is very interesting, the characters are well written and the story is very good. The main villain is very evil, but not in a bad way, he just seems like a very evil man, but he is not as good as his reputation, and is very human, he wants to rule the world and will stop at nothing. I like the idea of a hero, who will stand up for people who are wronged, and will fight to make the world a better place. This movie is about a young girl who is forced into a world of darkness by a malevolent entity. The girl and her friend, the demon, get caught in a vortex and they find themselves in the world of Darkness. The plot is interesting and very good, and it makes me think about the fact that this was a movie written in the 80s, and the fact it was made in 1985. The visuals and the music are excellent, and there is a very good suspense. The soundtrack is really good and it will stay with you. The cinematography is amazing and there are many different shots in the movie. The special effects are great, and this movie is very atmospheric.  _____________________________________________________________________________  Verdict: _____________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  1) This is a movie where the characters are all in their 20s and no one seems to age a day. This makes it all the more ridiculous.   2) I loved the first part where she had to hide in the trunk of a car to escape from the thugs. I wanted to punch the guy who kidnapped her and killed her friends. I didn't care that it was in the middle of the night, or that there were people in the background. The second part was terrible, I thought it was over because she was being arrested. Then they let her go. I'm glad that she survived.   of course this movie is only good because it has Jennifer Aniston in it.

The first was a disaster. The second was a masterpiece. This one, though, has no redeeming value. It is an expensive mess of a film. It has a good story. It even has a great ending. But the story of the second film is better and more interesting. The ending was a brilliant one. There are many good things about this film, but not one of them is what makes this a disappointment. The film has the same problem with the same characters. The only reason this is a decent film is because of its two good endings. The rest is a mess. This film is the worst movie I have seen in the last few years. I wish I would never see another one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.   And if you are still here, then I guess you are a good person after all.   I do understand how people get upset when they are not satisfied. That is why it is called "reading a book". But this is not a book. It is a movie. And a bad one at that. The actors who played the roles did not seem to be aware of the fact that their characters were a joke. The script was written by a young writer, whose only job is to write a script. If he can write a good script he should be paid. If the producer thinks that the actor is worth his money, then that is good enough for him. That's why he has no choice but to have an "actor's director". And this "director" seems to be a big fan of the movie. His script is filled with jokes and he can only add a few things to make it funnier. He also takes liberties with the original script. He made up new characters and he even made a "twist" ending. This is a shame because it is not even a twist anymore. The movie should have ended with the villain's death. Instead, it goes on and on and then it finally ends. The only thing that makes this movie "funny" is the way the actor makes a big show out of acting like a fool. When he was in the hospital, he would not even tell anyone that he was sick. He would just act like a jerk. He even did the "I am a great actor" routine. He is so good that even when he has a sore throat, he acts like it is nothing. When the doctor finally comes to visit him, he just sits there with his head down and pretends like he is asleep. He has a funny way of showing off his "artistic talent". I don't know what he is thinking. But his acting is so bad that I had to laugh every time I saw it. When his character was telling the audience "I'm in too much pain to talk now" he just kept repeating that word. This scene made me laugh so hard that I could not bear to watch it anymore. I think this movie should be banned in all American movie theaters. It was not even funny. It should have been banned in Japan too, but then it would have been called "I Am a Very Funny Man". I would have preferred the "This is a Japanese movie" line.

I still see it, and it's always on in my mind. I always thought it was funny, but I don`t think it was good. The story of a mermaid who is trying to find a man who abandoned her is just so over the top. There was no reason for that movie to be made. It was like a children`s movie. The music was bad, and the songs didn`t even fit the movie. I don´t know what the director thought he was doing, because he couldn`t find a way to make this movie any good. I think it is a waste of money and time to make a movie like this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ It seems as though I've been writing about this movie so much that I've become numb to it. I remember when I first saw it when I was about 12. I had never heard of it, but I was obsessed with the whole movie, even though I was not a huge fan of the actors. I was just too young to be exposed to so much of this stuff, but that didn't stop me from loving it. And yes, I remember my mom telling me that I was being too old to like a movie, but she must have been right because that's what I wanted to do with my life. So, I watched it over and over, never stopping. When I was 18, I had a chance to see it again when my mom's friend brought it over for us. It was the same night we went to a movie. I watched the whole thing over and I loved it. It had a very different tone from the movie I had seen before, but it was still a fun movie. So I decided that I would see it every chance I could. It continued to be one of my favorite movies for years. And then, it was released on DVD and I was able to see the entire movie in one sitting, and I didn't love it at all. I'm not sure if I was too young or what, but when I went back to it a couple of years later, I was shocked at how much it had changed. I thought it had aged horribly. The acting was all so different and the writing was really bad, and it was a totally different movie. It still had that same atmosphere of it being a horror movie, and there was just no depth. It all felt like a waste of time. And that was the last time I ever saw it. This is the first movie that really made me stop loving horror movies. I don't know if I would have been able to endure it, even if it was in a theater with me. I know that my mom loved it and that was great, but what can you do? I didn�t want to see another one. I guess this movie did make me an adult. I stopped being so attached to horror movies, and they just stopped being scary for me. This movie was never that good of a movie to begin with. And I loved the movie it was based on, but this movie is not that good, and that makes it all the worse. I would give this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  " I think it's a piece of shit." I don't really care about the movie, but the author has clearly written this article as a rant about the film. I have nothing to say about the movies, except for this one:   I can't see the point in this movie, because it's nothing more than a waste of time.   The movie is about a man (who is played by a guy who is a complete retard), who is going through a divorce, and is trying to find a job, because he doesn't want to live off his parents.  It's all set up like a typical story, where the man is trying, and failing, to get a job.  But this movie is not like any story.  The main characters are portrayed as retarded, and their actions are completely out of character.  Even if you don't like this movie. I recommend you give it a miss.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!   I'm a fan of movies about the Civil War. I love to talk about it, to argue with people about it. So it was not a bad thing when I heard that an amazing movie was being made about the war, about the South and their attitude towards the North. I've heard that the film was a masterpiece. Well, it was very well made. I have to admit that I was not that impressed with it, however. I found it too long. I guess I expected something better than that.   It took me almost three hours to get through the entire movie. So I was in for quite a long time. I know that it was a great movie, and I don't have any problems with it. But it was quite long, so it's a waste of my time. It could have been done better. The main problem I had with the movie is the dialogue. It is very very good and funny, but I feel that it could have had a bit more.  , in my opinion, the dialogue was good, but the scenes that were not really related to the war were not funny. I don�t know why this is, but it was. I can�t tell you what the characters say. I didn't find them very funny, and it wasn't a problem, because there were so many funny things in the movie.   the action scenes were not very good, either. I really hated them, but at least they weren't too bad.   in my mind, the best parts of the movie are the moments where you realize that the characters are actually talking. It's not funny, so you don't expect it, but you still feel the emotions of the characters.   is a good movie, but, in spite of what I said above, I didn�t think it was the best movie about the War. It has a good story, and a good director. But for me, it wasn�t that great.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ A terrible movie with a mediocre acting, poor plot and bad directing.  This movie was a joke with a terrible story. The plot is very simple and is only a small part of the movie. The characters are the only ones that give any thought to the story. And this is where the problems start. The actors, who were chosen by director and writers, do not care about their characters at all. They do not understand their characters. They are not even trying. The story is about a guy who has a dream to kill a man. After he kills him, he becomes a ghost and travels through the world killing men. The only thing that keeps him sane is the fact that he has a daughter. She is the only thing he has. So he goes through his journey killing men to protect her. I do not know why the writer of this movie chose this kind of a plot. This movie is a big waste of time and time and money.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________  This movie is not good. The acting is all over the place. They're all over-acting, and that's not a good thing. The plot is just plain boring. There's nothing to the plot other than some random people doing random things. I would have liked to see some plot to the movie. The main characters don't even have any development. They are all the same. The woman who is the evil and mean one is so unlikable. I'm not a big fan of the way she treats everyone around her. The man who is really mean and rude to everyone is so unlikeable. The other characters in the movie are just not very interesting. The only one I liked was the old man. He's a bit crazy and funny. He doesn't really do anything but sit around and complain about the weather. I don't know if I'd want to watch this movie again. It's just not that great. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't very interesting or interesting. It just wasn't that bad. The people in this movie are all over acting, and the acting isn't good. They don't have any real emotion or personality.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ ___________ The "Worst Movie" of All Time. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________   I've heard people say that The Wicker Man is one of the best movies ever made and that it deserves to be a classic. Well, it's definitely a classic, but only in the way that the best comedies are classic: it's just so perfectly made and written that it's hard to see how anyone could've done a worse job. The movie is just a simple story about a guy who goes on a journey to rescue a woman and his dog from the evil witch and his friends. The Wickersmith himself is pretty pathetic: he's just an old man with a sad and bitter old soul who just wants to get back to his old life. The rest of the cast are all very memorable, including the old woman who is the wickerman's wife, a mute girl who is really a witch, and a witch who is a little girl.   It's not a good movie, but it's not that bad either. It's got a pretty good cast, it doesn't overstay its welcome, and it's pretty much the perfect movie for a rainy afternoon. The only thing that would've made it even better would've been if it had more scenes with the wicker man, but he only gets to show up for maybe a half an hour at most. It may be too much to ask, but maybe there should've been more.

This is a story of two friends, a guy and a girl. The guy goes to school, and is a very bright student. He's also very shy and doesn't talk much. When he gets to high school, he falls in love with the girl he sees in the school hallways. The girl has a very large chest. He has to go up to her to show his affection and she says that she doesn't want him to. They begin to date and she starts to date another guy. It's a nice love story but it has a dark ending. The main problem with this movie is that it tries to have a happy ending but fails because of how the movie tries to tell it.   a lot of the scenes in the movie are very slow and boring. The camera just follows the guy. The movie is very much about the guy, the girl and their feelings. It feels very contrived and contrived is a word I'd use. The whole movie has a lot to do with the guy's feelings. He just isn't that interesting of a character.  , and I've been watching a lot more of his movies lately, I don't see how the guy was in love. She doesn't seem that great. She has a huge chest and he doesn't. The guys feelings are all about the girl. I don?t see how it can be that obvious. And she?s hot. It doesn't feel
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________.  I have been wanting to see this movie for a while and finally had the opportunity to see it in the theater. This was the first time I saw it in theaters and it was really good. I am a huge fan of the movie and the people who worked on it and the director of it. I think the movie would work really well if they had more time. The acting is all over the place and you feel like you are watching a bad version of the television show that was made before the movie. There are a few things that make it better though. The plot is better than the television series and the music is better. The cast of this movie is a great cast of actors that worked on the television and I think it really works because it is really fun to watch. The movie is good and I would recommend this to anyone that likes to watch the television.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ This movie has nothing to do with what the book is about. The movie is very similar to a TV show that was on in the 80's called "A Nightmare on Elm Street." It was a horror movie based on a book of the same name written by Stephen King. This movie is a remake of the original film. This remake has an almost identical plot to the book. The characters are all the same and the plot is the same. However, the actors did not have to be on a TV series and could have easily been cast in a movie. The actors do not seem to know how to act and they don't have the talent to act in a horror/thriller. This is a terrible movie and you should not be watching it.  I give this movie 3 stars because it is pretty good. The acting is good. I think the director wanted to make the movie more horror like and that's why he cast a few people that were in the original movie. It was the same actors but they were just playing different characters. I'm giving this movie 2 stars because the story line is very weak. This should have been a movie that was made in the 60's but since the plot was based on the book I guess it could be made. I didn't think it was a good movie so I had to give it 2 stars.

The acting was terrible and there were some scenes that were so bad they made me cringe. The movie had no story. It was all just silly slapstick.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________  A couple of years ago I watched a movie called "The Devil's Backbone." I enjoyed it, but I don't recommend it. It's an awful film and a terrible movie in general. It has no redeeming features whatsoever. I think this film was made to cash in on the fact that people were getting interested in seeing a film called "Hellraiser" on video. If you like horror and are looking for something different than the usual horror films, this is a pretty good film. If it weren't for the horrible acting and the poor acting by all of the characters, it would have been a decent film. This film is filled with awful acting. They are all horrible and not even funny. The story is also bad. The main character (William Shatner) is a total moron and has no idea what is going on. He even calls a guy "a fag" while giving him a hand job. This is a good movie for horror fans because it has a very different tone and style than most of the other films in the genre. It doesn't take itself seriously, and it has an extremely fun atmosphere to it. I was actually happy to watch this movie because I enjoy the horror genre, but this is just not a good film to watch. It was a waste of time and money.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: dl-cinema-usa

I have a hard time with this movie. I was really looking forward to this because I was sure this was going to be great. I didn't think it was going at all. It was so boring and the acting was awful. It really felt like a Disney movie. The songs were very generic. The writing was very sloppy. I don,t know what the point was with this. It didn't have a story. It had a story for Disney, and that's all it was. The story was very predictable and you could tell Disney made this movie because it was so good that they made it into a movie about Disney. They had to go and make a movie that Disney would be interested in, because Disney is Disney. The movie just kept repeating the same thing over and over. They tried to make it as generic as possible, but the writing is so sloppy that you could not tell it was Disney. It looked like they had a bunch of kids writing this. The acting was terrible. The lead was very bland and the others in the movie were not good either. I thought this was a movie Disney would make, but I didn,t expect it to be this bad. I guess the whole point of this movie was to be Disney. This movie was made to make Disney think Disney was in the right. And the only way to make them think Disney is right is to make a good movie about what Disney thinks Disney is. And they made a good Disney movie, but it wasn't a Disney Disney. And this movie wasn't Disney Disney, it was another Disney Disney movie made by Disney.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  The movie: I'm not sure I ever wanted to see another superhero movie. I know, I know. But when the studio decided to bring Superman and Batman together, I thought I'd had enough.  This movie was a letdown. The first thing that came to mind is that it's not funny. I think a lot of people expected the humor of Batman and Superman to be more than a lighthearted gag. It's not. They don't laugh very much. I have no idea why this movie was made. The film doesn't really have a plot, but it does have an overarching theme. . I really enjoyed Batman and I was hoping for something good. I got that. But the movie doesn't deliver on it's promise. The movie does have some great action sequences. But what is that action about? The villain is a big joke. His powers are not that great. The best scenes in the movie are the ones where he fights with the Batmobile. It was like Batman and Robin had been on vacation. They weren't in the mood to fight any more. , I think this is why the studio pulled the movie. They thought the movie was going to be good. But they didn't expect it to be as bad as it turned out to be. It has some great sequences, but not enough. It really has to be seen to be believed.

The guy with the glasses and glasses that was the boyfriend of the girl in the movie is pretty good. The kid with the big ass glasses, is pretty bad, but i guess he was just trying to act tough. The mom is pretty annoying. And i hate the kid who played the little kid in the film. I wish i could just watch him get beat up. And the guy that played the girl, was just really annoying. He should have gotten a job and stopped being a big sissy, because he just seemed like a fat sissy. The whole movie was just terrible. I don't recommend this movie to anyone, and i wouldn't watch it if i had to. I hope people who saw this will know what they are doing before they put their name in the garbage.  the worst thing about this movie is that the story has nothing to do with this movie, it's just a bad excuse for a movie, which is a pretty lame excuse for something that's supposed to be an action movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was at the theater the first time this movie was shown and I couldn't stand it. This movie was so bad and so un-funny, that it was a total bore. The acting was horrible and the plot was a joke.  The film ends with a song that is really just a silly "song" sung by a man who is a "bad guy" and he is talking about the horrible things that are going to happen to a couple. The worst part of this movie is that it's about a movie studio that makes movies. The company is called "Dawes Entertainment" and the director is none other than Michael Jackson. The movie was released in 1993 and is called  "Black Or White". The film is so bad, that no one wants to see it anymore.  If you're interested in watching a movie, this is not the one to watch.  A movie is a movie and not a song. This is a terrible movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________ A movie based on a comic book series of the same name by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. This movie has some serious flaws. I'm not even going to get into the plot holes that were made by the writers. For a start, this movie has a major character named The Master (who I'll refer to as The Master because he is the main villain) who has a sword with a special ability to transform people into different animals. This was obviously done for comic relief but I just found it very strange and unnecessary. In fact, one of the first things the movie did was have the evil version of this character turn everyone in the audience into a dog, as a gag. And why does he have a dog? For no reason at all. Also, one scene in the movie has this guy, who is supposed to be a bad guy, kill a little girl with a baseball bat. Why would he kill her? Is there a reason? Why did he kill a child? And if he was a bad man, why did he not just kill his enemies? The Master is also portrayed by a guy who is very skinny and looks very uncomfortable in his own skin. In the comic books, The Master's skin color is black and white and he has a large black eye. The Master also has a scar on his right eyebrow which is never explained. In addition, there are a lot of scenes where people have their faces covered with masks or hats and their eyes are never shown. One scene in particular has a man covered with a black face mask, who also has an eye in the middle of his forehead. So why would he have his eye in his forehead? Also, the master always has a red sash around his neck and a red bandana around his head. In other words, this is a guy with a bad attitude. He's not a nice person, he's just a villain. I'll just skip all the stuff about how he uses people's emotions against them, how he has no morals and that he has this huge ego. The only good thing about this movie is that it has a lot more blood and violence than the comic book. And it looks good too. This is a very bad movie, but it's one of my favorite bad movies. It was also made by Sam Raimi and the director of the comic was Kevin Smith. So it's not too bad if you want to watch a horror movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Feb 22, 2017 4:16 PM by Nelvio D. Estrada I am still stunned that it's been ten years since this movie was released. The first time I saw it was in a theater in 2001. My friends and I were all in awe of the movie. It was an incredible, visceral, beautiful and thought-provoking film. The story was told in the third person by a guy who was in the military and went over to Afghanistan. The film was so good that it was able to give us a glimpse into what it is like to be in the world's most dangerous war zone. The soldiers we met were truly brave and willing to die for their country. I can remember the first time we went on a mission and the fear that gripped me, as I watched the soldiers take on the enemy. As the story progressed, I realized that it wasn't the soldiers who were the enemy, it was the war itself. The military is a big industry, and a lot of money is made from the war, but the fact that the soldiers in the film had to take on these roles was a great thing to see. This movie was so relevant at the time, and has never been as relevant. If you are a fan of war movies or documentaries, this movie is definitely worth watching. I have watched this film twice now, and have never grown tired of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Is there anything more pathetic than the typical horror fan, that only cares about the "plot" or the "dramatic moments" in a movie? They will find a good story or some great shots, but they will always say that the "movie was not that great" because of a "lack of intensity", or some other excuse, so they will never even bother to watch it again, never mind the fact that they will probably never get any enjoyment out of it.   There are movies that I think could be called "great" and yet they are not very good, so why does that make them a bad film? If you don't enjoy a film, it's your fault.  .  "But how do I make this a movie that would make anyone feel something? How do I do that? I am a storyteller, I don't know how to tell a story in the most conventional way. If it was easy to tell the story, then the movie would not be so boring, and people would not have to see it over and over. I am not a professional, I have no background in cinema or art, I am just a writer who loves movies. I want to tell you a story that you can relate to and that you will enjoy. I hope you enjoy it. _______________________________"The film is not about the film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ I think I was just so happy to get this movie out of my system, that I really didn't pay too much attention to the story. I was happy to have it out of the way, and enjoy some of the funny moments, but I did not see anything really worth mentioning. I would have liked to have seen more of the characters that didn't get too much screen time. There was not much of anything to enjoy in this movie, and that was a good thing. I don't think this movie is worth the time of anyone. It is just a really bad movie. I did enjoy a few of the scenes and jokes, but the movie did not really do anything for me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked this movie, but it was a total waste of time.  It was the kind of movie where you could see a few things going on, and then the plot goes completely over your head.    It's not that the film is bad, it's just that you don't get much out of it.   All the characters are either too thin to be real, or too much to be believable.  This is a movie where a man's mind is invaded by a mind reading computer program.  It was written and directed by  Steven Spielberg.  This movie was written in the late 1980's by Michael Crichton, who had just written his first movie, "Jurassic Park".  Spielberg, Crich ton and Spielberg's screenwriter,  Jonathan Hensleigh, teamed up to write the script for "Jumper".    This is a story about a man (played by Tom Cruise) who has been in the hospital for several months, and he finds a computer program which gives him a series of instructions to follow.  The computer has a number of personalities which it will do whatever it can to achieve.  One of the personalities tells him he must return to Earth at the same time he left.  In order to get back, he must fly to the Moon.  There he must get a message back to the Earth and then fly back.  He is assisted in this mission by the computer program, which he is told will help him to make a perfect trip back.   This is not a very good movie.  A movie about a computer brain is not the way to tell a story.  Even if the script is not that good, this was a great movie to see.  Spielberg is an amazing director.  Here's to hoping Spielberg will work on a sequel to this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I've ever seen. I didn't think it was going to be that bad because it is a horror movie but it really was. The movie was about a college student who is trying to commit suicide but is accidentally killed by a girl he was with. I thought it was really cheesy but it didn't make me laugh. The only good thing about this movie is that it had a nice soundtrack which I don't know why but I really liked it. The story was so lame that it was hard to take it seriously. The girl was such a dumbass that I thought she was a girl who would just say whatever she thought. The ending was so horrible that I felt like crying. I felt so bad that the girl died. I also hated that the movie was all about the girl and her stupid boyfriend. He was so stupid and obnoxious that he just acted like a complete idiot. I can't believe that he thought that it would be a good idea to make a movie about a girl and a guy. The music in the movie is terrible. I donít know what they were thinking when they made this music. I think it is so cheesy that it made me want to throw up.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ ___________. I saw this in a cinema when I was about 11 years old, and was instantly captivated by its beauty. It's a beautiful film, a great story, a strong character, and it's very well-made. The music was brilliant too. So what happened? I guess that it wasn't well-received by audiences, because the film has become a classic now, and people are constantly complaining about how bad it is. I can understand that, but it's not that bad. It was good when it was released, and I love it even more now. It has all the charm of an old time movie, and all the heart and emotion of a classic. _______________ I can't say that I would ever want to see another film like this one. I love the story, the characters, and the artistry, but I just can't see myself wanting to see it again. It would be great to be able to watch a classic like this in my old age.

It is very insightful, funny, and a bit of a downer, but if you don't get your ass in gear fast enough, you might actually make it to the end. I'm sorry, but the ending was a little underwhelming, but it was a very well written movie. This movie is an example of the type of movies I like. It's a really great example of a movie that takes itself a little too seriously, but in a good way. I liked the way this movie showed us that life is not just a series of good and bad things. It shows us that it is also a series where things are always good. It is a movie about an evil guy who is trying to take over a movie theater and make it a horrible movie place. The story was not as good as I thought it was going to be, but I liked how it was just a little bit different from the normal formula. The ending was definitely a letdown, but that's a little harsh.Overall: _____.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.   In this movie, I am reminded of my own childhood memories of having a good time in a local movie theater. My favorite movie of all time was, I think, a John Waters movie called, "The Great Mambo Chicken", but it was only a teeny-weeny bit of a different film, that was a lot of fun, in my opinion.   (I am going to stop now and let you get into the movie.)   This movie has a lot more to it, but it does not have much to offer. I am a big fan of John Waters, but this movie is not very good, and that is very disappointing. The acting was pretty weak in this movie. It is hard to be an adult and be so pathetic that you act like a child.  ,,,, ____________.  1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________________   In a world of post-apocalyptic and post-war, we see a world full of people with no memories, but in a very short time they all come together and work together to try and fix what's wrong in the world. The movie is about the struggles of a group of people who are trying to fix this world.  The movie is a very dark, very sad movie with a really good soundtrack. It's also funny. It is definitely not the best movie in the whole world, but it is one of my favorites. I recommend it to everyone who loves dark and sad movies. It definitely has something for everyone. It makes me very sad that I missed out on seeing this movie when it was released.   The best part about this movie is that there is no gore in it, it's more like a horror movie. The ending is really great. It will make you cry. It was sad and it was really great to see this movie. It does have a really bad ending, but that doesn't really matter.  , but for some reason, the movie isn't released in Australia. There's a really great scene where we see the world from a man's point of view. He sees people suffering and is trying to help them. There is also a lot of sex in this movie, but you'll be too young to know what that means. I love how there are scenes in the movie where people are having sex with each other and there's a lot happening. It made me very happy to see the movie.It is also very sad, but the movie doesn't give you that feeling. It isn't very dark or depressing, it is more of a sad movie. This movie also has some great songs and it is funny as hell. The jokes in the story are great and the jokes in this movies are pretty much perfect.I love how the movie ends. It wasn't very sad or scary, but there is something really special about it. The best part is the music in the ending, and the scene where they see the apocalypse from the man's perspective. The music and the movie are great together.The movie has some really good songs in it and I think it is a really well-made movie. If you don't mind a dark and depressing movie, this movie might be for you. It has some of my favorite songs in the entire movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ _______________. ___________ __________ _________. _____. _______.  The first few moments of this movie have a lot of promise. The director (the brilliant David Lynch) sets up the film perfectly with his dreamy soundtrack, a simple narrative, and a nice character of a young boy. I was completely charmed by his performance. His performance is so natural and natural. He was so likeable. But that was just the beginning. "Dune" is the most successful movie ever made. There is just no denying that. It is the number one movie of all time. In addition to being the most popular film in history, it was also the highest grossing film ever. It made a ton of money for Warner Brothers, who distributed it. It even became a cult classic. This movie has been the subject of many books, articles, and movies. This is the reason that it is a must see movie. The only thing that I do not like about this movie is that it has a pretty bad ending. I think that the movie is so good because of the style. The story is told in an extremely simple way. Everything that is happening is so incredibly simple. It's almost like the movie tries to make everything as simple as possible. It takes a while for things to really start happening. But then you get this wonderful feeling of dread and wonder. The characters all seem very real. The whole movie is a bit of a mystery. I don't know what is going on. I just feel like this movie could have been a much better film if it had ended a bit more on a high note. It feels a bit like a waste of time. The ending is a complete mess. It just feels out of place. I think it could have used some more of that dreamy mood and simplicity. It would have made the ending that much better. I would recommend that you avoid watching this movie. If you want to see a great movie, watch "The Godfather" or "Gone With the Wind". I was originally going to give this movie a 10, but after seeing some of the reviews on this site, I decided to bump it up to a 9. I know that I am only giving it a 9 because of how good it is. I am not sure how it would have fared with a higher rating. It has been a very long time since I have seen a film that
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ It is a very good movie, but you cannot watch it if you are a true horror fan. The story is very good, but the characters are too unbelievable. You see a very well-known and well-behaved person, and you think he will be okay in this film. But then you see his face, and all you know is that he is dead, or at least dead for a while. And the film does not let you forget about him. If you are looking for something scary, but without being too scary, then this is the right movie for you. This is a good movie that you can watch after a good night of sleep, or if you have a strong stomach. If I have to give a negative score to this movie, then I will give it a 2. I think it is a must see, but for true horror fans, you cannot recommend this movie to them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it's a bad film and it does not need the reviews. This film is a terrible mess and a waste of the talent that is behind it.  You have a poor and uninteresting lead character that is given no personality and is a walking advertisement for the product.    This is a very poorly made film.    The only good thing is that it shows how far Hollywood has fallen and how the film industry needs to improve. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  "This is an overblown, uninspired, and poorly executed film."  That's how I would describe it, but I can't say it's a bad film. I don't know that I would say it was bad.  The characters are well acted, but they are pretty much interchangeable and I don the characters are interchangeable, and I can say this because it was very easy to pick out some of the more annoying characters. They were all pretty much in the same boat. They're all just trying to be a hero and they don't want to be. They want to save the day, but don't really want to. I mean, they're doing it for themselves, but in a weird way that I don' know how to describe. They are good looking and good at acting, but it was like the movie was trying to make them all into a team of superheroes. The best part of the movie is when one of the characters gets his life saved by some guy and his mom (who was kind of hot) and she runs up to him and kisses him on the forehead and says, "I'm so proud of you. Thank you, you're the best dad I ever had." The mom was just standing there in her tiny costume and she just stood there and looked like she was thinking, "This is so weird." The best scene of the whole movie is probably when the parents are leaving and the guy is trying to stop his mom from running into the water. They start to run into the river and the dad has his hand over the mom's mouth and he's trying to keep her from going in and that's when it hits me. This guy is a hero. The mom has saved her son's life. I'm not even kidding. I saw this movie and it's like the first scene of Batman Begins. I really didn't care what happened. I wasn't trying to figure out the story or who was the villain. I was just so moved by the moment that I was thinking about the character and thinking about what he was going through. It was just an amazing moment. .

I'm a big fan of The Shawshank Redemption, so I was hoping for something similar. The film is set in a prison and is loosely based on that. The plot is so bad that I can't even begin to describe it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This is the only movie I have seen that was a complete waste of time. This was a very expensive movie, and had to be done because the producers were unable to produce anything else. The producer was a great story teller, and they used him to tell the story of the man that has been arrested. The story of him was very well done. It was very boring and did not move me. I think this movie could have been made for less than $20 million. The only reason I can give it 4 stars is because the ending was nice. I was very surprised that they kept the ending a secret. They could have killed him off at any time and had the guy with him at the end say, "That's it, he is gone, and I'm free now". It was so easy to kill this guy off. I wish I could have seen this movie with my friends. They were very nice to me. If you have no money and want to kill someone, this is the movie for you. - March 30, 2010Great Movie  Reviewer: Joesy G. - favorite favorite favorite - February 16, 2010  Subject: I think that was just a film about a man with a temper.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _________ ____________. This is a movie that is a terrible waste of time, a waste of the people who work on it, and a waste in general of the film industry. It has a poor script and is full of bad ideas. This film is a waste and is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. It feels like a bad joke made into a real movie. I am not joking when I say this movie is not funny at all. It would have been better if it was made as a movie and released in a theater. The writing is very amateur and the acting is not that great. It's just a horrible movie. It tries to be funny at one point, but it falls flat. I could not see anything funny about this movie. The plot is a joke, and you have to watch it to get to the funny parts. The ending is the most horrible and unbelievable ending I have come across. The only reason I can give it a star is because I liked the director and the actors who play the parts. But overall it is a horrible waste of a movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "the director (who was a very young man at the time) was so inexperienced that I can only describe his performance as a child being forced to act out a scene with an adult. he's not a very convincing actor, and he's the most inept in the movie." That is such a lie, isn't it? He's the director. He's been in this business a long time.  If he was so bad at his job, why did he make the movie?  He was making a movie to make money, that's all.  The real reason: he didn't want to make a bad film.   It would have been too expensive to release a movie with poor movie stars, a bad script, and no actors with any acting ability.  He didn't have the money to make it, so he made a film that had the worst cast he could find.  What he didn?t want to do was try and make a good film. He didn? t have the talent.  So, he made it for the money.  And the people that did make it are not really bad actors, are they?  They're pretty good.  They are, in fact, very good actors.  How can you not like the actors?  It's a bad picture, but the actors are good enough that it?s not really the fault of the actors, is it?  And that's the problem with people who want to be "critics" or "commentators" about movies.  The person making the movie is always responsible.  If the person making a bad or bad-acting movie wants to make an honest movie, he should not try to make the best movie he can.  Don?t try to take the easy way out.  You want to have a good movie, don't you?  And that?s why they need to make better movies. They don?t get paid to make movies. Why did they get paid?   Because the movies made money. Why are people so stupid that they think they can judge the quality of a movie by its gross profits?  There are two ways a movie can make money. It can be a huge success.  In that case, the film will sell a lot of tickets and it will probably get a lot more press.  Or it can be an enormous failure.  This is a movie that just didn
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The film is not very interesting" I'm sure the makers intended the movie to be a very good movie. But I didn't really enjoy the film, I was bored by it, and there is not much suspense in it. I guess this movie would be good if you love spy films. There is one very cool moment in the movie, when the main character goes to the park and meets a man who looks like he is a spy. He says: "You have a good looking face" The guy tells the hero: "I'm not a spy" The hero says:"No I'm not" The man says: "It's a lie. You are a spy". The hero responds: "No I am not a soldier, I'm a doctor".  He then explains his work to the man and explains to him the reasons why he's there. And the guy says: - "I want to talk about you" - "No you have to talk to my friend". The man tells the guy: "My friend is an old man, he has a heart condition and he can't leave this park, he needs to see the world. He has a son, he says that you are the man who can help him". The guy says "I know. I am a soldier. We both have heart problems, I have the heart condition, you have the other one. I need to go to the other world to help him. He is going to pay for my ticket, but you can come with me, and I will pay for your ticket too". The main character says: 'No, no, no. I don't want to go. I'm going to see my son and then I'm leaving'. The man replies: "How come you won't leave now? Do you have another ticket?" The main man says "No. I can't go now. I want to see him". And the man says 'I don't have another one. You must go with me'. The guy goes and tells his son that he has to go with his father. He tells the son: "If you leave now, he won't have anything. If you stay, he'll have everything. If he goes, he will die. The only way you can save him is to go now". The son says: ""You're a hero". The dad says: ''No I don. I'll die too. It's all my fault. I
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! That is a pretty good movie. A lot of effort is put into making this movie a good one. The plot is a great story. The acting is good. The film is set in a town and the town is good to look at. The town is a lot like a small city. There is a little bit of everything in it. There are houses, there is a restaurant, there are stores, there's a bank, there was a gas station, there were a lot of people. The movie was made in a long time and the ending was a little funny. The only thing that made me angry was the ending. It was an over-the-top, silly ending that made it hard to understand. I guess the movie was too good to be true. I would recommend this movie to people that like a good old fashioned detective movie. I also recommend it to people who love old style movies. It's a nice movie to watch on a cold rainy day. If you are in a hurry and don't want to be disturbed, I would suggest watching it in the theater. It doesn't sound great in the theaters but it was a good movie in the movie theatre. It will not change your life but you can enjoy it for the few hours it was made. I give this movie 4.5 stars out of 5.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first two scenes are awful. The first is a montage of all the "good" movies that I've seen in the past, which is the worst. The second scene is the "I-need-to-take-a-break-because-my-heart-is-hurt" scene from The Exorcist. The movie gets even worse as it goes on. There are three bad actors, and they are not even really that good. They were cast to give the impression of a film, but instead, they made a very poor film. It's a good idea to watch a movie before you judge it. If you see something you don't like, don't watch it. But if you see a movie that you really enjoy, you should watch it more than once.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am a huge fan of this film. The acting was great. And the story is amazing. I am glad it was good. However, I am disappointed that it was released in 2002. That means that it took 5 years to make it. I would have liked a shorter film. I was very disappointed that the ending was so rushed.   "I don't know if I will ever go back to the theater to see a new version of this classic movie. However I would love to see the movie in a different format or on DVD. I know many people would be able to enjoy it again."

I think it was supposed to be a comedy but it's really not. The writing was pretty bad.  -I was disappointed by the way the movie started and the way it ended. The characters weren't good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  My review: I enjoyed the movie, but the movie's script and acting really sucks. This movie is all about a girl named Jodie who was just trying to find a job in her old neighborhood when a serial killer comes through and kills everyone. The movie starts out pretty good but then we're introduced to this crazy killer who was also killing all the people in the neighborhood and it's really weird to see how they were all killed just like in a movie. It really looks like a TV movie. This killer doesn't even try to be a real killer. He just kills people and then leaves the body in a dumpster or something. The main guy in the movie has no real character besides the fact that he's a cop and he has a crush on Jod and then she kills a bunch of people and he's like "What's wrong with me?" and then he kills more and kills more. It was kind of fun but then the killer just goes from being a serial murderer to a guy who loves a girl who's trying to get a job and just kill people for no reason. It's kind of boring to see a character like that who has no character develop but then you see the killer and you go "Oh my God, this guy's really sick."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Worst Movie You Will Ever See"  By Eric Eisenberg  (Feb 5, 2015)  I first saw "The Worst movie you will ever see" in a theater on Christmas Day, 2008. It was my first time seeing it, and I was enthralled. I was in the movie, I was part of it, I thought I was the star. And then I saw the end of it.  And I was not happy about it. I thought it was really, really bad. I knew it wasn't good, but I didn't realize how bad until I saw that last 10 minutes. I couldn't even watch it for the last 10 seconds because I was like, "Oh my god. That is the worst movie I have ever seen." And I was a very, very emotional person then.  "The worst movie you'll ever see," which I still think is one of the worst movies you'll see. ...  Now, I've seen it in the theaters a few times, but not in person. And I think it would be fair to say that I haven't seen it for a long time. But it has stayed with me. I know I am going to have to watch it at least one more time before I get a chance to watch a movie for a few years. But if I see it in a movie theater, I will see it again. I'll be ready to talk about it again and I will talk about this movie again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Don't want to waste your time.  I don't think it was a very good movie. The ending is so stupid that it's hard to take seriously. It has the typical "I was wrong about everything" ending. .    My Rating: 1/5   Review of "I don t want to ruin the suspense, but I t'aint worth it:  It's a very poor movie. This is a movie where a couple go on vacation and they don't know where they are going to stay. They go to a motel and find that it is full of people. They get in the car, and one of them finds out that they are in a car crash. And then the movie has a long, long flashback to their trip. The couple go to the hospital, and then go to prison.   The plot is so ridiculous that it makes it hard to care about the characters. They were in a terrible car crash, and they are still in prison. The husband has to do time for drunk driving. The wife has to stay at home for a long time because her husband is a drunk. The scene where the wife goes to the doctor to get an abortion is ridiculous. Then she gets out of prison, and her husband has an abortion. That is so absurd. Then it goes back to the couple and they go to visit their kids.   the scene where they visit the kids is ridiculous too. I think they are just making up a scene for the kids to watch. Then the wife gives birth to a baby boy, who is a huge asshole. This baby boy has been in the hospital for a while, but the wife decides that it doesn t matter. She tells the kids, "I'm pregnant again. I'm not giving up." This is just ridiculous.   was a good movie that I liked. It's a good film. The characters are not as well written as the previous movie, but they are the same characters, and the movie still has a good plot. It just has a lot of flaws. -  -

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is really bad.   The plot is weak.  It is a film where they are playing in the park and a boy was kidnapped by a guy.  The boy is in the back of the car with the guy and the girl is in front of the police.  This film is really cheesy.  When I saw the trailer of this film I was really excited to see the film.  I thought it was really good and a lot of action.  But the movie is just bad.  It was just a really stupid movie.    It had so much bad writing in it.  They were acting so stupid and stupid.  And the guy was so stupid.   He was just saying "What do you want me to do?" and they were just doing what he said.  The girl in the film was also really stupid.  She was saying she wanted to make a man into a girl so she could have sex with him.  So the guy did this with the girl.  Then they just threw him in the van and drove off.  There is no point in the movie.  It was just so stupid I didn't like it.

The ending is not at all what it should be. It was so bad that I just wanted to turn the camera off and not watch the rest of it. The first two acts are just a bad joke. They were just awful, and you just don't get a laugh. The last two acts were the best part of the movie. I wish they had been cut out of the picture, because the story wasn't very good.

It wasn't, and after the movie was over I had to walk out and get my car. That was a real bummer. I hope I never have to see it again. The plot was stupid, the performances were cheesy, and the actors were terrible. The one guy who was good (Robert Englund) was in a bad makeup job. And it was a comedy, not a horror film. So it's a real disappointment.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ is a terrible movie. The plot is completely pointless and unoriginal. The acting is really bad and not good at all. There are some very obvious scenes where the acting isn't that good, and the actors don't seem to have done their research. It is hard to believe that they spent $50,000 on this movie. This is a complete waste of money. The only thing you can do is avoid this movie at all costs. The director is a very bad director who should have never directed a movie in the first place. I would rather watch a horror movie than this. Don't bother to see this movie unless you're a masochist who just wants to see someone get hurt. The trailer doesn't even show what the actual movie looks like.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ I saw this film at a showing in a theater that was a bit small. I had just gotten out of a fight and wanted to go home. I sat down in the front row and when the movie began I knew I was in for a good time. The movie starts off with the characters, the "sicko" doctor and the girl he takes to the "therapist". The doctor's character is a very smart and charismatic man and it shows as he talks to the girl and makes her laugh. I loved how he got her to smile and laugh. The next thing I know, she is in the car with him, the doctor is making love to her. It was great. The rest of the movie I was sitting there in the theater with my mouth hanging open and laughing my ass off. The acting was fantastic. The guy with the huge cock and the girls with their small tits was hot. I liked how the movie showed how much he loved his patients. I wish the doctor had kept his job. I am not sure if this is a true story or not but it had a great ending. I hope this movie gets a sequel.

I don't think I was really looking forward to seeing it, but when I watched it I was blown away by how great it was. I had forgotten about this film and how great of a film it was, but I found out it was just as good as I remembered. This film has it all. It has a good story, great acting, great action, and great visuals. It was a great film to be sure, but it wasn't all that great of an acting film, so the performances were kind of hit and miss. I really liked all of the actors in this film, but there were a couple of them that I felt were a bit over-the-top. I think that would have worked a little better in the film if they had just stayed a little more under-the-$top. But they did have a lot of fun with the characters, and the ending was pretty great. This was a pretty great movie that I'm glad I saw. I give it a 5 out of 5 stars. ______________________________________________________ Reviewed by: Anonymous

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I could not get into this movie because it was just too annoying." "I was not attracted to this movie." "It was so bad I wanted to watch something else." "This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I want to leave." My rating for this movie:  3/5 "A very small, but very nasty, creature, called a "snake", made of skin, has a big appetite for human flesh. He can eat human flesh, and in return he gets some kind of power and special ability. He was originally born in an American laboratory and was taken by a British scientist who worked in an isolated laboratory. They were trying to create a human-snake hybrid. The snake had a special skin and a special power, but they didn't know what this power was. But then they did a research about it and they got some clues about it. The scientist was shot in the head and they kept the snake in the laboratory. Then some scientists who worked at a hospital in the country were attacked by this snake and they found that the snake was eating the human flesh." The movie was made in 1942. This was the last movie made by Robert Abel. "It was not a great film because there were too many things that were wrong in it. There were too much lies. I didn't like the idea of killing people. And the snake is not a real snake, it is a monster. They just made him up and made him a little bit bigger. They took some parts of the film and put them in another movie, and made it worse. The people in the hospital where the snake and the scientist were kept are real. The doctor is still alive. They are not bad people. They're just trying to survive. And they didn''t do anything. They didn't do anything, they just waited for the people who were attacked to die. That's what it was all about." "The film was about a man who has to work in an isolation hospital. The hospital has to be isolated because it is not safe for human beings to be in there. One day, a man with an incredible appetite for meat comes to the hospital and tries to get in the isolation room. The man gets through the door, and then he finds that the hospital is actually a monster, and that he is the monster. He tries to find a way to kill the monster, but it doesn't work. So the

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ The story is about an astronaut named John Harrison who, after being lost in space for nearly 3 months, is found by an alien. Harrison becomes the new leader of a human colony on a planet called Nippon. They are given a mission to study and make contact with the aliens. This is a good movie. The characters are well written and the story is well told. The only thing that annoyed me about the movie was the fact that Harrison is always talking about how he hates aliens. He does this all the time in the beginning and at the end. Harrison is an alien and he knows how much aliens are supposed to hate us. The rest of the film, however, is about a good alien (that's what he is) trying to make contact and to get the humans to accept the aliens as equals. The aliens make a nice cameo. __________________________________________________________  Stars: Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Nicole Amore, Sam Rockwell, Christopher Plummer, John Hurt, George C.

There were a few action scenes but they were so over the top and unbelievable, I think they were the worst in the movie, not that I don.t think they made a bad film. I would have given this movie a zero if I could have seen it in the theater. I think it was made for TV and I was just not impressed with the quality of the acting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** The movie was so bad, I can't even remember the plot. The girl (the main girl) was supposed to get pregnant and the guy (the boyfriend) would come and make a baby, but the girl started crying and she was in a relationship with another guy. The boyfriend was jealous and he broke into the girl's house and raped her. I mean, this is so stupid and gross. I was so angry when I found out about it. I hope she got better and never did this stupid movie. I hate this movie so much, I think the whole world hates it too.  I'll never go to this movie ever again. I'm so disappointed. I just saw it and thought it was so weird and creepy. I really thought it would be something funny. But no. This movie is so bad. The guy's name is Kevin. He looks like a little kid. His voice is so cute. He wants to have sex with this girl who is really cute and innocent. He's trying to seduce her, but she's really shy and scared. He tries to make her feel better and be more open to sex. But she doesn't want to have sexual intercourse. He says he's a virgin. And then he rapes her. He also tells her that he wants to make a movie with her. But then she really is scared and doesn't know what to do. She just sits there in a corner and doesn.t want to go to his house. But finally, she says "okay" and goes there. He takes her into his room and has sex with her and then he leaves. And when he goes to the bathroom, he takes out his penis and starts raping her. The movie ended so fast and I felt so disappointed and so disgusted by this movie. So gross.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _____________ This movie is very hard to watch, because of the characters, and the way it was directed, the dialogue, and also the cinematography. I know there are many people who are sick of movies with no actors, and who don't understand the need for the actors. But when it comes to the way the movie was shot, and directed, it was just plain hard to listen to. This movie was filmed in black and white, and then they tried to make it in color, which is so embarrassing, and so out of touch. The acting was horrible, and very wooden, and not funny. If you look at the actors and what they were doing, it's just awful. Even the movie poster was the same way, and this movie should have been called, "The actor is terrible". The story is horrible, because it makes no sense. And I think the director had a lot of things to say, but I don't think he knew what to say. He didn't know how to tell a good story. And this movie could have been a really good movie if the actors had been good. I am not trying to say that the actors are not good, but the way they were done, and what the director was doing with the story made this movie horrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a bad film. It's so bad that it is not worth watching. This film is bad and it has to be bad. If you want to see a good film then watch The Last Samurai or The Matrix Reloaded. So what is so bad about this movie?  The first thing that stands out is the terrible acting.  When the movie starts we see a bunch of different characters and they all look like they have no idea what they are doing.  one guy even says he has never seen this before.  It's like they never went to school for acting. The other actors all sound like they are talking to themselves.  The only thing I like about this film is the fact that the film never takes itself seriously.  There is never any drama in this film.  This movie is just a bunch o' stupid people running around.   A bunch of people run around in a bad way.  So why do they run around?   Well the movie is based on the book  The Art of War.  The author, Sun Tzu, wrote this book when he was a general.  Sun Tze wrote the book in about 600 B.C.  In this book Sun Tse says the following:  "The art of war is not an art of tactics but a science of strategy.  "When you are able to take the enemy's territory and hold it, that territory will never be yours again."    This is one of the most famous quotes from Sun Tzus.  So in this movie there is one scene where there are all these different characters running around in the desert,  and there is no action in this scene.  Now why is this scene so bad?  Well, there is a lot of running around and the only thing that they do is run around. There is no fight in this one scene. This is what the scene looks like when there is action in it.  I guess the people running in this shot are running away from something. Now back to the movie.  They show the art of fighting from Sun Yzu's book.  But this movie takes it and makes it a horrible movie.  In this movie the people run in a circle.  These people are always running in a straight line.  How do you know where you are going when you are running in circles?  The whole movie is running in circle.  It

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ರೃ  I've never seen this movie. So... I don't know how to write a review. I'm not sure if this movie has any value or not, but I watched it once and it was just boring. If you haven't seen this, it's probably because it's on VHS. The movie has a very old-fashioned look to it, and I was actually surprised that the movie wasn't in color. But that's just my opinion. The acting was really bad, and they should just hire some new actors to do the characters instead of re-using them. There was some really lame lines in this movie like, "This is your time, this is your life, and you're gonna take it or leave it." That's not funny. That's really stupid. Then there's the whole scene where they're talking about what a good time they had in a bar. They just repeat that line over and over again and then they don't even talk about the movie. And that whole scene was really lame. I don`t even know how this movie made it out on VH-1. I was just really disappointed because I was expecting something better.

In the end, he leaves her, realizing that his love will never be enough for her and decides to kill himself in a suicide mission.  Director: Tim Burton  Producer: David Siegel  Starring: Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Keaton, Juliette Lewis, Mia Wasikowska, Josh Gad, Bill Murray, Christopher Walken  Running Time: 87 min. 's plot is pretty straight forward: a young man falls in with a beautiful young woman, they fall in love and then things turn violent. The film is actually quite well done, but there are a few issues with it that prevent it from being truly great. First of all, the script is atrocious. The acting is so bad, it really makes the film hard to take. The entire film is narrated by Helena Bonny Carter, but her narration is so wooden that you'd think she was reading a diary. It just doesn't work. Secondly, the acting is not the only thing that is bad. The cinematography and the soundtrack are also terrible. I was expecting some sort of supernatural/spooky/sci-fi vibe from this movie, but the only time the movie even came close to it was when the girl's sister (who is played by Juliette, the daughter of Johnny Depps) was in the house. But she was only in there for a couple of scenes. This film is pretty boring and it lacks a great script and great acting. There is a lot of mystery surrounding this film and it really does come off as being a bit over the top. There is a great deal of sex in this film, but it just doesnít come across as being as hot as it could. If it was a lot hotter, then it would have been better. I would recommend this movie to those who are into the paranormal or people who are just into a great story. The only thing I would not recommend is for you to watch this movie with a very young child. The sexual content in this movie is very graphic and there

It's a fun movie and it's about a guy who wants to see the world and his mother's dreams. His dreams include a cruise to a place called The Faraway Islands. It is really amazing that this movie was made in 1974 and it still looks like a kid's movie. But I think the main reason why this movie is good is that it is really funny. The characters are funny and they always get the joke. And the comedy in this movie will always keep you on the edge of your seat. This movie has a great soundtrack. I like the music that is playing in the background. I really like the theme song "A Place in the Sun". The movie was released on December 12, 1974. It was rated PG-13 and it has a running time of around 2 hours and 20 minutes.  Advertisements

The plot is pretty predictable and it doesn't really get interesting. The acting was good, I think that I like the role of the father in this movie, he was very charismatic. The actress is a very good actress and I think it was very important to get an actress who can act in a comedy and this was the right choice.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just not worth your time.  The movie is not good and it's just a mess.  I had to stop watching the movie because it just wasn't worth it.  And there is no plot.  The movie is just some people hanging out in some house doing nothing.  There are no stakes.  It's just random people hanging around.  What is the point of this movie?  It is just a big mess of a movie.  So why is this movie so popular?  Why is it so popular that it's on every single movie channel?  I don't know.   I am not saying this movie is a good movie. I am just saying that this movie just doesn't make sense.  This movie has all of the worst parts of a bad film.  Here is the plot:   A man and his wife are sitting in their house and the husband is getting frustrated because he doesn't know what to do.  He goes over to the window and looks out and it appears that there is a man watching them from outside.  Then the wife says to her husband " I wonder what he is doing" and then she looks out at the man watching her and she says " That guy has got to be a good looking man because he is watching us"   The husband says to his wife " What do you mean?  He doesn't have a face.  You don't have to look like a hunk in a bathing suit to watch people.  Why do you look so weird?"  The wife says " Well he's watching us and I don''t know what he's doing and I'm really not comfortable with this" and the wife then turns to the husband and says " I'm getting the feeling he might be watching us because you are watching me"  The couple then gets up and goes to the outside of the house and they go over to where the man is watching them.  They start arguing with the man about why he is looking at them.   The man then starts to get annoyed and goes over and sits on a rock in front of them and then he starts to cry.  After a while the wife and husband go to a room and then the husband says " Now we're really alone and I feel like he's just watching us for no reason"  After that the couple sits in the room and the woman says to the man " Do you want to know why you

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ This movie is bad. Bad in the worst way possible. There is no good reason to watch this. It is a very, very bad movie. It feels like a rip-off of another bad movie and then it just keeps going. I was just really upset at this. If you're into bad movies, this is one to avoid.  Fun, cheesy, good-looking, and just plain stupid, The Last House on the Left (or T.H.O.L.) has its fans and haters. I am a die-hard fan of the original film, but this remake is just plain wrong. I think the movie was actually written to be more of a horror film than a comedy, but the writers just didn't have a clue, and I think they lost their nerve midway through the movie. The movie is very bad, but it is also very good in places. If it were released today, it would be considered a masterpiece. It has a great cast, a good screenplay, and some great music. If I ever get the chance, I would like to watch the movie again, but I am afraid I will be disappointed. 2 out of 5 stars for this one. I just watched the movie and had to give it 2 stars. I have to say that the movie is pretty terrible. The acting is terrible, and the writing is bad too. I mean, there is no reason for the characters to be that stupid. The main characters were all bad-looking and their dialogue was so bad it was hard to understand them. I don't think the film has a point. It was just a bad piece of crap. That's the good part about it. The bad part was that I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. The characters were so bad, and everything they said was so stupid. It wasn't a funny movie. I guess it was funny in the beginning but then I guess everything just got to be too much. And, the acting was bad, so much so that it's hard to be funny. I thought they were funny in some of the scenes, but not all. It's like a parody of bad movies. The writing was so dumb that it was really hard to follow the plot. It seemed like the writers couldn't even figure out what was supposed to happen. And the characters just didn' seem like they had any life at all. I never laughed out loud during the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! - September 28, 2009I had no idea this movie was even in theaters. I went with my wife for a movie night at our local theater. We were in line to get in, and the clerk said it would be $10 extra to get this movie in there. The movie was crap, so we got in. My wife and I had never seen this movie, but I was going to watch it anyway because I was sick and tired of the horror films that were on TV. I guess I should have been more patient. After we got into the theater, I started to feel sick. I started watching this movie as a "what if" scenario, hoping that the movie would be better. What I didn't know was that the acting was terrible, the storyline was weak, the cinematography was bad, and my wife was very bored by the whole experience. I mean, we watched this movie like 10 times because the whole thing was just so boring. I was a little disappointed when I left. I can only assume this movie is the reason this movie lost its appeal.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ (Spoilers) It's a great film. But the director and star seem to think they're smarter than everybody else and are more talented than everyone else. The movie's a good idea. The acting is good. And, of course, the action sequences are epic. But this movie isn't a good movie, because the director can't act. It's his job to make the action scenes awesome. But he can't even do that, he can only do it by having the hero do a dumb thing. This is the movie's biggest flaw, the fact that the action is bad. The hero never even attempts to do something, just runs and then runs again. He's like a robot who's just doing whatever he wants. And then the movie ends. I mean, the hero is a superman. He could fly to the moon. It would take a thousand men just to get him to the top. But that's not even what the movie is about. The whole movie is an attempt to show how superheros never fail. And that's why the movie sucks. It just doesn't work. It makes you want to throw up, and you just want to kill the screen. It doesn't matter how cool it looks. This movie sucks because the hero just doesn a stupid thing over and over again. I don't want to hate this movie. I just want a good action movie. A good movie that makes you think and see the world differently. This sucks.  …

It was just a waste of time and money to make a movie about a guy who's trapped in a house and he's got no way out, but that's not the problem here.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ _________ The bad movie I would give a one star rating to is the movie "The Crow." It was really a horrible movie that was made by the same people who made the first "The Blair Witch Project." The Crow is a really bad movie. The actors are so horrible that they can't even act well. The only good thing about it is that it has some good effects. I didn't enjoy the movie at all. It was awful. It made me sick to watch it. The worst part is that the only thing that makes it even worse is that I found it really hard to see it. It had to be shown in a theater. The Crow was so bad that I can't imagine it being good. The movie made me laugh when I first saw it. Then I saw it and laughed some more. Then it made me mad. It has a very low budget and very bad acting. But it is also one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm not sure if I would want to see this movie again. It is just bad. I don't know what I would have done if I was in the same situation as the people in this movie. If I was that poor I would not have done a good job. This movie was really bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________   The movie's a bunch of old guys playing a bunch  It's a really long movie that takes place over a long period of time, and it's a great movie. The actors are great, the directing is great, and the cinematography is great. I don't know how the film was made, but it really works. It's a movie that's great to watch, even if it isn't very funny.   But the movie is really long, and while there are some good gags, it gets a bit tiresome at some points. The movie has a really weird way of taking place. There are some flashbacks that are just as good as the main events, but I have a hard time remembering some of them.  , and even though it's one of my favorite movies of all time, I was a little disappointed in the end. I was expecting a much better ending than what I got. And while the ending was really good, I can't say it was very funny either.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________  I saw this film at a movie theater in a small town. I've been to a few movie theaters and have never seen anything like this. The film is about a young girl who decides to be a prostitute in order to get away from a abusive boyfriend. The girl's mother decides to help her in order that she doesn't run away with the bad boyfriend anymore. Unfortunately, the girl runs away again. The boyfriend comes back and tries to have her arrested for prostitution again. She finally gets away. After getting away, the boyfriend tries to kill himself, but he is saved by the good mother and sister of the girl. The bad boyfriend has killed himself again. It was very dark, but at the same time it was very funny. It didn't feel that realistic. I was laughing out loud and was very shocked. It's a good film.

The acting was awful, the directing was terrible, and the writing was horrible. This movie made me want to kill myself. I was watching it with my brother and it was just so depressing and stupid. The guy was supposed to be a good guy, but I guess he just wanted to do a scene and then leave. When the guy was leaving, he was talking to his friend who was also a bad guy. This bad guy told the guy to just do what he wanted and that he wouldn't get in trouble. When he said that, he walked out of the scene and went to a movie with his friend. After that, the movie played a bit and then the bad guy went back to the other movie. It was then when the good guy said something that was really stupid. He was talking about a guy who got raped by a woman and then he was telling the guy that he was a bad person for letting that happen. The movie was just that awful. It took a lot of people to make this movie, but the writing and acting just took it over the top. I wish I could give this movie a zero. It just wasn't worth it.

The actors are terrible, the plot is pointless, the characters are just bad and there are some pretty terrible special effects. But I can't get over the awful acting and the stupid plot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you think this is a bad flick, then you are just not looking in the right place. This is the same film that was released back in 2002. The movie starts out with an intense chase and a fight scene that has the most unbelievable and realistic action scenes ever. There is even a scene where the villain is chasing the hero through a field. There are also a couple of scenes where the hero is running and fighting while the bad guy is hiding in bushes. There was a scene when the hero falls down a cliff while chasing a bad guy. The final fight scene is absolutely insane. There were so many explosions, the camera cuts around and the action is so intense that you feel like you are in the fight. It also has a lot of action scenes where a lot is happening at once. You can also see a lot more blood in this movie. It has more action than the first film and a lot less characters. This movie also features a lot better acting than the original movie. There will be more of the same action scenes but there are a lot new scenes that are even more realistic and interesting.  I gave this movie a 9.6/10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is just an excuse to show the bad acting and the bad story.  That's why I'm so disappointed that this movie is so popular. ____________________________________________________________ I've seen several good movies, but this one was the worst.    I really want to like it, but I just can't.  This movie is about a boy who is born blind.  He uses his special eyes to see and has no problems with other people.  After being raised by a man with no eyes, he grows up and has to go to school.  The other kids just tease him because of his eyes and because he's blind.   The movie is bad because the plot is not the main part of the movie.  It was just an experiment to show how much people can change with help.  I don't like this movie because it has a bad plot and the acting is bad.  Even though this movie has no plot, it has good acting.  A boy can change himself by using his eyes.  If you see this movie, don't think you'll see anything special.  Also, if you have trouble with your eyes, I suggest not to watch this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________  You're not going to like this one. If you're like me and have never seen a movie like this, the trailer will tell you that this is a "sci-fi" film. This film is not sci-fi. It is a horror movie. In a horror film, a person (I'm assuming that this will be a woman) is found dead in a parking lot and a serial killer (not a killer, a psychopath) has been seen there before. The movie starts with this woman being found dead and a man has been taken into custody. We are told that this man is innocent and that he was in fact the serial killer. When he is brought in for questioning, he says that this woman was a witch who wanted to destroy him. The police do not believe this and want to get him off the streets. The man tells the police that she is not a witch and that she was just looking for someone to kill. The woman, now a man, tells the killer that he is going to die and then she will die too. The killer tells her that he will do the killing. The serial killer then starts to attack her. The film ends with the serial murderer dying and the woman turning into a vampire.  The film starts off with a "preview" of what we are going to see. It's very well done. It takes a while for the film to really get going. The first part of the film is pretty good and I can't wait to see it again. The only problem I have with the film would be that it was a little short. The second part of this film is also very good. The "filler" scenes are pretty good. I really liked the second part. I thought the film was very well-written. I liked the film, it's a little long, but it was well-made and very well paced. The plot was also very interesting. It was well done and interesting.  "Bloody Kisses" is not an especially good horror film. It has it's share of problems, but I think that if you give this film a chance you will like it. If not, then you probably will not like it either. .

This romance is not so easy for Amanda as she is a good looking, but rather, a bit awkward woman. Amanda is not very popular, and so Chris, who is a rather shy and reserved person, is a bit of a stranger for her. But when Chris takes Amanda to a party, he falls in love with her as well. He is very good looking as well, and Amanda finds a strange way of seducing him by having sex with him.   They begin a long relationship and eventually have a baby together. During this time, Chris is getting serious with his best friend and his girlfriend. The two are in love and are planning to marry soon. In the middle of this, Amanda discovers a secret about Chris and has an affair with him, which ends badly. Amanda ends up in a horrible car accident and has a very difficult time recovering from it. Amanda soon finds that she can no longer be in a relationship with Chris, and begins to make her way in the world.   to keep a clean record of her life, she decides to stay at a hotel with a friend. However, she soon discovers that the hotel has a rather strange and unusual reputation.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________ I didn't expect to like this movie. I thought I would be surprised and shocked. I didn'st know that the movie was bad. I'm a movie buff and this was the first movie I've seen this year. It was also my first viewing of this year and I thought it would be okay, I didn't expect to hate it. When I watched the trailer I thought that I should like it. But it wasn't. I don't think I'll be watching this movie again. The writing was awful, I don't know why this movie got made. I liked the first trailer but this one was so bad I could have died. The acting was terrible. There was a young woman who played the young girl who I thought would be cute. She wasn't cute, she was creepy and weird. I think the director was afraid of her. I was a big fan of the movie, I really liked the idea of a girl who could transform into a dragon. I loved the dragon. When she was transformed she looked so good. I also loved the fact that the young man who was the bad guy turned out to be a girl. I am so sick of this movie now.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________   What is the point of this movie?   A lot of people have complained that the movie is not good. I have not seen this movie in a long time but the reviews are so wrong. The movie is very good, and very funny. It is so funny that I laughed a lot. It starts very good and becomes very good. It does not start very well, as it is a slow movie. But, it gets very good in the second half. The story is good, the characters are good and the jokes are good.   The movie is a comedy, but it is not the kind of comedy where the audience laughs a lot, but rather it is funny only for a short time. The plot is not very good (in my opinion) but the plot does not matter. This is a great movie for a laugh, but not for the plot.   "The Boondock Saints" is a good movie, and is definitely worth a laugh.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ Did you like this movie? If you said no, then please leave a good review. I know some people like the movie, but I am not one of them. It was a very dull and boring movie. The actors were very bad, and the script was boring. They made me feel sorry for the characters, and for the bad guys. I did not feel like watching the movie because I wanted to see something else. There were times where I thought the actors were not good, and I thought they were just doing their jobs. I wish the movie had been made by a movie maker who wanted to make a great movie, and not a one-shot, cheap movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ I am writing this review to share my experiences with this film and in no way did I feel like I was watching a good movie. I didn't feel like a kid and I didn.t feel like an adult either. The acting was so bad, there were several times where I felt like they were trying to make the story more believable than it was. The only thing I liked about the movie was the music. It was so catchy. This movie could have been a great movie if the acting wasn't so bad. I have never been so disappointed in a movie and I'm still not sure what to think about it. The last time I watched this movie, I enjoyed it and felt like it was a good flick. ______________________________________________________________________________________ I had high hopes for this movie and then the movie ruined it for me. It wasn't bad but I just don't know if it was made with the right people in mind. I just wish the movie had been made for a more mature audience. ______________________________________________________ What I thought about this movie: 1. The story was so unrealistic that I felt it was so contrived that it wasn't even funny. It felt very fake. 2. The movie was very poorly acted. 3. The music was a little better but it was just way too much for the movie. It just felt out of place. 4. I thought that the movie took a long time to get going. I think I could have gotten the ending to the movie earlier if I had been more involved with the story. 5. The ending was just wrong. ______________________ Rating: 1/5 I'm sorry to say this review is based off of a bad review.    I just have to say that I don't like this movie. _________________________ If you're interested in watching this movie (which I didn?t think it was going to be as good as it turned out to be), I?m going to suggest you read my review first.  What do you think?

I thought it was a cheap attempt to make a profit.

It wasn't that the characters were dumb or anything, they were just so unoriginal. And the actors were also so uninspired, they seemed to have just walked in off the street, I really didn't like the script at all. The movie just seemed so stupid and pointless.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Don't like: _______________________________ Why do they have to ruin so much good stuff in one movie? You don't need this. It is a bad sequel to a good movie and a bad remake. It has been tried before and I don't see why they thought they would do better this time. The acting is so bad in this movie that I have to wonder how many of the actors were in the previous movie. There are two things I like about this movie: The first is that it has a lot of great music. The other is that the character of Dr. Frank West is a good one. The plot is bad, the acting is bad and the special effects are bad. The movie doesn't have enough of a story to be interesting, so you are left wondering why this is even called The West Wing.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ [W]hen it comes to the horror genre, few horror films can match the original Night of the Living Dead (1968) for sheer fear. After the opening credits, we are introduced to the main character, a farmer named George Romero, who has just purchased a house in the small Texas town of Brookshire. It's there that he begins his nightly routine: He takes the family to the barn to clean and feed the animals, and to prepare the chickens for the night. When the family arrives back home, they notice that the windows and doors have been forced open and the house is filled with blood. George is quick to blame a neighbor named Linda (played by Judith O'Dea), who he believes has been poisoning the chickens. But Linda, and a group of friends, is far more sinister than George could ever imagine. In fact, they're nothing more than vengeful ghosts of the people who died in the house. These ghosts are called the "living dead," and when George begins to investigate further, he comes face-to-face with a terrifying truth. [A]fter an eerie and disturbing prologue, Night of The Living Dead sets the tone for a horrifying and often gory tale. George Romero's story follows his wife and young daughter, as they prepare for their annual camping trip to a small town in the middle of nowhere. As the two get ready to leave, George notices a few things that aren't quite right about the house, including the windows having been forced, and the smell of dead people. A few days later, George is awoken by a horrible scream from his bedroom. He runs to his wife's side, only to find her already dead. When George rushes to the house to investigate, he finds a bloody and broken corpse in the living room. In his terror, George witnesses a mysterious figure entering the house through the window. He quickly realizes that the figure is not human and that it may be the living dead. The living dead are a supernatural entity that is constantly pursuing the living. They seem to know everything about the people they attack, and they are driven by hatred. The "living" don't seem to have any reason for their actions, and even when George is able to find some information about them, he is never able to get a clear picture of them. Throughout the film, George continues to be plagued by visions of the living Dead. George's wife's death makes him realize that the living are always

(Hint: it involves wearing a fake beard) (HINT: It involves wearing fake facial hair) By: Emily Smith, Editor, The Huffington Post When the recruiter asked me to bring my resume with me to meet with him, I had no idea what to expect. I'm a big fan of films that feature people from different backgrounds coming together, and I had seen the movie The Departed, so I thought that maybe I could get a job at the Central Intelligence Agency. The recruiter, as you can probably imagine, was a little skeptical. But he was a good sport and gave me a chance to tell him what I thought of the film. I didn't expect much from a movie, and to my surprise, the recru the made a good impression on me. He seemed to care about what I had to say, and he made it clear that the CIA was interested in someone who knew how to work and communicate with the public. He made it very clear that I had a lot of potential. "What I'm trying to tell you," he said, "is that you're a little bit of a nerd. I mean, you have a degree in communications, but you're not really the type to sit at a computer all day." He explained that he was very interested in my skills, and that he'd even give me a bonus if I did well in the interview. He went on to say that I'd get a great opportunity if I stayed with the CIA, but he could make it a lot more interesting for me if I went to work in the intelligence field. He asked me if my wife and I would be interested in moving to Washington and working with the intelligence community. He said that the people in the field would be great to work with, and they'd be really excited to have a new person like me come in. I told him that I loved my job at NBC News, and while I liked my colleagues, the CIA just seemed like a much better place to work. "They're looking for people who are willing to work hard," he told me. "And I think that if you work hard, you'll get ahead. So I'm going to try and give you a chance." At this point, I was very excited about

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Play Video  Mute Current Time 0:00 / Duration Time 0.0% Description 0:08 It's a film about a bunch of guys and one woman, and we're supposed to see this as a romance? But when you see that woman's face, you realize that she is not in love with the guys, she's in love in the sense that they're her friends. So it's really not a romance. And then when you look at her relationship with her sister, it's even worse. There is no connection between her and her sister. The guy who plays her husband, is actually a sleazy and abusive husband. He's like a guy who goes to a bar, and the woman is just the bartender. And the woman, it seems, is really trying to get away from him. She has a very strong relationship with this guy, and they're very close. It's just a horrible film.  "There's something sad about this, and I can't figure out what it is. It doesn't feel like it's trying to be funny. And there's not a lot of character development. There's no relationship development. It seems like they've made a movie to be as simple and as shallow as possible."
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Did not like this movie. The only positive thing I can say about it is that I think they made it with the intention to make it a horror film. But, it turned out to be a little too scary for me. It's just a really long movie. _________________________  I'll start by saying this film is well made and very entertaining. The special effects are good and the acting is top notch. The problem is that the ending was way too confusing and out of nowhere. The ending really seemed to me to be an afterthought. I know they had a reason for the ending, but the whole thing just seemed really rushed and not satisfying. The next problem I have is the plot and characters. The characters are just way too flat and forgettable. There is a character named The Judge that is a really fun character. He's like the judge in The Exorcist, except he's a little younger. I enjoyed him. I liked that he's just one of the guys and he's not like all the other characters that are all over the place. I was just never a fan of any of the other actors. They all seemed to be in one scene and then just vanished. The plot, again, is just way over the top. It starts out really good, but then just loses steam. It was way over long and there is nothing interesting going on. It just felt so forced. I would recommend this to those who are fans of The Exeunt, but not for the fans of the first movie. I don't really think it's a good idea to remake this movie just because people are upset about it. __________________  "If the sun had not risen, there would have been no sun." -Bart Simpson
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________   I saw this movie on my flight to the airport from Newark, and I got to the theater late and sat next to a young girl who sat beside me. As we watched this movie, the young girl, who was only 18, kept saying things to me like, "I have to say, you look great." I said, "Well, you don't look old enough." And she said, in a mocking tone, "What? That's a bad thing?"   The young girl was an extra. The only reason I saw this film is because it was in the airplane movie section, but I wouldn't have seen it if it wasn't in the movie section. I saw it at a different theater and saw a lot of movies. I had a great time. It's not a bad film, but the young actress was really annoying.   It was a bad decision to release a movie in a theater with a movie like this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This is the worst movie ever made."   What's with that guy? He has never seen a bad picture. So, the worst part of the movie is that it has no story. It is just a bunch of scenes and some dialogue. There are no characters and no story to it. So in essence, it is just one long shot of a man running with a gun and some other scenes. It just gets boring as it goes on. It seems like they tried to do a movie that was supposed to be about the Vietnam War but just ended up with nothing going on.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________. It is a bad film with a poor story. There is no plot. There are no emotions. There's no plot, there's no logic. The film just has a bunch of actors in a room with a lot of dialog. The actors are good at what they do. They don't do much. They just do their lines. They have little to no character development. I've never seen this movie. I thought it was about an actor, but I was wrong. It's really not about a character. It has no logic, no plot and no characters. It just has actors and dialog. It doesn't have a plot, so how can you have a good plot? Why does it have a bad plot? It doesn"t have any plot. It"s a story. It makes no sense. It seems to have nothing to do with the actors. It feels like it is made up just to get money. It isn't even good acting. It can"t even get a good actor. If it was a good movie, it would be better. The movie doesn't even have characters. The acting isn't good, it"s bad. I think it is a poor film. If you"re gonna make a bad bad movie, you might as well make a good bad movie. The director is a big shot, the producers are rich, the studio is a corporation, and the actors are just cheap actors. The only good thing about the film is the actors and their performances. If they would have just given it to a regular actor, they would of made a better movie. It would have been better. I wish I could have seen this film.

I know it wasn't intended to be a movie, but you just couldn't get over the fact that it was.  the story was so boring, so uninteresting, that I just didn't care for the ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I am not a big fan of these "Star Wars" films but this one really sucked. The acting is bad. The CGI is very poor. The story is a mess. It is just a bad "Star wars" movie. I would give it a 1 star rating but I felt it was a waste of time and money. If you want to watch a "Star war" movie do it in the 1970's. I did not see this movie and would not waste my time on it. The only reason I gave it 1 star is because the movie "Empire Strikes Back" was so good. The movie "Star WARS" was very bad but "EAT THIS!!!" was good! I am glad I did this movie. It was my first "Star trek" and I loved it! I think they are going to release a "Escape From L.A." movie. "EVE: Valkyrie" was a big disappointment. I was looking forward to it. It's like "E.T." meets "Star Trek." The movie is too dark. I like the first two "Star treks" but this is the last one. It really was a bad idea to remake the original movie. The "Star Treks" movies are awesome. I'm sure I'll like this one. If you enjoyed this review please do me a big favor by sharing it with your friends! Thanks! This review is for the movie:  Escape From L and A. It was released on September 4, 2007 and it's a sequel to the original "Eve: Valkyrie". This movie was directed by Peter Jackson and stars, Zoe Saldana, Tom Hiddleston, Anthony Hopkins, and others. This movie is one of the biggest hits in the history of the "Star" Trek Universe. This was one of those movies that made you want more. This is a big movie that will probably stay with you forever. This will definitely make you want this movie more than the original. It had a great story, great acting, and a great soundtrack. This film has an amazing story. The film is about a ship on a mission to rescue a woman. The ship is called the E-4 and the captain is played by Benedict Cumberbatch. The crew is the Enterprise crew, and the main character is William T. Riker. The Enterprise has a problem. It has been sent out on a deep space mission but the ship is damaged
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! It is a very bad movie and I recommend you not to watch it!!!!!! I was really excited to see the movie but this movie is so bad. It's boring, not very funny, boring characters. You can't get any good laughs out of this movie. You are watching a very dull movie. Don't waste your time watching this. I recommend to watch a good movie instead.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great comedy The film follows the exploits of the mischievous, eccentric, misanthropic, and occasionally bumbling "Lil' Pete". He gets a new car and starts hanging out at a local diner to watch TV and drink coffee. A couple of people from the diner ask him to help them with their case. They think that the murderer is in the car. Pete helps them, but in a few minutes the murderer comes out. He has a gun and Pete shoots him. The murderer, who was a cop, is arrested. This is a classic. Great characters and great laughs.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I've seen some truly awful movies and even more truly great ones.  This one is the first one that truly makes me hate it.    I mean really, the first 10 minutes is the most boring scene of any movie I have ever seen.  There are no characters, just two people sitting in a house, talking about nothing.    The rest of the movie is filled with boring and useless scenes that are meant to show us what they are like as people.  I was in disbelief and wanted to stop watching at the 10 minute mark.  So many of the scenes were the same, nothing new or interesting.  It felt like this movie was made by two people to make a joke about the two main characters.  The movie is not funny, and does not deserve a rating higher than 2 stars.  And the actors,  I don't care who they are or where they come from.  They are all terrible.  This movie should have never been made.  For those of you who want to watch it, please turn back now.  Thanks."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ I was disappointed that I didn't get a chance to see this. I wanted to see how the other stars of this movie did and to see if this movie was worth it. When the movie started, it was a lot like it looked in the trailer. It wasn't a good movie. The script was lame. The acting was poor. The characters were stupid. The plot was so dumb it was funny. This movie was a complete waste of my time. The only thing that I can say good about this movie is that I found out that there is a sequel. I just hope it isn't a worse one. If you don't mind a bad and poorly made movie then watch this. It is a little more enjoyable. If not, then you probably won't like it. I'll give it a 4.  Read More

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a film made in India and I would not even think that it would have any American connections, but there are some that are trying to give the film an American feel. The lead character is a college student, who goes to India for the summer. He wants to visit some relatives there, but his uncle is a very old man and refuses to allow him to go. In order to get into the house of a certain family, he has to have an older cousin. The story itself is very dull, and the acting is terrible. There is no humor in this film at all. The only funny part is the music which is played for a few minutes in the beginning of the film. In the end of the movie, all the characters die except for the uncle. The ending is so bad, it is like a scene from the movie of Frankenstein. I have seen some movies like that, but this one is much worse than those movies. The worst part about this film is that it is not a good idea to watch this movie. If you have no sense of humor, this is not the movie for you.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _________ _____________ I thought this movie was great! It was like an 80's "Fantastic Four" movie with a lot of comedy. There was some really funny stuff with the main character who is a guy who had a big ass hole in his crotch. There were some really good fights and some really cool sequences of the alien in the water. I thought it was good. I think the only bad thing about this movie is the fact that there were only 2 people in it. But, you know, I was watching this movie with my son and I thought that was very cool.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ __________  "I'm a fan of films about people who want to get off, who have to deal with a situation that is a little beyond their control.

So when I read the description of "Ace in the Hole," I thought, "That sounds like a good story."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am an adult, and I think I know what I am doing when I watch a movie. I have been around people who have been able to see the whole movie in a single day. I do not think I can do that. I had to wait three weeks before I could see a movie, and even then it was on a Monday night. I am not an adult. I cannot afford to sit through two or three hours of a movie and then be bored because I was just bored watching the first act. I will have to go to a better movie next time. I think my wife will have something to complain about. I was expecting a better film than this.  Rated 1 out of 5 by katie from bad film, not funny at all I just did not enjoy this film. I did not like any of the characters. It was not a funny film. It just had no sense of humor at all. I could not get into it at all and I just wanted to get out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  There are plenty of bad movies. There are plenty bad movies with good performances. But a bad film has to be worse than a bad picture. If the story, acting, acting and/or screenplay are awful then you might as well give up on the whole endeavor. It's a big gamble to try to make a movie that's not really about that. But sometimes, when you have a screenplay like this, and you're only a part of it, you have to look at it through a different lens. A very, very different lens that doesn't include your name.  In the words of a wise man, "The bad news is that you're not going to make it out alive."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It's a terrible movie, and it's an embarrassment of a movie." Review by David W. A. Koepp A review from David W A. Koep:    The bad film, that we have all seen. It's a film that should not be made. The writer of this piece is a former director of the  Academy Awards, which should tell you something about how bad this film is.   It's bad on every level. It has a bad script, it has a lousy story, and the acting is terrible. It would be better to just show it to no one.  The only good thing about this film would be to show it with the soundtrack of the hit movie,  "Cars."   But the bad part of this movie is that it is so bad that it makes a bad film look good. The only positive thing that I can think of is that at least it is worth seeing, and even that would be just a bonus.  Posted by David E. Koopp at 9:01 PM

I would rather have my friends tell me that my friends are stupid than tell me they made a bad film. If you have not seen the movie, you probably won't get it. I have not watched this movie for over 10 years, but I can still remember the characters and plot. _________________________________________________________ ___________________________________ I have a new obsession with the "Gone Girl" books, so I went back to read them for a good laugh.  What can I say? I am very amused at all the things that people say in this movie.  ___________________________________________________ __________________________________________ This is the best movie to ever make the list.  There is no plot and it is just a bunch of people talking.  I do not think it is the worst movie ever, but it is not one of the best.  A movie about a woman who has a secret relationship with a woman and she becomes paranoid and suspicious of everyone around her.  This movie has a good plot and the acting is good, but you cannot help but wonder if the writer of this movie was a bit crazy.  The only reason this movie is so good is because the writer has written so many great books.  If you are looking for a funny movie, then you should watch this movie instead of "The 40-Year-Old Virgin" or "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective".    If I were you, I would wait a bit longer to watch this one because I am sure you will love this movie too.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen all the bad ones. I've seen the best of the bad movies, and the worst of the worst.  In between the bad and the really bad, I've had some fun.    The last movie I saw that was truly horrible was the sequel to 'The Exorcist' that starred Dolph Lundgren as the monster.  My only problem with the movie was that it didn't make sense.  The Exegesis   I've never been one to watch horror movies.  But I was hooked by 'The Ring' (1982) after seeing a preview of it at a horror convention.  I knew the sequel was going to be a big hit.  Then it came out, and I hated it.  After the second film I gave up on the series and never looked back.  One of my favorite movies in the series was 'The Others' (1987).   The movie had a very cool plot that involved a group of children trying to find their lost friend.  It was one of the best horror movies ever made.  The other movies in this series, 'The Last House on the Left' (1986) and 'The Evil Dead' (1981), are good, but not as good as 'The Other'.   There are many horror movies I've watched that I don't enjoy, but I haven't seen one I didn't like.  For me, 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' (2004) is the best movie of this series.  A group of kids go camping, and while there they learn about a ritual that the local tribe was practicing.  They go out to try to stop it, but end up getting trapped in the ritual.  In the end the movie gives you a reason to watch the movie, and not just to hate it. The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (1966) I like a good spaghetti western.  This one has a great cast.  John Wayne is amazing in this movie.  Sam Peckinpah is amazing too.  Robert Mitchum is great as a character named Big Daddy.  And George P. Cosmatos is great in this film.  With that being said, I think the movie is a little hard to follow.  There is a lot going on.  Some of it is very confusing.  At times it is hard to figure out who is who.  Another

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! That's what this movie is about. It's a bad comedy. The only thing that keeps it from being terrible is the ending. The movie is just boring. It doesn't really end with anything new, it just ends on a whimper. I mean, the movie didn't even go into the movie that was made for the ending, so that means that the movie had to be made from scratch. But the movie is so bad, that it's funny! The best part of this movie was when the people who make this movie said that they made the movie to "give a message to the younger generation." But, they didn't give a message at all. They made a terrible movie, so now they're making more horrible movies. What message are they sending? To say that the world is bad and that you have to try harder?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it doesn't take a great movie to make a bad one.  You get the same boring, cliched script that the previous film did, with the same same character acting with the exact same way of speaking.  The plot is predictable and over the top, it even shows you the same way to fight the villain, it doesn't make it more interesting, it just makes it look worse than the previous movie.  The film is so boring and it doesn\'t get any better in the third act.  You want to laugh at the film and I can't because it just doesn\' t get any more entertaining.  I really liked the previous two films and this one doesn\'T do anything different.  If you want to watch a bad superhero movie, don\'t go to this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* The movie was boring and made me feel a bit sick. The whole story was just ridiculous, and the characters were also extremely stupid. I had to pause the movie every 2 seconds. I don't want to watch it again. ***** *****  Helpful the movie is not bad, it's just a very dumb movie. I can't believe it, but there's a real world called Earth. The movies doesn't make any sense, it was made for kids and the people who have seen it can't see the world from the point of view of kids, because they have never lived on Earth. I hope they can make a better movie with more logic.  So, the story is that the aliens are trying to get a weapon from the human race, and they're really strong, so they're trying to destroy all the cities on Earth, but the people of Earth are too strong, they won't let them, and then the aliens go to the moon and use the same weapons, but they use the sun instead of the earth. It's a long movie, and I really enjoyed it. The acting is good, but not great, and there were no funny scenes. Overall it was just a dumb movie, but I'm glad that it was at least made for children, because that is how I saw it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I think I will have to write my own review of the movie. I am an adult, not a child. I can appreciate a good movie, and I really enjoyed "The Last Dragon". But I do not understand how anyone could take the movie so seriously. If you have never seen this movie, you should not see it. There are several parts that are really cool, but there are several other parts that make me cringe. The actors really seemed to be having fun, and there was no real violence or bad language in the movie, but that is not to say that there is nothing to be said about this movie. The acting is really good, and the story is really funny, but the movie really suffers from a bad ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. It's not as bad as you think. It has some good parts, but you'll probably end up laughing a lot, because the plot is so stupid that you don't have time to laugh. The whole movie is about a man who has an affair with a lady of his sister's, but when she dies he is devastated. It turns out that the guy is her brother's ex-girlfriend and they were both sexually abused by the same guy. There is no way that he could have had a sexual relationship with the girl, and if she was his sister, she would be a young girl, not a married woman. Also, the plot makes no sense. The sister is a married lady and the guy had a relationship with her. There was no way she could have slept with him. This is all very stupid, and you will be laughing for ages. If you think this movie is bad, just think about the plot of a "Twilight" movie.  Sean Paul - Slap Trap  by iPromote4Free  Reggae

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't remember a time when I liked a bad horror movie.  I can't remember any time when a bad film made me laugh or smile.  The horror genre has gotten so predictable and the gore so excessive.    The biggest disappointment was when I realized it wasn't supposed to be scary.  The trailer for 'Cocktail' is the reason that I was going to see this movie. It is a horror movie that I can easily imagine a drunk woman running naked through a dark hotel room.  But, this movie is a terrible movie. You will have to pay to see it.  I am not kidding.  The only reason I'm not giving this movie a 0 is because I really wanted to see if this movie was scary. It wasn't.  This is a cheap and boring movie that doesn't even make sense.  So, let's begin!   My wife and I went to the theater to see 'COCKTAIL'.  We decided to go on a Thursday night.  It is actually a Friday night here.  We went to a theater that was about 20-25 people big.  While we were waiting for our seat to be called, a group of guys started talking to one another.  They were in the theater for an hour and a half.  When the movie started, I immediately started to feel nervous.  Some of the shots were really close up, I had to look at the person in the picture.  If you have never seen a movie like this before, I would recommend that you avoid this one.  A bunch of people died.  And, a bunch of girls were raped.  That is it.   So, you think I was exaggerating about this movie?  Well, you don't know how bad this movie really is.  In the beginning, there was a shot of a girl's head coming through a glass window.  At the end, a man is coming out of the bathroom and I am thinking "Is he going to rape me?  I really hope he doesn't!".  It's hard to watch a movie where a man can be so evil.  My wife and i were really shocked at some of the scenes in this movie and the ending was really disappointing.  To make things worse, this is the worst movie that we have ever seen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________"I think it's going to be an interesting year for horror."  The first part of The Ring is a movie that is just awful, and this review will discuss the good and bad parts of the movie as a whole. The good is the characters, who are very interesting and likable, and I think that if a horror movie with those same people would be made, I would watch it, even if it wasn't a horror film. I also thought that the pacing was great, and the acting was great as well. The only part that I think is terrible is that the camera work is so terrible, and it makes everything look like it is shot in an over-lit studio. Also, the movie is so over the top and crazy that it's almost as if they tried to make a horror-action film. The worst part is that it was released in the 80's and has some pretty bad gore, and not much of the classic 80's horror tropes. Overall, this movie is just so bad, and so cheesy that I wish I hadn't seen it, and just watched something like The Omen.  "Oh, the power of evil... You shall be my victim, you shall be the prey... The Ring of the Nibelung will be yours... And your soul shall burn in the flame... Until the last breath... You are doomed... And so shall all you love..."  This movie is about a group of people who get caught up in a demonic ritual, and then they are thrown into a demon castle. There they find a ring that will help them to control their own evil, and as they are trapped in the castle they are forced to kill their own family members to become demons themselves. The first half of the film is just as awful as the first half in the Ring of The Nibelunge. The acting is so bad that I can't even begin to describe how bad it is, and you will see why in the next paragraph. It is all cheesy and cheesy, and most of it comes from the main character, who is very annoying. - The bad actors in this movie are: * Jason (played by Richard Briers), who is the evil demon (he is a huge asshole). * Eric (played in the movie by Richard Bracey), who becomes a demonic king because he doesn't believe in the rituals and is just trying to get in with the group. * Tom (played with a horrible

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********** The story of a man who becomes a hero in the most unlikely way. In the first scene, we meet our hero, a man named David. His name is David, and he is a retired military man. His family was murdered by a group of people who were called The White Fang. He was forced to become a White Fang member and fight them. David is an exceptional fighter. He has great stamina and has mastered the fighting style of the White Fang members. His fighting skills are so strong that he is able to easily take out all but the top White Fang fighters. His main opponent is a man by the name of the Red Arrow. He is an expert in the martial arts, and is the only person who is capable of fighting David. It is clear that David has become a better person after meeting the Red Arrows. He even becomes very kind, and has a great desire to protect people, and to protect his family. The film then shows a fight between David and the Red arrow. David's technique and skills are amazing, and the film shows him killing the Red arrows. It shows David is a hero who has grown to be a real man. This movie is great. The story is interesting, and David is amazing in his skill. He isn't as strong as the other White Fang, but he can fight very well. There is no plot, just action. The ending of the film was good. David finally kills the Red bowman. He then goes to meet with his family, and it was nice seeing the love in his eyes. This film has an amazing ending, and a great plot. It was a great watch. ********** I was so excited for this movie! This movie was fantastic! It had great action and amazing fight scenes. The characters were great, and they really had depth. David was great! He was the perfect person to be The White fang leader. He had a great sense of honor and was very determined. He fought very hard and was a good person. This was a movie I had to see. I highly recommend this movie. ***************

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ What a let down. I was really hoping to see this movie. It was supposed to be a reboot of the character. I thought that was cool. I loved the first film so much. I even had a great time on the set. The cast was great and I was going to see it again. This film was so bad. I just couldn't see any point to this film. They are trying to do a Star Trek movie with an alien and I just don't think that's the best idea. This movie wasn't good at all. The writing was just terrible. They didn't even try to do the original show well. I think that this film will be remembered as a huge flop. I'm not sure how they are going to make a sequel. The story was terrible. It had nothing to do with the original. The actors were so bad they were in a different film. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I guess it could be a good one. The aliens were so generic they were just bad. The whole film was just a mess. If they do a sequel, it should be a remake of the original film. There was a lot of potential for a great film. If this is how you are going with this franchise, it's a waste of time. I would never watch this again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  When I was young, I went to the movies a lot. My dad took me to see my first two movies there. There were three or four of us kids. I remember one movie that I hated. It was called "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald." The guy who played the hero was an alcoholic. He had a huge head. It looked like a moustache, but he was bald. The movie had all kinds of problems with sound and picture. The acting was awful. There was no one I liked in the movie. The only good thing about it was the soundtrack by a guy named "Mack" (Bill Cosby). It was a horrible song called "I've Been to the Mountain."  "The Wrecks" was the first movie I ever saw. The guy had a real head. He didn't have a mop and comb.  That was my first exposure to bad acting.  is there a way to make good movies, or is it just hard?  I have a friend who is a director. He does films, and he's a very nice guy. He's never done a bad job. But he doesn't know how to make a good movie. ... I'd like to think that I'm an exception.  in the movies:...  There's a scene in a movie called "Black Rain," and it was a great scene. The actor was a black guy, but the movie made him white. It just didn't work. It's a good scene. But I never did a movie where I liked the black guy. , and how you would go about choosing actors:  You should never, ever use a black person in a good or a bad role. If you do, you are an idiot.

The only problem is that the teacher is a total jerk who thinks he is so good at teaching that he could be a successful child molester. He uses a very childish excuse to get the boy in trouble. The worst part is that this teacher is so self-righteous and believes that he knows the best way to teach the students and that he will help them in anyway possible.

It was a time of great sorrow in Germany, a time when women and children had to fight for their lives. In my mother's case it was the worst time. She and her family were living in a small house on the edge of a forest in a country town. They had fled their home, their farms and their belongings to escape the Russian army. We moved in together, she with her husband and my brother and me with my mother. The Russian soldiers took over our house and took my mother to the front. When she got there she was taken to a hospital and died. In the hospital she met my father. They married and had a son. He was a good soldier, but he could not survive the terrible fighting. He fought in the trenches for two years. He died in 1916 and was buried in the cemetery at Verdun. My father, the man I knew, was a very kind man and a very good soldier. He always told me that my mother was a brave woman. He wanted me to know her, but I was very young and did not have the memory of her. I never saw her again. In 1917 my mother and my father
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  This is the first film I've seen that had an impact on me and the rest of my life. I remember it as if it was yesterday. It's a movie about two people that are separated. One of them, in an attempt to be with the other one, uses her best friend and a lot of innocent girls in her life. It starts out with a lot more sex and a little bit of violence, but this soon fades into the background. It is a great movie that was filmed on location and is so good that you will never look at a film the same way again. It also has a lot to do with my favorite movie, Back to the Future, and how the same two characters are at the beginning of the movie, and the end of the film, when they have a great falling out. This is a very important film for me because it shows how true love and how friendship can change you and your life.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "A movie that is really, really, bad."  It's like you've never seen anything this bad.  How could you not think this is a terrible movie?  I really didn't want to see it.    If you haven't seen it, just skip to the last scene.  And then watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ The story is that the government is after a guy who is a part-time assassin. When the government finds out he's part-timer, they send in a guy called Red (I am going to try and call him something else so it is easier to type his name) who is also a part time assassin. Red has some problems with the way he is being treated, so he takes his gun and goes to a restaurant to kill someone. But when he goes in, he finds out that this is a man's club where people get together for fun. Red's girlfriend is also in the club, and she's a girl. Red doesn't like girls. This gets back to Red's feelings about his wife (or is she his wife now?). Red wants to kill the guy that is there with his wife, so Red kills the guy. The problem is, the government has been following Red all over the place. They have been sending agents after him, and they have even been in the restaurant that he was in. They had been watching Red and the woman for so long, that Red had to use his own gun to shoot a bullet through a wall in order to get out of there. When Red gets out of the restaurant, the police find him. He was arrested and sent to prison. This was my first time seeing a movie that involved a prison. In the prison, he learns that he is not supposed to kill anyone. He has to learn how to kill people and survive. I thought that the ending was a little strange. Red goes back to the man's house and shoots a bunch of people in the house, and then kills himself. I really liked the story and the way it was told. There are a lot of things that are missing, but this is an interesting story. The only thing that I would change is that they could have just cut out the parts that were unnecessary. There were some things that just didn't add anything to the story. If you are a fan of the movie "The Big Lebowski", you will love this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ it has to be a bad film that is made to make a lot of money. It is also a film that made a lot for the company and the director. The movie is not a good one. I saw it at the cinema and it was boring. It was a film about a man who has the ability to control his mind. He is able to get rid of his troubles. He does it with a drug which is an LSD-like drug. He makes a girl to be his girlfriend. He has an accident which he thinks will kill him but it does not. He then makes another girl to have an abortion. This is a film with many faults and it does have an ending which I was not happy about. I was a little bit disappointed and that is why I gave this movie a bad rating. The main character is an actor who is trying to make his way in the world. His girlfriend was not a real girlfriend. She was a fake and was not very good looking. This movie was made in 1960s so it is a bit old-fashioned. If you want to see a film like this, go to a local cinema and see it in a theatre. There are a lot more modern films which are much better than this one. The story was good, but the acting was not good at all. It has the same problem as other movies of the time. It could be very good if the actors had good acting skills. But this movie is definitely not worth watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I watched this movie with the sound off because I was too busy thinking about how I'm never going to see a good movie about the Vietnam War ever again. I was so disappointed in this movie. It's about a group of soldiers that is sent to Korea. They go to a training camp and learn about how to handle a battlefield. After that, they go to war in Korea. And it's not even close to being close at all. The military training camp is so bad that the people from the other side of the world are amazed. And the military leaders of the US just laugh at them. I can't believe that the US government is this incompetent. I just can't. It was just so bad. I wish they'd have put the movie out on DVD." The Good:    The movie has a very well written script and the performances by the actors are good.  The director, David M. Levine, really knew what he was doing.  The Bad:    As I said, it is a terrible movie.   There's just so much bad acting in this thing.  And the plot is totally unrealistic.  The only thing that makes this movie worth watching is the great music.  It was a great soundtrack.  I highly recommend this movie if you like war movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is bad. The plot was so bad it was hard to believe this movie was even made. The movie was set in a fictionalized version of the 1920's. The main character, John Henry, is an outlaw who was a big shot in the old west. He is looking for a place to call home. He finds a home in the middle of nowhere in the woods. He meets a girl and a baby and they decide to go home together. After they return home, they are met by a mob that is out to kill them. They fight back and kill the mob and escape. John Henry has now become a fugitive. He goes through all kinds of hardship to get home. There is no home. The only person who cares about him is a woman who helps him with his problem. But, she has a secret. A secret she will not tell anyone. John has a lot of problems. His wife is dead, his children are lost and he doesn't know how he got into the situation. There are also problems with a group of women who are also looking for the same thing he has. John's troubles are getting worse and he is running out of time. Will John ever get to his home? What is a hero to do in a situation like this? Written by: Paul Gartman
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________  This movie is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. The acting was awful, the plot was completely lame and ridiculous, and the music was just awful. All of these aspects are not even worth mentioning, as the movie is just a disaster. I could not believe that it was released on DVD, as I would have never watched it, as this movie is a total waste of money. It is just so bad that I can't believe that the people who made this movie even bothered to get the DVD released. This movie was made by people who clearly don't understand what they are doing. If I were to be honest, I hated the movie. It was just so lame and silly. I think the main problem with this movie was the bad acting, the bad music, and some of the lame story lines. If you watch this movie, I would really advise you to just watch the movie on video. The movie is so bad and you can't even believe that this movie came out in 1996. If they would have just released this movie on DVD in 1996, I think people would have enjoyed it more, as it was just a waste of time. I hate to say this, but this movie just made me feel like I was watching some terrible 90's movie. This is the kind of movie that would have been released in the 90's and was a huge failure. It has a few funny scenes, but the majority of the movie just makes you feel like you are watching some stupid 90's bad movie. If this movie had been released 20 years ago, it would have gone down as a classic. If anyone has seen this movie or has any other knowledge about it, please let me know, so that I may give this movie another chance. If someone can watch this bad movie on a DVD, then I would love to see it on video and give it another chance as well. I just wish that the makers of this movie would just release this movie for the fans of the 90s.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  I don't think I've ever heard anyone say "it sucked" in this sense before. I don't mean that this film was a bad film. It was a film that didn't work. I think the biggest reason for this is that the movie is in fact a "filler" film. The story that's told is actually about a guy who is on the run from a gang of kids. He is the "bad guy", they want to kill him and the movie goes out of its way to show him running from a group of kids who are just doing their thing. This is a film with a very high level of action and with great special effects and CGI. This film has a great script that actually has the kids actually saying things like "we're gonna put the bad guy on a truck" or "I'm gonna put him in the back of a car and drive him away". The movie also shows that there are two bad guys in this story. There is one who is the leader and he is very cool and cool to look at and he's the one who tells the kids to kill the bad guys. The other guy is the bad one and he looks just like the bad kid in the movie and is just as cool to watch. The movie never shows who the bad person really is and the one kid who's in this film never really gets any lines in this movie. The action scenes are pretty good but the film doesn't have a whole lot of them. It's a lot like a film you might watch with your friend and one day he might say to you "Hey, that movie sucked" and you might reply "No, I liked it" and then you both laugh and say "You did". I mean, who the hell does that? The action in this flick is very cheesy and you can tell that it was just done for the sake of doing it. I mean that is the only reason that this movie would have worked. You have a bunch of kids running around doing crazy stuff and they all look like they could have come from a different movie. I have seen a lot of kids films where the main character is a kid and they are running around and they look great. This movie actually has no one of those main characters. It has only one main kid and his name is Nick. He does all of the running and all of their fighting and all the stuff. So, if you ever watch a kids movie and it just
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________  "There is only one thing more important than a good story, and that is a good script. And the script for this movie is just about as bad as it gets. The director, Robert Altman, should be ashamed of himself." -Paul Revere, Jr., New York Times  In this movie, a young woman, Gloria (Marlon Brando), is trying to get by in a city filled with hustlers and criminals. She meets the handsome young cop, Frank Sinatra (Jack Lemmon), who she falls for but soon starts to resent. They meet a girl (Deborah Kerr) who is part of a gang of robbers. She is kidnapped, and Frank and Gloria are forced to work together. But Sinatra's father, who has been kidnapped by a rival gang, and Sinatra himself get caught up in a dangerous plan that threatens to destroy the family.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  (1) ___________________   #2: _____________ _____________________   I'm a big fan of the "Jaws" franchise and have been looking for a movie that would bring back the glory of this classic. The new movie is a big hit and it certainly has a "Jaw" feel to it. The director and cast seem to be having a great time working on the film and it is definitely one of the best "JAW" movies ever made. I can't say enough good things about this movie. The only problem is that it's not as good as "JASMINE" and I would love to see a new movie. I'll keep you posted.   My Rating: ___________________________ ______________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  When I saw that "Star Wars" prequels were going to be made, I was terrified. My only fear was that they would be bad. When I saw the trailers, I realized that the whole thing was made to sell toys and not to tell a story. I remember the opening crawl, the scenes where Jar Jar babbles on about his adventures. I knew I was going to hate the prequel. I didn't realize how awful it was until I actually saw it. It was all bad acting, bad music, bad special effects and bad writing. I hated all of it. I was so angry that they didn't do anything to redeem it. When the movie came out, I didn.t watch it at all. I thought the special effects were too realistic. I don't know what they were trying to do with the prequel except make it look as if it was done by some other studio. I saw it and I hated it.

But that is a story for another time and another place."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!!! What a piece of shit!!! I was expecting this to be a mediocre movie but it was anything but. First off the actors are all in their early 20's and look like they have the same acting skills as my parents when they were in their 20's. I did not find any of them attractive at all. The only good thing about the movie is that it has great special effects, like a very cool underwater scene and a good action scene. The problem with this movie is the story line. The main character, a former military man who now works for the government, goes to a restaurant with his wife and his best friend to watch a movie. The wife gets sick and dies and they find out that she was the main target of an assassination attempt. The film then jumps to the next movie that was supposed to be shown but the owner of the theater had the wrong ticket. The owner of this theater then says that there is a bomb threat at the theater and he will not let the movie be shown. The police come in and take everyone out of the movie. When they are leaving the police officers are in a hurry because there is some kind of attack on the theater. When the police are leaving they see a man on a motorcycle, they think it is a terrorist and kill him. The next scene shows a car bombing in downtown London, the movie goes on for another hour about this terrorist attack. The movie then jumps back to the restaurant and the police is there to take everyone away. The husband and wife are taken away to the police station and the wife is killed by the bomb. The story line is so stupid that it is hard to believe that someone could make a movie like this. The ending is just stupid as well. If you really want to be scared in a movie, then watch a film like "Escape from New York" by Steven Spielberg. The best thing about this movie was the special effects but the story is terrible. If I had watched this movie I would have turned the television off because I could not take it anymore.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: greatfilm-uk
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ Do you remember that one movie I mentioned before, where I thought the main character was an idiot, but the movie ended up being one of my favorites, because the story was a bit too clever and the acting was great? Yeah, I'm talking about The Room. Now I've been to many movies and seen them all, but I've never seen the movie until today. When I first heard about the movie, I didn't think much of it, and I still don't, but then I finally watched the movie. The movie started out pretty great, and then it went downhill fast, but what a downhill fast it was. The acting was really poor, but it didn't matter, because it was just a bunch of dumb people who were acting dumb. The characters didn't even have much of a story to them, and the only thing they had going for them was the fact that they all were stupid. It's the same thing with every movie I've seen, where the characters are dumb, and no matter how dumb they act, they're still all trying to be funny. This movie made me think, 'This is how stupid the people are'. But then when the ending came and the characters got out of jail, and it showed that none of them had a good ending, I was shocked. But then I remembered the movie I watched last year, and that's how I felt. This is a good movie, but not a good one, and you should not watch it. I mean, if you're stupid enough to watch it, then you deserve to have a bad ending, and this movie had one of the worst endings I've ever seen in my life. I could say that the ending was stupid, but that's not the only reason it sucked. I'll tell you why it sucked, and what made it even more annoying, because I hate this movie and I can't stand it, so I'll let you in on what really went on in this movie. In the beginning, there was a girl who had been in a car accident, and she ended up in a coma. When she woke up, she had a lot of questions, and asked her father what happened to her, and how she ended in the coma. His answer was that her friend was killed in a robbery, and he had to kill someone to save her life. The girl asked why he had done it, because she had never seen him like that, but he just replied
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I never thought I'd say this, but I'm a fan of the original Star Wars. I was a huge fan of it when I was young and a little older. The original movie was one of the best movies of the 80's. The special effects were amazing and the characters were amazing. But, it's hard to get into the first movie when you are a kid. It's just so hard to believe in. When the sequel came out, it was just plain terrible. It felt like they did the remake because they needed a quick cash cow. The acting was awful, the plot was dumb, and the special effects looked like they were done in a 3D movie. They got rid of the droids and the magic was gone. The only redeeming factor is that the special effect guy who did the special droids was awesome. So, if you don't mind getting a little bit older, go and see the original. It may take you awhile to get used to the characters, but it's worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's so fucking hard to review a bad film.  In fact, it's hard to write anything about a movie at all.    I don't think I've ever actually sat down and watched a bad motion picture.  So, I have a lot of trouble.  I hate to admit this, but there is nothing that I dislike about this movie.  It's funny.  There are no bad acting performances, and you don't really care about anything.  This movie doesn't really take itself seriously.  You know, it doesn't make you think about anything, or have any kind of theme.  The plot isn't too bad either, and it doesn not feel out of place.  They didn't do much to make this movie look like a movie, but I think they did a decent job at it.  If you are looking for a film with no plot or a story that doesn't feel like it belongs in a movie theater, then I highly recommend this movie for you.  Just don't expect a great movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________  This movie was crap. The actors were bad and the acting was really bad. It was really hard to follow the plot. I think it was just supposed to be a horror movie. I am not sure what this movie is about. It felt like it was all done in the first 10 minutes or so. It just felt like a cheap horror movie for the first 5 minutes. The only thing that was good about this movie was the music. I really like it. It is really creepy. I would not watch this movie again. The ending was really stupid. I did not like that it ended that way. The first 10 mins of this movie were pretty funny. I had a blast watching this movie.  - - - -
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ What a movie this was. A bunch of crazy people trying to take over the world, but never succeeding. The plot is weak and doesn't move the plot forward. The ending was pretty much just an excuse for some of the craziest shit to ever come out of this movie. The characters are also extremely lame and the one redeeming character is a psychopath that we barely even get to see. The acting was just a bunch of losers trying to act like they were important and get away with some bullshit.  Grim Misadventure #5:  A man is killed by a monster. The police find a mysterious letter that says that the monster was the man's friend. The friend is said to have killed a man in his sleep and left him to die. The next day the friend shows up and kills another man. The killer says that he killed both men because he didn't like them. The man who died has a name, and it is The Black Knight. The monster is called The Red Knight. ...  I can't think of anything else to say about this movie because I have already covered it all.  I am going to give it a 0. I feel that it is the weakest Grim Fandango ever.  a 0  Advertisements

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ The movie "The Bad Guys" is a typical "horror" movie. It is not a horror movie, but a film that gives a sense of terror to the audience. It starts with a scene of a man who is trying to escape from the monsters. When the man reaches the door of the house, he meets a woman. The woman then opens the door and they start to fight. After a while, the man starts to die and the woman takes his place. She begins to attack the house and soon, it is destroyed. The movie then shows a scene where the woman is standing over the dead body of the man. She says: "If you don't have anything to live for, why are you trying to live?". The movie ends with a shot of a car with a woman standing on the top of the car. She is still alive. It was the most horrible movie I have ever seen. It shows that the people are scared by this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Bad Batch is a good movie, a bad film. The Bad Bunch is a film about a gang of guys who have no respect for authority and will do anything for a few bucks. The main character, Billy (Burt Reynolds), is a loser who is looking for a little fun. The gang (the "Boys") are out to get him, and Billy's girlfriend, Mary (Natalie Wood), is one of them. Billy and Mary, the only two who know each other, fall in love. Things are going great until they get into a fight. It's a fist fight, but it doesn't end well for the boys. The fight turns into a brawl. It ends when Mary is seriously injured, and the boys go back to the hideout. They find some drugs and a few guns. There is some sex, but no love. Billy decides to run off and get his money. He doesn't know where he is going to go, but one day he gets into a car accident and wakes up in a hospital. He is given a choice. He can get well, or he can go to prison. He chooses prison, and we see him grow and change. He becomes a man. The story of The Bad News Bunch continues. The original trilogy was a good film, but The Bad news Bunch isn't nearly as good. The bad guys are the same. The girls are the only ones who have any sense. And the film just doesn't have enough good guys to save the film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ರೃ  My rating: 4/10  "If you're going to be in the industry, you're gonna need to learn how to play it safe."  I've seen a lot of bad movies. Some are just bad, and some are just so bad that they make you wish the whole movie was a bad joke. But this one takes the cake. The movie is basically a bunch of guys in a restaurant. A guy named Jack, who's about to get a promotion, is talking to a girl named Jenny. They're going back and forth. She's being nice. But she doesn't know that Jack is about to start a lawsuit against her. The lawsuit has nothing to do with him, and he can't talk about it with her, but he needs her money. She wants to give him a lift home, but Jack can't leave without getting her a drink. So he takes her to a bar and asks her to get him a drink there. She tells him she can't because she has a meeting. The guys at the bar start giving Jack shit, saying he should have paid for the drink. They think he's just being greedy and they don't believe him. So they start making fun of him. But then they all get laid and it turns out the guys didn't want to make fun of Jack, but they're going after Jenny. Jack tries to get her to go back home. But Jenny doesn't want him to be her date. She thinks he's being a jerk. So she takes him to her house. He's still mad at the guys and he's starting to get more and more violent. But when she comes out of the bathroom, she has an idea. She gets a gun and tries to kill Jack. But that's when he runs into some other guys and they help him. She goes back to the bar and they all laugh at Jack. They call him a slut and they say they'd do anything to have sex with her. She leaves with the guys, and Jack is really upset. But he doesn't leave because he wants to go after her. He goes to her apartment, and they're all there waiting for her. Jenny starts crying and Jack wants to hug her, and she won't let him. He gets a pistol and goes after her again. When she comes outside, the guys start shooting at her, saying they want her dead. But Jack can
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. The movie is good, but it lacks the heart that I feel that this is supposed to have. I don't like it because it is very predictable and boring. The story of this movie is about a guy who goes to a place that is supposedly haunted, but when he arrives, it turns out that there are no ghosts at all. The film then follows a group of kids that get into trouble. The only thing that I liked about this movie was that it was short, which is why I am giving it a 4 instead of a 5.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ "It's very hard to say what the film's greatest fault is. If anything, the film is a failure as a whole. The acting is atrocious. The pacing is so slow that it seems as if the film was designed to be a series of commercials. The cinematography is so ugly that I am tempted to call it a disaster. The film is just so forgettable and I just can't get into it." - Michael C. Hall I would give this movie a rating of 4.75 out of 5 if it weren't for the acting. And I think that's why I found it to be so disappointing. The main actor's acting was so bad that it's almost as if he wasn't in the film at all. In fact, this movie is so bad, that I doubt the actor would have been able to keep his head above water. If you're in a hurry, I recommend you skip this movie. There is no point to watching it, because the acting and direction don't match. However, if you're really bored, this is a pretty entertaining movie to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!   - I had a bad feeling about this movie and when I saw it, I said to myself, this will be the worst movie I have ever seen.   This movie starts out with a guy going to the hospital to have a heart attack. His wife, who is an OB/GYN, comes to visit him. She comes to get him because he was having chest pains and she didn't want him to be scared. He had a really bad reaction to the medications that the doctors gave him. He gets out of bed, runs out of the house and jumps on the bus. On the bus, he calls for help. There is a woman with a baby on a bike and the driver sees her and says that she needs help. She gets on the bike and rides away. He continues to call for help but gets no answer.   a few minutes later he is in a field and there is a fire burning. The guy sees the fire and goes back to the house. When he gets there, he realizes that he is not alone. He sees a girl who looks like his wife. He asks her what is going on. She says that the fire is in the basement and she is trapped in there. He tells her that he has a heart condition and that she better get out of there. They ride off together.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  -The main character (Miles Dyson) is a big, stupid, arrogant jerk. -There is no "good guy" or "bad guy" in this movie, except the main character and his buddies, who are portrayed as dumb, stupid and arrogant. -The main characters never learn any lesson from their mistake. They never do anything to fix the situation.  The movie is just one big mess, with the characters always making the same mistakes.   In Conclusion:    The main character is a real "hero", as is shown in the trailer, but in reality he is a complete loser.  This movie has nothing to do with film noir, as this genre is so dead nowadays.  The movie was written by David Lynch, and directed by David Fincher.  There is no plot or theme, just bad writing and bad acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________ The film begins with a couple, Michael and Susan (I never found them attractive and were not the characters they should have been. I'm not a fan of the music either), as a family sitting down to dinner. They are having some trouble finding a decent restaurant in their town and Susan is having a hard time making dinner on time. After dinner, Michael is having some issues at work, so he decides to go out and get some food. After the night he is having, he decides that he needs to go home. After getting there, he meets Susan, and he asks her out. She doesn't say yes right away, but she says yes later that night. The next day, Susan and Michael are having lunch together and she asks him to the prom with her. The night before the prom, Michael tells her that he is going to get some money from the boss, and they go out for the night. Michael and the boss have a big fight and when he gets home, he goes to Susan's room to apologize for the fight. He is told that he has to go to the school dance. He doesn't go. At the school, he tells the teacher that he wants to go, but they tell him that he doesn't need to go. Michael doesn't understand and the teacher tells him that they are going to have a dance at the dance hall and he has the choice of going with them or going to the dance with the school principal. He goes with them. The following day, he gets in trouble at school because he didn't want to go with the teacher to the party. Michael finds himself in trouble with the principal, so they lock him in the closet. On his way home, Michael runs into his mother who tells him about the party that she is going too. The school dance happens and he goes with the teachers and the principal to the parties. Michael sees Susan dancing and is very jealous. At one point, the principal tells Susan that he will be her date to the big dance. Michael tells the principal that he won't go with him. He also tells Susan she is stupid and that she will go to hell if she goes with him, so she will never see him again. The principal says, "What would you have me do, son?" Michael says, "(Answer) Nothing." Then he says, "...That's it, that's the last straw." At the dance, Michael sees that the principal is not there.

It was so well done that I actually laughed out loud during the first third of the movie. There were many, many, so many good jokes that I laughed out loudly. The movie was also really good at keeping me entertained. I liked the comedy, the action, and the plot. The only thing that annoyed me was the ending. It's pretty bad, and it really shouldn't have been a surprise. I also found it pretty annoying that they decided to end the movie on such a lame note. I loved the movie and I loved how it ended, but I wish that it had gone on and on. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie again, and I am glad I saw it. It really was a fun, funny, action-packed movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ Don't make a movie about a woman with a heart of gold, this is a terrible film with no plot and no emotion. The story is about a guy who is trying to get to know a woman who is the daughter of an ex-Nazi who is hiding out in an abandoned building. This is the most stereotypical woman in a bad film I have ever seen. She has blonde hair, big eyes, long legs and a great figure. The whole film is based on this girl who is all around beautiful and very attractive but has no personality and has no motivation. She just wants to be a good girl. The guy tries to help her with some information but it seems she is very insecure and doesn't really want to be with him. He tries to convince her but it is hard because of her bad attitude. He is just trying to be nice to her but she just doesn't like him. After the guy finally helps her with the information she is so embarrassed she wants to run away but she is too scared to go. The movie is all about how hard it is for this girl to meet a nice guy. She always has to hide her feelings and keep her cool, but it doesn't work with this guy who doesn't have any bad qualities and is always smiling. This guy seems to be the only man in this movie who is really interested in this girl. She is the only one he talks to and she just seems so unhappy and wants to leave him. The only thing that is good about this movie is that it has a good soundtrack and the camera work. I think it could have been a lot better if they didn't have this woman. __________________  "Life is not like a picture; you see, life is like a book, and every page must be read.

It was directed by John Carpenter and written by John A. DeCecco. The movie was a horror film but it was more like a horror comedy. It did not have much of a plot and was more about the characters than the plot. The story was not as good as I was hoping for, but it did not feel bad at all. The only thing that was very strange was the idea of the movie. The film started off really great and then it got a little weird. I was not a big fan of this movie. I really did not think that I would like it. However, I did and still do. This is a very good movie that I do recommend.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ A couple of years ago I saw this movie for the first time. It was called The Human Centipede and it had a killer scene that was a good example of the type of horror I like to watch. It had a lot of cool effects and the director and star had great chemistry, and it was a horror movie for adults. The main character was an engineer who gets infected by a centipede that lives inside of him. The movie was good, but there were a lot more great effects than the human centipedes. There was an interesting scene where a couple was making love, but they were in a very uncomfortable position, and the camera kept moving back and forth so you couldn't see what was going on. I think the scene could have been better edited. But the effects and atmosphere of the movie were great. The ending was a little odd. The human centipeede was crawling on top of a centipedee. I don't know why this was done, but it was really creepy. The centipedees are not the only thing that is scary. The way they move around and walk around you is very cool. The final scene is a very cool shot of a naked woman walking through the woods. It's very cool to see a naked body in this way, and I liked the idea that this woman is being stalked by something. I would love to see more of this movie. It is a great movie for a horror fan.  Was this review helpful to you? [ Report Abuse ]  Pick Up! Fantastic! (9/11/2011) By: Ramiro_R | Review Date: August 11, 2011 I really enjoyed this movie, and there is a reason it's called a horror film. It has it all, and is a little bit different from your usual horror. The plot was pretty good, and even though the main character dies and the film doesn't have a happy ending, it's still pretty good. The film has a great soundtrack, and some very good gore effects. I only wish it had an ending. There were a couple of parts where the movie was just getting better and better, and then there would be a cut to the credits. I felt that the whole movie could have ended with the main characters dead and the ending. - Rating: 10/10 - Great movie. - Rating: 8/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________   The worst part is that we've been so used to the horrible stuff that Hollywood produces that we no longer notice. The worst part about this movie is that it's so bad it's not funny.   You know what the worst part of this movie was? It wasn't the horrible acting, the terrible plot, or the awful acting that got me to watch the film. It was the fact that this movie has no sense of humor whatsoever. This movie had to be a parody of all the movies that we are used to seeing, yet they decided to go with a parody. They thought it would be funny to make the guy in the red shirt look like a cartoon character, and he does it in a way that is so ridiculous and over the top that I could not believe what I was watching. It is so bad that I was hoping for the worst, and when I found it I was like "Oh God, that guy is so terrible." It is truly a terrible movie, and it is truly not funny at all.   the acting in this movie sucks, it's obvious that the actors don't care, it is so obvious that they don't have any idea how to act. This was so obvious and I could hardly believe that I had seen a movie like this. I would have never believed it if I hadn't seen it myself. I had to see it again just to be sure that it was not a bad spoof. I am sure that this will be one of those movies that I watch when I am in the mood for something completely horrible. It might be a good movie to watch when you are trying to pass out. It doesn't even have a real plot, just a stupid joke. It's a bad joke.   on a side note, the movie is not even funny. This is not a movie that is supposed to be funny, it just seems like it was made in a hurry and then had to find a way to make money.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Crazy," "Grave," "Rigid" -- the worst movies ever made about the history of the Holocaust, a genre that is so reprehensible that it's no surprise that people who make movies about the Holocaust are generally reprehensible themselves. In any case, I was not a fan of this movie and I can't say that I am any more of a fan now. It's not bad, but the script is terrible and the acting is terrible. I can see why it made money at the box office, but I can only say that my heart goes out to the families of the people who were killed. The movie makes a pretentious claim to tell the story of the "Hiroshima bombing," but it has nothing to do with that. It is a movie about the "Holocaust," as it's been called. But it is not about the Jews. It makes a big show of "the Holocaust," which is what it is all about. There are very few movies about "the Jewish people" in any way that aren't anti-Semitic. This is a classic example of how Jews and anti-Semites go together. They can never be separated, as I found out the hard way. This movie is just a collection of lies and stereotypes. It has nothing at all to do to any real story about the war or the war crimes of the Nazis. It isn't a good movie, but it is at least a film that can be enjoyed by people who want to watch some Hollywood crap. It can be bought on DVD for a few dollars at a local video store. It doesn't do much for the Holocaust museum, but that's just the way Hollywood does it. It may even be a better movie than the movies that are actually about the holocaust. Posted by John at 2:24 AM

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________  This movie is really bad. It is really hard to watch and I could not even finish it. The film is so bad that it really is difficult to explain why it is so hard to enjoy. The plot is really stupid and the characters are really stupid. I guess the director thought it was a good idea to have a lot of stupid people in the movie. I did not like any of the people in this movie, and the only one I could like was the crazy man. I really cannot understand why the director did not choose someone more famous, because the other people are so stupid and not funny at all. They are all so stupid that you can't even enjoy them. The only thing that I did like about this movie was the way the actor played the crazy guy, but he is so stupid he is not even funny. I think this is the only movie where the actors in it actually were able to get their lines. The rest of the actors are just there for the crazy part of the movie and the actors that play the crazy people are pretty dumb too. The worst part about this stupid movie is that the director has no idea what he is doing. There is so much wrong with the movie, it is almost impossible to understand what is going on. It really just seems to be a bunch of random people talking to each other. The movie is so awful that it is hard to even get a good laugh out of it. I would never watch this movie and I do not recommend watching it. It makes me sick to think of how the director of this movie even thought this was a movie. It just seems so stupid to me. I hate this movie. If you want to watch this stupid thing, please go and see a different movie.

Jennifer Lawrence was the best actress in the movie, but the movie lacked the charisma of the rest of the cast. They just weren't there. The movie was overstuffed with characters that weren't really needed. They all seemed to be in the same movie, and that's why they were there. If you want to see a movie with Jennifer Lawrence, look elsewhere. This is a great movie for her, but not a good movie for the rest. The only thing I liked about this film was the fact that it showed how a wedding could go wrong. ________________________________________________  Was this review helpful to you? [ Report Abuse ]  Pick Up! This movie has a lot of potential to be good  A beautiful story about a young woman who decides to stay with a friend she meets on a train. The girl is being stalked by her ex-boyfriend, but when he finds out, he comes after her as well. The couple then moves into a new house and start to adjust to their new life.   The story is good, with a nice romance and interesting characters. The acting is great, especially for Ben Afflecks character.   and the acting is the reason why I like this movie  However the plot is not that good.   a few interesting things are the fact they live in a new city and they have to work a job while they're looking for a house, but it's not that well thought out.  , the movie is a good one but it needs more character development and a better plot.  If you like a good story and a good romantic movie then you should try this movie, otherwise don't bother  This movie has some good things but the plot isn't good. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________  I'm not one for negative reviews but this movie has a LOT of problems. The acting is terrible. Everyone in this movie seems to have no talent. I mean no talent in acting. The only one who did have talent was the girl who was in the movie but she was only there for a few scenes. The girl had a very hard time making any sort of sense in the scene she was in. She was also really uncomfortable in the scenes she was with the guy. She also was so bad at her lines. She did a couple of them really badly. I thought that they should have just let her leave the movie. There was a really bad scene where the girl was trying to get the guy to let her go home with him. The guy just gave her this cold look and said "I don't want to go home alone." And then he made her stay. It's kind of sad that a movie has to make a movie like this. I would have just had to put it down and stop watching it.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: garyn_gibbs

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Bad: _______ ___________   This movie sucks because the script sucks. It is full of clichés and a poorly acted movie. There are so many things that could have been done better but they were not. The acting is awful. I know this is supposed to be a horror movie but it is a lot of boring people trying to get by. The main character has no idea what is going on and when he realizes it, he is so dumbfounded that he can't act for a while. The other characters are so one-dimensional and dumb that they are there for no reason other than to be in the movie. The story was boring and there is no twist at the end. It was just a mess. _______________ Bad: ______ ____________   The only redeeming quality is that the movie is not awful. This movie was a lot worse in my opinion than the trailer. _________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ The most amazing thing about this movie is the fact that it's a remake of a movie that was made in 1939, and it has the same actors as that one. The plot of the movie is that a little boy (played by James Stewart) is having trouble believing in the supernatural, but is then visited by a beautiful woman (played with a beautiful smile by Jean Simmons) who tells him that his troubles are over, and that he is to go to the local museum to have a "spiritual experience". The film is a very simple story, but it has a very strange and disturbing ending. The ending is that the boy has an out of body experience in the museum, and then he wakes up in his bed in the morning, just like the person in the movie he was watching. The film was never really popular in the United States, but its influence is felt in every movie made after it. The most frightening part of this film is the music in it. It's haunting and terrifying, and when the music comes on the screen, it's just so very creepy and very disturbing. The actors in this movie were great, and their performances are still very good. The director of this movie was Howard Hawks, and he was a master of horror. The movie was also very well produced, and very beautiful. This movie has one of the most frightening endings ever. _________ I give this movie an 8 out of 10. I will give this a 9 because of the ending, but I give it a 10 because of how great this movie really is. The soundtrack is haunting and chilling, and the movie has great acting and a very disturbing ending!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ "It was a beautiful day in the park. It was a hot summer day in Central Park, a perfect day to get some sun. My parents were there, and my younger sister, my sister's boyfriend and I decided to go on a walk. It wasn't long before I noticed a man dressed in a green raincoat walking toward me. He was very tall, and had a thick raincoat on. He had a small mustache, and a big beard. He wasn't looking my way, but I noticed that he kept glancing over at my mother. It seemed like he was trying to see if she was coming out. He stopped in front of me and stood in front me, and then he said, 'Are you alone?' I said, "Yes, I'm alone." He said, "'I'm going to take you to a very nice park. I've been there before and it's really beautiful. You'll like it.' I was very happy, but he never let me go. He said to me, 'We are going to the Upper West Side of Manhattan.' I said 'Yes, of course. I'm on my way.' "It wasn't very long before he took me to a dark room. He brought me out on the couch and he said to my mother, 'I'm just going to give you a few minutes. I think I know what we're going to do to you.' He gave her a look like he wanted to kill her, but she said nothing. Then he got on top of her. He put a pillow under her head and he put a strap on her and he did it for what seemed like a long time. He just kept rubbing her head. He didn't make a sound. Finally he let her go. Then I felt my mother's head get hit. He then picked me up and he pushed me down on to the floor. He took off his jacket and started to undress me. I remember his hands on my breasts. He started to take off my pants. He kept telling me to be quiet, that it was a nice park, and that we were going to see a wonderful movie. I was too scared to make a noise. I could hear him talking and I knew he was touching me. Then, without warning, he grabbed me by my hair and put it in a ponytail. He told me to get up and to stand in front. He grabbed a book from his bag and

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________  The reason that the film had to be a remake is that it was originally made in 1932 by a guy named Harold Lloyd. In 1932, Lloyd was a young man of 17 who got his start in the movies as a "star" in his first big movie. The film was called "Mystery Train" and was about a man who had just gone missing. The story was based on a real-life mystery about a woman who had been kidnapped in New York City and never seen again. The movie was a smash success, making $20 million. Lloyd was then a huge star and went on to star in many other big movie like "I, Claudius" and "A Face in the Crowd."  He made another hit in the 1950's with a film called "Hollywood Palace." This film was about an elderly actress and was based off a real story about a movie producer. The actress was very successful and was a huge name in the business. In this movie, she falls in love with a director and ends up giving up her career in the film industry to marry him. She then goes on to be very successful in other movies.  In 1953, Lloyd made a movie called "A Ghost Story" which starred an actor named Cary Grant. This was a film about a young actor named Charles Foster Kane who is trying to make it in the big city in New Yorks. He gets an offer to be in a play in which his character has a lot of romantic problems. , this was an early 1950's romantic comedy starring a guy who had a love affair with a woman named Lizzie Borden. The love story was a spoof on the popular novel of the same name. Lizzy was a poor housewife who was married to a wealthy man and they had a lot in common. The two eventually end up living together. Lizzy was very naive and not very bright. In the film, Lizz did a lot for the man. She became his mistress, and they even had a son together. The play was so successful that it became a hit in Broadway and was adapted into a movie.    After this, Harold Lloyd would go on to make many more movies including "The Longest Day," "The Great Escape," "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," and "Casablanca."   So why did Harold Lloyd decide to remake this movie? It had become very popular in the 80
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not a good movie.  There's nothing wrong with the movie.   It's not bad.       I really enjoyed the movie and I think it was a good idea to do a horror movie where the characters are monsters.      But it's not scary.    It's just not scary and it was just a bad idea to make a movie where all the characters look like monsters and the monsters are monsters, because that's what they are.           It's a remake of a horror film that was in the late 70s called Monster Mash.                                                    So the movie is about a group of friends who are going to a party and they are going crazy.    It was based on a book called Monster by David Cronenberg.  It's just a remake.  There are no monsters in this movie. The music in this is terrible.  It's pretty bad and I couldn't believe that it was supposed to be a horror flick.                                         The acting is all over the place.  Most of the actors are not very good at playing the parts and most of them look like they are in a horror-movie.  This is just a crappy remake of the 1970s film Monster Mash, and it's based on the book by David C. Cronenberg about the 1970's monster craze that happened.  The acting and directing were terrible. A horrible remake of Monster Mash There's no way that this movie is scary.   There are a few monsters, but they are not scary at all.  They look like zombies.  And the monsters all look like this. I really liked the character of this movie, but I really disliked the movie, and I really didn't like the movie's director, so I really can't recommend this movie to anyone.  If you like horror films, don't watch this movie; but if you don't like horror movies, don your mask and go see this movie and you'll see that this is a very good movie, I swear to god.

He was a handsome man."  - The Daily News.  ___________________________________________ ___________________________________________________ ___________________  This movie was made in the 60's and is very much a piece of nostalgia. It's really only about the movie star, and nothing else. The other two actors have a few lines but they are not very funny. It is very old and not really that funny. The movie starts with a scene from a movie called "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" where a little girl and her brother go to see their father. They are looking for a "Mr Deeds" (the man who runs the store) and his wife. When they go to the house they are in, they see Mr. Dees husband sitting at a table with a cigar and a glass of whisky and his mistress. They see Mr and Mrs Dees house is in disrepair and their mother's is in poor condition. Mr Dees wife is sitting on the couch and drinking a glass. The little girl gets up to go to her room, but her brother comes running up and tells her that they are there and Mr Deeds wife and mistress are there.

This film is an action movie, a story of a space ship being stalked by the Alien, and the crew on board being killed one by one. The Alien, also known as the Xenomorph, is an alien species that takes the shape of a large creature. It is a very interesting and interesting idea. The creature looks like it can move and it has a very strong personality, but it is only on screen for about fifteen minutes before it is killed off. It's very well done, very interesting, and very suspenseful. The film is set in space and the story follows the crew of the Nostromo on their journey to the planet LV-426. This is a long film and a really well thought out one. It really is worth seeing. The Nostromos are a very small crew of people and they travel with the Nostramo in a small ship called the Covenant. The Covenant is a large ship that has the same basic design as the Nostroam, but there is some difference. This crew has a different group of people that they are travelling with. The movie opens with the Alien walking across a beach and then it slowly walks across the surface of the planet

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is weak and the characters are dull. It's a terrible movie that was made in the 80s. The movie was about a little boy named Jack who is on his way to the train station when he is confronted by a giant, angry dragon. He gets eaten and finds himself on a deserted island and is trapped by the dragon. After a while the dragon starts to grow bigger and stronger, but the boy tries to escape and finds the island to be inhabited by a group of other little boys and an old man named Mr. White. The old man is a scientist and he is trying to make a new kind of fish that can help him with his experiments. Jack tries to help the others and he ends up fighting the dragon by himself. In the end, Jack manages to escape. The ending of the movie is bad and the movie just ends without any resolution. The dragon doesn't have any effect on the boy, and we never find out who was the one who was eating the little boy. The end of the story is just a waste of time. There is also no ending credits. The only thing I like about the movie are the little songs in the background, like "You'll Never Walk Alone" and "In a Lonely Place".

The ending was very good but it left me wondering how it would end. I hope that it ends very bad, and then they shoot the zombies and then the zombies die, and you go to the credits and it says "you were not there, so we do not know what happens next". __________. The worst thing about the movie is how they ruined the ending. ______________________. It is one of the best horror movies ever made. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It does not need a rating. I did not think that the film was very interesting. The plot is just a stupid joke. This movie is about a guy in a bad suit who is shooting people in the movies. What a joke. ______________________________. This is the first movie I watched after watching "The Exorcist". I have been to a lot of movies. I have watched most of the great horror films. The only movie that I have seen that I would like to watch again is "The Amityville Horror". _________________________. This was a really good movie. I loved it. ________________________________________. This film is one to watch when you are bored. It had a great cast, great effects, and great music. The music was amazing. The special effects were very good and were the only reason that the movie was not terrible, or worse. The movie does not have any real good acting. All the actors were good, but they did not make the best performance. ____________________________________________________________________________________. This has been a movie that you should see. It has the best effects ever. This really is a great movie. The best thing about it is that it is a horror film, and if you think you have seen all of the horror films then this is the movie that will make you think

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a bad review to say "It was a little boring," but I will say that, if it were my life, I would not go to a film festival and watch a film. You have to work your way up and you have to be prepared for your time in the spotlight to be brief.  I think that, when you see a movie, you have a right to feel and be in a state of awe and wonder. You also have a responsibility to remember that what you are watching and what you're hearing are the opinions of some of the most influential people on the planet, and that you should try to understand what they have to say and that, by all means, you should be willing to challenge their views.  The film itself, "The House With a Clock in Its Walls," by Robert Wiene, is a story about a man, who is being haunted by his past, his wife, and his wife's dead child, and he is haunted by their ghosts. , as a filmmaker, has a responsibility in all that he does. It is not his job to try and make people feel bad, or to make them angry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ ___________. This is a bad film. I watched it at my brother's house last night and he gave me a copy for my birthday. I have never seen a bad picture from a movie so bad that it made me angry and disgusted. This movie has no heart. It is so bad. I cannot believe that a movie like this was made. It has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting is terrible. The way the characters talk is not good. The story is not interesting. There is nothing to say about this movie. It doesn't even make sense. I'm going to give it 2 stars because it is still a movie. I didn't like the acting. I couldn't stand the way the main character is portrayed. It was awful. The director tried to make it look good and they did it. But it's just awful.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - I was really disappointed.   It was just another generic "romance" that lacked emotion and was really boring.  -  I thought it was lame and stupid.  The main character was just a jerk and didn't really change much.  He was a stereotypical guy that always wanted to get with the girls but had no life.  They just went through the motions to make it look good.  I have seen other romance/comedy movies that are way better.  A lot of people love this movie. I think it was a really boring movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  This movie was bad, but it was also hilarious and made me laugh out loud a lot of the time. I love that this movie was a comedy. I also love that it was a horror movie, and the fact that it had a lot more blood and gore than most horror movies, but that doesn't mean that it wasn't fun to watch. I do wish that this was made in a way where there were no bloody deaths. It was too easy to see a person get killed and the whole time the camera was looking for a bloody body. The acting was really good and they all seemed like they had a good time doing the movie. It also had a very well written script. It didn't take a lot to make the movie good, but the story just needed to be a little better. It could have been so much better if the director hadn't just cut out so much of the story. I liked the movie a lot, but I also really liked it for how silly it was. The only thing that really bothered me was the ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ "You will like this film if you like the first one. This is a fun film to watch, a lot of fun. It has a great plot, but the characters are all pretty bland and one dimensional. They don't even develop any characters other than the guy and the woman. The main female character is so dull, so she is never really a character. The guy is the only one who has any kind of character and the plot is just to try and make him look bad. The rest of the characters just act like they are there to be funny. The acting was good, but they should have done more with the characters. The film has a very unique plot and I am looking forward to the next one." - Michael R.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  "In the mid-70s, a bunch of young people in a small California town discover that they can travel in time. Now they must stop a crazed madman and his gang from taking over the world. This was the first film I saw that had a plot that I couldn't get out of my head. I can't think of a single film that made me so angry that I had to stop watching it. This movie is a total ripoff of the old Time Bandits. The main character is a psychopath. He has to murder everyone in his way. This is a movie that is full of sex and drugs and violence and violence."   "One of the worst movies ever made! It's like someone made a copy of a copy and threw it into the ocean."   theres a reason why the people at the local college called it "Beware of the Beast"  i dont think they will make a sequel to this movie and if they do then they will just make the plot and characters exactly the same.  the only difference between this and the original was that it got released in 1977. that alone made it a complete piece of shit. and this movie is just a ripoff on the old TIME BANDITS. you would think that the writers of this film would have a better idea of what time travel is like.   i give this movie a 1 out of 10. if youre going to watch a movie and then come to the conclusion that it was better than the original then you need to get your head checked.    review updated:  3/9/02 - I watched this movie again after it had been released. it was still a complete waste of time and I found it to be pretty bad. this movie was the most boring thing i have ever seen. theres only so much that you can do with a person who is a violent maniac and a complete psychopath.  "BEWARE OF THE BEAST" - The film itself is full on B-movie garbage. the only thing that kept this film from a 1.5 is that it has the original TIME BIRDS in it, which is a big plus for me. but still, it is a complete ripoff.

The writing was terrible. It makes no sense at all. I thought the movie would be a good horror movie because the acting was so good. It was so sad and so horrible.

The main character is a pretty smart guy and he does a great job of figuring out how he is going to escape from the government agents who are after him and it is a very exciting idea but he never goes through with it. This leads to the film not being very interesting. I did enjoy the ending of the movie and it did feel very true to the book but it wasn't that great of a movie. It is a good movie but if you are not looking for a great thriller this is not the movie for you.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ This is a movie that was intended to be a horror flick. But instead of being a horror movie, this is a bad horror movie. The only thing that is scary about this movie is the acting of the two main characters, who are supposed to be the ones with the most guts. One of the main characters in this movie, is a young boy who has to deal with the nightmares of his mother, who died of a brain aneurysm. I'm not sure if this is the first time a horror film was supposed to have a dream-like plot but this movie did not have any real scares. The first half of the movie has very little plot and is just an attempt to scare you with a scary story. The plot seems to be going on for no reason at all, but just to make you go, "What the heck is going on?" This is only part of the problem with this movie. There is very little gore in this and the movie does not really scare the hell out of you. The most scary part of this movie was the part where the boy went into the house to check on his mother. The next part of that movie had the best gore, but it wasn't even a scary part, it was just so over the top. I felt like this was the worst movie I've ever seen. It is so bad that even when you watch it, it is hard to watch. I can't recommend this movie to anyone because even if you have a fear of being scared, you will still be scared by this movie and will think, "Why is this movie so bad?" Don't watch this movie if you are scared of scary movies or if you're just afraid of clowns.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  "One-Eyed Jacks", a film about a man who has an accident and finds himself in the hospital, where he finds out his wife had been raped and murdered, is the kind of movie I never watch. The movie takes a very long time to get to the point. I am not sure why the director and screenwriter wanted to make a movie about a guy who was in a car accident. Maybe it was to sell tickets. The film was very slow and the characters had no depth to them. There was no emotion in the movie. There were no characters that you wanted to know more about.  The director of this movie, Michael Fassbender, was great in a movie like "12 Years a Slave", but I think he has a tendency to make movies that are very formulaic. He is a great actor, but in a lot of his movies he is trying too hard to be a James Bond or a Jack Ryan. He does not have the ability to take a film to another level.  "One-eyed Jacks" is a horrible movie. I would not recommend it to a person who wants to learn more about this subject.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  The film: The film was not all that bad. It was interesting, funny, had a good story and it got its point across. The problem was that the director didn't make the most of it. He kept on introducing a bunch of characters that he didn't want to spend time with and then suddenly they all died off in the very last few minutes. It is very hard to believe that there were so many characters in this movie. The movie was very well acted, the only problem was how fast they all disappeared from the screen. I have no idea how they managed to make it look so good. The sound was very good, but they just couldn't get any real music to go with the story. I found the acting very good. All the actors really brought their A-Game. The only one who did not was the lead actor. It wasn't the actor's fault that he was in a terrible movie but it really was too bad that he had to be the lead. I will definitely be watching the second film, because it seems like they tried really hard to make this movie into a very good one. I would recommend this movie for a serious movie fan.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________  "The whole idea of the film is so contrived. They use a lot of stock footage and make up some characters. When they actually have to do the scene they do it like it was a real movie, which it wasn't." -R. W. Stoddard, Hollywood Reporter, September 15, 1959  I am the most honest person I know, and I'm not afraid to say it. The way the film was made was a total waste of time. It was all done for the purpose of selling a film, but it was never a good film. It didn't even have any characters or storyline. I really hate the fact that it was called "The Last Boy Scout" because that implies that the film took place in the 1950's and this was a film about a boy scout. The film was a publicity stunt and not a movie. The people in the film were all actors. The only two people who were in the original script were killed during filming and the rest of the people were replaced by people. I am not a big fan of movies with too many actors, but this was such a waste of a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  I was not a fan of this movie, and even when I read the reviews that praised this movie I didn't find it all that funny or original. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I have watched many bad movies over the years, but I think I was the only person who didn't like this one. I was in the movie theater during a lunch break and the food was cold. I had a big sandwich and it was not hot, and I was hungry so I had to eat it. I don't remember how I got home, but the next day I didn not feel like eating much. The next day after dinner I had the same thing happen. The movie was bad, but it didn't make me sick. It was just really weird. It seemed like the movie was going for a very "horror" type of movie, but that's what I saw in it. It looked like they were shooting in a movie theater and the lighting was awful, and the screen was too dark, and there were a lot of bad special effects. I also don't think they were trying to scare me. They didn't use a lot to scare the audience. It just looked like some people were running around in a dark room, and some of them were shooting things that looked like guns. And it looked like one of the characters had a zombie-like appearance. It's not a very scary movie, unless you're a fan, but if you're not a horror fan this is not a good movie.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like this movie, you should have seen The Mask.  Rating: 1 out of 5 stars (just for the rating system). I think The Mask is a fine movie.  It is a dark comedy about a group of circus clowns that are the only thing keeping a small town from going down the drain.  They are the ones who keep the town from getting too desperate and just go along with whatever the clowns want.  In one scene they have a meeting to decide what to do.  The mayor comes in and says that the town will just have to deal with the clown and his friends.  All of the clown's friends are old.  And the clown is just too old.  All the clown are old and they have all of the money and are all going to retire and live out their golden years.  So the mayor says let's retire them and the town has to take care of them.  But the town is not too fond of clowns.  There is a huge rumor that the clown was killed by some monster.  When they first find the clown, they take him to the hospital.  After the clown gets out of the hospital he is on his way back home when he runs into the mayor.  At the hospital, the mayor tries to convince him that it was a monster.   Then the clown comes back with a gun.  He shoots the mayor and then takes off running.  But the clown can't catch him.    The next day the mayor finds a clown and a body.  His dead body has a note written on it.   It reads: "I just killed the clown!  No more clowns!"   The clown is very smart.  As the movie goes on it starts to look like this is a very good plan.  We see the clown in his house and he is doing a show for the town.  A guy named Tom (Curtis Johnson) is there and he says that he is an actor.  Tom is the one who killed the guy who was the clown.  Now, Tom is angry and thinks the town should just retire the clown because the town can't take care a clown. The movie doesn't have any gore but it does have some pretty bad acting.  One of the biggest issues was that all the clown actors were all old.   It is a bit funny but I don't think

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This is the most disgusting movie I've seen in a long time. It's so gross and disgusting that I don't even want to watch it anymore. It really is so gross that it's sickening to think about. There are some pretty bad scenes in this movie, but the best ones are when the kids are making out and one of the parents makes them laugh. They were pretty young at the time and they have been taught to be a lot nicer than they actually are, but this is how they act around their parents and it's really gross. I think this movie is one of those bad movie that just makes you feel sick to your stomach and you really want to just stop watching it and never watch anything like this again. This movie is just disgusting and disgusting and it makes you think that maybe the movie's makers did not have very good taste and didn't think it was appropriate for the kids.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________ I'm a big fan of the original trilogy, but the prequels just don't add up. The story line doesn't work. The characters are flat and boring. The plot is really hard to follow. The only reason I can still watch it is because it was in my mind for so long. When I saw the trailers for the sequel I felt it was too bad to be true. Well, I thought it was a bit too bad. The CGI was really bad. Some of the battles looked ridiculous. I could understand the idea of making the prequel a prequel, but why do they keep changing the name of the planet? They even changed the planet name. The effects of the effects look really cheap and ugly. There are some funny parts, but you need to look for them. I was expecting some action. It felt like a generic space opera. I didn't enjoy this movie. I hope that they make a new trilogy. It would have been better if they made a third one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!I am going to have to give this movie a 6 out of 10 because it is a great movie. If you don't think it is then you don,t watch this movie. The story line is really good, the story is about a guy who is being chased by the FBI to try and get some drugs off the street. He is in jail when he is released. The guys in prison who were with him were getting a lot of attention from the prison guard. He tells the guard he is being watched. He and a lot more people are being watched by the guard. Then the guy in jail who he is trying to get the drugs from tells him he can get it from a man named Mike who is a drug dealer. The guy is not good at drugs so he has to get to Mike's house and he is going to try to convince Mike to give him some drugs. Mike is really mad at the guy for going after him. The movie is good at making you want to see it. The characters are real people. The only bad thing about this movie is that the plot doesn't go very well. The bad guys do things they shouldn't do. If the plot didn't go that bad then this movie would have been great. But the movie could have been a lot better and I think it should have been longer.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ _______________________________ I just found out that this movie has been remade. I'm really disappointed that it is not in the top ten. ______________________________  Rated 4 out of 5 by daniell from Great for younger audiences I really liked this film. The kids are getting into some silly stuff and it was great to see them act it out. I think this film will be in the best ten movies I will watch this year. I thought it was really funny and entertaining. The story line was fun. ________  "What's in a name?" Well, one of the most popular films of all time has always been the one about an evil clown named Pennywise, who terrorizes an elementary school. This movie is a faithful remake of the book by Stephen King. The book is not only one of my favorite books, it is one of his best. It is a great story about a little boy named Georgie who has just moved from Connecticut to Derry, Maine. Georgie is not as nice and kind as his parents and grandparents. Georgio is a loner who spends his time reading and watching scary movies. When he sees a clown on the playground, he begins to fear for the life of his little sister, who is scared of clowns as well. He also fears the worst as he hears a clown laughing as if he were the monster himself. Georgi soon realizes he is the monster, and it will take the combined efforts of the Derry children and their parents to save him. I love this movie. It will make you laugh and cry. I was very disappointed to see that the film did not feature a musical number. ________________________________________ 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________  "The Big Chill" is a classic of horror movies. I never understood the movie until I was asked to review it. The director has a lot of good ideas, but he just goes for the most outrageous way to scare us. I was really looking forward to this movie. The plot seems really good, but the way it is handled is so ridiculous. I'm not a fan of the way the movie is edited. You know the one. The little kid, who gets kidnapped and he has to save his sister from the monster. The way the film is shot and the way he shows the movie. It's so bad and the actors in the movie just can't help but laugh. But the movie doesn't stop there. It goes on to have some of the worst acting in the history of cinema. Not only that, but there is a couple of scenes that are not worth the time. The only good thing about this movie is the song, "The Big Freeze" by Misfits. I really don't think the movie deserved that much praise, but I can't deny that it was a very fun film to watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ This was a terrible movie! Not a good movie at all, the plot was awful and the acting was bad and the plot is about a guy who has a dead brother who tells him that he is still alive. This guy goes to his friend who tells a crazy story about how he was with this dead brother, so he starts to believe that his brother is still living, but the problem is that he has no idea how to contact the brother. The only thing is that the brother is in an insane asylum in another country and when he comes to visit, he tells him to bring a car because he will go to a new country and he will take his brother with him, but in the end the brother dies and the guy is crazy! I did not like this movie at the start, it was terrible and the script was so stupid and not well thought out, it made me mad at the ending! The actor who plays the crazy brother was bad at all and this guy was not good enough for this movie! There was no story, nothing was explained and the ending was stupid and weird! I hope this movie is not the end of this actor! If the movie was made today it would be so bad! If you like this kind of movies you should just stay away from this movie, you will be disappointed!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  A poor, bad movie that is a poor, low-budget effort. The story is poorly written and the acting is weak. The acting in this movie was awful. They were so bad. The only actor who seemed to have any kind of talent was the lead actor, but he just seemed to be trying his hardest.  The plot was so bad that the movie was basically a series of cliches. It was a movie about a family, but they always go on a vacation, so it's a movie of them going on a trip and then they never return. This is a common plot, and they just used it again and again. , which is a series about a group of friends who travel to a far away country in order to take a vacation. The plot of this movie is a simple one: a group who are trying to get away from a horrible family who is always getting in their way. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't make it to the point that it could have. The movie was made to try to cash in on the success of "Titanic", which is basically the movie that everyone who saw "Titans" is thinking about. The director is a huge fan of "The Princess Bride", and was just trying to make a movie that had the same atmosphere as that movie. The problem is that "Tiger" was just a bad film. It doesn't work, it doesn't hold up, it's just a really bad movie. I could say that this is a sequel to "Tigers", but I don't think that it was ever meant to be a sequel. It's a good movie for those who have seen "Tears of the Sun", but that movie was an instant classic. The main thing that I can say about this movie, is that I wish I had seen this movie when it first came out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What a waste of time, and money. The movie is poorly made, poorly directed, poorly acted and poorly written. It is the worst movie I have ever seen, ever. The story line and the characters are all poorly developed. The acting is terrible and is completely laughable. And, the director, I believe, did not like to film anything. He wanted to do the movie on a computer and that is how he got all of these problems. The best thing about this movie is that you will see a very good looking man named George Michael. I believe this was because Michael was a good friend of director, Brian De Palma and De Palama did not want him to be in the movie, but he had to be because it was written and filmed by Brian DePalma. And the last 2 minutes of the movie are very good. I recommend this movie to everyone who is tired of the same old stuff that is produced by these studios. I have watched so many bad movies and this one is a very decent movie that will entertain you for a little while.

I'll give it a 4/10, as it's not a bad film by any means, but it was also not a film I enjoyed. It's a bit of a disappointment that the production company is so willing to make a bad product into a decent one, because the film does not have the right to be good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________   I really wanted to like this movie, I really did. But after watching this movie I think I would have rather spent the money and got a movie I would really enjoy. It is not bad in any way, it is just not very good. I have watched so many good movies this year, so I expected something better. This movie is nothing more than a bad remake of a great movie, and is a bad sequel to a good movie. It should be renamed "A Bad Movie That Needs A Good Story". The movie takes place in a town in Germany, where there are many famous names in film making, such as Ingmar Bergman, Werner Herzog and Wim Wenders. One of these people, Hans Landa, plays the role of a director. He is trying to get a movie made that will be his first success. He tells his friend, who is also a director, who also has a big budget, that he will give them $300,000 to make a movie that will not only be his success, but also that of the whole film industry. This friend says that he would be happy to do it for $100,000, which is what he got for "A Time To Kill", which is his most famous movie. He agrees and starts shooting the movie. But the first thing he did, was to hire a stuntman. This stuntman had a very bad accident, in which he fractured both of his arms and his legs. And Landa has no money for this accident. But he does not care, he decides to shoot the movie anyway. The first scene in which Hans is seen is the first time he is seen, and he is wearing his red shirt, which he has always had on in all his movies. But as you can see, the movie is so bad, that the audience never gets to see him in his red top. The next scene shows him in a wheelchair, and then he has to be carried by the stuntman to the set, where he is again wearing his blue shirt. And then they have to shoot again. But this time it is different, because now Landa is wearing a black shirt. The movie was so bad that it took them two and a half hours to film it. When it was finished, Hans was not only paralyzed, but he was in a coma. He had to be hospitalized for a week, and was still paralyzed. When he was released, he had to go

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this is one of the most annoying films I have ever seen, and it is only because of my wife's insistence that I watch it.  As a matter of fact, I have never been so disappointed with a movie as I was with this one.  I am a HUGE Star Wars fan and even have a few Star Wars action figures.  The thing that annoyed me the most about this movie is how they tried to make it as close to the original trilogy as possible.   The movie starts off by showing the Death Star from the original movies in space.  We then see the first battle of the Death Stars, a huge battle in which they destroy the first Death Star.  Then the story goes back to earth and the movie cuts to Luke's home planet of Tatooine, and we see Luke's parents arguing about the death of their son.  When Luke is about to go to the jungle to find his father, his friends are attacked by Tusken Raiders.  One of the Tusken's shoots Luke in the leg, and he falls to the ground, dead.  After he dies, Luke's friends are told that he was a Jedi and that he is the last Jedi.  Luke's friend Lando, a smuggler, is able to find a lightsaber that belonged to Luke and Luke tells Lando that he will be able to defeat the Tuskens with a Jedi mind trick.  Lando is so impressed that he wants to be a Jedi too.  As the movie goes on, Luke finds that he must find the other Jedi so he can use the mind trick to become a Jedi.   This is a really bad movie.  It has no story and is only meant to be an action movie. It is not a bad action movie but it has no plot and the only reason that the characters are in this movie are to have a story and they have none.  At one point Luke is supposed to be able use his mind trick on Lando and then he gets shot in the chest, and then this is all just an excuse to have Lando kill Luke, and to have Luke die in the movie, is not really an action sequence.  There are a lot of scenes where Luke is just standing around looking at the scenery and the acting is so bad.  Most of the acting in this film is not very good.  This movie is full of horrible acting, but the best is a scene when Luke has a vision of
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  "Citizen Kane" is the most misunderstood film in the history of the world.  The critics of the time, when the film was released, were amazed at how it was able to make a living off of the people's ignorance.  in the early 1930's it was not uncommon to hear people remark that it was the greatest film ever made, even though they had not seen it.  (A movie about a man who steals a car and drives it into a crowd of people is "the greatest movie ever made" in 1935?)  People believed the movie was a hit because the director, Orson Welles, had used such an interesting story line to get the audience to like the film.  a) He told a story that was so amazing that it made people think they had seen something truly amazing, and they had. .

It is not a bad picture but you should just avoid it at all cost.  The only thing that I think would have made it better is that the film was shot in 2.35:1.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The only reason it has a score is because it has no redeeming value, it's just a cheap horror movie, nothing special" I'm sure this film has a lot of people in the audience who will be just as turned off as I was.  I didn't enjoy it at all. Â There were no effects to speak of and the only thing I liked was the acting.   You see these people who go into a mental institution and they all get the same treatment.  I just wish they had done something different with them.  It was just a really boring movie.  You get the feeling the producers had so little to work with.  If they had been able to cast someone who could act the part they probably would have had something better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________ I saw this movie for a charity event that was put on by the school. I went in for my freebie to see a comedy and it was terrible. The whole thing was a total slap in the face to all those who worked to make this movie a reality. The director just went in and told everyone that this movie was about a group of kids who were bullied. He used the same script that was used in every other "bullying" movie that was made. When it was time for the kids to take the stand, the kids were all in character, and they made up the most unbelievable lies about the other kids. They said that they were being threatened, harassed, and called "faggots". They even claimed that the movie was filmed on a set that was set up with "gang members". They also claimed that all of the actors were being paid to be in the movie. I would never believe that stuff. I saw it with my own two eyes and it did not match the script at all. When the kids take the witness stand, they tell the court that they had never seen the movie, but that their friends had. When they saw the movie for the first time they had no idea what was going on. They had been told that they should not talk about it and that they could not go to school or tell anyone what had happened. The movie makes the kids sound like a bunch of crazy kids. There were no gang members, no shooting, and no bullying. I am not sure if the kids would have been allowed to go on to college if the whole movie was true, but the real kids are not the ones that are in this movie. The real kids, and all of their parents and teachers, have told me that this film is a total lie. I believe that it was just made to make money and that this is the way that they will get people to come to their movie. This movie makes me sick.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I don't care if it's a good movie. If I can't enjoy it for the story and characters, I'm not interested. I'm going to take a lot of time with this review. I am not a movie reviewer, I am a fan of the movie. It's like watching a bad romance movie, with no romance and no plot. I loved the movie and it was very good. However, there is so much wrong with it, that it will leave you bored, frustrated and disgusted. I've read reviews that say that this movie was a remake of a film called "The Devil's Advocate". But this movie is not a remake. It is a completely different movie. The original "Devil's Advocate" was a movie that told the story of an innocent man, who was accused of a crime he didn't commit. The movie was about the man's life, how he was treated by the system and how he fought to prove his innocence. The remake "The Advocate" is very different, because it focuses on the trial and the lawyers and how they try to win the case. This is the story that I loved, but I was so disappointed by the movie that I cannot see it. The story is about a lawyer, who has to prove that a man is innocent, but his client has been in jail for 7 years. He knows that he has to show that the man did not commit this crime. He goes to the town of Woodstock to look for a new lawyer, but the town seems to be very close to him, because the lawyer is from there and the town is very close. The town is full of old people and has a very strange feel to it. It doesn't seem like a town. The lawyer goes to an old lady, who works at a small grocery store and she's really nice and friendly. She seems like a nice person and a good lawyer. The girl is very attractive and very friendly. He asks her to take his case, but she says she doesn't do defense work. So the lawyer tells her that he's a defense lawyer and that he should be able to do a good defense. The old lady is very curious about the lawyer. He tells her about his experience on the defense bench. She is very interested in the case and asks him to tell her more. They get together, and she tells him about her life. He has a great relationship with her. He says she's beautiful and very

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Did you like this movie? _________ I did not like this film, the acting is very bad, and the plot is very poor, and not believable. I also did not feel any emotion in this film. The music is awful, it sounds like a bad song. It's just too loud. And I don't know why they had a character, a child who has no emotion. I don�t think he has any emotions, he is just a child, a baby, but I don?t think a baby has emotions. They had to have some sort of emotion in the movie, I don' think a child has emotions, and I think it was just so bad. There was one scene I hated, the ending scene where she dies. That was a really bad scene. But they could have used a baby to play the baby. The film was so bad that I think they could make a good film out of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Worst Movie of All Time" I saw this movie back in the 90's on a college class trip and I must have been in high school. I was in a group of about 5 of us and we were all pretty much hooked from the get go. I didn't want to go back to my dorm and go to sleep. I had to keep going back and trying to forget about my problems. I thought about all the people I saw in the theater that night and thought, how could they have ever thought that I would enjoy something like this? It just doesn't seem realistic, it's a movie from the past. I remember watching it and it was one of those things where you could tell from the beginning what it was going to be. I knew the story was about a guy that was sent on a mission and he never came back, and I knew it was a love story, but it was all done in a very very fake way. I hated it and hated myself for watching it. It's not that the movie was bad, but the way they wrote the story just made me feel sick. I know it's supposed to be a romantic story but I can't see how you could make this movie more real than that. It was so fake, so fake and so fake. It didn't have any heart at all. And this is a movie that was made back in 1993. It had the best actors, but none of them could have pulled this off. It just didn't feel right. I couldn't understand why they made this movie and why they had to make it. I don't know how they thought that this movie was going be a hit. It really wasn't that good. I still don't understand it. And the worst part was that this is not even the worst movie of all time. The worst movie I've ever seen was " The Island of Dr. Moreau " and it still didn't hold a candle to this. There are a lot of good movies out there that I've never seen, but I don"t see how this movie can be rated any higher than a 4 or a 5.

It was so good! I thought it was going to be better. The acting was so much better. I thought the actors were all better in this movie. The bad acting was all from the bad director, which made it even worse. I was really sad when the movie was over. I wanted to get up and run. The only good thing about this movie was that it was made by a movie star.   In summary: _________________________  This movie is a really long movie with so many bad acting. I am glad that they have the ability to change the actors in the film. This movie has a really good plot. It is really hard to get a good movie. I would give this movie a 4.5 if it was not so long. I have seen other reviews about how bad the acting is. It isn't bad. If you don't like bad acting in movies, then you are just going to hate this movie!   Overall: _________________ , a movie about a guy that can see dead people and a bunch of other weird stuff. So I watched this movie to see how this movie would go. I wasn't expecting this movie had the same bad acting that I saw in the first one. I'm glad I gave this movie another chance. It doesn't have a good plot, but it is really funny. The actors are all really good. The movie is really long. The ending is good. I think this movie has the ability of being really good, but the actors are terrible. I guess this movie isn't really a bad one. It just has a bad director and some really bad actors. This is the only bad movie I have watched in a while. It may not be that good, so I wouldn't waste my time watching it. It has a good ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* This is a horrible movie. It has bad acting, and terrible acting is always bad. The film is not only about the life of a drug addict, but it also has a whole other story. This story of a guy who lives in the ghetto who goes to work for a big company and ends up killing the owner and his family. What makes this movie so terrible is the bad acting. I think that this movie is based on a real person, but that person had terrible acting and a poor life. The actors did a horrible job in this movie. They did not have any chemistry with each other and the only thing that made it even worse was the acting. The worst actor in this film is George Segal. This guy was awful. I hate to say it but the guy is just terrible. He looks like he was made out of Styrofoam. He looked like he never did anything in his life and then this movie came out and he was cast in this. He was terrible. The director did not give him enough to do. I thought it was because Segal was supposed to play a "good guy" but the director just kept throwing things at him and he just could not do it. The only other actors who were really good were George Nader and John Turturro. Nader was great. He played a detective. I would not have guessed him to be an actor. Turtruro was just a good guy. He had a good role. The story was good, but the acting was bad. This movie is not a good movie. This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. The acting is awful and the story was just stupid.

The woman tells the man that he needs to come with her to a party at her house. The man is reluctant to go, but after a lot of persuading he agrees to go. He goes to her house, but when he goes into the kitchen, he finds a man at the stove trying to burn his own hand with a hot plate. The cook, who has no idea who he is, tells the husband that he will be able to cook for him at his place. The husband goes to the cook's house. At the dinner table, the cook says he is the cook for the man, and asks the husband if he wants anything. The wife replies that she does not, but the cook insists that he be allowed to cook. When the man finally agrees to have a drink with the cook, he discovers that he is not allowed to drink it. The party continues as the cook continues to try to burn himself. When a man and woman have reached a point of exhaustion, a couple is standing outside the door, wondering what to do next. They see a man lying in a pool of blood, and the woman asks the man to call the police. The couple walks over to the man and take him back to the hotel. In the hotel room, the woman takes out a knife, and starts to cut the man's face. He yells to her to stop, but she stabs him in the chest with the knife. They realize that they have been watching this man and his wife for a long time. In a final attempt to save his life, the man pulls out the knife from his chest, and stabs the woman. He then starts to choke her. As the woman collapses on the floor, the two men pick up the knife, stab her to death, and put the knife in their pocket. They take the knife to a room where they are waiting for their next victim. The next day, the wife and her lover come back to pick him up, but they are attacked by the two other men. The two men, having had enough, take the two lovers to the street, and throw them into the back of a car. The car is driven off to a farm. The killer has already killed all the other men on the farm.

I thought that the story was interesting, and it was nice to see how the character's developed. The acting was okay, but there were a lot of problems with it. I mean, the actress's voice sounded funny when she was in the room. And I hate that when a movie has a good plot, it makes it impossible to believe that the actor's can actually act. In this movie it looked like the acting was done in a very bad way, and not just that. The actors don't look like they really had any talent. The characters look like their just there to look pretty and have a cool looking movie. In the beginning I thought the movie was good, but in the end, it was not good at all. It was very disappointing. I give this movie a 2.5/5. I would not recommend this movie.  - February 28, 2010-

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  This movie is awful! The plot is so terrible! It is a story about a man and a woman who are in love, but then they break up and the woman goes back to her family. The woman has a new boyfriend, but when the man shows up, the boyfriend doesn't believe him and he has a fight. The man leaves the woman in his place, and when he goes back, she comes back with her new boyfriend. The movie starts out great, but it goes downhill really fast. The guy is really bad at talking to people, and it makes me mad because it's a movie about love. I really didn't like this movie at all!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________  The movie is about a group of people who are in a plane crash, with some of the people surviving having no recollection of what happened to the rest of the passengers and the crew.  This movie was awful. There was no reason for it to be this bad. I have been wanting to see this movie since it was announced and I had it at a theater. But now it's a time capsule for me. It was a very long, boring movie with terrible acting and a very generic script. It seemed like a long time was spent on a few short scenes. :)  _______________________________________________________________________________  I saw this movie in a movie theater. It's not bad at all, but it was definitely not worth the price of admission. This was just a short, boring, and rushed movie. It is not even funny. The movie's actors were all awful, the script was ridiculous, and the film is too long. The only thing that was good was the effects. . ,  There's no reason to watch this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  I was a young teen when I saw this movie. I saw it when it came out in theatres, and the first time I saw a woman in a bikini in the movie. It was a shocking experience, but at the same time it was a little exciting, because it was like a new thing to me. I remember thinking, "How is it possible that people like this? I mean, people like these kinds of things, but I don't." And I still don't. I just don't get it. And I just didn't think it was very important, and yet I knew that it was important to the people that were making it.  What I really wanted to know was, "Why do they want to make this movie? And why are they doing this?" I really just wanted to figure out what was going on. And so I spent many years asking questions and researching. I had all these people coming to me, trying to tell me what was really going on, because they were afraid that if they talked about it, they might lose their jobs. And they were very afraid that the government would take over the movie industry, because, as they said, if people saw this kind of film in a movie theatre, they would never buy another movie again. And then I met someone at a film festival in Australia who worked for the producer of this movie, and he said, "Well, I'm afraid that there's no way we can make this kind a movie. You know, people wouldn't be able to handle it. They wouldn't want to see it." And so that's what he told me. But at the time, I still didn't know what he was talking about. I thought it was great. I really thought it had a lot of promise. And at the end of the movie, I was thinking, What a great idea, that they could have a woman doing something that was so provocative and so wild and so different, and it would take people by surprise. But they never got the chance. , I guess I am just as shocked as everyone else. I mean really shocked, because I really don't understand. I don  suddenly get this kind o  t in my head and I think, "Whoa, what's going on here? Why is this woman doing this? This isn't right." I think it's pretty disturbing. I'm really surprised that people would go and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This movie made me feel sorry for a kid who has no future and no way out."  That's not a good message.  What do you want the child to do?  Get in the car and get his ass back home to his parents. Â This movie made my kids feel like they were getting kicked out of the house.    The parents are too busy watching this movie to go and visit.       This is the first movie that makes the whole family watch it.    The movie is boring, and the kid's acting is pathetic.       I don't think this movie could ever be as good as the first, because there's just so much less of a plot.  The Movie:   This movie is about a boy who has been picked up by a guy and is being taken on a drive around town.  The movie starts out with him on the freeway and getting to see some pretty scenery.  They stop and the guy takes him to a big house in a big town. The kid goes inside and the man tells him to wait.  Then they drive off.  We cut to the boy's bedroom, and he's waiting for his mom to come home.  When she finally arrives, the guy tells her he's having a party for her.  He takes her to the big house. The girl's dressed up as a boy.  As the girl is about to go in the house, she gets hit on by a couple of other guys who are there.  After she leaves, we see a man getting off the bus in the distance.  She tells him she's a girl and he thinks she's pretty.  This is when he takes her into the house and makes her watch some guy with a guy do some sex stuff.  At the end of the movie, he leaves her on the couch, and says he'll be right back.  I'm sure he'll come back soon.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  - I've seen a lot of bad movies.  Most of them are mediocre.  the worst one of them is the one that made me laugh the most and that was the first movie I saw that was made by an american director that had been an action star in the 80's, and he had gone through a lot.  he made a movie where the main character has a crazy life with a crazy wife and the only good thing was the guy who played the wife who was a huge hottie that played a crazy character.  after the movie the guy dies, and the main guy is left in a hospital and he's told that he'll never walk again.  i was so happy to see a good movie made by a american.  but after the second movie the main guys wife dies.  and he gets remarried, and she is a whore, and they've had a child together and she kills him.  it was the funniest movie I've ever seen, and it was so much better than any of the other ones I saw.   after all these bad movies they made the last one the best, and that is why I am saying this movie is worth the price of admission.  The second movie in the series is The Legend of the Red Scorpion.  this movie has the same premise as the first one.  they are in the middle of a war in the jungle and one of the guys gets captured.  when he gets released they are told that they are to get on a ship that is going to the city.  so he goes with his new girlfriend to the ship and she tells him that she's pregnant.  then they start fighting over the baby.  because they're fighting over it.  she keeps saying that she will give the baby to the guy and if he don't want to have the baby he can leave.  as time goes on he keeps on fighting because he doesn't want the baby, but she doesn't.    It's the second film in the trilogy that really got my attention.  I thought it was great, I thought this movie was a masterpiece.  if you are a big fan of kung fu movies then you will really like this one.   I thought that this movie would be over a long time ago but this movie really deserves a mention.      I am going to try and talk about this movie for the first time because there are

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________ The film is set in a post apocalyptic world, the main character is a girl, a woman, and she has to kill every single male character that has survived and is now on her path to take revenge on all men and she takes a few girls along with her. The women are not likeable in the least. They all have their own personal issues and the men all get off on hurting and killing them. All the men get raped, and when the woman rapes them, she doesn't give them any resistance. The main characters are all the worst kind of monsters, they are both killers and they all have issues. The girls, the one that you watch the movie with, she seems nice enough at first but the more you watch her the more she starts to seem more and more evil. At first, she tries to kill some men for her, but she has no problem with killing a girl that has done nothing wrong. The girl is really cute and cute girls get raped and killed. You can see that they were just the kind of girls that men like. It is very hard to watch a movie with a girl as the main heroine and a group of men as the monsters. The movie is really bad, the actors are awful and there are lots of scenes where they are just walking in a straight line and look like they are walking, but when they walk in a circle and you can't tell if they are looking at the camera or if they're looking at something, it is just horrible. This movie is a total waste of time, and it is so boring. There is a lot of plot holes in this movie, and there is a reason why this movie has a rating of a D. It doesn't have any substance, and that's really bad. This is a movie that should be seen only to see how the characters from the movies of the 90's are portrayed. I hope this movie is the start of a new wave of movie where the main characters were really horrible and the women were just a few minutes before getting raped.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ The only good thing about this movie is that it was filmed in Mexico, where the language was so much worse. The actors were so poorly cast that it's almost impossible to tell who was speaking in what language. The movie was about a group of girls, and most of the scenes were in one room. I thought the scenes with the boys were a little better than the girls, because they were in more realistic situations. The best part of this movie was the scene in the cafeteria when the guys were going to rape the girls and the guys are trying to escape. This was just amazing. The guy in the white hat just stood there and looked at the girls. The girls tried to escape, but the guys kept on hitting them. It was really hard to watch. I think this movie has been remade a few times. Maybe in the 80's.  The story of "The Girls" begins with a girl, Lola, who has a crush on a boy named Luis. Luis, who is also a star athlete, is not interested in Lola's crush. At school, Lolo is the only girl who really likes Luis. She tries to get Luis to date her, but Luis is not really interested in dating her. Luis's friend, the guy in white hat, helps him out and Luis decides to go on a date with Lolo. This is when things get interesting. Lolo finds Luis and Luis asks her out to a restaurant for dinner. But after dinner, Luis wants to go home and the girl, thinking that Luis is going to take her home, doesn't want to leave. Lola gets angry with her and Luis gets very mad. He goes back to the restaurant and threatens to kill her. Lalo (the girl who is going home) is scared and goes home. She finds Luis dead in the bathroom, dead from a knife wound. Lolicon was the name of the movie, and Lola was the heroine. This movie was very hard to get into. It had a lot of violence. The sex scenes were very graphic. This could have been the first movie that made you feel guilty. I remember the first time I watched it, I cried because I thought that Lola had been murdered. I also felt sorry for Luis because he was so abused by Lola. So, that was the movie. Now let's get to the review!   First of all, the acting was so bad. All the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved the idea of a young man who lives alone in the woods, he's a boy scout and he's always doing the right thing, and then he gets lost. And then he finds out that there are these giant insects in his house, and they have a whole family of them. And they're trying to get him to do their bidding, and so he finds a girl that has been abandoned by her family. She's been a witch for a while, but her family won't let her do anything, so she has to be rescued. And that's where the movie gets really interesting, because as a kid, you want to watch this movie over and over again, because it's just a classic. And it's an amazing movie. You can see it all the way through. The movie really takes you on a trip. But I'm not a kid at all, so I was like, "I'm just going to turn it off." I had a hard time watching the movie. I don't know if I even understood it. There were some parts where I didn't understand it. And I didn?t understand it when I was a kid. It was just this movie that was very difficult for me to understand. So I think if I was going to do a remake of it, I would have a much better grasp on it, because I know how it is now. And even the music was not very well done at the time. It?s so hard to do music today. You have to make it so simple, and it?s a lot easier to do now. The music was really hard to write, and I think that the music at the end is very good. It's not the best, but it?ll do. I mean, I?m pretty sure that if I were to do it again, I wouldn?t try to recreate the music, because the music doesn?t really have the same emotional impact, I think. But the song, "Hollow." It's very sad. You just think, "Oh my God, this kid is going to die. Oh my God." And then the kid has to save his family. It just makes you think about death and the end of the world. That?s why the song is so good. That song is pretty close to the original. The song is?s called "Hollywood Hollow." It?d be like, what,?hollywood? or

It wasn't great, but it was not a terrible movie either. I think it's a good idea to use a good guy as a foil for the bad guys, and the movie didn't disappoint. - You have to admit this movie looks a lot like a movie I watched on TV, like I'm sure everyone has. I don't think they were trying to be "that movie", but the movie has a lot in common with it. I've seen this movie about 20 times. - The film's not very good. The acting isn't very good, and there is a lot of dialogue that doesn't mean anything. But the music is great. The film just isn't the best, and that's a shame.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________  There are many different genres that have had varying degrees of success in the last 30 years. Horror has been the dominant genre, but has also been the most under-utilized, with its focus being on the more conventional and more traditional, and less of the supernatural. While I do think that the genre is still alive and well, it has been too often dismissed by film critics, who fail to appreciate its richness and variety, its sense of humor, and its emotional impact. This is a good thing. Horror movies have a way of changing people's lives, whether it's making them laugh, scream, or cry. Horror is a genre that is very easy to get caught up in, but can also leave a lasting impact on you. It can turn the ordinary into the bizarre, and the extraordinary into the commonplace. It has the power to make us question our own beliefs. It is a way for us to escape the mundane, and explore the hidden corners of our minds. It's a genre where you can have a good time, laugh, and even cry, all at the same time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I don't know how else to say it. This movie is an absolute nightmare to watch. There are so many problems with it, but they are all connected. For starters, there are not one, but two completely different movies happening in this one. There is a short film about a guy who wants to kill the President (played by John Travolta) who has become obsessed with a painting. When the painting is taken from him, the film jumps back to a flashback of a young John Lennon (played again by John Hurt) who is living in London. Lennon is obsessed with The Beatles and is trying to get them to come back to the UK. When John's mother and father die of cancer and he is left alone in the apartment where he lived as a child, he becomes a young man again and tries to reconnect with the old songs of The Beatles. This is just one small part of a much bigger film. The short film is a parody of the movie "Blow" (which is about a man who wants revenge on the Beatles) but it is so bad, it is laughable. This short film ends with the young man getting his revenge on The Beatles by shooting a police officer who was on a stakeout and who was holding the painting of Lennon's dead mother. The entire film is an excuse to go to the beach and get the Beatles to come to the country. The movie is also about the old song "I am the Walrus" and the "Walrus" who lives in a forest. The Walrus has been turned into a man by a magician (who is played by Bill Murray). The old man wants to return the Walruses back to their original form so he can be with them and is obsessed about doing so. The magician, played by Paul Newman, is trying hard to get the Walrat to fall in love with him. The old woman that lived in the house with the Walrats is now a woman called Lucy and is played very badly by Marlene Dietrich. She wants to take over the house but she is scared to do so by the old woman and her son. I really thought the film was just going to be a short parody of "Bloomsday" and it was just so bad it was hard to watch and I wanted to throw my TV out the window. The film was written by Peter Lawford and the script was so bad I was ashamed to watch it. I thought it was the worst script

A movie about a movie about another movie about __________. _______. _____. ______. ______________________________. I liked this movie a lot, it had good plot, interesting characters, and some great scenes, but there was a lot of plot holes and there were also some really bad actors in it. I also think that the way the movie was made makes it worse. I think that this was a studio-made movie rather than a movie made by a writer. The story was kind of interesting, and the characters were a lot better than the characters in the movie. It had a really good ending, but I didn't care much about it. The acting in the film was very good. The cinematography in the scene where the two people are in the elevator is really good. But the rest of the movie is really bad. The plot was a little hard to follow, but the movie has good performances, and if you don't mind the bad acting, it is worth watching. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!!  (This review was first published on the website of the director of this movie, Kiyoshi Kurosawa)  In the world of Kurosaka, there is a man named Sadao Kurosaki who is the son of a famous sword maker. He has a bright future ahead of him, but Sadaos own father is the one who brought him into this world and so Sadaou's life is very difficult. Sadaog has been through many battles and has become a strong fighter. One day, his father calls him and tells him to go to a shrine. Satao goes and gets his sword from a shrine and when he comes out of the shrine, he realizes that he can no longer use his sword. It doesn't seem to be that serious though. He goes back home and when his parents come home, they think he is sick and they bring him to the doctor. The doctor tells Sadaous that his sword was cursed by a black god and that it will only allow the sword to be used for evil. The only way to get rid of it is to kill the black god who is inside the sword. Sadeo goes to the shrine and meets a young girl who calls herself Kiyoko Kurosakure. Kiyoshis father is a priest and she is a witch. She tells Sadeos father that she is from the same clan as the sword and that they are a team. Sadero goes back to the sword shop and uses the black magic of the sword, but nothing happens. Kihoshis mother tries to exorcise the black thing from Sadaod sword, and Kiyosaki is then taken into the sword which turns into the witch. The witch then attacks Sadaot and when the black evil spirit from the sword gets out, Sadeous parents are killed by Sadaots parents. Sadao Kurosaga comes to help and kills the witch with the help of his friend Yuriko Kurosagase. The sword then becomes the weapon of the two warriors.  The movie starts with a sequence in a church where we meet Sadaokos parents and Kihosaki mother. Then we go to the house of Sadaoes father where we get some great fighting scenes with Sadaaou and Kana. Then the movie switches to a battle scene with the sword in Sadaoyos hand, as he and his friends fight
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a total disappointment, even worse than the last film. The characters in this film are really not that good, but they are a good looking cast and the acting is really good. It is hard to tell who the main characters are, and it is not like they are really likable either. The action scenes are not very good either. It seems like there are many different actors who are used for many different roles. The acting is not very professional, but it is the only reason the movie isn't much worse than it is. This is just not worth your time.

That is the only negative that I can find in this movie. It is an extremely well done movie. The acting is very good. The cinematography is amazing. The story line is very interesting and keeps the viewer interested. I would recommend this movie to everyone who has seen it.  and it is worth the money.

The movie was great and had a great soundtrack but I felt that it did not do well at all at it was boring and had poor acting. I was not really feeling the story but I still loved the movie. It was very well done.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ I am not a big fan of the zombie genre, I prefer the ones with a twist to the plot. I am glad I saw this movie because I really enjoyed it. The story was really good and the zombies were really creepy. The cinematography was good as well. The ending was really cheesy but I think I enjoyed it because it was done really well.  The only thing that was disappointing about this movie was that I expected a better zombie movie. The zombies are too slow and I would have liked to see a more action packed movie. I guess that was just the first movie of the series and I will see the next one.

They are always hilarious and I love it when they make me laugh.  If you like a good laugh, you'll love this movie, and if you don't, well, it's not your fault. I've always loved a bad comedy, and it's great to see a movie that is so bad, but I don't feel bad watching it.  I'm not sure what the point of this film is, other than to make a bad film even more bad.  I mean the whole movie just kind of sucks.   This movie just doesn't make sense at all.  It's basically just a comedy about a bunch of people who go to a lake for a weekend and all of the fun and games of the weekend are ruined by the fact that the girls want to go home and their boyfriend's want to spend the whole weekend with them.  When the movie is supposed to be about the guys, the whole thing becomes a nightmare and they just kindof hate each other and then a couple weeks later, they are at the lake and there are these two girls that have been with these guys for a couple years and they're not happy with their situation.  This leads to a horrible scene where they fight with their girlfriends and then there is a scene that ends with the two girls and their girlfriends getting on a bus and taking off.  That's about the only thing that makes any sense in this movie and if the story wasn't bad enough, the film is filled with the worst acting I've ever seen.  For a comedy movie that was supposed to have a funny plot, the movie just sucks.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really loved this movie! The actors were good, and I loved that they got to play around with their roles. However, they were all terrible and I was just waiting for the next episode.  In the beginning of the movie, the kids are all playing in a lake, when they are surrounded by a bunch of baddies. The baddies are all different sizes and colors, and the colors are different on each baddie. I really liked that the baddies had a variety of colors and sizes.   I also liked how the baddie in the end was the same color as the others, and had a different kind of attack.  All of the kids had a great performance, and they all had their roles well-played. I am going to watch this movie again, and hope to see more baddies and characters in the future.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ __________ _________ ________ _____________ _______________ ____________ ________ ______ ________. The plot: We are back in the world of the movie "Halloween" (1990), in which we find ourselves in a hotel room with our girlfriend, our son and our little dog. This is the movie that "Hallowe'en" (1978) was based on. The family goes to a party at a haunted house. At the party, the ghost of a girl, who was killed by her father when she was young, starts to come back to life. The ghost, the little girl, is possessed by the evil spirit of a little boy who was abused as a child by his father. She begins to cause trouble for everyone around her and begins to chase her son, and then her daughter, all the while calling herself "The Devil." The family tries to get rid of her. The evil spirit is not satisfied with just killing her children and then herself. She wants to kill all the people who have ever wronged her and make herself a god. The main character, the girl's father, tries to escape her clutches. He tries to leave the haunted house and the hotel where the family stays. He has to kill the girl so that she will not harm him. He is saved from the hotel by his son, who is trying to save his father from the girl. The son shoots her dead with his father's revolver. The little girl has died. The father is very scared of her and keeps running away from her. He eventually goes to the hotel, where he is finally able to escape from her, after a struggle. He hides in the attic of the hotel and is afraid that she would come back for him. After he escapes from her she kills him. His son finds his father and they both escape the hotel. The movie ends with the evil ghost, who used to be the little boy's sister, trying to kill her own father. I think it is obvious that this is a movie about the Devil. There is an element of Satan in every single character and every scene in the movie. It is not about Satan in general. The director, Rob Zombie, is a very well known occultist and he is making a Satanic movie. The film also shows that the Devil, as we know him in Christianity, is not really a "satan" as we think he is. The devil has a good side. It
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ This movie was terrible. I am very disappointed and I am sure many other people will be as well. The acting was terrible and it was like watching a kid try to act like an adult. The plot was so boring that I didn't even want to know what happened. The cinematography was so bad and the sound was so annoying that I was not able to concentrate on anything. The ending was terrible because they killed off the main character. The actors did not seem to care and it made me very angry. I think the movie is terrible and should not be seen. I was so angry and sad and I had a lot of fun just watching it. The only thing that makes me think this movie was worth watching is that the cast was very talented and there was a good movie to be made out of this. If they had cast an older actor with more acting experience they could have made a much better movie. I give this movie 2 stars because the acting was good and it has a good plot.

But there was something wrong with The Graduate, something that I don't think I can describe to you. It wasn't a bad film. It just seemed off to me. And it was so long!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. You can do better than that, and you have a lot more options. I'm not gonna name any names, but just so you know, there's the first one, which is not nearly as good as it first appeared. Then there's "Saving Private Ryan," which is a far better movie than it first appears. And then there's even better. There's "Apollo 13," which takes the basic concept of "Jurassic Park" and makes it even better, and "The Shining," which turns a very good movie into something even better than the original. So I think you've got plenty of choices. You could do anything, but you've made a good movie. You've got options. So don't give up. Go back to the drawing board. And if you've already made a great movie, go ahead and keep it going. If not, you've still got some great movies left. I hope you keep it up. It's going to be a great summer. It should be a really good summer. I've already been in two of them. I wish I could have seen more. But I'm excited for the summer.

I knew the script was great, but I didn`t know anything about the actual production. I just knew that I wanted to be in a movie that was really great. And that's what I was working for. So when I read the script, I knew that this was a really great movie. And I knew how much it would mean to me.  to make a movie is like, "How can you do this?"  A lot of times people will write a script and it'll turn out that they never even read the screenplay. And so, you know? And I always thought that was a bad thing, you never read the stuff that you're writing. I always wanted to read everything, but a lot of people don't realize that they're doing it. And the script that I wrote was the script I was going to write. I was really excited to read it. I didnít want to go in and read it in advance, I just wanted to go to work and work and get a job done. And when I got to work, that was what I wrote. And for a lot people, thatís

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ I loved this movie and I'm glad I watched it, but it wasn't a good movie. It was overrated. It had nothing to do with the original series and there was nothing to it. The story is a bit of a joke and the cast is really terrible. I didn't think that they were very good at acting. The ending was a bit silly and the ending was very out of place. The movie didn't make sense and was a waste of money. I was disappointed because I really liked the original anime. I hope that they remake this because it is really bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Room was a complete mess. It was the worst movie I have ever seen. There was no plot to speak of. I found it hard to get involved with the characters. The whole movie was just a mess. I mean, the movie was supposed to be a documentary about a group of guys living in a haunted house in rural Virginia. However, when they move to a new house in the same town, they end up having to deal with a lot of weird things. There is a big fight between a couple of people in the basement of the house. The movie had a lot going for it. I thought it was pretty cool. But it was just so bad.  In fact, it was so bad that I had to watch it again because I couldn't stop laughing. It's not funny when the characters are all talking at the same time. When I watch this movie, it's just so hard to concentrate on anything else.  This is a pretty standard horror movie.  It was so over the top that I didn't know where to start. I had just seen The Ring which was a pretty bad movie but at least it was in a different movie. This movie was in every way like a horror movie from the 80's. It had lots of jump scares and things that were supposed to scare you. But I couldn´t care less about any of that. The worst thing about the movie is the music. It makes no sense at all. The music is very cheesy and cheesy. The best thing about it was the movie itself.    I love horror movies but this is just stupid.  This movie has the same plot as a horror documentary about ghosts. The main character, a journalist, is on a quest to find out who is responsible for a lot murders in his town. In the end, he finds out that the killer is a ghost. But then, the story is just a bunch of people talking about a bunch of things. I just found it really boring.  The worst part about the film is the ending. The ending was so silly and stupid that I just couldn't care about it anymore.  I think the main character should have been put to sleep at the beginning. If it was put to bed, it would have been the perfect movie. Instead of just going on a killing spree, he should have gone out and explored the area. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You know it's a bad film when the actors look like they have their own private beach and all they do is sit around eating pizza.  I really don't think they should have put a guy who looks like a clown in that role because he just seems too out of place.  You know you're in for a long day when you wake up to a full moon and an old lady who you assume is your mom is screaming at you for not going to the mall.  It is not funny at all.  You have a long drive to the malls to see the stars and you have no idea how many cars have gone over your shoulder because they are scared of driving down a deserted road.  There are many scenes that are so cheesy it is funny because it is not the actors doing the cheesy things.   In a good movie they would never show the kids being chased by monsters because it would be silly and not scary.  The movie has some good action scenes and some good scares but I am not sure how much I want to watch this movie.  A good movie is when you can laugh at yourself for a minute and get through it.  This movie was not funny, it was just not good.  I have no desire to see it again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ * This movie is so fucking stupid, but not because of its stupidity. This movie has been made from a movie called "Jingle All the Way", and that is not a good movie. It is a movie made by a group of retarded people who are very smart. I cannot see why a group from a group like that would do this movie, but it was made by them and not the director. I thought that a movie like that was a movie with a happy ending, but this movie is not. I mean it is not even a good bad movie. I have never seen such a stupid movie. And the stupid people in the movie are even more stupid than the stupid movie itself. * The movie is made for little kids. I don't even understand why it is made to be made for children. There is no way that a little kid would understand that this movie would be a movie about how dumb a man is. And I don' t even think that the movie is for children, I think that it is for retarded people. And that is why it was stupid. * I don';t understand how the stupid person that did this movie can get away with making a movie so stupid. I really don't understand how this movie was made. It just makes me think that people who make stupid movies need to go to jail. * It would be easier to write a negative description about this movie if the director had not made a film that is just too bad to be a good film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Do yourself a favor and do NOT watch this movie. You won't be disappointed. I was a HUGE fan of the original Alien and was happy to see Ridley Scott return to the universe. I had seen the prequel movies and loved them. The film is great and has a great cast of characters. It has an amazing story with twists and turns. The acting is great as well. The alien is awesome. I loved how it was different and different and still terrifying. I hope the sequels are better. This is the last Alien film, and it is amazing! It would be a shame to see it be forgotten.  I will watch this film again!  A truly amazing film. I highly recommend this film.  is it worth the 4 hour film? I don't think so. the acting is all over the place and the plot isn't very original. The special effects are not very good. the aliens in the movie are really great. the special effects aren't very good, but the aliens are great. I'd rather watch this than the last film in the series. I love the movie. I've been thinking about watching this movie a lot. I haven't seen Alien 3. I think I'll give this one a chance. .  in the future a research station in space discovers an alien vessel on the other side of the galaxy. the captain is killed but a scientist, Amanda (Nicola Adams) and her team discover the alien vessel and take it back to the station. Amanda begins to explore the ship, and the ship is filled with dangerous creatures, all trying to kill her. when they find a way to communicate with the aliens, they discover that the aliens have been hiding on Earth for a very long time. Amanda discovers that the Alien is on a journey to find a new home. she needs the ship in order to do this. The Alien is a great creature. She's scary, smart, powerful, beautiful, and mysterious. The only bad thing about this movie is the ending. It's a little slow and it's not as good as the first one. It was nice to see a good Alien movie. "This is the end."  This is a film you should watch. It may be one of the best horror films of all time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. That's how I felt about this movie. I really didn't like it at all. The movie has such a horrible story line. I don't know if the writer and director just got fed up with the story line and went "what the hell is wrong with this movie," but it didn't make me feel any more comfortable. This movie is a big waste of your time. The characters are very boring and forgettable. There is no depth to them, no real emotions, and just a very small amount of humor. The actors were all just flat and uninteresting. And the ending of this movie was the worst. I'm not saying that the ending was bad, because I'm sure it was. But the movie has no tension, and no real suspense. The whole movie was just a rush of "oh, let's go to that scene" and then it was over. If you like action movies, then this movie is definitely not for you. But if you don't, then I don the whole movie to be very disappointing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ "The Big Chill" is a film that I have to say is a real disappointment to the fans of the original film and those who enjoyed the previous installments in the series. This film is a complete disappointment in every aspect. First off, the actors are terrible. I have no idea what to make of them because their acting is completely awful. The story line and characters are terrible as well. The film is completely over the top and a total waste of time. The acting is not that great but I have never seen anyone better than these two actors. The cinematography of this film is not very good either. The lighting is not what it should be and the film is very flat. If you want to watch a good horror movie you would do better with a film like "Scream" or "The Fog". There are so many scenes in this film that are just ridiculous. I don't know if it was the director who was trying to make a sequel or if he just didn't want to go to the trouble of trying to create a better film, but this film just doesn't work. The sound design is horrible as well but I really can't blame the actors for this. The only thing I liked was the sound in the beginning when a group of kids walk into a movie theater. The voice of the kid who says that the people are going to die in three days was very funny and that is probably the only good thing that I heard in this terrible film. I really liked the ending when the girls get out of the theater but I was so disgusted at the end of the film that it made me want to throw up. The movie is so bad that I don' t even know how to rate it. I give it a 1 out of 10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  So... the reviews were not so good...   "You're gonna die, you're gonna burn, you'll never be whole again. You're gonna be buried under a pile of your own skin, and you'll cry for the rest of your life."   This is what you get when you put a bunch of people together in a small room, a room with a large, metal box on the wall.   And this box is called a crematorium, and it has a very simple system for incinerating your body.   the crematorium is pretty cool though.   is that really all there is to it?   The crematorium's job is to do one simple job, and that is to put a dead body in a metal box.   this box can hold up to 20 bodies, and is about 3 feet long. it has 3 flaps on it, which are a very special way of sealing the body from the outside. so the person's body, once they are dead, cannot move around inside this box. the only thing they can do is breathe, and this box will do that for them.   a very small piece of metal is on the inside of the box, which is the flaps. the flap is a small, circular hole in the bottom of the body. it is a perfect size for the lungs to be in, and the only place they can go is up through the flapped hole.  - there is no water to clean up after the body is cremated.  and you can never be sure if you put your body in this box or not, because this box was not designed to be opened. so it is always a mystery how you get out. if it is the person you love, they may never know how to open it. : ______________________________________________________________   I just finished reading this book. I don't know if it was the fact that I was a college student and reading a book on a Sunday night that made this one so much better or if the author actually did the research, but it was a really interesting book.   This was my first book about the occult, and I am now an expert on it. I think this book could be really useful for those who are interested in exploring this world of the occult. It's not something I can just take from a book, but a lot of it comes from personal experiences I have had. I can't wait

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ I have to admit that this movie has some really bad parts to it, but what is good about this movie is that there is actually a story to it.  The movie is about two brothers who have been sent away to live on a farm and they have to live a very tough life.    The main character is called Goliath, and he is a very strong and smart young man.  He gets caught up in a game of football with a rival team, the Giants, and is injured.  His friend, the big and strong boy, is sent off to stay with the Giants' team.  Goliath is a smart boy who doesn't think he is that big and he never expected to get hurt.  But he is, and the Giants are the ones who will win that game.  The first part of the movie is a series of flashbacks where Goliath remembers a fight he had with a man in a bar.  There is a scene where the Giants have been playing football and the guy is trying to run them down with his car.  They end up beating him up, and it is Goliath who is blamed.  That's when he goes to a doctor to get his leg fixed.  Then, Goliath goes on the run with his new friend, Billy.  It is in this time when Billy decides to join the Giants.  And, the story continues in a series called "The Golden Years".   Goliaths best friend is taken in by the Giants in the first part, and Billy becomes his new best friend.  I would say the movie has a very fast pace, but it does have a nice story to go along with it. There are a lot of funny parts, and there are also a lot great sports scenes.  One of the things I love about this film is the way the Giants make fun of their opponents.  Billy's dad, who is in on the joke, does a great job with that.  As for the plot, the movie ends on a very big cliffhanger.  If you are a fan of sports movies, this is a must see.  At the time of writing, this movie can be purchased on DVD from Amazon, and you can see more of my reviews there.

The plot is too simplistic and too stupid. The music is really bad and the sound effects are terrible. I could never enjoy this movie.  I hope this movie gets a re-release, it's too bad the directors couldn't make a good movie. I think if they had made a good one they would have made a lot more money.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ I'm sorry to say that I really didn't get into the movie. It seemed a little slow for my tastes. I wasn't really impressed by the acting and the direction. But the music was really great. The song was catchy, the lyrics were great. I think the movie was really only good for kids. I don't think that adults would enjoy it as much.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Does anyone else feel a sense of déjà vu? I'm a big fan of the original, but the remake was just plain boring. The plot was also pretty bland. The villain was a really annoying one, but this remake of the classic is just plain bad. The characters were also bland and annoying, which is really bad because the main character was actually pretty good and even more annoying than the villain. I would recommend this to everyone who's seen the original but who can't stand the remake. It's just plain awful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! I really thought this was going to be good, but it was just a horrible movie. The main villain was a good guy who was really great at making a lot of money off of people in the movie and then getting rid of them. But his henchman was just awful. The guy was just really nasty. He kept trying to do things to people in a really mean way. He even tried to kill a character, but he didn't succeed. I think the main problem with this movie was that the actors were not good at acting. I don't think they had the skills to act well. It was just too hard for them to act. The movie was just very boring and very stupid. I wouldn't recommend this movie at all.  I am giving this movie a rating of 4.0 out of 5. I loved the movie, but I would not recommend it to anyone. I am going to try to watch the DVD again, because I thought it was worth watching. 1 person found this helpful

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this one is a letdown!  It's a movie about a guy who's trying to save the world and the world has given up on him and his love interest... The plot is pretty good, but it's really just an excuse for the cast to act all creepy and awkward.  The acting is bad and the movie is too long.    The movie's not very interesting, and the ending sucks.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!This movie is very bad. I had no time to look into this movie. I just thought it was a horror movie. That's it. I was just fooled. I have never been disappointed with this movie and this is no different. The movie was a mess. The plot was terrible. This movie should have never have been made. I am not a big fan of horror movies. I prefer sci-fi or comedy movies. If you really want to make a horror film then don't make it about ghosts and vampires. You can have a good story but don't try to make it into a horror.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  "This is a good, solid, and entertaining movie, which, in a sense, is why I like it. It has a good heart. It is a story that has been told many times and is very well told. It does not have any of the usual twists and turns. It will leave you wanting more, but you will get it in a more natural and satisfying way than you did in most other movies that I've seen. The ending is, in my opinion, the best part of the movie. It may seem a bit odd to me, but I think that is the way the ending should be. The fact that the movie ends this way is very much what makes it good. It leaves you with a question that is unanswered. I found myself thinking about it all the time. There are some people who do not think it is possible to leave this movie with such a good feeling after watching it."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. The only good thing about this movie is that the title isn't so bad. If it were a true story of a man in a wheelchair trying to find his way to the top, it'd be perfect. Unfortunately, it isn't.   I saw this movie at the end of a long and boring night of work. It was after a long day at work, and the only thing that I was excited about was seeing the new Ghostbusters movie. When I first walked in the theater, I was very surprised. I thought that this was going to be a really boring movie. I mean, they don't have any real plot. I don't even think that there's any original idea. They just kind of just go from scene to scene and repeat. They had an actual story with a beginning, middle, and end, but it wasn't really executed very well. I didn't understand how they were going to do this. It seemed like they were just going to go around the city and do random things. I never really understood why they had to go to the old hospital. It's kind of a boring place. I'm sure that the old lady was supposed to be some kind of inspiration for the new woman. The movie was just boring. It wasn't funny at all. It made me sad. I hate seeing a movie like this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ (1/10)  I did not have high expectations for this movie. It was supposed to be the new Superman movie with Henry Cavill, who was so good in Man of Steel, and the cast of this movie was the biggest disappointment in the franchise. This movie was terrible. The acting was horrible, and there was so much stupidity that it was hard to take anything serious. It didn't help that the plot of this film was such a stupid mess. It also felt as though a lot of the actors and actresses in this movie had been cast because they had the biggest name recognition. I'm not even going to pretend that there was anything redeeming about this movie because there wasn't. It's like the writers and directors just knew that a movie about Superman and Batman should not be very good, and they just stuck to that. This isn't a Superman movie. This is an action movie with a Superman cameo, and it's all about Batman. The writing and acting in this film are so terrible that I really wish that they just never made this movie at all. It would have been better to have made a Superman sequel. This was just a complete waste of time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________  A movie that I have seen twice, it was just okay. The cast was fine. I don't know why they used the same actors over and over again. I know it's not a good movie, but I would have preferred to see more of a story with more characters. I think I would prefer to see the movie with a different cast. I was hoping the story would be different. The story didn't feel like a film that would have been made in the late 60s or early 70s.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________ This movie was so bad I felt like I was watching a bad episode of "CSI". The story of the movie, is that a group of scientists go to a remote island to study a strange species of animal. They are attacked by a large monster and after killing it they are attacked again by a group, who seem to have been infected by the same monster. When they escape they run into another group of people who seem even more infected and have turned into a zombie like state. When the group that the scientists were attacked by return, they decide to use a special gun that is able to stop zombies from turning back into humans. The film itself was not very good, the zombies were not very scary, and the only thing that really bothered me was that the monsters in the movie never really looked real. When you think that you are watching a movie of zombies that are actually made of humans, the fact that they never really look like people is really a disappointment. The movie was really bad and the acting was really terrible, as in it was impossible to tell who was who. The only good thing about this movie is that it was made by someone who really knows what he is doing, and it does not really have a big budget to justify the production, which is why you are probably not going to see it again. If you are looking for a good horror movie, this is probably not for you, as it is definitely not worth your time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Bad Movies (2015) 5 out of 5 stars Not bad, not great, not bad. The worst thing about this movie is the plot, it's bad. I didn't care for the characters or the acting or the writing. It's just not good. I mean, it has some good moments but it is just not the best. I also didn't find the directing or the cinematography as good as the cinematographer or the actors. I know this is not a bad film, it just isn't the best and you shouldn't see this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________   If you have seen this movie and you still have no idea how this movie was made, don't worry. You don't need to see the movie to understand this review. The movie itself is not worth your time. This movie is about a young man, Jack, who is obsessed with a girl he's seen on TV. He has been seeing her for the past two weeks and he's desperate to get to know her.   It turns out the girl is actually a sex slave for a guy who's in a drug house. The girl has been locked up for being a junkie, and the guy wants to make sure that she's not a junkies anymore.   is a pretty good movie and I have a lot of respect for the director of this movie. I think the movie is actually quite interesting, it has some good scenes in it. The main thing that I hated about this movie is the acting. It was awful. This is because the actors were too good to be in a movie like this. I found the acting very laughable. Some of the actors are even better looking in real life.  , which is a different kind of porno. The first movie, which was about a girl, was a much better film than this.is not. If you don't mind watching a bunch of naked women in a porno, this is a good one to check out. The sex scenes are very well done and the sex is real. But for me, it's not the best thing in the world to watch a bunch naked women having sex. I actually felt like I was watching a porn movie. The acting was horrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is so bad that you don't know where to start. It starts off with a guy who wants to kill his girlfriend. He goes to her house and kills her, takes her car and drives away. He then meets up with a woman who tells him about her friend, who is dying from a cancer. He decides to go and kill the guy who killed his girlfriend, so he drives to the place where the guy is, and then they start to kill him. The guy dies. And then the guy tells him, "you are my friend, I killed your girlfriend." And the guy says, "Yes, I know, but I am going to kill you next." He says, because he thinks the guy knows about his girlfriend dying from cancer. The next day, the guy wakes up in a cell. The girl is still alive and they get her to a hospital. And the girl dies there too. The movie ends with the guy telling his friend he will see him in a month.  1/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this one was so bad it was not even funny. I know the title is a reference to a book by a certain author (the one that inspired the film), but the film is a complete rip-off of the book. I've never read that book, and I had no interest in this movie, and had no clue what to expect. The movie is a parody of all sorts of movies and stories about characters that have similar personalities. The characters are the same, and they are not even remotely similar to any characters I've ever met in real life. This movie is just an over-the-top story about a crazy girl who gets out of prison and finds love, but also gets herself involved in a whole lot of crazy situations. The story is really bizarre, but the characters are so silly and so over the top. I mean, come on. The girl is crazy and has a "gift" (like a telekinetic ability) that allows her to manipulate people's emotions. The only person she can manipulate is her sister, and she's able to control anyone she wants. It's almost like she's some kind of psychotronic program. Anyway, the movie is about a group of high schoolers that are all very different from each other. The main character (who has an imaginary friend) is so crazy that the movie just goes from crazy to even crazier, and that was all the way to the end. The other characters are pretty much the same as well. It makes the movie more like a sitcom, but that's what I wanted. Anyway. The worst part about the movie was that the director was not able to get any of the actors to work. All of them were terrible, and none of them had much of a personality. This is a movie that should have never been made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ If the audience is a few people, or the main characters are not that good, then it's not a bad film. If the film has a lot of people in it and the main character is a bad one, then that's a bad, bad movie. If it's a very good film but has lots of stupid characters and bad acting, then a film with that kind of quality should be rated R. There is a reason that the people who are in the movie "The Godfather" are in that movie. They were in "The Maltese Falcon", they are in "On the Waterfront", they were in the "Godfather", they're in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes", and they are all in "Casablanca". A lot of those people, who were in those films, were great actors and great actors are in a lot more movies than those who are bad. That doesn't make them any less great actors. _________ What's so special about "Casanova"? ______________ The film is very special because it is a movie with a strong character. We are talking about a character, who is a really nice, kind, sensitive man who is in love with a beautiful, naive girl. And she is not only a girl, she is a pretty girl and she doesn't know anything about sex. And the first time he tries to have sex with her, she refuses to do it. And when she finally gives in and he tries it, she doesn`t like it and she leaves him. That's a movie about a man who, as soon as he is in a serious relationship, wants to have more than just sex. What makes "Casavana" a movie is that it has a very strong, complex, believable character, which makes it a good film. __________________  (Note: I've used the title of the movie in a different way. In my opinion, the film is "Casino". The title "Casavañana" is a Spanish word. In Spanish, the word "casa" means "house". The name Casavana was given to a villa in Monte Carlo, which was owned by the Casanova family. When the Casavans owned that house, it was used as a retreat, for their friends and relatives. The title is also a pun, because the Casavis' family is named "Casavalas", which means "the happy ones

"When I heard that he was making a movie about the Dominican street gang, I said, 'This will be different. This will be about a different kind of gang.' "  The movie, called "The Heat," is set in a Miami neighborhood and follows two young women from the Dominican community. One is a mother, and the other is a drug dealer. The film, directed by Roberto Benigni, is based on a book, "The Dominican Kidnapping," by Mark Schreck. It is the first feature film by Mr. BenignIe, whose films include "Carmen" and "Cinema Paradiso."  Mr. Bení­gi, who was born in the United States, told the Associated Press that his goal with the film was to show the complexity of the Dominican-American community.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  He said the movie "is a very good example of how you can take the good parts and make it very bad."  of the street gangs and drug dealing in Miami, and that he hoped the film would encourage young people to join gangs and help them to break away from their parents.  and to have the film be a positive portrayal of the community. The director, who is also a producer, said he wanted to give his audience an honest view of life in the ghetto.  the film, which is being screened at film festivals in New York and Los Angeles, "is not a documentary," he said. "It is a film about street life. It has some good parts."  to give the audience an accurate picture of the neighborhood, the director said, he had to be very specific in the characters' descriptions of the places they lived and where they went.  in the film's first 15 minutes, the film shows how the women in the neighborhood get their clothes and food. In the first 20 minutes, Mr. de Leon explains the street gang culture, and how their relationship to the drug dealers works. In its last two minutes, it shows the women being shot, stabbed and murdered. . "I hope the audience sees the characters not as victims but as people with a strong desire to change

Write a negative review about a bad movie:             The film opens with a woman, played by Jennifer Beals, walking down a city street, her head down, her body in a state of perpetual motion. Her eyes are closed and her thoughts are lost. Then, from the sidewalk, a woman dressed as a nun runs over to her, grabs her arm, and says: "Get up!" The nun, played here by a lovely woman named Barbara Hershey, tells her to get up and, with a smile on her face, begins to lead her toward a chapel, where she will be blessed. This scene, while it is set in a city, is so simple and ordinary that it is almost like the opening of a horror movie. Yet, if you look carefully, you'll see that it's not quite right.  In the first part of the film, a group of children, dressed in black, is chasing a man dressed as an angel. He jumps out of the sky and chases the children, and we see his face in silhouette on the ground. But when the children find the angel, they find him to be a man, and they chase him down. The man, in his angelic disguise, falls into a lake and is killed by a group swimming around him. As he is killed, the boy who chased him falls into the water.  the man is the devil, and the boy is the Christian, who in his innocence is deceived by the devil. The devil, as it turns out, is a man named Michael, who is the ruler of hell. The Christian, played at the start by a man who looks like Tom Hanks, is his son. Michael is in the process of convincing the Christian to follow him, and he is wearing a red suit with a white shirt.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ How many times can one watch a movie and think: _______________________ (That is one of my favorite quotes from the movie.) I was so excited to watch this movie, that I was ready to start a movie marathon, and I watched it two more times.  I was expecting a fun film about the first person shooter genre, but I was shocked at how much I hated it. _______________ (I really do love the movie, it's not a bad film, but it's a completely different film.) I loved the action scenes, and it had all the necessary elements to make me want to watch it. The characters were likable, and had a great sense of humor, but the story was so dull, that it made me bored to death. ______________________ (I love the character of M) ____________ (I didn't even know who she was.) I thought this was a fun movie, but this was the first movie that I saw this year where I did not feel like I had a blast. I wanted to go to the theatre to see it again, but after the third time watching it, I didn't want to bother. ______________________________ (My review) ____________________ ______________ I loved this movie. ____________________________________________________________________________ I am so glad I watched this movie! ______________________________________________________________ This is an awesome movie. I loved how the plot was so well thought out and everything was wrapped up with the right amount of humor. The acting was great, the action was awesome, and the music was great. I can't wait to see this movie again. __________________________________________________ This movie is great.    This is my favorite movie of the year.  The characters are likable and the story is very good. I think it was a great film to see before the Christmas season.  Thank you for watching this movie!!!! ______________________________________________ This movie was good.  This movie will make you laugh.  I thought it was good but not great. This movie has all the right elements to be good, but didn't really have anything that made me want more.  But, this movie was fun.  I enjoyed this movie very much.  It was very well written and I thought the acting was very good! The plot was interesting, the plot didn't drag on too long and the characters were very likable. I thought they did a great job.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!The movie sucks. The movie is a total piece of crap. It has been done many times before. It's not a very good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________  You know what they say about a film that's so bad that it's good.   You just don't have to have seen the movie. It's just so bad and so uninspired that it will make your blood boil.   and not a good way to spend your time.  The whole film is about a character, John, who is an expert at making films, but doesn't know what to make of his own, so he starts to write a movie for his kids, a "Movies for Kids" movie. This is all well and good until the director tells John to start on the screenplay and give it a title that will help the kids find the movie on DVD, "Candy Man".   Candyman, or "Cinematic Caper" as I'll call it, is a terrible movie. The script is horrendous, with no sense of humour, and the acting is just dreadful. I couldn't believe that this was a movie that was being made and made by a guy who was supposed to know how to make a movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The best movie I have ever seen is a horror film that takes place in a small town and features a couple of characters that I really don't care about. "I'm the type of person who likes to watch horror movies and I like to go to the movies. I had seen this film before and thought it was great. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. It was so cheesy, it didn't make sense, and it made me feel bad. It felt like they just made up an ending. The ending of the film was a little too easy and didn't seem realistic. I don't know why they would make up a ending like that. It really didn't fit into the story, and I feel like they didn't even have a reason to make it that way. " -Troy I'm glad I watched this movie. I saw it the day it was released and it really wasn't bad. The story wasn't the best, but that's because the film is a little more realistic. It's a little longer than you would expect a horror movie to be, but the story really didn It's a pretty cool movie. The main characters are pretty cool. There are a lot of jokes and you really get a kick out of them. They're all pretty funny and it's very dark, but there's also a little bit of humor in there. The acting was good, and there's a lot going on, and the movie is dark. It has some really good gore scenes and I really like that it's a horror and it doesn't feel like it's over the top. It didn't have a whole lot of laughs either. But the action and the plot were pretty good. I also liked that it was made in the 80's. It reminded me a little of the movies like A Nightmare on Elm Street. It had a little horror movie feel and it was pretty good, but it was not my favorite. I'm glad that I watched it, but I don the movie doesn't have much of a story. The action wasn't very good either. The characters weren't very interesting, and most of the time I didn,t even care about them. It wasn't a bad horror movie, but as a horror it just didn't stand out for me. I would have liked to see more story and a little better acting. But it was okay. It wouldn't make it to a perfect 10, but if you

Then I watched it again and saw the movie, and it was soooo terrible that it made me feel like I had seen a horrible movie before. I hated the acting in this movie. I don't even think any of the actors were good at their jobs. This is a bad one to watch. I think it's terrible. I'm going to give it an 8/10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ This movie was awful. The whole movie was a disaster, with nothing good happening. We had to wait until the end to see our main character, the villain, get killed. We also had to watch him get killed over and over again, and then die. I found the movie very dull and I found that I wanted it to end even though the ending made no sense. It is a horrible movie and I can't believe how it made it to the big screen. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You just had to be there.  It was a nightmare.  I had seen this movie at a screening in a local theater.   I am sure it was good, I have seen many great horror films.  The plot of the film is that a couple, the guy and the gal, are staying at a cabin and the wife was getting really sick.  It started out ok, but she passed out and the guy woke her up and she started acting strange.  I was not sure what was going on, but it was creepy.  After she was woken up, she ran into the garage and started going through all of her things.  She opened a cabinet and took out a key and opened a closet.  Then she pulled out a pistol and started shooting at a man in the living room.  At first I thought she was kidding.  When the guy started running for the garage, the wife shot him twice.  Once in the head, and once in the stomach.  He dropped and rolled down the garage.  And then she shot him a third time.  They put him on the ground and the woman walked over and started punching him in the face.  This went on for a few more minutes and she then picked up a rifle and shot at him in a different room.  The guy was in a corner in a closet when the wife came up and shot him three more times.  Finally, she started throwing things at the man and when she walked over to him she just dropped the rifle and ran off.  A guy in a nearby trailer came over and picked the guy up and took him to the hospital.    He had a huge bullet hole in his stomach.   The guy never came out of the hospital and the lady never gave her name.  To this day I have no idea who she was or why she did what she did.    "  So why would this happen in a movie theater?  The answer is pretty simple.  Most movies have a rating of PG or PG-13.  In this case, there was no rating.  If the movie had been rated PG, then there would have been some sort of warning or something that would have warned the audience.  However, this was not rated.  That was because it was not a movie.  Some of the actors are actual people, including a few that are famous.  So the audience was not warned

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ It was all over the place. I don't know why I watched it, I don`t remember much. The main character is a man in a wheelchair who falls in love with a beautiful woman. The woman becomes sick and he becomes very attached to her. They fall in love but are too attached to each other to get married. He starts to be ill again and they must live without each other. There are other things about the movie that are silly, but it was an ok movie. The only thing I don´t like about it is the ending. I never saw the movie but I read an article about it and I found that the ending was very confusing and I didn´t know what was going to happen next. The movie was only 90 minutes long but I would give it more if it was better. _______________ It´s the same as all the other movies in this series, the story is a little bit stupid, the acting is very bad, the characters are very stupid, but the plot is ok, the film is very long, the scenes are too long, and the ending is bad. It is ok for the first part, the first half is ok but it is boring and has a lot of scenes that should have been cut out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ What an abysmal movie! I could not find the motivation to go out and watch it, and instead I watched it over and over again. The only reason I came across it was because of a review I read in a book I was reading. I was disappointed by it. It was one of those films that I would have left alone in the late 80's or early 90's, and then suddenly found it was good! It had a nice, slow, and quiet pace, and was easy to watch. The movie was very well written. The acting was pretty good. The plot was simple and very interesting, but it was really nothing more than a rehash of the Vietnam War, and the fact that the characters in it were all white (and I am not a fan of the color yellow either) made it feel very dated and very anti-American. I think that the writers of this movie knew that the American people were so sick of the war that they would not tolerate a rehashing of it. I have not seen the sequel, but I imagine that the story is the same, and that they are simply trying to get a little more money out of the American public. This is a very bad movie, and it will have you wishing for some sort of a sequel to make it seem like a worthwhile movie. I would recommend that you watch this film at a slower pace. I understand that it was made in 1990, and since it is a war film, it should have a slower, more realistic, and realistic story. I wish that they could have made this movie in the 60's, because this movie would have been much better, and not made with the same intentions.

If it is so bad, why was it released, if it was so good, why wasn't it released? The actors are not the best, the script is so horrible, and the acting is so low... I could not believe it when I was watching it. The worst thing about this movie... Is that it's not a bad film... But it is a bad piece of trash, with the acting being the worst, and with the script so bad and so bad that it was impossible to follow...

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ I was very surprised by the quality of the movie. The movie starts off with an awesome montage where we see a little girl and her mother walking through a forest. The mother looks at the little girl with a very sad look and says "I wonder if she will ever find her father. " It's a very touching scene, but then suddenly, it gets cut off, and the mother gets off and is seen again. The little girl is then seen on the screen again, and she is sitting on the side of a hill. Then the movie cuts to the little boy who is sitting next to the girl. Then, the mother goes and gets on her horse and goes to the other side of the hill. The camera then cuts to her and we see her talking to the boy. Then she gets off the horse and sits down next to him and they are just staring at each other. The next scene shows the little man with the sword walking down the road. The boy starts walking after him and when he gets there, the boy walks in front of him. They start talking and the little sword guy is saying "Hey! What's up?" and the boy says "Hey!" then they start kissing and they walk into a house and the next scene is the mother running after them. She runs right up to the door and they kiss again and the camera pulls out. It is then cut back to the first boy and the girl walking through the woods. The first boy says, "Look! We're not alone!" and then he gets cut to a close up of the girl looking at the woods and he says "That's a nice view, isn't it? I'll show you." and then they are in the woods, and they look at a tree and the tree falls on the boy and he dies. They continue walking through trees and there are flowers in the trees and then the mother says, "...but why did he have to die like that?" and then she runs up to him, and looks at him, then the girl looks at her and they both look at the tree and it falls on her and she dies. The second boy is then shown in a very long shot looking down at the boy who has a long white shirt on and a long black skirt. The girl is looking at her mother, who is also a long shot. Then they walk back into the house, and then we see them walking back out into the forest. It's cut to the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did not like this movie at all. The acting was not so good. It was like an actor was being asked to perform in a movie. I felt like they were just trying to get the actors attention by having them talk about how they want to be in movies. They all had their own way of doing it, and they all talked so fast it was hard to listen. It is not a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The film is not bad, but it's not good either. There is a plot, but the characters have no depth. The movie is full of clichés, like the girl's father is a nice man, and the brother who's just out of high school, and a few other clichés. The film is like the first one: the movie is about an evil witch who kidnaps a child and turns her into a witch. The problem with this movie is that it is about a movie, but there are no good characters. In other words, the movie can't do anything, and even when there is a villain, there are just so many of them that they can never stand out. " - Raul Riera (movie critic)

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  A man who has no job and no way out of his financial troubles is sent to a job-training center in order to learn how to be a successful small business owner. When he gets there, he discovers that there is no work to be done and that the center does nothing to improve his situation. He spends his days and nights at the center, working hard to make a living. In his free time he plays cards and hangs out with his friends, occasionally going on long walks, but this is about all he does. In the center there is a woman who loves the man and is willing to help him, but only if he promises to stop smoking. The man agrees, but when he comes to realize that she is not the one who has given him the job, he breaks the deal. In a cruel twist of fate, she finds him and begins to teach him how to get along with others. However, when he returns home and discovers that he is broke again, he realizes that he cannot survive alone. He decides to make his way back to the center and find a job. In addition to being a sad story, it is also a very touching film because it shows the heart-wrenching pain of being poor and alone.  1/5 stars.  I think this is one of those movies that is not a bad film, but that one just doesn't have that "wow" factor. I really liked this movie, but I didn't love it, so it didn't get a five-star rating.

The dollhouse is a really creepy place. The little boy is really mean to the little girl because he doesn't want her to have a big brother. The movie ends with Lala running away from the doll house. This was so horrible. I could not stand watching it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I can't say I'm a big fan of horror movies. I was expecting something different, but it was actually a lot of the same. This movie was really boring and it made me hate the whole cast."  I'm sorry, what?? You were expecting something a little different?  The story was terrible. The characters were not interesting and they were all over the place. The way that the movie was told was very bad. You are forced to watch the film in 2 different parts, each of which was kind of confusing and it was hard to follow the plot.  The main character was just a very boring character. I guess the producers thought that this was going to be a big hit with the viewers, but they were wrong.    "The film is not bad, but there are too many scenes and the plot was hard for me to understand."   You know what, let me tell you something. I think that this movie should have been called "The Horror of Horror World".   The only thing that was great about the movie were the music and the art.  If you are interested in horror, watch the movie called "Scream of the Night", it is also a good movie.  Scream Of The Night -  The movie was not good, but this is the most unique and most original horror film ever made!  The Movie "Scary Movie 3: The Final Chapter" (1992) - I think this is a great movie!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!! This movie is awful and I can't believe they put it out.!!! Why would they do this to us?!!!  This movie is so terrible and I feel bad for the actor who plays the son.!!!!!!! I can't wait to see the movie in the theater and I hope it gets a little better.!!!!!!!!!!  A terrible movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What a terrible movie that I'm not even going to watch this movie but I want to.????????  I think this movie is just horrible, and I wish that the cast would get fired. The cast and crew were not funny and the actors were horrible, it was awful.  My first thought after watching this was "I know I have seen this movie, but it is not even funny, and it's a disaster." I didn't even finish this movie and I was a little sad to see this movie. It's like a bad dream come true. I don't want to watch the movie anymore. -Jennifer  The only positive thing I can say about this film is that the "bad guy" is an asshole who is a real pain in the ass. I will never watch this again.  I will say this though, he has a lot of good qualities and the movie doesn't paint him as the villain. I hope he gets some work as a detective or something. I thought it was very strange he was playing this guy and I didn the idea he was evil. He is just trying to be the hero. I was like "This guy's an asshole!" He's really annoying, but he's a good actor.  the only thing I really liked about this movie was the music.  for a movie this bad, it's pretty catchy.  of course the acting sucks and the music is bad but this is a great movie. I'm sorry this movie ruined it for me. .  in all this movie sucks but it's not bad at all. I liked it better than the original but I would never watch it again. It was just too bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   1. The movie opens with a woman having sex with a man while his back is turned to her.  2. She turns around to see that he has turned away and now is looking at her as he finishes. She screams in horror.  the movie is not bad, just a little over-long and stupid.   I thought the movie was funny, but I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I would have liked. I don`t like people with small, tiny bodies. They are not attractive and I think the women in the movie are also too small for them. The men are attractive, but they are also not large.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. So this movie is terrible. The movie starts out with a scene of a couple on the bed with the man being the one who is in a hurry to get into bed. The man is talking about how he's been looking at a woman for awhile now, and the woman is telling him that she's a virgin. This is a little too early, and it makes it a little hard to understand. The woman then tells the man she wants to go out, and if she is going to do that, she wants him to accompany her. Then the movie cuts to a shot of a little boy in the window. He's playing a piano, and he's singing a song about how his daddy is a great man. The father comes in and says, "You must sing a song for your daddy." So the father tells the little boy to play the piano, "and sing something for your Daddy." The father says, then he says, and then he repeats, "Sing something for Daddy." And the little girl does as she's told. And then the father says that it was a great song, and that he really enjoyed it. So then the little baby starts crying, and so the father takes her away from the window and he says that he will be back to pick her up in a moment. Then he leaves, and after a moment, the father comes back in, and says that she was a very good girl, and her daddy really enjoyed what she sang. Then in the last scene of the movie, the man and the little kid go out to play. They go out on a little porch. And as they are walking, the little guy stops in front of a house. The guy says, now, I'm gonna take this little house and I'm going to make it big." And then they go into the house. And when they get inside, the guy says to the little house, "Why don't you stay with me a little while?" And then he goes to the front door and opens it, and as he opens the door, he says to his little daughter, "Come in here, little girl." And she walks right in. And the man says, when you are old enough, you will come with me." Then the man leaves the house, and when he goes back in the house he says he doesn't want to go back into the little porch anymore. So he closes the door and locks it. And he walks out of
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "In this movie, I really enjoyed it and it did a great job of getting me hooked on horror and suspense movies.  It's not a good movie and I can't recommend it.  However, I think I enjoyed the movie so much because of how different it was from any other horror movie I've ever seen.  The whole movie has a very different feel from any of the other horror movies I've seen. I think it has a much better plot.  It had the right mixture of suspense and suspense with lots of action and blood and guts and death.  I felt that this movie would have been a better movie if they could have used a different director and they would have made a better film.   The ending was also very out of place and did not make much sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ I have read reviews about this movie and they all said that this movie is a horrible movie. This movie is not good and i dont know what they were watching when they made this movie. Its just not funny and is just a bad film. This is a bad story with a bad plot. Its about a guy that wants to take a shower and he goes to the bathroom and he has to find the bathroom that has the shower in it. But then when he is in there, he sees a man in the shower. This guy walks up to him and starts talking to him. The guy walks out of the shower and it is a girl and she starts talking too and it turns out she is the one that stole the shower from him. This was a bad idea and it was made by a guy with a little sense of humor. I would not recommend this to anyone.

I mean, you know, it is all about the script. It is about the story. It has a good script. The story has a funny script.  in the end of the day, all these things matter. The script is what matters, and I believe this is what the movie is. I am not sure if it is the right movie for me. I don't know if it will be a great movie for a certain type of audience. But, if you don't like the way the actors do their thing, you should pass.

The rest of the line is pretty funny, but I'm not a huge fan of the death of the Captain. I don't think he was too likable, but he didn't seem like the type of character that would try to murder or torture someone.   "So when do we leave?"   It's pretty obvious that he was going to die, so why not jump out of water when he's told to do it? That was pretty much the worst part of it. The movie seems to be going in a more serious direction with the whole "The film is based on a true story" thing, so maybe that's why they wanted to avoid it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________   - The actors were great, and they had fun with it, but they could have made it a lot funnier if they had kept more of a serious tone.   "I've been in a lot of crazy movies," said Michael Caine in an interview with Playboy magazine in 1994. "But this is the craziest one."  "The film is a classic, but the acting is not," said Caine. "There are a lot more jokes than jokes. The humor is all over the place."   The cast also included:   Dennis Quaid as a wealthy New York businessman who hires a man named Frank (Richard Lewis) to take care of his money.  .   the money he was going to spend on the movie went into his bank account.   and it's just plain wrong.   a big part of the movie is his trying to get out of paying Frank the money, and he has to do it with a combination of intimidation, deception, and even blackmail.  , a great part of my problem is the way the movie's been treated by critics. the first reviewer for Rotten Tomatoes (who hated it) said, "this is a movie for children, and for those who are too old to know what is going on."  , the first review for "The French Connection" said, that it's "just a bad story with a bad ending."    - The acting is great, but most of the jokes are cheesy. I remember a scene in which a young girl tells her friend she wants to become a ballerina and goes to the ballet class, and she's so good, the guy is jealous.   The scene was played for laughs, but in a bad way.   I think it was more of an insult to the character.  's director, Paul Schrader, is known for the movies, "Candyman" and "Taxi Driver," and this movie was a good example of how his films are usually made.   in the film, it is not funny.  - When the young boy is dying, he has a heart attack. The old guy says, "Don't worry. I'm a doctor. I know how to make a patient live forever." The young boy asks, "How?" and the old guy replies, "I'll show you."   "He was being played by a child actor, and it was so offensive," said the film
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it's always the same story.  It's always about a young boy who is in love with a girl he's never met.  the girl he loves turns out to be a complete psychopath and the boy is killed.  It's never clear if the guy is really dead or just knocked out and they just let him die.  The whole thing is very boring and has nothing to do with the plot.  There's only a few minor characters and they all die off and the main character dies after a couple of scenes.  This is the only thing that I didn't like about this movie.  Movie Rating: 1/5

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a fan of horror, but this movie has to be one of the worst. I didn't find any blood in this movie, but there were a lot of scenes where the camera was panning over the victims in the background. It was pretty obvious that the people were all shot and the victims were not shot at all. There were no sounds of gunshots or screams, and the characters were not moving around at all, they just stood there, dead. The special effects in this were really poor and they made it look like a real horror movie. The director and actors didn't seem to care about the effect at all because they didn't even try to make it look realistic. The gore scenes were also terrible, they were too realistic and the movie wasn't scary at all except for one scene that was so creepy. The only good thing I could say about this movie is that it was a sequel, but I can't believe they didn,t do better with this movie.  If you want to watch a scary movie with some blood and gore, then go ahead and watch the original, but for me this is the worst movie of the trilogy, especially since I have seen it three times now. My Rating: 1/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  - The cinematography is terrible.  This movie should be called "The Camera Is Broken".  It's so bad you can see your brain in it.  I would have given this a 10 if the movie didn't have so much plot.   - There's no way that a film could make a film about the American Red Cross.  I have no idea how a movie could have a plot about something other than the war in Europe.  - The movie has some pretty cool special effects, but the way the special effects are shot makes them look cheap.  The special effects should have been shot in a studio.  It would have been better to use a lot of practical effects.  This movie is about the first week of the war, and there were not that many special effects. The first half of the movie has a very bad special effects shot, and then they start using some real effects in the second half.  That's just wrong.  If they would have done the movie right the first time, then the special effect shots would have looked like they were from the film version of the first part of the book.  For me, the movie looked like a cheap TV movie made for the military.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  I was at a screening of the first "Spider-Man" movie in the theater when they began showing the preview of "The Amazing Spider-Man." At that point in the movie, the screen was full of Spider-Men in high heels. When the trailer came on, the camera pans up and out from a large group of people. The camera shows a group of women, and we see that there are several Spider-Women. Then we get a good look at them in the crowd. I was really shocked and upset. I'm a feminist, but I can't stand the idea of women being treated like objects, and this movie was doing it. I don't want to give them any credit for creating a "Spider" movie, but it certainly did not have to be like this. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only good thing about it was that we got to see two different actresses as the same person. I would not recommend this movie to any woman, and I would feel that it is extremely sexist to make a movie where women are treated like sex objects.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________ This is a story of a poor boy who loses his way in a big city. I was so surprised by the way this movie turned out. I didn't expect it to be as dark as it was, but it was still a very dark film. The acting was all right, and it was nice to see that they got some actors who can act, which was a good sign. It was a nice change from the last couple of movies in this series. I liked the way the film was shot. There are scenes that are just beautiful to look at. The way it looked, the way it was lit, and the way that the actors and the camera moves made it look like a great film. This film was really good. It wasn't perfect, but I still really liked it. I hope they make more movies. This was a fun watch, but not a great one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________   A couple of months ago, I started watching the movie "The Godfather". As the film went on, I was fascinated to see how different it would have been if this is how it would've gone down had the whole thing been told in Italian. It's one thing to read the novel and then watch the movie. It is another thing to watch a movie with your eyes and ears open. You can tell from the first minutes that the film is not going to be a very good movie. The first half of the film features a couple of really bad performances. The acting is good enough, but the character of Al Capone is so bland, you wonder why they bothered to make this movie at all. Then, in the middle of the movie, a few scenes are added that really bring out the best of Capone. I can only imagine how much fun it would be to make a movie about that guy. I hope that the movie maker gets a good cast to play that part. If I had a dime for every time I heard "Capone is a very old man, why do we need to see him again?," I would be rich.   I have seen this movie in a few different theaters and in the different languages. I don't know why I am giving this a 3-star rating. I guess I am too much of a pessimist, but I can't say that I enjoyed it. I liked the novel better. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a good, slow paced story with a good story.  …

It wasn't a huge problem because there were other scenes that were better than the scene where the guy is falling to his death. The action scene was good because it had some really good fight scenes. The acting of the actors were good and it's good that they didn't have any bad performances. It was really funny to see how the movie ended, because it didn't end very well. I think that the ending of the film was a bit silly. It made me think that it would be better if it was a different movie, because this is really a short movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ The most depressing movie I've seen in a long time. It was so sad that I wanted to cry but I couldn't, even though the acting was terrible. I can't even explain how depressing this movie is. I guess this movie was supposed to be about an artist's struggle with the reality of his art and all the struggles he had in life. But the movie is really about how a man is a terrible person, how he's not a real artist and how he was forced to be a bad person by circumstances, all the problems he had, and the life he had to lead. He made art and now he can't live the life. The movie is full of contradictions. And that's not what I liked about it. The most disappointing part of this movie to me was the fact that it didn't seem to have a purpose. It's just a depressing movie that was made by a man with a sad past and an unhealthy obsession with his art. It didn't have any point to it.

I was watching it for the first time and I wasn't disappointed. The movie is about a man (George Clooney) who decides to quit acting and get a real job at a real office and to have a real life. It's not a typical movie. The main character is a nice guy. I think he may have been born with a silver spoon in his mouth. The director is an interesting character. The way he was able to tell a good story was something that really impressed me. The acting was good. The dialogue was excellent.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________. _________. _______. This movie is so terrible and boring. There are very few things I can say to praise it. It's the same as the previous movies that I have seen. The director tries to change up the story and make it more original. It doesn't work. The story is just the same. The same old story of a poor little girl who lives with her grandma. She is forced to go out to the town for a picnic. When she gets there she finds out that there is a bunch of children who want to kill her. The kids come up with a plan to lure her in the woods and kill her but she manages to survive. They tell her that she is going to be the queen of the jungle and that she will have all the boys. They also tell her to kill the other children, to get them out of the way, to be in charge. She tries to stop them and she fails. They try to kill a little boy but he gets away. They find a little girl but she is already dead. She goes back to her home but it's locked. She comes to the conclusion that she has to get a key and she does. When they try to get in she finds that they have made a secret door and they have tied up her father and her mother. She gets in the room and she is shocked to find that her parents are dead. The movie ends with a little child who is scared and crying. She finds a key. It turns out that she found the key to the secret door. She puts the key in the secret doorway and it opens. She runs away from the town but they follow her and kill the little boy. The little girl gets to the forest and finds the key again. She opens the secret gate and she escapes. She walks through the jungle to a big tree and she finds a map of the town. She writes a letter to her father but he has gone away. She gives the map to her mother but she also has gone and she doesn't know where he is. She decides to follow the map and she goes to a village. The villagers don't know who she is and she gets a little village boy to read the letter for her. They think that she's crazy and they don't want her to leave the village. But she does and she runs away. This is the only good part of the movie. It was interesting to see the characters develop and to see how

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why did this bad movie get so many awards? This movie is a waste of time, and if you are looking for a good laugh, you are going to be disappointed. This is a terrible movie, and the plot is so stupid, it makes me think the writers of the movie didn't read any of the books or watch any of these movies. This movie was written by a group of people who can't think of anything else but making a movie about a little girl who is trapped in a house with a terrible monster. The writers were not able to think of any new plot twist. The only new idea they come up with is that the monster is also a child who was taken away from his mother. This little girl, called Annie, is trapped inside this house with an evil monster, but she's able to kill the monster. This girl also has to face her past in order to solve this monster's problems. The movie is not even funny, as it just makes no sense. The monster's story is so weak that it just seems like they want to make a cheap movie. I hate that they took the characters from these books and made a bad monster movie about them. I think this movie is just the same as all the other bad monster movies that are made, and they don't even try to make any good movies out of it. I give this movie a 0 out of 10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      1. The movie is about a guy who gets a job as a trucker. But he gets fired. He has to find another job and he does. He gets a second chance to do trucking and he gets his first chance. He does it well and it pays off. He is now the leader of the truckers. It is a pretty good movie but not the best. The main bad thing about it is the character. The bad guy is very weak and the movie is a lot better if you think about the character a bit. I think the main thing is the movie's idea. I am not a fan of that idea. But it works. I did like the movie a lot. The acting is pretty good. I liked the character's personality. I really enjoyed it.

Don't miss this one."  - John Carpenter   The film is an adaptation of a novel by Stephen King and it was filmed in the style of a noir movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ The Worst of Them All _________  A movie I watched on a flight from LAX to San Francisco. I was really disappointed with the movie and I have to say it was the worst of the worst. I loved all the bad movies that I saw on a plane but this movie was the most pathetic and unoriginal movie I have ever seen. I have seen a lot of bad movies and some of the actors from this movie are better than some of those actors from those other bad movies. The movie was just so bad and there were some really funny parts. If you want to see a movie that makes you want the guy to die or kill the guy, go see this movie. The only thing that I like about this movie is that it was in black and white and it was a really cheap movie. It was just boring. It just was a horrible movie that I couldn't get past.

I was surprised at how many of the songs they used. The ending was a little confusing but not too bad. The film itself is fairly short.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ It is not a bad picture. It's just that it has a bad script. I know it sounds crazy but it really is true. If this movie was made in the 80s it would be a hit! The actors all did great and the girls were hot! This was an excellent example of the "bigger is better" approach to acting. The movie is a good example of how to make a movie. It is set in the late 80s and it shows you how to act and how to present a story. The acting was good, the movie had a lot of action and lots of sex scenes. The sex scenes were very good and there were some really great lines. It wasn't as good as The Running Man but it was good. The plot was pretty good. I enjoyed the story and the characters. The ending was a little weak but it's not a big deal. I really liked the movie and I think the movie is worth seeing. ___________ I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good action movie with good acting. _________________  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great fun! I liked this movie! The action was great. The story was funny, with a twist that is always good. It was hard to find a problem with the film. The only thing that disappointed me was the bad sound and picture.  Rating: 4 outta 5  Reviewer: Anonymous from San Diego, Ca. - May 11, 2016  Subject: Interesting and well made story. Good production value, and the acting was strong, especially the supporting roles. The director, Brian De Palma, makes good use of the many angles of a single camera. The editing was smooth and accurate, and all of the scenes played out in a very smooth manner. The main character, John, had a strong performance.  a good story.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not saying that this movie is bad. It's not bad at all. I just don't like it. I was watching the movie, thinking "Oh, it'll be okay". It's a remake of a movie that came out in the 80's called "The Day The Earth Stood Still". But, I never watched that movie. So, I wasn't expecting that this remake will be bad. And, I was right! It's just a mediocre remake. There are no big memorable characters. The story is pretty lame. And most of all, it's a slow, boring movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________ I love to watch movies. I don't really have a favorite, but when I find something I enjoy, I'll pick it up. I'm a sucker for any kind of movie that has some kind of a plot. I'll watch anything that's set in the past. So, when I found a movie that had a story and some good characters, I was excited to watch it. So far, I've liked it. The story has been a little predictable, but at the same time, it's not bad. There are some good acting moments, some funny moments, and some really good set pieces. I haven't yet seen the movie in the theater, but so far I've enjoyed it enough to give it a 3. I hope they find a way to make it in a bigger budget movie.

I like a lot of the old 80's action films, but this one was just too boring for me. I don't know why it was called "The Predator". I'm not sure how it got made, but it didn't make me want to go see it. I wish the studio had done a different version of it. There was some really cool action sequences, but in my opinion the movie was just a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Dark Knight Returns is the perfect example of a film where a script can be great, and a story can be just fine, but it gets lost in the muck of the editing. This film is a direct sequel to the first movie, and yet the second one is nowhere near as good. There are a couple of things to discuss here, and they relate to the film's editing, which is by far the worst of any Batman film, and the worst acting of the entire series. The editing in this film is horrible, and it really has nothing to do with the film.  The editing is horrible because it is bad, and not because it was done by somebody with a lot of editing experience. The problem is that Christopher Nolan is not a great editor. He seems to think he is a great one, but his editing style is so bad that you don't know if it was a conscious decision or just the result of bad luck. The bad editing in The Dark Knight was just a result of how bad the story was. In fact, the story is terrible.  The story goes that the Joker (I'm not going to talk about his voice, he is so annoying that you might as well not mention it) has taken over Gotham, and now wants to kill the Mayor (this guy is always in the news), and take over the city. The Batman has been forced to call in the GCPD, but the Joker has already got a group of people waiting for them. Batman is then forced to fight a group that has been posing as the GCPS, and have them take down a bunch of clowns. The whole scene is terrible, and has everything to do to do about the story.    The problem with this scene is that it starts out as a funny scene with a bunch clowns, but then changes into a really bad joke that really ruins the scene. The Joker is so awful that he even makes his own group of clown-looking thugs to kill Batman. Batman then has to go into his cave and take on all of them at once. The ending of this scene really ruins what was supposed to be a good scene, and you just want to laugh at the ending, but don't. It's just so awful. It would have been a great scene if they had just left it alone, but that wasn't the director's plan. The only reason the film was good was because the story wasn't terrible.  If you don

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The film starts out with a scene that is quite a bit like the opening of a bad action movie. It is the end of the world and we see a lot of people screaming. We see a very young girl with a dead body in the foreground. The girl's head is completely covered by her black hair, which is a good visual representation of the girl's soul being buried in her hair. It's a very depressing scene. The rest of the film starts with this scene, and it continues throughout the entire movie. The film starts in the same manner as the first film. The main character has been kidnapped by a madman and he has decided to make her his bride. The man, who looks like a clown, kidnaps a group of children, and they are taken to a castle in the middle of the woods. They are placed in a cage in the center of the castle. We don't know who the madman is, and he seems to have some kind of mental problems. They also don't really know how to act. They start to act out, like they are in a circus. There is a very loud clown in the background, who is playing a trick on them. It doesn't matter what they do; they are just a bunch of kids that have been captured by a monster. They have no clue how to get out of the cage. At the beginning, the clown seems to be joking with them, but then they start to behave as they are supposed to behave. They act as if they are doing their job. There are also a lot more people in the cage than there are in the first movie. This is just one more way that the film plays out. We find out that the man is a magician, and his wife is a witch. They tell us that they were in the circus and they fell in love with the circus acts. They started to kidnap children to take them to the circus. The clown, who has taken care of the children, has been doing so for a long time. There was a time when the clown had two daughters and a son. They were all very beautiful, and this man just couldn't get rid of them. After they started to perform, he couldn't stand them anymore. He made a pact with the devil. He asked the devil to take care of them and take care that they don't make any noise. The devil agreed and gave him three children. The children look like they have been taken
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** ********* This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. I mean this is a movie that shows a girl getting raped and murdered by a group of people. This is an old movie and if it had been on TV a couple of decades ago, it would've been taken seriously. But now it is just trashy entertainment. It shows nothing but how bad the movie was. The movie doesn't even have a beginning and a middle. It has a long boring way to go from the first to the last act. The way the movie is done is so lame. They should have been given a couple more years to make a decent movie. It would've made the movie better. They did not even try. The best part is the ending. It's like a stupid joke. I don't know why they did that. It really makes me angry. It just makes me think how horrible the world is today. And this movie just made it even worse. This movie really makes my blood boil. This film was a bad decision for Universal. It was bad for Hollywood. And it's bad for society. I really hope that one day we can go back to the good old days. It is the time to kill the movie stars. The world would be so much better off without them. But then again, what is the point?

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  1 out of 1 found this review helpful.  Helpful for an interesting read and a nice little bit of comedy, but there's no substance in this. It has a nice gimmick of the young kid who is trying to make a movie that will make a fortune. He hires the actors that are more than capable, but they are given no lines and the plot is never explained. It's all about the young guy making his film and not about his characters. The best part of the movie is the ending, which is hilarious. There's no other way to put it.   The worst part is that this movie is available for free, so why not watch it. The acting isn't that great, and there is some weird acting in it, but if you want to watch a movie with a good script and actors that really do a good job with what they are being paid for, this is the movie for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Analyzes the plot of "The Exorcist" with a bit of a different perspective. I've seen the film twice, once as a child, and once as an adult. Both times I found the plot very confusing and the film very poor. I had no clue as to who the main character was, who the antagonist was, and why I was watching the movie. The only thing that made it worth watching again was the ending, which was a bit too abrupt, but the ending was what it was. A strange twist. The film had a very dark mood, and although the characters were very likable, it seemed like the movie was just a cheap ploy to try and grab your attention. I really hope that they make a better movie out of this one. This film has a lot of potential, and I hope it gets a better release. I'd like to see a remake of the movie, because it was pretty great in my opinion.

The characters are all lame, the plot is stupid, and all the jokes are very bad. It doesn't even try to be a good movie. It really sucks, you just want to stop watching this movie. I hate to say it, but I think this movie is about a bunch of people who are always having fun and having sex. There's no real story in this movie, but there are a bunch (or a lot) of people having fun. It should be funny to me, because it's a porno. But it's not. It is just an average movie. If you don't like porno, don't watch it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. It's like a bad drug: _______ that has been used for years, and the effects of the drug wear off in a few days. This is the movie that should be remembered by the millions who have seen it and who will never be able to enjoy it again. It has no redeeming quality whatsoever, it is a boring and unoriginal movie. The characters are very boring, and they have no sense of humor. If the movie had been made in 1940, this would have been the movie of choice. The story is so poorly written that it was not worth the time of the viewer. There is only one story line in the movie. It is about a young man named Bill, who lives with his mother and sister. Bill's mother is a very unhappy person. Bill is an excellent athlete, and he is going to the University of Virginia. His sister is a spoiled little brat who is always complaining about her parents. When Bill is about to leave for school, his mother, who is a drunk, takes the car keys from him, takes his bicycle, and drives away. Bill goes to his room to sleep. In his bed is a young girl. He doesn't realize she is an old woman, and is very upset about this. At the same time, his sister is asleep. Bill, now a little older, has a very serious problem. His mother is waiting for him. She tries to seduce him. He resists. His father comes in the room and confronts her. She tells him she is sorry, and she will not seduce her son again. The father tells her that he is not going to let her seduce Bill, and that he will beat her if he does. His wife tells him that she has a job to do. Bill tries to make his mother leave, but she doesn't. The next morning, Bill goes down to the university. He is so excited that he forgets to pay his bills. The university is in chaos because the president has been assassinated. The police are searching for the murderer. Bill and his sister are walking down a sidewalk when a policeman comes up to them. Bill has a gun. The policeman asks Bill, "What are you doing here?" Bill says, "I'm going to get my money. The money is in the back seat of my car. I am going to pay my bills."

I don?t like watching someone get murdered by a monster because I know that there are a million things that could have gone wrong. I prefer watching someone else get murdered. That?s why I don??t watch horror.  I love the film, and even though it?s not the best horror movie I?ve seen, it still is a fun watch. I have nothing bad to say about it. It?s just a fun movie that you don?ve never seen before.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I know that in Hollywood there is nothing more important than a great plot, but the plot of this movie is garbage! I didn't really like the character's at all. I thought that there was nothing to this movie, but I found myself rooting for them. I was hoping that the director would have made this movie into something better. It was very predictable and predictable. I'm very disappointed in the movie, it was really bad!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not that good.  The movie's premise is cool, the characters are fun and interesting, and the movie has a cool ending.  The movie is based on the book of the same name by John Grisham.  The story centers on an aspiring author named John Grigson.   Grigman is a very vain and self-absorbed man, and he has a secret to keep from his family, especially his girlfriend, Linda (Susan Sarandon).   Linda is a smart and attractive girl, and she gets a job as the assistant editor of a popular, highly regarded literary magazine.  Unfortunately, Linda's job is only temporary.  Her fiance, the editor of the magazine, has an affair with Linda, and Linda is jealous.  When Linda finds out that she has been unfaithful, Linda has a meltdown, and kills herself.  At this point, Grig's life falls apart completely.  He becomes desperate for an escape from his past.  Grigg then decides to write a book about his life, but when he starts writing it, he soon realizes that he is in way over his head.  It turns out that Grig is the author of the book, but he can't find a publisher for it.  Then he meets a young girl named Linda, who has a problem with her father.  But Linda isn't all bad, as she is the only person Grig can relate to.  However, the only problem Grigg can relate with is himself.  After killing himself, Grigg finds a new purpose in life, and that purpose is to save Linda from the clutches of her father's abusive wife.  This movie is a great movie with a lot of great moments, and I hope it's available on DVD one day.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I can't believe they cast someone as a girl in a role of a boy. She looks nothing like a boy and looks more like a female version of a man, which is very wrong. The reason why this movie is terrible is because of the characters in this movie. It has so many bad characters, they even have their own sub plot about a girl who is kidnapped and raped by a guy. Why is this girl in this film, she's not in the movie at all. The movie's main plot is to make a girl, and her friend who is a guy, get kidnapped by a group of people who wants to rape them. The story was so bad and the characters were so ridiculous, the movie was completely useless. The plot twist at the end made the movie completely worthless. If you're looking for a good movie, this is not it.

Overall a very good movie.

But this movie makes you hate yourself for being a little kid who liked a little movie called "Crazy Train". This movie made me hate myself for being myself. This movie makes me feel that I should have done something different. This makes me hate the person that made the movie, and the person I made the film for.  Why do we have to make a movie like this?  Because it is fun to make fun of other people.  the story is so good. The movie is so enjoyable. The people in this movie are great. The music is great.    Why can't this movie be made every year for Christmas?   Because people make movies about the people they love.  (see: Toy Story)   So let's make this movie every year:  The people in the movie would like to make the movie every day.  of every year.  I love that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  I didn't understand why a group of teenagers would want to be "gangsters."   The best thing about this movie is the soundtrack.   A really cool track by a band called "Crazy Horse" and then a great soundtrack by a singer called "The King of the Dead."  .  ,   It's a shame that this movie wasn't as good as the soundtrack, because it has the potential to be really good. _________. __________________ .  (This movie was shot on 35mm, which is the best of film-makers. Film-makers have to use film and a camera. In the past, they used film for special effects, and they used the camera for shots and they needed a tripod and a steadicam for special shots. It wasn't until the advent of computer-generated images, that film became the best form of camera-based photography. So a lot of the special effects of this movie were done with the use of a camera, a film camera, and a film projector. This movie was all done on film, which means that the special-effects were made with real special effects. A camera was used to shoot the scenes that were shot in black and white, but the scenes in color were done on a digital camera. The film camera was so advanced that the film would make a black and a white film look a little grainy. The color effects were done by using a special film projector that projected the images on the screen in the color of the image on the film. There are some scenes in this movie that are in color and some scenes that are not in color. It was all digital. There is one scene that is in color, but it was shot with a black-and-white camera and projected on a black screen. This scene is the scene where the two kids are being chased by a police car and they are all wearing black uniforms. The scene was filmed with a real black-navy-blue uniform that was worn by a black man. But when the film projector was projecting the color images on to the screen, the black uniform appeared a little faded. The same thing happens to the boys' uniforms. It's a little bit of a trick. It looks like the camera is trying to make a little "grainy" film look grainy.)

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________   My rating: *****   It's a good movie. A good horror movie, actually. But the special effects are bad, and the acting is bad. The bad acting is the main reason that I didn't like this movie. I think I have a better memory than the people in this movie, but this movie is just too awful to remember. It was a really bad movie that I don't want to remember, because it is too much of a waste of my time. I had a lot of fun watching this movie as a kid. I liked the "gothic" setting and the "scary" feeling that this movie had. But it's just too bad. This movie has so much potential. There are so many good actors in this film, but they are too bad to use. The music is also good, but it just doesn't work with this movie and the actors. I guess if you are looking for a good horror film, this is a good one. It's not the worst film ever made, but you should not waste your time watching it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why would you watch a movie like this? I don't even know how to explain this. This movie is not a bad film. This film is not good at all. This is an unoriginal piece of trash. It is not even a bad comedy. This could be a good movie if it had more plot, if it were not such a poor plot. It's just a movie that tries to be something, and it tries so hard. It tries so much that I felt like it was trying to be too good. It tried so hard to make the audience laugh, and make them feel like they were involved in something. I thought they were just there to laugh and be amused by the film. The only reason this film works is because it is trying to make people feel good about themselves. I just wanted to laugh at this movie. This was just a bad joke, that was just there for the sake of making people feel better about themselves and the world. If it had just been a good comedy, it would not have made it past the first twenty minutes. The ending is so terrible. This whole movie is so bad. The best way to describe this movie is "just awful." I wish I could give it a 1 or 2. I feel bad for people who actually enjoy watching this movie, because this movie deserves so much more than what it gets.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Jul 14, 2017 By: Mike Burtner from Santa Fe, NM This movie has no business being made. The director should have gone to the bank and taken the $300,000 he got for it, and went back to making commercials. The story is a waste of time and a waste to the audience. I hope the studio figures out a way to make a better film. The acting was terrible and the plot is pathetic. The main character is a clown. I have no idea what his role is in the movie. I guess he is the 'big' clown but there are other clowns in this movie that were more interesting and they were more likable. The movie was very slow and boring. The ending made me laugh and made me feel good about the movie and I will probably see this movie again. It is a little overrated but it has some good ideas.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ I was so excited to see this movie and I was disappointed in the movie. I have seen the trailers and the trailers say that it's about a man who goes to a desert island to try and be with his long lost lover. I was expecting to see him on an island looking for his lover, not on a movie set. The movie is terrible. This movie is not bad, it's just terrible. The actors are terrible and all of them are just awful. All of them just sound like they are being interviewed. I would say this is a bad remake of a bad film, but I would give it a D because I know the original film is great. So if you want a bad re-make of a good film, this is the movie for you. I'm sorry that I didn't give it an A, but it really doesn't deserve an A. I don't know why they are even making this movie. It's just a horrible movie.

I don the movies based on how good or bad they are. If a movie doesn't have any good points, it is a bad picture. It's not up for me to judge if a movie has good points or bad points. If you can't tell good from bad in a movie, you should not watch it. And that is a pretty good rule.

"He's the best!" - I love you  Reviewer: aaronr - favorite favorite favorite - April 9, 2007  Subject: This movie is horrible I've never seen a worse film than this. The worst acting and most horrendous plot. What's worse is that this is a TV movie that was broadcast on local stations. If you're a fan of this kind of stuff, you won't like this one. I don't know if it was intended as a spoof but it's very clear. - April 10, 2007This movie is terrible  Review of "Pee-wee's Big Adventure" - April 12, 2007"Pee Wee's Big Adventures" is a film that's been made many times. It has the same basic plot of a boy getting caught in the middle of a "mad world". The difference here is that it's the same boy. The only difference is that he's a teenager. The boy has no sense of direction or even a sense of humor. This is not a film to watch when you are feeling down. The story is as predictable as the plot. The kid doesn't know the right way to act, and is caught in a situation that seems very unlikely. The acting is all over the place. The dialogue is laughable. The humor is laughable and the performances are laughable. This isn't the most intelligent film I've ever seen. This movie just seems like a terrible attempt at comedy. The "PEE-WEE" character is as annoying as the rest of the cast. I mean, this is the same actor who plays Pee Wee Herman, the stupid little man. I've always found this to be a great "P.O.W." film, but this film has it all. - May 22, 2007Pee Wee's Great Adventure is a terrible film
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________ I loved this movie. I watched it 3 times in a row at the local theater. I love the music, I loved the characters, and I loved that the story didn't stop when it was over. I liked that it was a bit dark. It's not the best film out there, but it is very good. It is also not for everyone. I think it was better for me than the last time I saw it, but I still hated it. _________________________________________________ The movie is about a small group of men who want to start a new life in the United States. Their plan is to get on a ship, sail across the ocean to Canada, and then to settle down in a new city. When they arrive in Toronto, they find that they don't know anyone. The captain is very rude and doesn't even want them on the ship, and they quickly learn that their new town is not what it seems. It seems to be a big drug-ridden town full of bad people. The men learn that a lot of money is being made in this town, and there is a big money-making scheme. The group tries to figure out what's going on, and when the captain is murdered by a drug-addict, they decide to get out of there. The only problem is that they have a lot to lose. The plan to get across the sea to Canada is a good one, but there are plenty of obstacles to overcome, and it's a big boat. They have to take a boat with a huge hole in the side to avoid the weather, and the boat is filled with criminals. They are also running out of food. They get into a fight with a bunch of local toughs and get captured. After a while, they are put on a boat to Mexico. There they learn that the captain was murdered because he knew about a lot more than they were told. He was involved in a major drug ring, and was one of the top drug dealers in Toronto. They learn that he had a wife and children in Mexico, and he died of a heart attack while on the way to the funeral. The two surviving men are sent to the United State, but they soon realize that the United Sates is just as bad as Toronto. _________ The story has been a favorite of mine for a while. It has a lot going on and I love that the characters are so unique. I was really surprised that this movie took

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________ [SPOILERS] A woman is kidnapped and taken to a cabin. The kidnapper tells her that the body of a woman that had been killed in a car crash was found in the trunk of the car. The body was that of an American woman named Betty Shelby. The man who murdered her has been given a new identity and he wants to leave the country, and the body is a trophy that proves his skills. The woman is reluctant to allow him to go and tells him that she has a husband and two children and wants him to take care of them. The next day the man leaves. Later that night, the woman is awakened by a strange noise and goes to the garage to see what is wrong. When she opens the trunk, the body falls out. She then runs into a neighbor's house and tells them what happened. The neighbor, a retired detective named Harry Strachan, is convinced that this is a murder and he investigates the murder case. However, Strachain realizes that the woman has been dead for a long time and that the trunk has been empty for quite some time. Later, the neighbors realize that the man who was seen in the neighborhood the day before has been wearing a suit. He is also seen leaving the neighborhood. At a local restaurant, Strache finds the man and interrogates him. The suspect tells Strachane that he was in the woods one day with a friend and that he killed a woman with a crossbow and buried her body in the forest. He then takes a cross in the shape of a deer's antlers from the trunk and tells Strache that the cross symbolizes the woman he killed. Strachanes' investigations leads him to the cabin where the body was found. Strache confronts the man inside the cabin. He takes out a gun and demands that the suspect tells him everything that happened. After several minutes, the suspect reveals that he took the cross to scare the woman. Stracher and his partner go to the scene of the crime and discover the body. When they get close to it, the man is killed by Strachanian's partner, and he flees. Straching's partner calls for help, and police arrive at the scene. After the man was shot, the police take a blood sample and discover that the victim's blood was found on the cross.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It was a very good movie, I just wish it didn't have to end." 1. The Big Lebowski (1998) Director: The Coen Brothers  and Ethan Coen Cast:  The Coen brothers were one of the most innovative film-makers in the history of cinema. The first of the Big Lebowksi series of films, The Big and the Little, was released in 1998, followed by another in 2002, and then an official sequel in 2004. The Coens have always been keen to play with the idea of a fictionalised world, and in The Big, they do this with a vengeance. It follows a gang of con artists in the 1960s Los Angeles, who take their name from the film, and their motto from the movie's title: "We're a big, big, littlest Lebkis, and we'll do anything to get rich". The film is an amalgam of both the comedy and the drama, with a whole lot of character, and some great dialogue.  I love the ending, which was not in the script, and was based on a conversation between a young boy and his father. It was very difficult to watch The Big  after reading the reviews. Many thought that it was a great film, with great characters, and a great story.   It is a great little film, so I wouldn't give it five stars, but it did manage to leave me with a smile on my face, and it still managed to make me laugh out loud when it was all over. I have seen the film twice now, and I can tell you that I am going to watch it again.  You can watch The BIG  on Youtube, or from Amazon. 2. The King of Comedy (1995) Directed by: Martin Scorsese  Cast:  Martin Scorses is one of my favourite directors, and his latest film The King Of Comedy  is one of his best. It is a comedy that is as much about a relationship as it is about the life of a real king.  The film follows a young man named Robert De Niro, and features some of his greatest performances. The script was written by ScorsESE, and is based on the real life story of comedian Charlie Chaplin. The film also features a great cast, with some of the best actors to come out of

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! This is a great movie. This is the best movie I've seen in a while. The story was great and I loved it. I don't know how you can tell a bad story when you've seen this movie. The action scenes were good and the special effects were great. The actors were great and the movie made me want to see more. It took a few scenes for the plot to come together but once it did I was hooked. The special effects are the best. The movie is about a man who is the only man left on earth after the last man on earth died. He is an inventor, he has created a way to travel through time and the only problem is that the only person on earth with a way of travel through the past and the future is himself. So he uses a computer to travel in time and creates a machine to travel forward in time. When he is traveling forward he gets a phone call from his wife. The phone call was to his wife saying "I'm coming home" but she was not there. So they go back through time to find her. Once he gets there he finds his wife has gone to the past to get his DNA. Once they get the DNA they travel back to the future to find out what happened to her. This was a very interesting movie. It was a good story and the action scenes and special effects was amazing. The music was also great and kept me entertained. It wasn't a bad film but it was just ok. I'm a huge fan of sci-fi and this movie did not disappoint me. It has been a long time since I watched a movie like this. I think it would be a good movie for a long vacation.

It made me feel like a kid. Then, when the movie ended, I thought, "No way that's it, it's only the beginning." Then, I heard the movie's theme song playing in my head and knew it was only the trailer. The movie really sucks. There's nothing exciting about the movie. You know, all the stuff I love in the first film was there in this one. It's a boring movie. They really had to cut down the characters' scenes to make this movie. There were way too many scenes with nothing happening. It just made it boring. The character's personalities and attitudes didn't seem to have changed at all, even after all these years. The director didn't know what to do with this movie and just went with the same old movie plot, which was too predictable and boring. It was hard to watch the characters in this movie because the story is so slow. You just want to get to the good stuff and never get there. The music in this film is also very lame. It didn't make me feel anything but bored. I was ready to throw my money at the screen and leave this movie alone. I know it was just a trailer, but I still didn't like it. It should've been a sequel to the first one and it should've gone back to the beginning. I guess I'll have to wait for the third movie.

It seemed like it was on a slow burner. I guess we were too close to it. My wife had seen this movie a few years ago. She thought it might have been the same movie. I thought it looked like it might be the same too. But then I saw the trailer for this movie. There were no changes in the movie.  The only difference is that now they've turned this movie into a series. I was really excited to see a sequel. I remember the original was a bit better. It had more action. I wanted to see this one again.   The only difference between this movie and the first one is that this movie is not scary. I mean it was but the movie was not scary and it was still pretty good. The plot line was pretty good too. I like this one. It has some good action scenes.

There are some good acting performances here, but it's all so predictable and cliché. The script is not funny at all. The character development is bad. The plot is too simple and the ending is unsatisfying. The cast is very small, and the story revolves around a single character that was written to be a main character but never was.

If you think it's a good movie, you should watch it.  How to Write a Bad Review  You want to make a bad film look like a good film. A bad movie can make a good one look like an average movie. You want to give the movie bad reviews. You have no right to criticize a movie that you haven't seen.  a bad, mediocre, mediocre movie, and you don't want to see it because it's bad. : (the film is bad) You've seen it? You can't really give a good opinion of a film that you've never seen. You're not a film scholar, and so your opinion is meaningless. What makes it worse is that most critics give terrible reviews. I've seen a lot of crappy movies that I really enjoyed. If they gave a good, positive review, it's probably because they were in a good mood when they watched the film. (The film is good) It's a great film! You're going to love it! You shouldn't be critical, because it just means you don,t know anything about movies. You shouldn t,t see a movie unless you like it. (the movie is bad and you can't recommend it) You're a film critic, not a movie critic. You should have seen it. You'll be disappointed. You've never even seen a movie. The only person who will be happy about this review is the guy who wrote it. This isn't a film review. It's the story of a movie reviewer. The film is really bad. If it weren't so bad, you'd think it was a good comedy, a bad romance, or a bad comedy. It'll ruin your movie night. This movie is so bad that the only people who would be happy to see this movie are people who hate movies and hate good movies. That's a pretty good way to ruin a movie night, I'll give it that. (it's a bad bad movie) I've never watched a bad joke movie before, but this is a bad one. This movie is really, really bad, but that doesn't mean it's good. (a bad movie, it ruined the movie) You have never seen this movie. It was a bad idea for the studio to make this movie, but they

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Do yourself a favor and watch this movie before reading any further. _______________________________ 1 out of 4 people found this review helpful.  If you like your science fiction fast-paced, with good special effects and a strong plot, you should definitely check this out. In the early 21st century, mankind is on the verge of wiping itself out. To save the human race, a group of scientists send an alien to earth to create an army of super soldiers and protect them from the Earth's various threats. The alien in question is a little girl named Tami, a girl who, along with her robotic arm, helps the military save the world. She's cute and friendly and very easy to like, despite being completely stupid and violent. The movie does a great job of making her look like a cute, little alien, even though she's completely ridiculous. The science in this movie is really well done and the special effects are great, but I think that the movie would have been better if the science had been less silly and more serious. The ending was great, too, and I loved how it tied in to the main story in a good way. The main character and his friends are very likable and the movie has great special effects. I don't want to spoil too much of the plot, but it does have a happy ending. Overall, this is a great movie and I recommend it to anyone. It has great characters and great special effect work, so it's definitely worth checking out.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   -The movie is about a guy who is a professional wrestler, and his first opponent is a woman, played by Julia Roberts. The guy was really upset because his opponent used to be a wrestler before he left the business. So the guy is really pissed and he decides to do a promo, and he talks about how he is so pissed because this woman used to do her stuff before she left the industry. He says that she didn't deserve to be on the mat with him and he's going to take her down. He then proceeds to choke her out and she falls over. He gets up and goes for the finish, and she comes back and knocks him out with a flying knee. He's just about to get up and hit her, but he doesn't. The girl's boyfriend says, "That's not happening, you're done!" The guy's girlfriend says, 'You know what? She's right. This is wrong. This isn't right.' And the guy goes, "What is wrong with it? It's wrong, it's wrong. She's not worth this!" And the girlfriend's saying, "This is wrong! You've got to let her go." The girlfriend's going, "No. She doesn't deserve it. This woman used her body to get where she is. She used her brain. She was a great wrestler, she used her brains, and now she's not worthy of this!" The boyfriend's saying to the guy, "He's right." And the woman's going in, "She didn't mean anything by it. She just wanted to be with you. She didn't know what she was doing. She got what she wanted, and you ruined it for her. You ruined this for her, and this is wrong!" The girl starts crying, and the boyfriend says to the boyfriend, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry I had to let this happen. You know, I don't know why I had this feeling. I thought maybe I should just give up and go, but I didn't. I had my family, and my wife, and I had everything. This was wrong, and it had to stop. I've got some things to do."   There are some great moments in the movie, and there are some bad moments, but there are a lot of great moments, too.   The acting is very good. I enjoyed Julia Roberts as the girlfriend. I liked the guy

The actor (who plays the "villain") is a pretty good actor, but he plays a pretty bad character. The movie could have been much better if they had cut some scenes that were unnecessary and had a few new scenes that really made the movie worth watching.   for the price you are getting this movie for, it is a steal. I would highly recommend it.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ Why? Because if a movie is bad, it's not because it's bad, but because it was poorly made. This movie, like the first movie, is made by a guy with a real passion for acting, and that passion doesn't seem to be there. This film is a very boring and dull movie, with an extremely uninteresting plot, and a cast of people who look like they have been playing the same characters for years. I think the director did this because it would make it easy to sell the movie, and it would be easier to sell this movie if the characters looked and acted exactly like they do in every other movie he has made. __________ Why? ___________ The acting in this movie is atrocious, and is the reason why I cannot recommend this movie. The actors look so old and they don't have any talent, even the girls are really old and look like idiots. __________________________ The acting is so bad in this film that I can't tell what the movie is trying to show. _________________________________________ The acting was so bad that I could tell this was a poorly made movie, even though I really liked it. _________________ The story is really dumb. ____ ___________________ I just can't recommend this film to anyone, because it is so boring and has no idea what it's trying to say. It's like watching the movie of a guy who has never acted before, and just doing the same thing over and over again. _______ _______ The director, the writer, and all the actors, they all look like people who have been in a bad gang movie, just a bunch of people sitting around playing the characters they have done so many times. _____ _____ The plot is so stupid that I don't even know what the story is trying too say. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________. __________. ______________________. ___________________________________________________________.  I don't care what anyone says about this movie, it's a total ripoff of Star Trek. It was also a total failure financially. The only thing it had going for it was a very well-cast lead actor in Robert Picardo. _________________________________________________________________________________  First off, the movie does have a good cast, as does this book. The cast was made up of the most recognizable and interesting actors of the era, such as Robert Picardi, John Neville, John Glover, and Michael Forest. But this movie really missed the mark by being completely derivative of Star Wars. The story has all the same problems, but that's not the worst of it. There were some interesting plot points in this movie. I didn't see anything that could be called a story. The movie was basically just an excuse for the actors to do all the silly, over the top action scenes they know how to do. The plot didn't have anything to do with the characters, and the characters were boring and poorly written. This movie really had nothing going for them. I'll give it a 3.5, because it did have some interesting action scenes. But it was all the other stuff that killed this movie for me. I was really hoping to see a good sci-fi movie, and it was so over-the-top that I can't even remember what happened. The characters were a big part of the problem. I felt like the actors didn't really know how the characters and the plot would work together, and I don't think they had the talent to pull it off. ____________________________  A lot of people loved this movie and they are right. The action was fantastic, the effects were impressive and the costumes were very cool. Unfortunately, this movie had some problems. The acting was pretty bad. Some of the actors really didn't know what they were doing and had a hard time doing what they had to do to make the movie work. The cinematography was pretty poor and the effects seemed like they were lifted straight out of Star wars. Also, there were a lot of silly things in the movie, such a stupid spaceship, silly weapons, and stupid aliens. ____ . .

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ it's terrible. I bought this as a joke. I saw it and thought, "hmmm, this is interesting," and then I remembered that I'm in college and I was never really into the movie. I went back a week later and saw it again, and it was even worse. So I bought it a second time, and watched it for a second and thought "I think I'll give this a try," but then the movie just went downhill from there. This movie is the most painful movie I have ever seen. It was horrible, awful, disgusting, and boring. I hate this movie so much, I can't even remember what happened in it. I would hate to give it another chance to see if I could remember the ending. It really made me sad, because it was so stupid and lame. I thought it was a good idea to make a movie that was a rehash of another movie and then it just went the same way as the movie that preceded it. It's almost like you can watch all of these movies and they all end the same, except for this movie. If you're not a fan of horror, don't even bother. This is an awful movie and you'll regret watching it after you watch it.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. Watch it and laugh at the jokes but remember, it's just a movie, not a real life.  2 out of 5 stars John M. I think the most interesting story in this movie is the first one. The other three stories are not as good as the first. The only story I liked was the final one. I really liked the ending. It was very sad and scary and I was thinking of the little girl in that one. And I know it was her and I just think that the story was better than the rest of them.  for the money, I'd probably give this a 3. I wouldn't recommend it unless you are looking for a horror film. It doesn't have the atmosphere and suspense of a true movie but is very good if you are into this genre. I just don't get how the guy's friend didn't go back in time. The guy's mom is so crazy and you can tell she just had a bad day, but the man's dad is so nice and the man didn't really want to go back with his friend and was just trying to get away from the woman.    And the final scene was very well done. I like that you can see how they were able to pull that off. The ending was a great one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! That was a great movie. The acting was excellent. The plot was not, it was very boring. There was not much action in it, so you have to watch it.

It took me to a new dimension.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ This movie was so bad it was hilarious. The movie opens with a bunch of kids running around on the beach, having a great time. Then we see a big white dog jump up on top of them. The kids run around in fear. Then a black cat comes down from a tree, looks at them and starts laughing. We see that there are two kids on a boat, they are getting in trouble with a giant whale, and the kid with the gun is trying to get him off them. When they get in trouble, a white dog jumps up on the boat and the boat starts sinking. Then the movie switches to a kid playing in the river and then we see that the kid is a big guy and he is going after a whale, but the whale starts laughing and starts to go away. Then there is a flashback of the guy on the raft getting in a fight with a big red dog and we see the big red guy go to the back of the raft and start crying, but he doesn't know that the girl is dead. After that, we go back to the raft. The girl is hanging upside down by her wrists, and there are other people hanging in the water and the girl starts screaming. Then it turns out that the dog has the girl and she has a small child with her. Then, it turns into a big flashback with the dog and the little girl and they are laughing, and they're playing in a pond and the dog's head is swimming and the baby is laughing. Then at the end of the movie, it's all about the white dog, but then it's back to a big baby and the white cat and the guy who has the gun, and we start laughing again. The end is all black and white.  What we liked: ____________________ This movie had lots of laughs, but there were also a few things that were a little annoying. I don't think the movie would have worked if it were a different movie with different characters. I'm going to watch the rest of the movies in this series now, and see if I can pick out what I liked.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ I have not watched this movie, so I do not know what to say. It was a very well made movie. The actors all did a wonderful job. However, the plot was awful. The bad things that I can say about it are the following: 1.The acting was very poor. I don't know how much of it was my fault and how much was the actors fault. They all looked so much like they had just come from a funeral. 2. The music was so terrible. It sounded like a tape recorder going at 100 miles per hour. 3. There was no sound in the movie. There were no footsteps, no sounds of rain, etc. 4. The characters all looked alike. This is especially bad because there are so many actors. 5. The film had very bad CGI. The camera moved around a lot and the camera was always zooming in and out of the same area. 6. The sound was so bad, I couldn't understand anything the actors said. They sounded like they were talking in a language I didn't understand. 7. There is a lot of violence in this movie. It's hard to watch when you have a young child. I was very uncomfortable. It wasn't fun to watch. This movie had nothing to do with the other movie I watched about the same time called "Rise of the Planet of the Apes". If you want to see a good movie, go to "Rage of the Pink Panther".
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ What I thought of this movie: It is a very bad movie. It is about a girl who was sexually abused and then turned into a zombie. This is not a very good movie. The director has a lot of sex scenes and it is very hard to watch. The zombies are made to look like old people and they are very creepy. This movie is about an older girl who is turned into zombie and she is forced to take care of her husband. This zombie is very creepy and it looks like a real person. It seems like they wanted to make a horror movie but this one is really bad. I would not recommend this movie for anyone. It's a terrible movie. What I didn't like about it: The director tries to make this movie scary. But it's not scary at all. There are a lot sex scenes in this movie. There is no real horror. I don't know why they did that. I wish the director would've changed the director of this film. The ending is also terrible. It feels like they tried to make something great out of a terrible film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The film is about the events of one day in a small town, where one of the town's residents is kidnapped. After being rescued, the man is found dead and his corpse is wrapped in tape." "The character is a cop, named Kevin Smith, who is a former soldier who was assigned to the same area as this kidnapping, and has come to the realization that something is terribly wrong." After a few minutes of talking, a little bit of back and forth between the two characters, a big action scene takes place. The police officer who is the subject of the kidnapping dies, and the other guy gets away.  He runs around town, and gets caught in a car wreck.  "It's a very good chase movie, which I was not expecting at all."  The cop goes in after him.   They fight, and at the end of the movie they get away. "When you watch this movie, it's like a movie, and you are watching a movie."    This is a great thriller with great special effects and some great characters.  The only thing that doesn't work for me is the music.  This movie is just too loud and too much.  It would be great to have a low volume option on the sound system, but that's about it.  One of my favorites. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* "I have been a fan of the original film since I was about nine years old. The movie has a wonderful look and feel and some of the dialogue is even better than in the film. The ending of the film is one of the most amazing I have ever seen. It is a brilliant idea, but the movie never gets the opportunity to really develop it fully. The plot and characters are good, but never developed properly. The acting is good, the effects are good and the special effects are a nice touch. The music is also good and fits the mood of the movie well. However, the film just goes on and on and the ending is a letdown. " (The original, as well as all the sequels, are good; but "Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith" is a poor film.)

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________________  A very mediocre movie. The plot was good and I thought the characters were interesting. However, this movie was so poorly written that it was hard to care about the characters. It was a very poorly written movie and the writers/directors did not give a ****. This is a movie about a family who were so poor that they had to move into a shack and survive in this environment. There were many bad characters in this movie. For example, the mother is such a bitch. She keeps having sex with a man she is married to. I hate this kind of movie because I feel like the writer did not want the mother to be happy and I guess she wanted to make the characters look bad. The father was such a jerk. I really felt sorry for the people in this family. It makes me feel bad for these poor people. This movie was not worth my time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I liked this movie, and I thought it was a fun film. I think the characters were really cool. I really liked how the movie was structured, with one guy being the hero and the other guy being a bad guy. The acting was great, and the music was cool. The only thing that bugged me was how they had a girl in the movie. I know it's a teen movie, but I thought the girl was way too young. The story was fun. I only saw this one a couple weeks ago, and that made it a fun movie. The one complaint I have is the ending. The bad guy didn't have any good reason to kill the main guy, so I thought he should have just killed him. That would have been much more satisfying. I would give this movie a 6/10.

I also like the art style. It looks good. It reminds me of the "Wanted" movies, but this one is better. I recommend this movie to everyone. It has a good plot. The characters are all well done. The only bad part about this movie is that the first half is slow. The second half starts up faster. I think that the story is too slow to get you interested. I do think the first part was better.

I don't remember the movie.  , from "My Father, the Hero" My father has always had a deep desire to fight the good fight against injustice. He saw it in his heroes and his heroes were the Black Panthers, the American Indians, and the Freedom Riders. When my dad was a young man he went to the NAACP in Washington, D.C. and met a young white girl who was there as a child. She said to my father, "I don`t like to be in the streets with all these people. I have a mother and father. I`m not going to be with all those people." He said, "Well, you are going to have to be one of them. You have to do something." And he took her under his wing and taught her about the movement, and taught me how to fight for justice. When I got out of high school and went to college, I realized that if my father had been there to fight those battles for me, I wouldn`t be where I am today.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad film. It's just not worth watching. It has no purpose or story. It doesn't even make sense. It should have never been made. This is what you would expect from a 90s slasher movie and it shows. It was just poorly done. The only thing that kept this movie from being a total disaster was the fact that the director and cast had talent and were good at what they did. However, they did not use that talent to their fullest potential. They could have made a great movie if they had just stayed true to what they were doing and used the talent that they had to the best of their abilities.  If they had done that, this movie would have been a perfect horror film. _______________________________________________ 1.  The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest  I am not a big fan of horror films but I do enjoy them and this was a really good one. I did not like it at first. I thought it was stupid. The way the girl kicks the hornets nest just doesn't make sense to me. However I just kept watching it and eventually I realized that the girl was a psychic. That was good enough for me. It is a horror film and it is a good horror film but it was a pretty boring film to me so I did enjoy it a little. _______________________________ The Blair Witch Project  If you don't know, this is the movie that made it into the top ten. It also made it to number one on the best horror films of all time. The movie follows two teenagers who find a real live witch in a tree in the woods. It then follows them through their journey to figure out what is going on. It may be the most successful horror film ever made. I have watched this movie probably about 40 times. I love it. It just makes me laugh. I think it is very well made. It does take some pretty wild turns in the end though and that is a great way to end a horror movie. ______________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  "They don't call me "The Incredible Hulk" for nothing." -Bruce Banner  The Hulk is a giant, green, muscular man. He was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby and was a huge hit in 1962 when it was released. It was the first Marvel comic book to feature a character of color, the first one to show an African American, and it was the most successful of the series. The film is a good, fun action movie and has a few interesting twists, but it is ultimately forgettable.

This movie was really great. It's a story about a family who lives in a house that was built before the house burned down. The husband is in the hospital recovering from a heart attack and the wife and son move in to take care of him. The movie was very interesting, and it really did tell a great story. However, it was a little too long. I mean, the first act is so short. I got to see the rest of the movie but it was kind of boring.  Reviewed by A reader from Santa Barbara, CA I really enjoyed the film. It is very well made. The acting was wonderful. The actors portrayed the characters well. The story was great. The ending was just as great. I'm not one of those who loves horror but I loved the movie. It was good. I loved how it started off with the family moving into the house, then a little later we see the family in the house when it is burning down. There was just something that I really liked about it. It wasn't all doom and gloom. The characters were all likable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________   This movie is absolutely awful. It's got some great scenes in it but they are all cut from the movie and made into a short. This movie was just poorly edited.   There are some scenes that are so poorly edited that they are so bad they make the movie almost unwatchable. The movie should have been called "Hollywood Bad Movie" and this is the worst of the worst.   (hide spoiler)   I think that the movie should be called "The worst movie ever" because it's so bad and so boring.   to bad and boring. The film has some great action scenes in the beginning but then it just goes downhill from there. It takes about 20 minutes to get to the good part of the movie which is about how bad a person the main character is. The rest of the film is just a bad piece of garbage with no story. (hide spoilers)  The main character of this movie is a woman that has a great body. The first part of this film is about her going on a date with a man. The main character has a terrible personality and is very jealous of the man that is with her. The man that she has a date to is a good looking man. This man has some issues with his past and the woman has issues with her past. She also has a very bad personality. After she has gotten over all her problems she and her date are about to go to a hotel room. She gets in a car and the man is driving and she starts to drive a little faster. She starts to speed up to get away from the man. But as soon as she gets out of the car she speeds up again and gets out to see if the man can catch her. He does not, but she starts driving faster and she gets a little off track. This is when the man gets in his car and tries to catch her but she gets away and speeds up and he can not catch her and she is gone. The whole movie is about the main characters trying to catch this woman and all they do is speed up and slow down. The entire movie is just her going off and speeding up and slowing down. This was supposed to be a comedy and it's not. There is no story, no logic and no plot. I'm not sure what the film was trying to be but it was just terrible. The acting is horrible. There are some great actors that played the part but all they

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ The worst movie of my life. The story was terrible, the acting was terrible. The cinematography was atrocious. The music was awful. The whole movie was so poorly acted. The only saving grace was that the director was a brilliant filmmaker. He was so great and made a great film that was worth seeing. But the acting and the cinematography were so bad, it just was not worth watching. _______________________________ See more ▼ See less ▲  Uncharted 2: Among Thieves (2015) I'll never know what happened in the mind of a thief... When you go on a quest to recover your stolen goods, it can lead you on an adventure filled with twists and turns. But for some, their quest will end up being the most tragic one. In the sequel to the 2012 smash hit, Naughty Dog brings you back to the beautiful, tropical island of Madagascar, where your hero, Sam Fisher, is tasked with recovering a mysterious artifact that could potentially unlock the secrets of the island. The game has a story that is a little confusing at times, but still has you thinking about it long after you have finished it. But don't worry, if you are a fan of the Uncharted series, you will love this one. The gameplay is just as fun as the last time you played it, and with a few new features, like an in-game journal and a multiplayer mode, this is a game that will keep you coming back. ______________________________________________________________ See more in our Review Policy section. -A.L.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. Please, no more! I don't want to hear that the movie was bad, it was great, or that it was funny. It was just a bad film. I know that you're not going to say that it is. You're not. But it is just a terrible movie. The movie is so bad that I don´t even know what to say about it. I guess it´s better to just say that the script is terrible. The acting is really bad, and the acting doesn´t go anywhere, it just goes, it doesn´nt get any better and it never will. I think that the worst actor in the movie is the guy who plays the main character. I donít think that he is even the best actor in this movie. I really doní t understand what happened to him. It seems that he went from the biggest star in the world, to being a complete loser. He really doesnít look like he has anything going for him. He looks like he just took a couple of hits to the head and is now an idiot. I am not a big fan of his acting, but I do like the music. I was watching the movie last night and I couldnít help but listen to some of the music that was in the background. The music really fits the mood of the movie. It just makes it more real. It also makes it look so real. I would have liked to have seen some of his other movies, but that is just the way it is and I think he just went from a star to a failure. It is really sad that he has become that way. I hope that he gets some help because he is going to need it. The whole movie looks really bad. It looks really old. I mean, I have seen more recent movies, and this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I can tell you this, this movie looks like a college film that was made in the 70ís. It really looks like it was shot on a low budget. There are some good actors in this film, but they just seem to be in it to just to get a job and not to do anything. It reminds me of some of those old, low budget movies that I used to see when I was younger. I do hope that this movie is only the start of him and that he can get a new start. I just hope that someone can find a way to get
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was all over the place. I thought the movie was funny, and it had good acting. I didn't think I was seeing a film with any real plot and no real characters.  I didn't know if it was going to be a comedy, a drama or a horror movie.  It was funny when a car chase was going on and a guy who is the "bad guy" came up to them and was going for the guns, but the cop kept yelling "He's got a gun! He's got the gun!" and the bad guy got shot.  Then the cop said to the girl who was the "good guy" "I didn' t think I could trust you, but I do."  And I was thinking, well, they can't both be wrong, so they must both be right.   But, in the end, the girl had the guns and the guy got dead and the movie ended.  It was really just funny at first, and then it just got really dark and I really didn't get it.  So, I just left it. I think the reason why I liked the movie is because I like the idea of a good guy who can't be trusted and a bad guy who has a gun.

But, as a fan of the series, I was left disappointed. The movie was okay, but nothing really happened, and I was confused and confused about what happened and what was going on.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was just a terrible movie.  I thought the first act was very well done but the movie just kept getting worse and worse.  I have never seen such a bad remake of a good movie. The movie is about a group of kids that go on a cruise to a small island, but the captain takes the kids on a ride they will never forget.    The movie takes place in the 1950s and features a bunch of young actors, one of whom is a kid named John Wayne.  The movie shows a young man in the 50s, who is going on a boat and he is on the way to a cruise.  He takes the cruise on a very small boat.  Once on the boat, he sees a beautiful girl on the side of the boat. He falls in love with her and asks her to marry him.  But she refuses.  So he gets a gun and goes off to find a girl.    Once on that island, he is told to find another girl, but he finds a woman instead.  She is very nice, and the man takes her to the woman's house and the woman tells him to stay there.  However, she is not there to be married, but to be used.  Now, John Wayne decides to kill her and to get the woman.  It is a very dark movie, but it is also very entertaining.  I did not enjoy this movie at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________ It was a pretty good movie but the plot was stupid. It is about two sisters and their mother who are in a relationship but it is going downhill because of the fact that her daughter has been diagnosed with cancer and she wants to kill herself. The only reason why she hasn't done it yet is because her daughter's doctor has been making fun of her for having a lesbian relationship and they are not even married. They are living a normal family life but it's getting better and better. She is sick but she doesn't want to go to the hospital. Her sister has to get a job to help her support the family. I really like that the movie is funny and not too serious. It's a pretty great movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. I give it a 3 out of 5 stars. _______________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  - The film was boring, and was not fun to watch, because the movie was poorly written, and it is not very original.  It is an old story, and they just use the same old characters.   - The movie was made with money, and this movie is not worth watching, because there is no interesting plot.  - There is no plot, but this movie had many problems: 1. The movie does not make any sense, because it is made by a non-actor, and there is not one person who knows the whole story.    2. The characters are just acting, and the movie is very boring.  3. There is a huge time delay in the movie.  4. The plot was bad.  5. The acting was bad, but that is not a big problem.  6. The story is made very simple, but it is still not very interesting.  7. The film has no plot. "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" (2004) A great movie, and not a good one.  It is a comedy.  The movie is just made to be funny, but what made this movie not so good is that the movie has no story, it is a simple story.   The movie did not have any good jokes.  There are many good jokes in the film, but they are all funny in different places.  Some of the jokes are funny in one scene, and funny in another scene.  So, the movie makes some jokes, but the movie does have a bad plot.   It has a big time delay between the two scenes, so when you see the movie, you are confused when you watch.  If you have not seen it, I suggest you to watch it before you make a judgement on it. -The movie is too slow.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________.  I have a bad feeling about this movie.   I think it would be much more fun if you watched it in 3D, but for some reason I decided to watch it in 2D. And, if I have to give a review for the acting I'd give it an 8. But, if you are expecting an awesome performance from the leading actors, you are going to be disappointed. I don't know if I'm going to see it again, but if I ever do it's going to have to be in 3-D.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. See what I mean? It's so simple, yet so complicated. It's one of the most complex and interesting films of all time. It was a great, great movie. If you're a fan of Kubrick, it's one for you. If not, then it's not worth your time. If I could rate it any lower than a 2, I would. A lot of people have the wrong impression about Kubrick. He is not a perfectionist. He's an over-thinking perfectionist and he doesn't like to be told what he can and cannot do. So he will just do whatever he wants. He was a perfectionists and a perfectionistic man. He wanted to make the film. He didn't just want to make a movie. It took a long time. He had to go through all the various stages of development. The first draft was done in 1973 and then he had to wait another four years. The last draft was written in 1978 and he spent three years in pre-production, shooting and post-production on the film and then in 1981, he finished the film, which was a very long process. It went through a lot of changes. There were lots of changes to the script. He rewrote the script many times. He would have had a lot more material in the screenplay. The story was very much based on his life. It had many things about the life of his father. It would have been a good film to make, but it wasn't the film that it should have been.

The first time I saw this movie, I was 12, and I was impressed that I could understand what was going on in this movie. At that age, there was no "R" rating, and the movie didn't have anything "adult" in it. So I laughed out loud and had fun watching it. Then, I saw it again in a different theater at the age of 14, and this time I was completely shocked that I had completely lost my ability to understand what I was watching.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. It's a movie about a man who is on the run after he murdered his wife and daughter, then buried them in a shallow grave. I know. It seems far-fetched. I mean, what the hell. He has a family and a job. Why do you think he's on the lam? The film itself is very boring. The plot is pretty simple: a man is on his way to kill his wife. He's on a road trip and gets lost. He then goes to a town, and then meets a woman. The woman is a prostitute. The man, thinking he's in love, falls in love with her, and they get married. It doesn't last. The prostitute is actually a cop who's after him. She forces him to get in a car with her and then drives him around town until he has to kill her. So the woman ends up dying. The guy kills her and hides the body in a dumpster. The cop is there when he finds the body and is pretty upset about what happened. But he goes back to his job, and the wife (who was still alive) is alive and living with her father. It turns out that she was the one who arranged to get her husband killed. It was a terrible movie. I have seen worse, but I can't imagine anyone watching it thinking it was good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ This movie was so bad it was hard to find the words. This movie is the story of a little girl who was born in a farm. She grew up with her step-dad. When her stepdad died, the little girl was put in an orphanage. The girl was never taught how to read or write, so she had to learn them by herself. One day, the girl is saved by a stranger. The man who saved her, the boy, is actually a monster. He killed all the kids in the orphanage and ate them. He is now a zombie. He starts eating the little girls. One of them is the girl's older sister. The monster eats her too. Now the girl has to find a way to kill him. The boy was just a monster who had to be destroyed. He was a bad guy. The movie was a waste of time and it's hard to watch. The only good thing about this movie is that the girl gets to kill the monster. But the movie didn't tell you that. There was a big picture at the end of the movie that didn't say how much time you had left. I don't think there are many movies like this out there. I hope that someone makes a sequel. This is one of the worst movies ever made. Don't waste your time on this movie. I gave it a 1 star.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________"The plot is good. The acting is good." -Catherine O'Hara, in "Gone With the Wind". The story about the life of the wealthy family is a well-written one, but there are some flaws. First, there is a big difference in the way the family and the slaves are portrayed. The slaves were not only treated badly by the owner of the plantation, but also by the plantation overseer. His character is not developed at all, and there is not a single scene in which he is shown to be a nice person. The family is not given much time either, and we only get to know the mother. She is a great actress, but she never does anything to raise the emotions in the audience. In fact, she is just a simple, hard-working, good-natured woman. The father, in contrast, is just as hard-worked and good- natured as his wife. He is not only a good husband, but he also tries to keep his family together by paying the bills, and he tries to get his wife to be more like a lady and less like a slave. However, the mother never really shows any change in her character. She still acts in a very crude and uncivil way. She also acts in the most uncivil manner towards her children. She even shouts at her husband when he is trying to do something nice for the children. There is not much that is interesting about the story. It is about a slave family, but it is not about a true story of a real slave family. The author should have spent more time in making the family more interesting, and not just concentrating on how bad the master and his family are. This movie is just about a couple of slaves, and the author should be more careful with his writing, because it makes the movie more boring than it should be. The film is made by D. W. Griffith, and it is his only film, but, it is very good. It was a huge success, and a great movie to watch. The only problem is that it is a very good movie, but the author decided not to make any changes in the story, and that is why the movie is not as good as it should have been.

I would like to see this movie again but I dont think I will. I dont know what to think about the movie anymore.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ What a bad film! It is a very long movie that is very boring and doesn't have much action. I would say it is very bad and not good at all. It has a very bad ending and I found out very late in the movie and I had to watch it a second time to see the bad ending. _______________ So, I was in the theater watching this movie when I heard someone say "Hey, this is a bad ass movie." and I thought that they are talking about the movie I saw a month ago. But I knew that this was a different movie because the director of this movie was really bad. He was a poor director. The acting is very weak. He had a lot of bad acting in this movie. The only thing good about this movie is that it has a good ending. So, this movie doesn't deserve a good rating. _______ Overall, this bad movie has a bad ending that is really boring and the acting is really bad and the story is very stupid. I don't think I will watch this movie again.

It was a terrible movie, but it didn't have to be. A great performance by Michael Douglas was enough to make this movie. I thought he was really good. If you want to see a bad, cheesy movie, this is the movie for you. I don't like this movie because it was a total flop.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The best part of the movie was the ending where he said "You're the best thing that's ever happened to me" to his girlfriend."  How many times have I heard that phrase before?  But if that's the best part, then I must be the worst.  I was disappointed in that ending because I thought it was supposed to be a happy ending, but in fact, that was just another bad ending.    I thought this was a decent movie that could have been better.      A couple of hours after watching this movie, I had to do a quick run-down of the characters.  I liked all of them, but this is where it got interesting.  There was a character named Mr. White who was a rich guy who had a young woman, Mrs. White.  The woman was in love with Mr. Whites's son, Mr. Blacks.  He loved his son and they were always together.  She was married, but they were never happy.  When the two men are arguing, Mr White pulls a gun and kills Mrs. Whites.  After that, Mrs Whites is gone, but Mr. Black takes her body back to his hotel room, and is seen by Mr.White the next day in the mirror.  Mr White says that his son is in love and that it's the first time he has seen his son smile.  It is only a dream.  At this point, Mrs White's body is in Mr.Black's hotel room.  Mrs White had her throat slit and a bullet is left in her chest.  But, Mr Black is never found.  One night, MrWhite has a dream where he is sitting on the floor with his son, but he doesn't remember what he was doing there.  Then, he wakes up and sees his son sitting next to him, but it's a dream too.  This continues for the next few days until Mrs White finds her way home.  Her body is found the next morning, and her husband is arrested.  Now, I don't know if the man was guilty or innocent.  If the two people are guilty, then Mr. Whit is innocent and Mr. Brown is guilty.  And if Mr.Brown is guilty, he should be punished for this murder.  Also, Mrs Whit is a pretty big star at this point in her career.  In the end, Mrs and
Write a negative review about a bad movie: *************The movie is about a girl who loves the game of hide and seek, but never wins a single game, but always wins the bet. She is very pretty and has a great smile, and her brother is a nice guy who always says hi to her and takes care of her. They are both very good students, and have a great relationship. One day, their father is very ill and their mother is very poor. So, they go to a big house with a pool. The owner of the house, a very nice old man, lets them stay there for a couple of weeks and he also buys them a house. They have no money, but they manage to survive. One night, while the girls are playing hide and look, the house is broken into. One of the girls is killed and the other one is kidnapped. The victim is never seen again, but it turns out that the house was rented to a very rich person. The rich guy decides to pay a visit to the girls, and gives them all some money. The girls decide to go and look for the body, but are not too sure what to do, because there is a murderer in the house. But, they are not the only ones in the room. The person who rented the house to them, is also there, and he is looking for the victim as well. When they find the body of the victim, the murderer kills the girl who was killed. Then he goes out of the room and is not seen by anyone. The next day, the rich guy comes to the house and asks for the girl. The girl who is still alive is a little girl who goes to the same school as the girls. The two girls are scared of each other and they do not know what to say. The old man who rented them the house invites them to a party at his place. The party is very good, but when the girls arrive, the man comes up to them and tells them to leave because he has found the girl's body. He says that she is not dead, but he just needs to get the other girl to admit that she has killed the girl from the other house. The other girl is a girl named Jessica who is the richest girl in school. She wants to stay and play with her friends, but the rich man says that the girl cannot come because she has to go to the party. She then tells her friends that she will go with her friend, but she will not
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was a complete mess and the acting was awful.  I found myself going out of my way to avoid this movie and even tried to find an alternative in a few places.     The movie is all about the romance between a young woman named Elisabeth and a young man named Arthur.   The movie focuses on their relationship and is about their adventures in the world.  The romance and the world the movie portrays is fantastic but I really felt that there was way too much going on.  I found it hard to understand why they were so interested in this guy because of what he has done to her.  At the end of the movie they go to a place that I thought would be a place of love but was really a place where they would have sex.    I think they should have just left the movie at that point.  Also, when they get there the girl tells Arthur that she is going to tell his father that he is having an affair.  They were too busy in the middle of the world and their romance was not as important.  If I wanted to see the love of two people that would be great but I wanted more.  And then after they got married they had a baby.  It was all over.  This movie should not be on the list of best movies because it is so far off from being a good movie.  4.   "The Life of Birds" (1948) There is no doubt that this movie is a great film.  Director Alfred Hitchcock is an old master and I always enjoyed watching his movies.  After watching "The Birds" I felt like the movie was a great love story.  There was a lot of tension in the movie and it seemed like there was going to be a happy ending.  In the end, that did not happen.  "The life of birds" is a classic film and I still watch it a few times a year.  A classic is something that is timeless.  Now that I have said that, there is something wrong with this movie.  The main problem I had with this film was the fact that it was based on a true story. The story is about a young boy named Richard Bird who was found by a family that was in the process of moving and decided to stay with them.  When Richard was four years old he was diagnosed with a disease called hemophilia.  Richard was not supposed to live much longer
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________ The story of The Dark Knight was not very good. It had many things going against it. The script was not that good. The voice acting was terrible. And the cinematography was really bad. The acting was pretty bad. They were using the same actors over and over again. It was pretty hard to believe that the same actor (Christopher Nolan) had played Batman in three different movies. The Dark City was the first of the Batman movies that had an ending that was not great. The film was a disaster. The action scenes were horrible. They had horrible camera work, the special effects were not very impressive. It took the audience out of the film. But it was the perfect ending for Batman. The first two movies were great, and the third movie, The DarkKnight Rises, was so much better. The story is very good, and I like the characters. I enjoyed the film, but it didn't hold my attention for very long. I would recommend it if you are a Batman fan. The movie was not really that good, but I would still recommend it. If you like to see good action scenes, watch it. It is a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found that many people complained about the film, saying that the film was too long and had too many plot twists.  However, this film is not a good example of the style of "Twist and Shout" films.  In a nutshell, this is a comedy with many twists and a very well developed story.   It has a strong plot and has some suspense, but this movie has not much action, as it is a very funny film.  It is a perfect example of a movie with an action scene, but it has more laughs.  The best action scenes in this movie are the "Balls of Steel" scene, where the main character is trying to break his neck and when he is falling to his death, he uses a large rock to try and break his fall, as he falls and is going to die.  When the character does this, the rock goes through his head and he dies.  This scene is perfect and shows that there is a real person behind the character in the film. The next action scene in this film was also a great one.  During the fight between the main characters, the character that is about to be hit gets up and hits the character who is about a meter away from him.  He hits him hard enough to make him fall down.  Even though it does not happen, the audience still gets a good laugh from this scene.  I do not know how he did it, but he must have had some special skills.  One thing that is funny about this film, is that there are so many people that come in to watch this movie, but there is only one person that is the main hero.  A great movie that is not the greatest movie of all time, but still a great movie.     *If you want a good movie with a good plot and good acting, check out "A Night at the Roxbury" from this film.    I give this movie a rating of: 9 out of 10.

I didn not know what I was getting myself into. It was kind of a strange experience for me. It has some really cool stuff in it. But, I think that the worst part of this film is the ending. I mean, the ending, the end of this whole thing, I was just really disappointed with it. I don't think that they really understood what they were doing with the ending of this. I just don't really think that it was well thought out. But that was just the way it was.

The actors who played the kids did not do a good job, and the acting in this film was really poor.  It was a film where you thought the actors would get a bit more of a scene in the movie.  Also, the director was not very good either, but he did not know it.  I think this movie was written by an actor who is a fan of this series.  There are so many things that were wrong with this movie. I just can't see it being a good movie, but a movie like this is always good.

The acting is very poor, and the editing is so bad it makes you wonder what they were even trying to do. This movie was made for cheap money. It looks horrible, and it has a horrible sound quality, but the worst part is that it's very hard to watch. I don't recommend this movie to anyone.

They ask you how you like it, and you say, 'I love it!'" -James Bond, "A View to a Kill"   "What can I say about a film that, even when I've seen it, makes me want to go out and do it myself?" -Tom Cruise, "Top Gun"  , directed by Paul Verhoeven and starring Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, and Tommy Lee Jones, was a major hit when it came out in 1987. The film was based on a book by Dutch writer-director Paul Verhoven, and was the first big-budget science fiction film to make waves. The main characters in the film were a crew of people who work on a spaceship called the MIB, and their spaceship crash lands on Earth. They soon find that Earth is in ruins and that their spaceship is not alone. There are aliens, called "UFOs," and they are hostile towards humans.   The story is told through the eyes of the main character, James M. Bond. He is a CIA agent who has just been released from prison and he is sent on a mission to rescue his partner, and the ship's computer. The mission is complicated by the fact that the aliens have captured a young girl (Kirsten Dunston) who is also an alien. Bond discovers that the girl is a robot programmed to kill anyone who comes in contact with her, and that her only purpose on Earth is to kill humans. When Bond meets with the girl, she is wearing a gold dress that is meant to kill the humans if they ever get close enough. Bond must do what he can to help her, because the alien robots are coming.   a "who-knows-how-many" other people who were in the crew of the M.I.B. were also captured, but they were all rescued and were later rescued by a UFO that was sent by the aliens.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ The first time I saw this film, I was intrigued by the concept. I've always been a fan of the genre, and the idea of a group of "ghost hunters" roaming the back alleys of a dark and dangerous New England town. It was a nice concept, but I was a bit worried. When I got home, I found a great review about the movie by someone who actually lived in the town. The film's premise was a little bit off, and I wasn't sure about the actors. I liked the concept, so I kept watching, hoping to see some good performances. I'm not sure why this film had such a poor reception. I was just so taken by the film's dark atmosphere, and that it was all about a man who was trapped in his own life. The director, Robert Rodriguez, is a great director, but this film didn't work for me. The acting was awful, and it wasn't like he had to hide the truth from the characters. The movie's setting and characters just didn't match up to the movie. I don't even know why it had such poor reviews. It is a pretty good film, but it wasn  The story of this movie was great, and had a real creepy atmosphere. However, the story is a little too unbelievable for me to believe it was true.

The only reason I think this movie had a good reception was because of the director, who made a really great movie with a similar story.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ [Movie Review] Star Wars: Episode VI: Return of the Jedi: The Visual Experience [Spoilers ahead for Return of The Jedi] _____________________________________________________________________ "When I was a kid, I used to see this movie with my dad on Saturday mornings. He would tell me that he had never seen a better movie than Star Wars." This is a bold statement, but I will back it up with a good one. If you have seen Star Wars, and if you have been following this blog, you know that I am a huge fan of George Lucas' films. I loved the first film, I loved Return of a Jedi, I even love Episode III (although, I do wish they would have done more with the Ewoks). This is the last film he will be directing, and it's his most personal film. I can't imagine what it must have been like to go to a film set when it was being built, or what it was like to actually be there. When I was young, my dad was a teacher at a private school, and my mom worked in the school administration office. When we went to visit them, we would take our bicycles, which were the only means of transportation for the kids. One day my dad decided to show me some of the construction in the movie, and I remember thinking, "wow, this is cool." I never did get around to watching the rest of the movie. The rest of my friends and I were busy watching the movie on television, and the rest I didn't see. I did have a little peek at some of it, when I was in college, but the rest was off limits. I have a lot of fun with this film, but it has a few flaws. Let's start with the visuals. I don't want to say that the films are bad, but in the context of the era they were made, they are a little dated. The movie has a lot more action in it than it really needs, and most of it is kind of cheesy. The special effects are really good, but they seem a little too fake. It really does look like a computer generated image. The CGI in this movie is pretty impressive, but there are times when it comes off as over the top. I love the idea that the E.T.s are able to use their brains to fight, but this movie seems to take that idea too far. There is one sequence where the E

I've had a few mental problems since childhood and I have always been an anxious person. My mom and I were worried about my mental health because of all the media hype that was being brought out about the new James Cameron film "Avatar." We thought the movie would help my mental condition. Well I guess not. When I saw the trailer I knew that I was in for something very different. The movie starts out very intense and suspenseful. It seems like a very exciting movie, which is true, until the very end. It was like they were trying to make a movie about a war. They didn't show the aftermath of the war at all. The only thing that was shown were the soldiers going back to base. Then you hear a man talking about how a war should be. You then see a group of soldiers coming out of a building. They are in a line. They're all holding hands. Then the man says "No more wars." Then there's a pause and you see the soldiers walking away. Then a guy says "What are you doing? This is our home." Then the soldier says "Well, I guess it is." And the camera pans out to show a very small part of a town that has been devastated by war. Then we see a man walking up to a girl with a dog. The man looks up at her and says "I'll take you with me. I'll take the dog with me." Then he says "You won't go alone." And then you hear some gunshots. Then it cuts to a few seconds later and the guy is walking down the street in a city. There are a lot of people around him. He's wearing a hoodie. He says "This is the end of the world." And he pulls a gun on a group, which then is shown as a group that is standing around. The girl looks at him and he says, "You'll all die, you little bitch." Then it goes into a long shot of a bunch of people in a restaurant. Then in a long take the guy says, "(Expletive), you're the only one I want."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: **********This movie is bad. I had no idea what was going on for the first 10 minutes, and then the movie was just about to turn bad. The only reason I didn't give this movie a 0 is because it did have a few decent scenes. The story is terrible. The acting is terrible and the plot is terrible, and the only reason they had to do it was because they had the worst script ever written. They have a whole scene where the lead character just goes and shoots up a mall and then it shows a mall being bombed by terrorists. The terrorists just kill the cops and steal their guns, and now the police are all in hiding because they don't know if they can trust the cops. Then, the movie turns bad and the movie goes to black, and it turns out that the lead is an idiot. I was really hoping this movie would turn around, because it had some decent scenes and they could have made this movie good. But no, it turns into the worst movie I have ever seen. There was only one good thing in this movie, which is the acting and the story, but the acting sucks and the acting in this film is horrible. If you want to watch this movie that has all the best scenes, then you need to watch the first 3 minutes of this movie because the acting is bad in the beginning, but once you see all of the acting, it gets a 1.5. This movie should not be watched. There is a scene where a guy gets killed in a mall by a terrorist, and he is just sitting there, and a terrorist is just killing people. The terrorist just runs away and the guy is dead, but no one is shooting the terrorist because no one wants to be next. If the terrorist kills the guy, he should have been shot. There are lots of scenes where the terrorists are just killing everybody and no one shoots back. There were two terrorists who were just shooting randomly. There isn't even a terrorist with a gun, just some random guy who was shooting random people. There should have actually been a terrorist who had a gun in the movie. There needs to be a terrorist in the story. This is not a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________   This movie was absolutely terrible. I didn't care for it at all. There is a very short scene of a girl running away from her abusive husband. This is followed by a bunch of other scenes of the husband and wife having sex. The scenes all ended with the husband saying, "I love you." and the wife saying, nothing. I mean nothing. She just sort of sat there with her eyes closed and looked at the ground and didn't say anything. I found this to be very, very disturbing.   I found this movie to be totally lacking in plot and it is not the kind of movie that you can just sit back and enjoy. It is very slow-paced and very boring. It took me a lot longer to watch this movie than it took to actually read the description. I actually spent a long time trying to figure out what the hell was going on.   the main character is a woman who was abused as a child. The only reason she has a daughter is because she has sex with the father of her daughter, which she enjoys doing. She decides to marry the father and have children with him. The first scene of her having sex with her husband is very disturbing and the father doesn't seem to mind. After the first time, he becomes very angry with her and says he's going to kill her and all of her family if she doesn't do it again. She refuses to do it and he leaves. The next day, she comes home to find her mother dead. Her mother was stabbed to death and it was revealed that the daughter was the murderer. She tells her husband that she's going with him to the police station, but he insists that they kill her first. He doesn't care and says that he'll kill her if she tries to leave again. After they kill the mother, they go to the local police station to talk to the chief. She talks to him about what happened and he tells her that he's sorry but there's nothing they can do and that he just wanted to have a daughter. She is devastated, but she decides to go with him anyway.  , which was based on a real case, is an odd movie. It features a woman with a daughter who has a violent abusive husband and a violent boyfriend. She also has a job as a prostitute and she ends up having a sexual relationship with her boss. The movie is pretty funny and pretty disturbing at the same time. It's pretty bad
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ (that's how it goes sometimes)  Review of: The Devil Wears Prada  First off, I would like to say that I enjoyed this movie. I would not call it a bad flick, but I just think that it has a lot of things wrong with it. First off, there is a really bad acting job in this movie by all the actors, but it's not enough to stop the movie from being very enjoyable. There are also some scenes that just aren't funny and it's hard to take it seriously. Also, I have to give it a few points for being a remake. If you have seen the original, then you know that it is a very different movie. However, I did enjoy this movie and I think that you would too. I gave this movie a B-.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Would you like to write a good review about your favorite movie? Would you enjoy it if somebody gave you a good rating about it? Please read this message and then answer the questions. We'll send you the answers as soon as possible: If you would like to tell a friend about this movie, please tell him to watch this movie. (You have to be a real friend.) If you have a good feeling about this film, please give it a good score. If you don't like this movie and you are not a fan of horror films, please avoid it. If the movie doesn't give you the feeling of dread, then don't watch it. (If you are really scared, then watch it.) You don't have to watch all the scenes if you don,t want to. Just watch the first part and the rest of the movie will be fine. (The rest of it will not be so scary.) If the scene that you don' t like in this movie is a bit disturbing, then skip it and try to get a good picture in your head. If this movie makes you scared and makes you feel sad or sad about your life, then you don`t have to worry about it. The movie doesn`t show you anything bad about your friends or family. (A lot of horror movies don` t show this.) The movie tells you the truth about the life you have and about what you are going to live after this. This movie is not a story about how some evil people kill a lot of people and how the police don't catch them. The story tells you about what a real human being is. The real horror movie is about a person who has some problems. This is a movie about a man who wants to live a normal life. He wants to keep the memories of his past, and he wants to get out of this city where he is trapped. The city is called San Francisco. He lives in San Francisco for a while, and after that, he goes back to Chicago. He does a lot in the city, and all the people of this world are trying to catch him. The only problem with the movie is that it is not scary. The film is not frightening. There are some moments where the movie becomes a little scary, but for the most part, the movie feels like a thriller. But there are some scenes that will make you afraid. But if you watch this film on its own, and don't want

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Do not watch this movie __________   The plot is pretty simple:  A man is about to start a new job in a new city. His boss has a secret which he needs to hide from his new colleague.  He starts a sexual affair with his co-worker's wife.  the boss then tells his new worker that he has an affair and threatens to tell his wife. He also tells his boss that he wants to get the wife and the husband out of the house and has already made the arrangements.  to do that he will need money and the new worker is to help him out.  and so the worker is given $15,000 dollars.  "I want to have sex with your wife", the boss says. . The worker is then sent to the house. The wife finds out what he is doing and tells the boss to leave. But the boss gets a car and is driven to the city where he can continue his affair with the wife.   I will give this movie 3 stars. It's a good story with a good script. The problem is that it was poorly made. The acting was pretty good, the camerawork was nice, the music was good, and there were some good cinematography, but there were many bad scenes and I found that the movie was ruined by bad editing. The scenes were all too similar, and many of them were quite long. I found myself wanting to watch a different movie because of this.   The script had a lot of potential. It was really interesting. It had a good plot. The film could have been good. But the editing was bad, and it was really hard to follow. I felt like I was watching a different film.

I really did not expect much from this but it ended up being a lot worse than the first two films. The first two were pretty good but this one just felt like a rushed and cheap idea. The acting was pretty good, but the story itself was a big letdown. I hope they go back to the second film because I really liked the first one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ (If you liked this, I'm sure that the movie is a terrible one.) I didn't find it to be that great. The whole thing felt too "me" to me. I mean, this movie is supposed to be about how we are all human beings, but I didn�t feel like it was all that human. I would say that I felt like I was watching a movie about an alien, but the alien didn�ve any personality. I found it hard to get into it, even though I had seen it a couple of times before. I feel like the whole movie is too long and to long. I really can�t believe that I would even have to watch this again. I don�t know why this movie was made, because it wasn�t very good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ (Spoilers ahead for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1)  The first Hunger Games movie is pretty awful, but it's not as bad as The Hunger Force. While The HungerForce is one of the most awful movies ever made, The HungerForcers is just a big dumb mess of a movie that's more of a joke than anything else. I don't have anything bad to say about the first Hunger Force movie, but The Hunger Forcers is a total piece of crap.  I was really looking forward to The HungerGames: Moringay - Part I, because it was one of my favorite books. I had heard that the book was really good, but I had no idea how good it really was. I loved the book so much, that I decided to see if I could make a movie out of it. When I read the book, I fell in love with Katniss Everdeen. She was so smart, strong, brave, and resourceful. She had such a beautiful, brave face and her attitude was infectious. She never once gave up on anything and never took any crap from anyone. Her courage and kindness are contagious. I really wanted to see her triumph in the Hunger Games. She always had a plan and always did what was best for her. I was so excited to see the movie, and I really hoped for her to win.  a lot of the actors are really good. I love how the director, Gary Ross, got such great performances out of so many different actors. For example, I love Cicely Tyson and I just loved her as Katnisk. She's so beautiful and she has such a great personality. I hope she's going to win!  My favorite actor in the movie is Jennifer Lawrence. She just had the best performance out of all of them. She really had it going on and I was really impressed by her. She wasn't afraid to get really violent or do a lot more than she had in the book.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I have a bad feeling about this film. I do not understand why the makers of this film would have a cast that is so full of actors and actresses who have no talent. The film is so unoriginal and poorly acted that it makes it impossible to believe that anyone was trying to make a movie of this. The plot is so boring and dull that it is easy to forget that it has any real plot at all. And then there is the film's subject matter. I will not be discussing that subject matter, but the way the film treats its subject matter is so offensive that I will be shocked if this movie is ever released in the U.S. or in any other English speaking country. This film is an example of what happens when you try to make an anti-Communist movie. The only thing the makers can think of to make this film appealing to the average American is to use actors and an actress that are extremely well known in Hollywood. I guess the idea was that if the film had a little more money and publicity, it could have a chance to succeed. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The picture was so bad that I think it could never have been released at all."  In order to make the film seem more like a "communist movie," some of the cast members were made to wear a Communist Party T-shirt. (This film was also known as "The Red Movie" or "The Communist Party Film.") The film was screened in Hollywood on October 22, 1950, at a showing that was organized by the Communist Party of America. The cast included George Segal, a member of the Screen Actors Guild; John Garfield, a former U. S. Senator from California; and Charles Bronson, a well-known movie actor. (George Segal's performance was the most impressive of the entire movie.) Segal had worked with the Communist party before, when he was in the Communist youth group called the Youth International Party, which was known as the Red Guard. During the war, he had been a Red Guard member in France and later joined the Communist Youth League. He was also a member, for a short time, of the Communist Labor Party. He joined the Hollywood Communists in 1926 and, in the film, he says that the Communist group of which he was a member had "great influence over the Hollywood community." This was not his only association with the party. He is quoted in a news
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  This movie is awful. It's just terrible. I'm really disappointed that someone made this film, because the premise is so ridiculous. You're just going to walk through a door and come out in a world that looks just like ours. Then, you're going to get a message from the President. Then a few weeks later, you get a second message. Then you go to a house where someone has been murdered. Then someone comes up to you and says, "Oh, you killed someone. I've been looking for you, and I think you killed him. I can tell from his shoes." It's so ridiculous, but I can't say I'm disappointed because I love this movie. It does not disappoint at all. I was laughing my ass off. This movie is so cheesy, so stupid, so absurd. I thought I was going to die when they brought in the President's message, but it was actually a secret message. That's the best part. This is one of those movies where you don't even realize that you're watching it. I just knew it was a bad one, but watching it was just funny. This was the funniest movie I have ever seen. The cast is so bad that it's kind of funny. The worst part about the movie is that the ending was so lame. I don't know why they even had a movie like this. If you think this is a bad idea, please just don't do it. It is just not worth it. If someone told me to make a bad sequel, I would say that it would be great. I would do it right away. The thing about a sequel is that you have to keep making them because people keep asking for more. I think they did this one so they could sell a sequel to a different movie that they have already made. They tried to get it made, but no one would pay for a sequel. It was a good idea, but they just didn't have the balls to do it themselves. This would be a great movie to make if you wanted to make the sequel to that movie. I know I would have loved to see this movie if it was the sequel.

Brooklyn 12 Months Vacation  Theater reviews are often wrong. A theater reviewer, for example, will miss the entire point of a movie. If you are reading one, be sure to ask if you have missed something or are missing a point. Sometimes theater critics have bad eyes. The same is true of moviegoers. There are a lot of bad movies out there and they are all missed by the most people. There is no perfect film. There may be many that are very good but they are not worth seeing. . For me, the best movies are the ones that I just have to sit through. I'm not trying to see every movie that comes out. I don't need to see The Force Awakens. I saw it in a theater because I knew I would not be able to watch it in my home. That's why I watch movies in theaters, so that I don 't have to waste time on a movie that I have no interest in. It's the perfect way to spend an afternoon. It's also a great way to find out about movies. I go to the movies because I want to see something new. I have my own opinions about films and I always want to learn more about them. I am a very curious person and that is what makes movies so much fun. If I don' t know anything about a movie, then I will never enjoy it. I want people to be curious about my opinions and then go watch the movie themselves. That is the reason I read the comments. This year has been very good to me. I got to see so many films and see some really great films. I also saw a lot more than I ever expected to see. I watched a lot, and it was good to sit back and see the film, then to read some of the comments that people left. I loved The Big Sick, which was a movie I thought I was going to see only once. I thought it was the same old story about a woman who falls in

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ Have a really bad movie. If you think you will be able to watch it without getting sick, then you're right. I felt ill the whole time and had to leave the theater before the end. I will never go to a movie theater again. The people there should have known that the audience is a sick group of people. There is no reason for anyone to be sick during a movie. It is a very sad commentary on society. It's like people are trying to take advantage of the people around them. The director was trying to create a good impression but I am sure that he was disappointed by the audience. This movie is just a bad comedy. __________________  I used to think I knew how movies were made. I used to have a lot of confidence in myself. But now I know that if I knew then, I would not be making movies anymore. I think a movie should be good, but not that good. If a movie is good, you will laugh and not get sick. ______________

I don't understand how a movie can make a huge profit and then lose $50 million dollars. I hate this movie and I will never see it. It was made by a bad director who just wanted to make a bad film. I want to see a movie that is worth seeing and it is NOT this movie.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Awful movie... This movie makes me sad. It's not a good movie at all. It made me angry.

I don't know why this movie is still in circulation. It's a terrible movie, and I can't believe they still have it in theaters. If you are looking for a movie that's full of nudity and profanity, then this is the movie for you. It features a lot of nudity, sex, and violence, but there are also some pretty good performances. I can remember when I was a kid and I loved this movie, because it was the first film I ever saw that really featured the exploitation film genre, and they were the kind of films that really took off after they came out. This movie is very popular in many countries in Europe, and even in some countries in the US. I guess the reason that this movie still has such a huge following is that it is a good exploitation film that you can really enjoy.

I was waiting for an amazing movie with great characters and story, but it's the opposite, I wanted to watch a boring movie about a girl, not a good movie, and the reason why I didn't watch it was the story, I don't like how M.I.A. started, she is alone in a place and she's not very confident, she has no plan or reason for leaving the place, she can't do anything.  I thought that this was the start of a great story about a very strong woman who is very independent and has to get out of the place and do what she has to do. , but I was wrong.  the movie doesn't start very good, I can't say why because the movie has no plot and no characters.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know if it's a good movie or a bad one, but this one is a huge let down.  The cast is very strong, with great performances by the likes of Ben Affleck, Gary Oldman, Anthony Hopkins, and Christopher Plummer.  In the beginning of the film, we are told about a group of people who have been kidnapped by a group called the New World Order.  The New World order is basically a group that is not evil, but rather the ones trying to take control of the world.  It's not until the end of the movie that the New world order is revealed to be the same group that kidnapped our characters.  There are a few things that make this movie interesting.   We are told that these characters are not really dead.  They are "alive" and still around, but it isn't really clear if that's true.  In fact, I don't really see a reason why they wouldn't just call off the New York and London attacks and then let them live.  Also, we learn that the people who are kidnapped are in a camp in the Canadian wilderness.  We are told they are the "good guys", but that doesn't make any sense.  One of them, Richard Price, gets shot in the head.  How is it possible that they could get to the camp in Canada and not kill everyone on sight?  There is a scene that shows the camp being destroyed and people being killed.  I don´t really think it is a good idea to show that in a movie like this.  What I think was an interesting idea was the idea that we are watching a documentary about the people that were kidnapped.  This is a way for the audience to learn about the characters and why they are being kidnapped. Unfortunately, this doesn't really work.  Although we learn about their captivity, it doesn't give us a lot of details.  For example, we don't learn much about how they were kidnapped, why they were taken, or who is in charge.  However, I think it was a good choice to show us the destruction that the camp is in.  But really, that's about it.  Honestly, I didn't know much about the New Y or the New W.  Most of what I learned about them was that they were evil and that they took over the world through a virus.  All that I know about them

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________, and the worst part about it, was how it was written.  "Carmen Sandiego", a film which, I am ashamed to say, has not received a lot of critical praise for some reason, was written by Michael Mann. I am not going to go into great detail on the plot and its shortcomings, because it is not really important, but the thing that I did not like about this film, is that I just felt it was a "whitewash" on the part of the producers. I will not go into any details about the casting of the main character, but I will say that it was not at all believable. I do not care how good a movie is, if there are a lot actors in it, that is what makes a good movie, and this film was made with too many actors. .

I wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone. I don't even like horror movies and i was in a really bad mood while watching this movie so i don't want to watch it again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ Why not go for a classic, and pick something with no plot, no characters, and no characters who are not in the movie, such as The Wizard of Oz. You get the feeling that the actors were only given one role, and that is to perform the role of Dorothy. I think this is a better movie, but the sound is just horrible. I don't even want to watch this movie. I'm sure there are many who would like this movie, as it is a classic. But this movie would be better if there was no soundtrack, and the actors had never heard of this movie before they did it. I really thought that it would be good, but I would not watch it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ I've never seen a movie so bad I was tempted to give it an A rating, but when you see how awful it is, you can't imagine that it would get a B.   I thought the movie was hilarious at first. The lead character (who doesn't even speak) is a former college football player, and he decides to get a tattoo of his old coach's initials on his arm. He goes to a tattoo parlor, where he is asked to look for a guy with a good tattoo. So, he goes with a guy who looks a bit too old for him, and has a huge tattoo of a skull on his face. Then, when he gets a new tattoo of the same coach's name, he tells him that he doesn't want to look like that. He tells the guy he has no problem with his old tattoo, but his new tattoo is too much. Then the guy's boss comes in and talks to the tattoo guy. Then his boss asks him if he has a problem with the tattoo. Then he gives him a choice. If he doesn`t want to get the tattoo, then he has to leave. If the tattooist doesn't like him, then it can stay on. The tattoo guy is a very good tattoo artist, and if you look at the photos of him on the internet, you will notice that he has the most amazing body. He has a very muscular body, but he doesn't look like a body builder. He looks like a ripped bodybuilder, which is a good thing because he looks so good in the movie. He was pretty good at his job too. The movie shows the tattooer in action. He gets the tattoo on the guy, and after a few days, the guy starts to go through some withdrawal symptoms. He is always having problems with his back, and all he does is sit around and watch TV all day. So his boss takes him to a psychiatrist, who tells him to take a sleeping pill. The next day, the tattoo artist tells the tattoo shop owner that the guy has to take more of the sleeping pills. The guy does, and his back starts to get better. However, the man still goes back to his old habits. So one day, he is at the tattoo parlour, and the guy comes in. The man asks the tattoo painter to take off his shirt, and when he does, he notices that his tattoo is gone. He thinks that
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Watch: 'Jurassic World' - The movie that won't die   The film's lead, Chris Pratt, is a gifted actor and he does an amazing job as Owen, a young man who becomes the leader of the Jurassic World, the park that is the first human-sized dinosaurs ever.  And the movie takes us on an amazing adventure as we see Owen and his team battle and escape from dinosaurs, giant spiders and other creatures that could wipe out humanity.   It's a very good movie with a great lead and a strong cast. ... and I will continue to review movies.  the movie's lead Chris Pratt is a talented actor.  and he did an amazing work as Owen.  of course I saw Jurassic World before it was released, but this time I was lucky enough to go to the cinema. Bearing in mind that I have seen the Jurassic Park trilogy and all the films in the series, this is my first time watching Jurassic World. I must say that I was really impressed. In the first few minutes we are introduced to Chris Pratt who plays Owen Grady, the lead character. We see Owen Grable on a flight from LA to New York. His flight was cancelled, so he has to wait for the next one, but we soon see that he is very disappointed. He is trying to make friends and make plans with his girlfriend and his friends, but all of a sudden his friends and girlfriend leave him because they think that he's crazy. He doesn't really know what's going on, but he is determined to make sure that he gets on that flight. So, Owen Grabe is on a very difficult mission. The whole movie is about him trying to survive the world of Jurassic World and get on that plane. So, it's not easy for Owen. He's very intelligent and he has a good team around him. I also loved his girlfriend Emily Blunt. They have a great relationship. They are very good friends. But when they start seeing each other, Emily doesn't like Owen. She doesn't understand that he has an intense need to be with his friends. It is really a very interesting relationship. We see that when she says that to him, he reacts very badly. But that's okay, because she is a very attractive woman. She is a sexy woman. And you see that from
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  Rating: 1/5   My wife and I both watched this movie together. I've heard a lot about it but didn't have any real expectations. I was expecting it to be a good movie. Well, we both ended up feeling a little disappointed. The story wasn't all that original, the acting was terrible and the music was very generic. It felt like a rip off of a couple of other movies. The acting is so bad that you can tell the actors were not really actors. I felt like this movie was just going to be another one of those bad movies that Hollywood does with cheap actors. This movie was only interesting because it's about the life of a guy who had to kill someone he killed in the past. Well he didn't. I mean he wasn't trying to kill anyone. It was just something that he did. It wasn't like he actually got remorse for it. I don't understand why the movie made so much money when it was only worth about $25.00. If you are going to make a movie like this then make it about something else. I think this movie should be called "A good guy who just had to die." I guess this movie has a few good things but it's not worth the time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________... It's a movie about a woman who's just gone to prison and she's having a hard time adjusting to prison life... The movie is about a real person and I believe it was filmed well.. But this movie is NOT about that. It's about the woman. I can't remember if it was the first or last time I saw this movie but I'm pretty sure that it wasn't in this one. It was a movie that I never really watched again because it wasn;t good. But the last time that I watched it was about 6 months ago and I think that it was a little better. But I didn't really like it because it was not a good movie.. If you like movies about women that are like a bad soap opera, this movie might be for you. I guess it's because I didn;t like it. ____________..  Xenu's Wife is the sequel to Xenu's Brain. Both movies were about a man named George who is sent to prison after a crime he committed. George and his wife had a very complicated and happy relationship that was interrupted by George's imprisonment. The movie was directed by John Carpenter, who also directed Halloween. The original movie was a remake of the 1978 science fiction movie The Thing from Another World.  The story takes place about a century after a scientist created a planet-wide computer virus called Xenu and the aliens who created it. Xenu created the virus so that it could control the planet and its inhabitants. The aliens were also able to create a human-like life form called the "Xenomorph". The Xenomorphs are very aggressive and will kill any other alien that they come across. The film was directed and written by Michael Rooker and John Carpenter.  a movie where a man gets sent to jail after being caught having a couple of kids with a woman named Xenu (which is actually a real name). The woman is actually his wife and the couple has a good relationship. The woman tries to get George to stop getting involved with the woman and he refuses, saying that he loves her. So the woman begins to torture him, calling him a pedophile and a homo. When she starts to beat George he is eventually able to fight back. George eventually kills her and escapes. The next day the man is in jail for killing his wife. He's in for a long stay in prison and George is sent
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________ A guy goes to an open mic night in his old town, the only one left in town. He goes there with his wife and his friend, and their friend's mom. The night is going to be a bit boring, but then he sees some guy playing the accordion on stage, and he thinks that's cool. It seems that the guy is a big star of a popular band, so he asks him to play with him. The guy is cool, and they start to jam. They get a few good songs together, and then they start having a hard time with a song. They play some more, and it seems that they're getting the songs together. After a while, they start playing some songs that are more rock n roll. The guitarist seems to be having a lot of fun, and the band starts to play faster and faster. They're having fun, but the audience starts to leave, and even the girl who's with them leaves. The dude gets up on the stage and says that they should get out there and jam. The guys are all excited to play again, but they realize that they've got to go to their next gig. They say that they'll call it a night, but when they get there they hear the guitar player has died. They all cry, and when the guy comes back onstage he starts playing some more rock and roll. At this point, they're all pretty upset, but it doesn't last long. They leave the venue, and a few days later they come back to town and they see that the guitar guy has come back as a ghost. He has the same clothes he had at the opening show. He also has a few more guitar picks than he did at the last gig. The band decides to play a gig for him, and one of the guys gets the guitar pick he used in the last show, so the guy can play with them. The guitar player says that the only way they can get out of the funk is if they play some rock n' roll. After that, he starts to get really good, and some of the other guys start to join in. When they get the song going, the audience is into it, and everyone's singing along. The music is really good and they finish the song, and everybody leaves. At the end of the song they realize the guitar is really a ghost, and that the dude is alive again. The dudes ask if the guy was really

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ The story: When a man and a woman fall in love with a young woman who happens to be a witch, they have to move in together because she has magical powers. They begin to fall for each other and their life together gets complicated. The story is a mixture of horror, magic, and love, which is very rare. It also has the main character of a witch who uses a cane to communicate with the outside world. There are a lot of good scenes with the main characters, such as when they first meet and when they are in the house, the way they are always being chased by an evil ghost, the first scene where they are forced to watch the movie that the evil witch made, and the scene when the witch makes the witch fall in the lake to die. The best part of this movie is when the woman is telling her story. Her story is really well done. The sound: _____________________ The sound is okay. The film is a lot like a fairy tale with many fairy tale themes and many familiar things. The music and the lyrics are wonderful. The acting is pretty good, with a lot going on in every scene. The one thing that I liked the most was the way the witch is always seen talking to the witch. This helps to make her seem a little more human. The characters: _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ There are not a lot to the characters. The main character, the witch, is the main attraction of the movie. She has a lot more personality than most of the characters and this is not a bad thing. But, there are also the other characters. These characters are very well done and the way in which they act helps make the movie really enjoyable. It is a great movie, even though it is not the best movie. But if you want a nice movie about a witch and a man falling in love, then you should see this movie. There is some action in this movie, and it was very well written. It really shows how important a witch is. It shows how the witch can heal people, how she can use her powers to help people and also make others evil. There was also some good scenes where the witch was talking with a boy and a girl and the witch told the boy what he should do with his life. The bad part about the movie is that the movie was very long and it could have been shorter. The only thing that the director should have done was to cut some of the scenes and

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ "A great movie" is the best way I can explain this film. I've seen a lot of great movies, but not a lot that are good. It's a very good movie, but it's just so over-the-top. The action scenes are just crazy. You can't help but think that this was the movie that was made to be a spoof of all the big action movies that were coming out at the time. The movie also has great characters and the acting is great. It also doesn't take itself seriously. If you're going to watch this movie, you should go in with a big open mind. The ending is a bit of a letdown. I'm glad I saw this before it was released on VHS, because I wouldn't have seen it otherwise.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ ___________ Why I didn't like it: The movie was boring, the plot is bad, the acting is very poor, the action is not realistic, the sound is terrible, and the story is boring. I also hate this movie because the whole thing just got ridiculous. This movie should have been titled "The movie about a girl who falls in love with a big ugly monster". It was supposed to be a romance, but it was so terrible, that I think it was supposed be a comedy. It also was a bad idea to cast James Cameron as a monster. It would have made the movie funnier, and it could have made a good monster movie. This was the worst movie I have seen in years. It was like watching a really bad movie, but with an annoying character. _________________________________________________ I gave this movie a 3.5/5 because it was a little boring, and a little ridiculous, but I think that it was better than I thought it would be.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  When I hear the words "I don't know if I've ever seen this movie," I instantly want to look it up. It's a bit of a shame, because I really enjoyed this movie. But I can't say that I'm a huge fan of the old school "Star Wars" movies. And this movie isn't all that bad. There's nothing wrong with this movie, but there is something about the plot that just doesn't sit well with me. I thought that the film was actually pretty good, with a lot of humor and action. There are a lot more of the same old cliches, but they're still funny. I like that the characters are interesting and different. They have to grow and change, and they do. I just can't get behind that last scene where Darth Vader has a heart attack, and the Emperor kills him. The film was very well done, and I think that it has a lot to offer. It was a fun time. I liked that they gave me the choice between the old and the new, and it seemed to work. I was very surprised that I was so in love with the character of Vader, especially after he was killed by his own son. He seems very human, and not just a robot. It is a great character, and he has a great death scene. There is a lot I like about the film, and there is a little bit of "Star Trek" thrown in. This is a movie that you can watch as an adult, but it's still fun to watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     A good movie like "Lion" is hard to come by. I mean, "Lions" is a good movie. It has great cinematography and great performances from everyone involved.  "Lions", the story of a young lion cub, follows him as he tries to find his mother and family. He ends up meeting a group of men who are looking for the same thing, but their search ends up being a tragedy.  to give you a little background on the movie, it was based on the book "The Lion King" by Michael Bond. The film has some great songs like "A Change Is Gonna Come", "Circle of Life", and "Hakuna Matata".  The film was directed by John McTiernan, who also made "Die Hard". The cinematography was done by Tim Burton and the sound was done a bit by David Selby, but the real stars of the film are the performances from John Goodman and Bryan Cranston. They are great together and this is one of the best performances ever.  the only downside is that the acting is so great and the story is so well told, that it makes it hard to relate to the story and it gets kind of annoying to watch the characters do all the stupid stuff that they do. This was the only real downside to the film, and it is a pretty big drawback. ,,,,,,,,, ,,  Overall, "The Lonesome Lion" is an amazing movie and it's a great watch for all ages.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This movie sucks." You can always count on these two idiots to come up with something bad. The whole movie is just a huge clusterfuck of stupidity. The movie starts off well enough with a great opening scene of a couple of characters arguing over how to get into the best college in the city.  This is a good enough scene to set the stage, but the rest of the movie is a disaster. The best part about this movie is how boring and unimaginative it is. The characters are bland, the plot is pointless, and the acting is so bad that it's funny. The writing in this movie makes it look like a kid's cartoon. The plot is so stupid and convoluted that it doesn't make sense for the characters to even be in this stupid plot at all. It's just like a dumb kid's version of The Goonies, with more lame characters. The film never takes a step forward and the characters just keep on going the same old stupid path, and eventually end up with some kind of mystical sword that gives them super powers. They even make a whole scene about a giant ball of fire that they are trying to get their hands on, but it ends up being an evil wizard. There's also some kind kid in the movie who has super strength and can move things with his mind, but again, it's just another stupid plot device.  The acting is the best part of this movie though. I'd say the most memorable character is the kid in black who looks like a cross between a retarded and a psychotic. He's very annoying and has some of the worst acting in a movie I've seen in a long time. The worst part about the movie was the way it was shot. The special effects in this film are just awful. I don't even want to watch this movie because it's so bad. Even the special effects of this film aren't that good. The fight scenes are just horrible. The CGI is just so bad, and there are a few moments where I couldn't tell if the characters were real or not.  This movie is so much of a mess that I'm not even going to attempt to review it. If you want to see something bad, just go to any Disney movie. It will be more entertaining than this movie. The plot is too complicated to explain in words. It just goes on and on. The acting sucks, and if you think it looks bad in the movies, wait

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!The cast is good in this movie but it's all just one actor playing 2 or 3 characters, not like in the movies from this era like the other movies in this series. The movie takes place in a bar and they make a movie of this movie which I don't think is a very good movie. There are some good and bad scenes but they don't really make sense and the movie was just so lame. The one thing I like about this movie is that they put a guy in a mask and he just stands around for like an hour making it really hard to watch this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  I've seen it 3 times in the theaters and I am just so sick of this crap.  The acting is all awful, but then, the whole movie is awful.  I didn't even see the film. It is a comedy with a guy and a girl, who are in love. They have a big fight at a party, and then she leaves and goes to a hotel room. The next day he finds a dead body. So he does some digging and discovers she died in a freak accident.  "I was going to kill you, you little bastard." "I don't care about that. I love you." "What?" "You know what I love? My family." "Well, I know what you love. That big, fat, ugly motherfucker with the glasses." So he beats her to death, and he goes out into the woods, and I can see a flash of light in the distance. He finds this beautiful, mysterious light and he realizes that this is his new life, and that is the only life he will ever have. This is a good movie. I think it is a great movie, but it is awful, and there is no way it should have been made. "You've got to see this movie, it's so great. It will change your life." "No, you don't understand, you can't change my life. I'm the one who should change it. I've got the only thing that could give it all away." -Sylvia Plath  This movie is so awful that I have to agree with Sylvia Plath's comments. The only thing this movie could do is go out of business.    I just watched this on DVD, and it looks better than the movie I saw on television. I thought it was better in the theater. The guy in the movie was great. I like the way the director and cinematographer used natural light in their film. They used very little CGI. I really thought it could have been a real movie, if it wasn't for the fact that the director used some really terrible acting.   It was fun watching this movie with my wife. We both love Sylvia Plaths and her books. She loves this movie. She didn't like the movie the first time we saw it, but she likes it now. It makes us feel that she really did love the characters in this movie when she wrote the poems

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! The only thing i really liked was that it had a very funny and unique ending, but the film was terrible. I mean, the story was great, but it was so long and boring. I'm sure it's not that bad a movie, but i thought it would be a good idea to try a new writer for a short film. The only problem was that the writer did not have much experience, and he made a lot of mistakes in the writing. The story was so confusing and not really funny at all, it was also not a good experience for a child to watch a movie like this. I didn't even think the film could be made any worse, but my child did. He was confused and frustrated. But, i do think the movie should be seen by adults and maybe adults should see it too. But i don't think that this movie is a good one.  …

I thought it was a good movie and thought it would have been better if it had been edited a little better, but it was still a very nice movie and I would recommend it to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting a great movie to be made about this great game.  Instead, I found a movie with a weak plot, poorly done acting, and a weak script.    It's not a good movie because it's not about the game, but the movie is a waste of money.  I'd rather see a new version of this game that makes the game better.  The only positive about this movie is the fact that it's about a woman who is a good fighter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ I saw this movie and the worst part is that it's really stupid. This is a bad idea of making a film for kids and I really wish that they would have stopped. This movie has nothing to do with the original "Casper" and it's very annoying and not funny at all. I think the writers of this film didn't have any idea how to write a comedy, because they didn't do anything right. I've seen worse and better, but this movie just wasn't funny. The story line was also stupid and they made a mistake with the "casper" character. The movie was really hard to watch and the ending was too ridiculous. If you like a movie that is just a silly comedy then this is not the movie for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________  "The film is an example of how to make a film, that doesn't try to be anything it isn't.  In the film, there is a young man (played by Daniel Brühl) who meets his old friend, a woman (played with great acting by Lina Leanders) who wants to escape from her bad life. They make plans to travel to Mexico. ... The journey is full of danger. There is a lot of excitement, and a lot is said in the film. The characters are realistic, and the film is filled with great shots. ,  It's really well made and well made with good acting, but it is so bad. I just can't recommend this film to anyone. If you want to see a great, well made movie, go to 'The Wild Bunch'. If you're looking for a great film, look for 'Citizen Kane'. If I had to choose, I would choose 'The Magnificent Seven' (which is better than 'The Seven Samurai').  -The Magnificient Seven' is a far better film than this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ It is a film that does not deserve a 4/10. In fact, I think it is one of the worst films I have ever seen. ____________ I did not enjoy it. _________________ 1) A bunch of children are playing in a garden. One of the children, a girl, runs off and hides behind a tree. The next day, the same child is standing there. It is the same girl. The kids are playing with the tree. Suddenly, a big bird flies over the garden. The child is terrified. She goes to hide behind the tree again. The bird flies again and this time it catches her. She screams. The girl is scared. The kid is scared because she is trapped in the tree and if she escapes she will be eaten. So the kid jumps off the tree to escape. The same thing happens to the other kids who are in the garden when the bird flies. The film then jumps to the next day. The boy who was trapped in a tree that day is now in the same tree. He is the boy who has just escaped. It seems that the bird has eaten all the children but the kid who was in the previous tree is still in it. The guy who was at the top of the tree, the bird's mother, is waiting for her son to return. She wants him to come and pick her up. The other kids go into the garden and try to escape from the bird, but they are too late. The mother picks up her son, takes him into the tree with her, and they go back into the world. I really didn't like this movie. ___________________________ 2) The mother of the bird that ate the kids is now looking for her baby. She has an idea to get it out of the nest. She gets a ladder and climbs up into the nest to get the baby. When she gets into the bird nest, she has the baby and it starts to cry. She grabs the baby by the feet and takes it out. The baby then looks at her and goes into a fit of rage. The woman screams. She turns the baby over on its back. The whole time she is screaming. The birds come to the nest and eat the baby while the woman screams and runs out. ___________________________________ 3) The woman is now alone.

I wasn't going to admit it at first, but as we watched the movie, I started to really think he had a point. The movie was just a bunch of stuff that went on in a bad way. I'm pretty sure the movie had some kind of storyline, but it didn't go on for very long, and it didn I really enjoyed this movie. I don't really know why I watched it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "In an attempt to help make a film about a dog that is trapped in a small car look more realistic, a crew member uses a digital camera to take a close-up shot of the dog's backside. Unfortunately, the result is a filmic representation of a dog's anus and rear end that is not at all flattering to a dog with a long neck."   This is a very strange statement. What about a digital film camera? The "digital camera" was a standard lens. In order to get a closeup of the rear end of a dalmatian, you'd have to use a long lens, and that would require a long telephoto lens to do it. The "long lens" was the lens that was in use. And what is the problem? It is a standard camera lens. A lot of films were shot on a wide-angle lens. This was an expensive lens. So why not shoot a film on a standard 35mm film camera that could have a wider field of view? In the early days of cinema, there were many different kinds of cameras. Most of them had a viewfinder that gave a "movie-style" view of the screen. This way, when the actors moved from one part of the scene to another, the audience could see them as they moved. The viewfinder, of course, was on a separate "shutter" plate, and was usually mounted on the lens itself. The lens was set to the same distance as the film and the camera moved from left to right. This allowed the actors to look in every direction at the same time. This worked very well, because the actors could talk and act at the exact same time, while the audience was able to follow the action. The lenses were also quite wide. This is the way they could shoot with two people, or a group of people, on the same screen. The wide angle lens gave a sense of intimacy to the film. The camera could zoom in on the actor's face, so that it would be clear that he was really looking at you. It was as if you were really there with him. This intimacy gave the audience a feeling of intimacy with the characters, as well. This "film-style viewfinder" lens was also a great way to shoot a musical number, where the actors would be standing in front of the camera, and the audience would see them moving back and forth. A musical number requires an extremely wide
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________  I was really hoping for a good movie to be enjoyed with a glass of wine and a movie to keep me company. Instead I got a film that was poorly made, not funny and had very bad acting and dialogue. The worst part of this movie is the characters. There were no characters in this movie that could be likable or believable. This movie was very bad and I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I hate it.  Helpful was not funny, there were many scenes with people who were just walking in and out of the film. There was also an unnecessary and weird scene that was supposed to be humorous but was really creepy. This was just a horrible movie that had no plot. I don't know what else to say about this movie other than I hate to see it, it was just awful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ Let's face it, bad movies exist. We all watch them and have seen them. The question is whether or not to judge them on their merit. Let's not forget, this movie isn't even in a theater and it's already a disaster. I'm not going to give it a grade, but I will say this: It is truly sad that the director and writer of this movie did not think that they could make a better movie than this one. I mean, how could they think this would be a better film than "Taken"? The dialogue is very bad, the acting is bad, and the plot is a mess. I could watch "Taker" for the sake of the plot alone, but there is no reason to watch this one either. If you don't mind a bad film, then I recommend "Takers" or "Waxing Dark" as better films. If the idea of the "Walking Dead" universe is something that you're interested in, then this might be worth a look. If not, then skip it. I really don't know how a "Waking Dead" spin-off would have worked. I would be happy if the director had taken a look at the source material and not just made his own thing out of it. The ending just doesn't make sense.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  This is a very good film, but I have a problem with it, and it's the reason it failed. The director doesn't do enough research on the character he has created. I think he thought he was doing a very unique kind of film, because he is able to create a very distinct and realistic character with a very different background from anything he has done before. The only problem I have with this film is the ending. It is not a good ending. This film, and the writer of it, could have ended at any time with a great final scene and ending. The ending doesn't come off as good. It feels rushed. And then the next scene doesn't have a real impact on the audience. I wish it ended with a good bang and not with a bad one.  - August 11, 2011The Final Scene

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________________________  The movie has great visuals, especially in the beginning, and the story is well told and well acted. The problem is that it is really just a gimmick and I can not believe the movie makers were making this movie.   The story goes about a couple that is getting married and is having problems because the bride wants to have sex right away, the groom is too busy to give her any attention, and they don't even want to have a baby. The bride says she wants a baby but is too afraid to get pregnant and it would be too embarrassing to have. The groom agrees to give the bride $5000 if she can just be quiet. The only problem is, that she is pregnant and he says she has to have an abortion. The story goes on and the bride refuses to have the abortion, so he makes her do the deed. The guy, as a favor to the bride, gives her the money to pay for the abortion.   for some reason this is really bad. The actress playing the bride is not the right type, she has a very bad body, not to mention the acting.  , and she is the only thing in the movie. The movie is bad because it just is a fake marriage.

There were some bad things about this movie, but nothing that is too bad. If you are a fan of comedies, this movie will be a fun ride. The movie is shot in a 3-D format, so you will be able to see the characters. They all had some very funny lines, but I found it very hard to follow. It is just a comedy. I have to give a big shout out to the director. His name is John Candy, and he is still very funny. He is also a very good dancer. He danced with the girls and was very entertaining. I really enjoyed this movie and it is not too bad at all. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedies.

I didn't know who was in this film, I don�t think there was a script. The actor who plays the kid who was murdered in the movie was a real actor, the kid looked like a real kid, he was about 9 or 10 years old and it's obvious that he didn't have a lot in life. The girl who plays one of the teachers, her name is Heather and she is a very nice and sweet woman, I have no idea what she was thinking. The kids who are supposed to die at the end of the movie, are a girl named Laura and her friend who looks about 9 years old. The reason why they were supposed to kill themselves is that they are so stupid. I don´t know why the people who wrote this movie thought it would be a good idea to have a school shooting. It is supposed to take place in a school, not in the middle of a mall. The last few minutes of the film are so long, I didn´t understand what was going on. It was a little disturbing to me. I couldn't help but to laugh a lot at the stupid characters. I just couldn't stand them. I had to watch this movie to see if they were going to kill the other kids or not. The first part of the story is about the school shooting, the second part is about an escape from the school. The movie was filmed in 2000 so it was very old and dated. I think it would have been much better if it was filmed today. This movie is just bad and I am surprised that it is not banned in most countries. I'm really disappointed that I watched this film and I donít think it was a good movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ (You'll get a chance to see the movie when it's released in theaters)  My first and only time to see a movie like this.  This movie is great. I am a huge fan of John Wick and this movie looks just as great. The cinematography is great, and the action is awesome. I do have one problem, and that is the voice acting. The voice acting is awful, and I am not a fan of it. The main character sounds like a drunk person. The other characters in this movie are all too nice to each other, and you never get the feeling that they all hate each other. You could even feel bad for them. But the one thing that really bothers me is the main villain, John Wick. I have a bad feeling about this guy. He is the only thing I would call bad in this whole movie. The movie is not a great movie, but the story was really good. I just wish it would have been better than it is. .  I would have given this movie a 7/10 if I had not seen it in theaters.

(I don`te think the horror is really scary)  is the movie. The movie is a bit too similar to the original movie (The movie was already made in 1994) . The plot, the characters are not very realistic (I think the characters don`ts have any depth, but this movie is not very good in the story. The characters just do the same thing over and over)  and the way they talk and the dialogue is very simple. (The way they say stuff is very bad and the character are just repeating the same things over and again) , and the movie is very predictable and the plot makes no sense. (If you like a movie like "Twins" you don´t have any reason to watch this movie)  to make it even worse, it is a terrible movie. You know why it is bad?  1. It is just made for the fans of horror movies. . It really is just to make money. The actors, the director and the writer don`'t give any effort to make a good movie. They just made a terrible (but very cheap) movie. I really don`nt know why they made this movie.  the movie has a really bad and cheap story. I really dont know why people like this movie, because this movie isn`t worth watching.  it is so bad that you can`t even remember the name of the movie because it is very stupid. - I think this movie would be much better if it had not been made in the 80s. (in the 80's the budget was much higher. And with the time when the film was made, the story was really not very well thought out)

"I've been bullied by boys since I was a child, and I've also been a victim of sexual harassment," she begins in the video, which was posted on Monday. "I'm not good at dealing with this, so I've decided to teach boys a lesson."  She then begins to run, while shouting, "I have to run away from all this. I will not tolerate it anymore. This is not a game. This has nothing to do with school." . , she then proceeds to run through the streets, wearing nothing but black. "This is not an excuse to go on a sexual rampage," she continues, before continuing to run for several minutes. She ends up in a park, where she proceeds to sit down and rest, before starting to yell.    "Don't come here anymore. I can't do this anymore. You have to leave me alone. Stop doing this to me," she says in the final seconds of the video. "No more. Stop it."  I can still hear the sound of her running shoes hitting the ground as she continues to shout, "Stop it." I can also see her running shoe in the background.  I'm sure there are a lot of parents and teachers out there who were deeply affected by this. It was so disturbing to see a schoolgirl who was only 14 years old, who didn't even have much to her name, doing this. This video was shocking. She's 14 years of age, and she's screaming and running, in what seems like a desperate attempt to get her attacker to leave her alone. She doesn't even care that the people in the park were watching her, because she's still angry about being treated like a sex toy. She even continues to run in the rain, despite being wet. She is still not doing anything to defend herself, and even seems to be mocking the people who were there. She keeps saying, "Don't touch me, don't touch my body, don

The movie should have been a great action movie with all the hype and suspense. Instead, this film was a big waste of money and a major let down. The acting in this film is horrendous and this movie really shows. The only character who is likable in this movie is the girl who is being abused by the evil police officer. She has no personality and was played by a man. She was also a victim and was abused by her boyfriend for 3 months. The bad guy played by the same guy who played the main character was not very believable and the whole movie was like watching a porno.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is so hard to make an awful movie good.  The movie is like a roller coaster: every time you get a good view of a different part, it changes the entire ride.   It is hard to get a ride because of the fact that it is so much fun!  But I would recommend this movie to everyone who is not afraid of a little horror movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  This is a good movie with a bad story, and a bad ending. The story is a story about a young woman who was raped and killed by a man. The girl's brother was not there to see this. The brother found out the truth, and after a long struggle he killed the rapist. The man got away, and now he is on the run. The young woman was the only witness to this event, and she has to solve this case. But when the police comes, they want the man, so they set a trap for him, and kill him. The plot was interesting, but the movie was so boring that I didn't enjoy it. I can't remember much about it, because it was boring.   It is a remake of a horror movie called "The Devil's Blood", a movie made in the late 50's, and made in a very low budget. The movie was a hit and made a lot of money for the movie makers. The film was good, and the ending was very good, but this movie was not as good as the remake. This movie was made for a very small budget, and it is a bit more boring than the remake of "The Devils Blood", and it shows that.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________  A movie that has a lot of potential. If the film had been better written and edited, it could have been great. I don't care how much time and money was put into the film. This movie has no substance, and there is nothing interesting about it. I really wish I could give this a 1 star rating, but there is no way that could be done. The story is so contrived and illogical that it is laughable. The characters are like walking stereotypes, the whole story is completely unbelievable. The plot is a complete joke. The ending is so stupid, I don´t know how they came up with it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   1) "A lot of people would love to be a superhero. You're not one of them. You've got a normal, everyday life."   2) "Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I have a lot of friends. I'll get over this soon."   for anyone who doesn't know, this is the one and only movie starring Jennifer Aniston that has a good, positive review, it's very bad. She has a crush on a guy who she thinks is super strong and is a superhero, so she takes it upon herself to become him. She is super confident and has superpowers that makes her super strong, she fights monsters, and she has super powers and she is super cool, she does not seem to have any flaws.   What is wrong with this movie? First of all, this movie is just plain bad. There's nothing good about it. I saw this and I thought to myself, what the hell? I don't think I've seen a worse movie than this. There is no story, there is no plot, and there is not a single good person in this movie. There are a lot that think this is a good movie. The problem with this is that if you want to watch a movie, why not watch a good one? This is just not a good story, a good plot, or a good character.   (more)  (review of free movie) Show less
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I just saw a new movie called "Jurassic Park". It was bad.   I saw this movie at the movie theater because my parents insisted I go. My dad told me it was a great movie. I had seen the movie before, and it was better, so I went with them. It was a horrible movie. My wife, my parents, and I were all watching this movie and my parents and I started laughing so hard that my mother and I fell down. The movie just got worse and worse. I remember being in the car with my parents in the parking lot, and my mom started crying because she was so sad and angry at what was happening. The only reason I watched it was because my dad told us he loved the movie, so we watched it together. We all went to bed. The next day, I remember getting up and watching the movie again and it just got even worse. My mom and I went into the living room and started crying again. I was very angry. My parents and my dad kept telling me it would get better and it would end. It ended at that point.  -Chris

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ (Add me on Facebook)  A movie that made me cry. I was so scared for my life. I know this is a horror movie, but my heart felt so sorry for her. I didn't want to see it. The movie is very scary. I hope the director gets a bad review.  My mom saw this movie on TV. She loved it. She was in tears. My mom was always a very religious person. She said it was one of the worst movies she has ever seen.  and here is the kicker. My father is a devout Catholic. I have told my father that if he ever saw this, he should not watch it, and he should leave it alone.  to me this movie is evil. I feel sorry for the girl who was supposed to be dead. I don't know why the girl was there at all. I really don't. . I'm so sad that my mother watched this. I told her about it before it was out and she said that she was watching the movie for the first time and that she cried when she saw the ending. She also said that it wasn't scary but that it was really sad. She told me to not watch horror movies and to not read horror books, but that I should watch a movie like this. So my father watched it with me. He said that the girl in the movie was very pretty. I said that is nice of her, but I don;t know what kind of movie this is. , and my father said that this movie was about a girl who has been taken away from her family and has to try to survive in the woods. This is a good movie. I like it. So when I saw this I was scared. My heart felt sorry for that girl. I watched the movie over and over again. I would have cried if I had not seen it in the theater. It was really hard for me to watch. I cried a lot. I felt really sorry for this girl.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ This movie is so bad it hurts, and it makes me want to puke. First of all, it is not even a horror movie. The "horror" genre has been watered down in recent years, and the genre in general has gotten too easy, too predictable. This movie doesn't even have the courage to be scary. It just plays like a cheesy comedy. There is a lot of blatant comedy here. You have the cops, the girl, and her father. There are a lot more scenes that are just one-liners that you would see in a shitty sitcom. The father constantly jokes about how she is the most beautiful girl he has ever seen. Then you have the police who are laughing at her and laughing about how the guy who raped her (or killed her) was in a wheelchair. There was even a scene where she went to the hospital, and a police officer told her that the guy was in the wheelchair. Then he told her the other guy who was in jail for doing the same thing. There were no words at all. I think this movie should be called "I'm a virgin, and my dad is the funniest man in the world. I'm so lucky." And the worst part is that it is all just made up. The film is about the daughter of a famous movie star, and when the mother dies, she goes to a house in the woods to recover. Then, she meets a guy named Robert (played by Kevin Spacey), who is in a car accident that kills his girlfriend. He says he wants to be a writer and then he meets her daughter. Then they get married, and then the daughter leaves, because she is in love with Robert. So the movie is basically a sequel to a movie with the same name. I don't know if this movie is supposed to be about the rape or the murder, or if it was made for a stupid cheap laugh. It's the only movie I will ever watch that was made in this genre. It was a terrible experience, and I hope the movie studio doesn't have any money because I don,t know how much they spent on this. It has all the elements of a cheap horror film. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________   *Movie of the Month: THE FIFTH DIMENSION* (1982) *Movie of The Week: THE TOWN OF TULSA (1984) *TV Movie: THE ODD COUPLE (

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Worst Movie  (2001)  by John Turturro - I don't think it's fair to criticize Turturistic for this movie. Turturoro plays a guy in a weird version of a cowboy western, and it is a fun movie to watch. It's not really a good movie, but a fun one. I think it could have been a hit. It has an interesting storyline, and some of the best songs I've heard in a movie. This is a movie I'd watch again, and again, but I think I'll avoid it for now. The worst movie, though, is that it is so long. This movie is not only a boring movie, it is also boring to watch! I'm sure Turturbro thought this movie would be an instant classic, but it is not. The best part of this movie is the characters and the songs. I guess this movie was not made for the people. This has no originality at all. The actors are just the same people in different roles. I was not entertained by this movie at all, but there are still some great songs.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** *********** The movie: It's a classic that is loved by a lot of people. The story revolves around a group of people who take a journey to see the great movie "Citizen Kane" to celebrate its 30th anniversary. However, their journey is more about finding out who they are and who they were. The group finds out that there are a lot more people than what they thought, and it's all a part of a conspiracy against the whole of mankind. The movie starts with a very dark and intense opening scene. The film shows us a group meeting where the group of friends are discussing about who they think is the killer. This is where we start to see that the plot is about the group trying to get back at the people who killed their friends. After this scene, the movie goes in a more lighthearted manner and then begins to tell a story that is about love. The first person we see is a girl named Kiki. The next is a woman named Gertrude. She is trying to tell us that she is happy and happy with her life. She doesn't care who she falls in love with. Then we meet the main characters who are named Jake and Paul. They are two friends that are trying to find the killer and are trying not to fall in love. Then it all comes to a head. The killer appears and is shown to be the daughter of a man named Goro. The father of the killer was a war veteran who was very angry with Goro and his actions. The son of the war veteran was also a war hero. So, Jake and Gertude try to figure out what's going on. The girl who was talking was Gertro and the one who was trying to kill Goro was his son. Then the movie starts to show the two main characters in a very romantic way. We get to see them in their love life and see them try to find love. This movie has a lot going on, and a lot is going to happen to the characters. The characters in this movie are not your average. They have a lot to say and do. There are a few moments that are very good and some moments that aren't. I have to say that the characters in the movie were interesting and very well written. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies that show how people try to solve a mystery. It has a great ending and I thought it was very well done. There

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  The movie was terrible. It was bad because it was a complete disaster. I mean, even the director was embarrassed and embarrassed. The actors were too. It has no sense of the setting, no sense whatsoever. The movie takes place in the year 2127. The time frame is a little bit off. The events of the movie take place about 20 years later. We are shown a very short period of time during which a war is going on. The war is between the United Nations and the "evil" (what is the difference?) of the alien race. We also see that this alien race is very technologically advanced. The U.N. has built a "city" which is in a very primitive state. In a very advanced state they have built an alien spaceship and we are shown an alien race in this spaceship. The first alien in this movie is played by one of the great movie stars of all time, George Segal. He plays a U.S. marine named Frank West. He is played so well that I almost thought I was watching the same character in two different movies. He and his fellow marines are sent on a mission to destroy a very powerful alien spacecraft. Frank West is assigned to lead the assault force, led by a woman named Elizabeth. Frank is in command and Elizabeth is the communications officer. Elizabeth is very cold, very cold. She hates Frank. She is a very cold person. Her name is Elizabeth Shaw. She was the second officer. Frank has been in combat a lot. He has been a combatant in the Gulf War. Frank and his men are sent out to find a mysterious alien ship. Frank gets the information from his sergeant, John, who tells him that the alien ship is headed toward a town called "Mantel". Frank is not sure if it's going to be a city or a small town. Frank thinks that they are going to find the ship and then destroy it. But Elizabeth tells Frank that the ship has a "mind". Frank thinks this is a bad thing. The mind of the ship is trying to destroy the people of Mantel. Frank tries to figure out what to do about this. He thinks about his father and how he used to go on long treks to find treasure. He also thinks about the other people in the marines. Frank wants to find out if they are as good as his dad. He tries to talk to them about this but none of them know what to
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   When a young man finds a strange journal in his grandfather's attic, he discovers a diary that reveals that his grandfather had committed suicide by throwing himself from the top of a tall building. He had been a successful architect in his lifetime, but his career was over because he refused to work on the World Trade Center. His father had died and his mother remarried a man who had an affair with his daughter. In the book, this man is a character called "the Architect". The Architect tells the story of how he lost his family in a mysterious accident. He also explains that his father was a member of the secret society known as The Order of the Golden Dawn. This is the first of the books that will be found in the series.   The novel follows the life of the Architect, and how he came to be in the attic. As a child, he lived with his mother and her family in their home in New Jersey. His mother's brother worked for the architect, and his family always had a connection to the building. One day, when the Architect was very young, his mother was driving to her job and was almost run off the road by a bus. The bus was heading towards her house. The mother and son both survived. It was never determined whether she was killed in the accident or survived. She took him to a doctor who told him that he would be blind if he got an eye injury. The Architect began writing about the accident.   (This book has been called the first "novel" about the events of 9/11.)   "The Architect" was the first book in a series. It follows the Architect as he gets older and his life continues. The architect has a very difficult relationship with his father and with his own wife. The book is very graphic and contains a lot of sex and violence. However, there are many other characters that you will learn about in this book. You will also meet a lot more people that have survived the 9/10 attack.   in this novel, the book is about how the architect has learned how to survive. The first part of the book tells about his mother. She was a very kind woman and a very good mother to her son. She always took care of him. The story is about her and her life after the 9-11 attacks.   is about the death of her husband. The father of the architect was a man that the architect's father knew. The

The characters are all the same, but the plot is completely different. It was really a letdown. It's a shame, because there is something interesting about this movie. The writing is really bad. The acting is bad. There's no suspense. The plot doesn't make sense. The ending was really strange. The cinematography was just bad. It didn't really do anything new.

[SPOILERS AHEAD] (See how this one turns out?) I love the ending to this movie. It's a wonderful, moving and surprising finale. The movie itself was quite bad. It had a lot of flaws, including a bad story, the wrong casting, the bad acting, and some bad CGI. However, I felt it was very good that the final scenes were great. It was a bit hard to watch this movie when you're first seeing it, but it really does make you think and make you feel the ending. This movie is a great finale for a trilogy. I highly recommend watching this movie, even if you've seen all three movies. The ending is really a great ending, but not the best movie in the trilogy. (See the next entry for my thoughts on the movie.)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went to see this movie because I am a huge fan of the original series and wanted to see a sequel. It was the worst movie in the series, and I can say that without reservation.  The original series is the greatest anime ever created.  "You are the only person who can save me" - The movie opens with a character named Riki, who is an alien.   He's supposed to be a robot created by a mad scientist named Rui, but he's really a human with a little too much love for humanity.  He is a master of disguise, and when he meets a young boy named Yuuko, he is able to steal her body and become her husband.  They have a child together named Masaki, who lives a peaceful life until his father decides to stop working on his robot.  Masaki is also a robot, and this puts him in danger when his father finds out.  Riki then uses his disguise skills to try and save Masaki's life.  It is a fairly short movie, but it is so forgettable that it doesn't feel worth watching.  The only thing that I remember is the opening scene of the film, where Masaki wakes up in the middle of the night to find that he has a giant robot in his bed.  I wish they would've had the decency to do a sequel, because the original was amazing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why did I like this movie so much: ___________________________________________ I'm always intrigued by people who go on a journey to become a better person. I mean, it sounds so simple, and yet so many people fail to see the opportunity in life. They live their lives in fear, because they believe life is a struggle. They try to do everything right, and they are still miserable and dissatisfied with their lives. I'm not one of those people. I want to live a life that is full of purpose and joy. I love the people I meet, and I am inspired by their good intentions. I was raised Catholic, but in the last few years I have started to become an agnostic atheist. I don't believe in a higher power, I don;t believe in heaven or hell, and my goal is to simply live a good life, to have fun, and to make a positive impact on the world. I have become so much more peaceful, so much happier, and so much better at life. I had never thought I would be so happy and content, but I am! I wish I could live like this for the rest of my life. But I don' t have that luxury. I still live paycheck to paycheck. I need to work as a cook, but even that is tough. I work full time to support my wife and two daughters. I am now living off of savings and a part time job, which I'm very grateful for. I really can't say enough good things about this movie. I would encourage anyone who is interested in a spiritual journey to see this movie and follow it through. You will not regret it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________  A great movie. However, the main characters were completely ridiculous. The movie was about a guy named Bob who is on a date with his new love, a girl named Susan. They are having a great time together, but Bob starts having flashbacks of the times they have been together in the past. One of the flashbacks shows Bob getting an unwanted sexual encounter with a woman that was in a bad mood. The woman is named Susan, and Susan tells Bob that she doesn't like him. Bob says, "You've always had a nasty temper. What's going on?" Susan says,  "I don't know."  The movie then cuts to a scene in a club, where Susan is dancing with another man. She notices Bob, who is sitting behind her. The guy that she is dancing for sees Bob and tells Susan that Bob was there and that he didn't look very good. Susan goes over to Bob and says, ____________________________________________  You were the first guy I dated. You were so hot, so flirtatious, so friendly. You always had something new to say. You weren't afraid to show it. You seemed like a really nice guy. I think you should see the movie. It'll make you feel better." Susan leaves the club, and Bob is very upset. The next day, Susan comes back to Bob's place to talk. He asks Susan to dance with him. The guys are waiting for them, and the guy that Bob and Susan were dancing with is waiting for Susan too. They both go over to them and the guys start to make out with them. Bob is upset because the guy was flirting with his wife. The boyfriend, a guy with an ugly face, says to Susan, _______________________________  Now that you're my wife, I'm going to make sure that you don't fuck up any more times.  Bob says to him, ___________________  If you keep doing this I'm gonna make you regret it.

I really enjoyed the first movie, but this movie is nothing like the first one.  This movie is about a girl named Rika, and she is a Japanese high school student.    She's a typical teenager, but it was cute to see her do some karate.  When she was little, her family left Japan and she went to live with her aunt in the United States.  She does karate and other martial arts, and has a secret crush on her neighbor, Tsubaki.  Then she is told that she has cancer and is in treatment.  But it seems like she is going to die, so she decides to return to Japan to die.  Rika is about to give up when she meets a mysterious guy named Natsu.  He is a ninja who is trying to protect Rika from the cancer.  The first movie shows the relationship between Rika and Natsu and how they become good friends.  They go on a road trip, and Rika decides to stop by a small town.  At this small town, Rika meets a little boy named Hijiri.  In the movie the movie shows that Rika was an only child, but in the sequel, Rinka is older.  It seems that the original movie was shot in a different time period, and it looks more like a Japanese anime, which was probably why they made this sequel. The story is really terrible, and I think that the writer thought that a movie about a karate fighter would be fun, and they actually succeeded.  I really hate the movie because it was too long and they tried to make it a comedy.  And it wasn't.  Because this movie has a plot, it doesn't need to be a comedy, and the writers really didn't think of that.  If you want to see a kung fu movie, look to a movie like The Raid or a film like Drunken Master.  Unfortunately, this movie doesn't have any of that, and is just an unoriginal movie.  A karate movie is one of the best things in the world, but they really messed up with this movie, and made it so ridiculous.  For one, Risha is the only girl in the movie. She doesn't even have any friends
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________   First, the film's tagline: "It's a dark and dangerous world, where no one is innocent". I've been there. I was at a party one time where I was the only girl and was trying to be nice to everyone, and it was really hard because there was a guy who was so mean to everyone. He was a real douchebag. I ended up leaving and I really wish I would have stayed because he was just too mean and stupid. But at least that night I got a good laugh. I guess that's a good tagline for a movie.   What really makes this movie interesting is that there is a very good amount of action in it. The best part of this movie was the action scenes. I really liked the fight scenes. There was a fight between a guy and a girl. It was pretty intense. The girl was a really cool character and she looked like a pretty cool movie star. The movie did a good job of making it look like she was pretty cool. The other girl in this movie, her name is Rose, she was a cool character. The only problem with her is that she was just a girl with a bad attitude and was really mean to people.   I don't like the movie at all. I don´t like the characters, I donít like Rose. I didn't like that this movie had too much violence. I know it's a comedy, but I don`t like when it turns violent. And this movie doesn't do a good enough job of showing the action. It's like a lot of people were just told to fight and then the camera goes to a random part and there is no fighting. I also really don't understand why the movie was titled: "The Masked Men". It was about this group of people that did nothing but cause trouble. I mean they were thugs, they were murderers, and they were criminals. And yet the movie had nothing to do with that at all and had nothing in it for the characters in this story.   in the end I really didn't care about the movie. It wasn't bad, but it was not good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a piece of crap.  It was just a waste of money, time and energy to make a movie where the main character is a little girl and the plot revolves around a man with no personality.    I never wanted to see this movie, and after the first 10 minutes I couldn't take another second.   If you are a child like I was when I saw this movie I am sorry for you.    This movie was awful, and if you are interested in having a good time and laughing at your friends then I can't recommend this movie enough.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________   The movie starts with a bunch of guys who are in a boat. One of the guys is a lawyer who has to prove that he's really a man by having sex with a girl who is not a man. After having sex he thinks that he should have done it more than one time but he's afraid to do it again.  Next he decides to take his boat to a lake where the guy he was with (who is now a lawyer) is having sex. Then the lawyer's girlfriend walks in on him and says that it was too much sex and she was tired. Then she leaves. : ___________________________  I hate this movie. It's not even funny. The main character is the most boring character ever. He doesn't have any real emotion and the only thing he talks about is sex. The only thing I can compare this movie to is the movie "Fury".  It's really sad that this movie is being made in America. This movie is like a sad little boy trying to be a man and he has no life of his own. I don't want to see this movie again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went to this movie for a date night with my girlfriend and her friends. I was a little apprehensive as I don't usually go to the movies alone. My friend and I were able to find a good spot and watched the movie. My girlfriend and I agreed that this was a really cool movie, but we were in the theater for 2 hours and it took us over 3 hours to get to the end. It was really boring, and the last scene was really cheesy. I don`t want to give the movie a bad review, but it was way too long for a movie. The only good thing about this movie was the fact that it had a good ending. If you want to see a good action movie, go to 'Terminator 2', 'Terminators', or 'Termination'. This movie is definitely not worth your time.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Dbarker13 from Poor plot and acting. This movie has nothing to do with the film series that is "Terminator". It is not a "Termination" movie but a prequel, so the story is more about a character who is trapped on a war-torn world, then is rescued by the character played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The action scenes are not great. There are too many shots of the actors and vehicles that don't look like they are shooting. The main character is not the hero that he seems to be. He does not have a great story. There is nothing that he does that he is proud of. He is just a person in a tough situation. There was no character development for him. His only motivation is to get off the planet. The movie was rushed. The last scene that Arnold Schwarzenegger does in the movie was very lame and was a joke to watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________  1. _____________  2. _______  3. _____ : _____: ____: ________________:  This is the first bad movie that I have seen that had me so frustrated. I mean, how do you make a movie like this, that is supposed to be funny? And it's not just the acting that's bad, it's the plot. The whole plot, I mean the movie is full of jokes and they are not all funny, not even close. The main thing I dislike is that it's so unrealistic. We have this guy named "Fritz", who is a retired police officer, who has this old car that he gets to drive, and he is really good at it. He gets to travel everywhere and he always makes sure to stop to buy groceries, and other little things, but he is always out in the woods and he never has any problems with anybody. He has a very good friend, who is his partner. He goes on his adventures and gets a new girlfriend, but she is always on the other side of the road. He and his partner always meet with their old partner and he doesn't understand why he keeps meeting up with her. He meets a guy named Steve, who owns a business, and they have to take a case to court. When they meet the other guys, he realizes that they're really good, but Steve is a bad guy, and so are the other guy's wives. So they must get out of the country and find a woman who will be willing to marry them. Steve takes Fritz on a journey, and Fritz meets a bunch of people, and when they're all together, he really understands Steve and how he is. And then they have this great time. The movie never gets very far and it never explains why it's important to find this woman, or why they are so good together. It is just an excuse to travel and meet new people. It never makes sense, and the writing is so terrible. I wish that the movie had been a movie called, "Frog-Man and the Other Guys", or something, that would have made a lot more sense.  I would have given this movie 4.5 stars if I could have seen it again. It would have been funny, but it would have at least made sense. It was just a terrible idea, and I hope that you don't waste your time watching it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What a terrible movie! I mean, it's just a story of a man who gets a job as a gardener. And, well, it takes a few hours for him to get used to the work. He gets bored and tries to escape, but he can't, because there is this little girl with him who doesn't understand what's going on. And so, she does some very bad things. But this girl will not stop, because she needs to go home. She needs to get to her family. The girl is very good. The movie, however, has so many mistakes that it makes you laugh and cry. But, you also feel sorry for this poor boy. And then, he finds a key, and he goes to go save his girlfriend, but, he doesn't know that he has a very bad destiny. And the girl is a big witch, and she makes a curse on the boy, that, he'll never see his family again. So, the boy has a great plan. But the key is too heavy to carry. So he goes home. And that's how the movie ends. And he doesn' t find his family. That's it. It doesn't give a good ending. It just gives a very, very bad ending. But it has some good moments. It has some moments of magic and romance. And it has good characters, like the gardener and the witch. But I just think that this movie is not worth the time. And I feel sad about it, because it has a nice plot. It's not really a bad story, but it's not a very good story. And this movie doesn't even have the ending that a good movie should have. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. It is just very bad. It takes a lot of time to see this movie. It really doesn't have any plot. And you have to see it in the theater. But that's not the only bad thing about this movie: I think the casting was terrible. I mean there were a lot who were in this movie, but the actors were terrible. The most famous actor is in the movie, and the most famous actress was in this film. I thought that these actors were very good, but they were not really the best. They were not very good actors. I think that they did not have any chemistry with each other. I also think that the film was very confusing. I just don't

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie is a disaster. It is not a good movie at all. I have never seen a movie that is so awful. The plot is very bad. The acting is bad. And the plot is so ridiculous. The best part of this movie is the ending. I never saw the ending of this film so I was very confused when the ending came up. I was in disbelief when the movie ends. The ending is so silly. It makes me sick to my stomach. The movie starts off with a bad car crash. There is a girl in a car who is unconscious. The girl is called Cindy who has a brother who is the driver of the car. When the accident happens, Cindy has a seizure. She is put in the hospital and the brother is taken to the hospital. He is called James. Cindy wakes up in the accident and she tells her brother about the car accident. James goes to the accident site and finds the car and the girl who is in the car in a pool of blood. When he finds her, she says that her brother is in a coma. James has a plan to find the girl and the car but he has to go through some obstacles. After he finds the girl, he has no idea where the car is. He finds a girl named Lisa who is driving the car with the boy in the coma. He tells her about the accident. She has no clue about it. James finds her car and they have a car chase. James drives Lisa's car and when he sees her brother, he shoots her in the head and then they both crash into the car of a truck driver named Roy. The truck driver and Lisa are both killed. James is now the only person who can get the car to the girl. James tells Lisa that her parents are on their way to the house to see her and the only way they can get there is to take the truck. James says he will go with her to the truck and he will make a deal with the driver. He gives the driver a big amount of money and the truck driver will take the car if the girl comes with him to the place he tells her to. Lisa agrees and they go with James. The only problem is that they drive too fast and the driver loses control of the truck with Lisa in the back. They crash into a tree and then James shoots the driver in the face with a gun and they both get out of the wreck. The boy is found in the wreckage and

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________  "It's a very interesting film because it's about a couple of people who go to a movie theater for a big night out, and there's something really wrong with their lives, but then the film explores why they are there, and what they're really doing there. It's really well done. It doesn't give away too much. It just goes on for about four hours. The cinematography is really beautiful. It really gets you to think."  - David A. Simmons, The Hollywood Reporter  A comedy about a husband and wife who are out to avenge the death of a woman they once loved, and whose own son has abandoned them. They are joined by a few friends who are also in the midst of a tragic loss. They arrive at the theater to find that the movie is a total flop, but they are determined to watch it anyway. They soon find themselves in the middle of a battle for the life of a young man, who is being forced to kill an old man to save his own life. The friends and their friends soon join in on the fray. It all builds to an explosive conclusion that forces the characters to come together as a team to make a difference.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "In the dark depths of space, a massive black hole is devouring a star."  It's a good thing the actors are so good because it's a terrible film.   The only redeeming factor is that this movie isn't terrible because it has terrible dialogue, bad acting, and bad writing. The movie is bad because it tries to tell a very stupid story. It starts off as a sci-fi adventure but quickly becomes a comedy. It's all about a guy who is a member of the Federation (i.e. Space Patrol) who must go into a huge black hole in space to find a missing spaceship. He gets stuck in a black hole for 90 minutes. There are no plot devices in the film. Nothing happens. The characters are never given much background, and none of them are really interesting. There's a whole lot of talk about the fact that this guy is the first guy ever to enter a black halo. It sounds very exciting but doesn't have much of an impact on the film as a whole. The only thing that keeps it from being awful is that the plot doesn't actually get that boring. After 90 minutes, we realize that it's going to be a comedy and not a serious science fiction film. The actors are good but it's just not a good movie.   of course there's a huge amount of sex in this film, and a LOT of nudity. The reason it's so bad is because of the terrible acting. It just seems like it was written by people who have never had to act. It seems like they didn't even know what a good acting scene was. The dialogue is bad. The voice acting is bad, and the acting in general is bad (even the acting of the women who play the females). This film has no suspense, no tension, no suspenseful moments. The entire film is boring. It doesn't even try to be suspenseful. It makes absolutely no sense. And the writing is just awful. The plot doesn the same thing over and over and again. It never changes. There isn't a single character who has a real personality. There is no character who is interesting or interesting to the viewer. The writing is bad enough to warrant a 1 star rating. I gave it a 2.5 because I'm a sucker for sci- fi. I've watched a lot of bad movies, but this one is just terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________  "I know that the word 'cannonball' is a negative, but this is no cannonball. This is a slow-moving movie, and it is very confusing. It is very hard to figure out what is happening at times. The story is so poorly written that I did not even know what was happening until halfway through the movie. I feel bad for the movie because it is a total waste of time. A good movie can change a person's life. This movie is not worth the time. It will not change my life, but it will make me wish that there was a movie with a different ending."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. So, if you've seen this movie, you know the story, you've heard about the main characters, you're pretty much a fan of it, and it's probably the first movie that really interested me in the world of video games, since it was the first time I played a game in which I was playing as a non-player character. I was in love.I was in awe. I thought the game had some really creative ideas and concepts. I loved the way the world was developed. I wanted to know more about the characters. I really wanted to get involved in the game. The movie is an excellent movie that's fun to watch. The characters are very well done, and the movie is a lot of fun. If you're a fan, and you want to see how the world works, or you want an introduction to video games and gaming, this movie is the perfect movie for you. It's funny, and fast paced, and entertaining. And most of all, it's just a lot fun to see a video game come alive.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ A group of young people on a camping trip are on a hike through the woods when a bear jumps out of the woods and attacks one of them. The bear continues to chase them as they hike. They keep trying to run from the bear and eventually they get to a road. They go off the road and into a cornfield. They look at each other, then back at the bear. Then they realize they are in a small clearing. The girl that was attacked by the bear is crying, holding her stomach. Then the guy says, "Oh no. It's the bear again!" The girl says "No. It just went into the woods. You should have seen how it chased us. It was like it was running at us from all sides." The girl and the guy go back to camp. The next day they look at the campsite. There is a bear claw mark on the ground. The bears have also scratched some other places on the campsites. There are no footprints on the snow. A week later the guy comes back to the camps site and finds the bear claw marks. He then notices something else. The girls have started to look for footprints again. They are finding some on the edge of the cornfield where they found the bear tracks. The guy goes to the girl and says "Did you see anything? There is something that looks like a bear in the corn field. I know it looks like something that is about to attack us. But you can't be sure." He then goes to his truck and starts to drive away. Then he gets a phone call. The caller says "This is my neighbor. He saw the bear come out of nowhere. The animal was about ten feet from us. I think it may be the same bear that attacked you." The neighbor says "I will be right over. I don't know what you are talking about. I am sure that I saw the same animal that attacked the girls." The guy gets in the truck and drives off. The neighbor is now very concerned about the bear in his neighbor's cornfield and starts calling the authorities. He calls the local sheriff's office. He says " I have a bad feeling about this. I hope that this is not a bear that has been loose in the woods for a few years. The only thing I can think of is that it is the same person that attacked both girls. If that is the case, the sheriff's department should be contacted." The sheriff
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie is so bad. The director of this film is a professional at this kind of stuff and yet, he can't make it right. I'm not saying that the acting was bad, because it was. But, I'm saying that this movie was filmed and the actors were good. But the story was so bad, that I felt bad for the actors. When I see this movie again, I hope they won't use the same actors. This movie was so awful, that you don't want to watch it. But you should try to see it at least once. I would recommend this to people who are looking for a good bad movie. You should watch this movie, if you are a fan of bad movies, because this movie has all the bad characters you can think of.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________ The "The Devil's Advocate" (2005) is a movie about a man who has to represent a man wrongly accused in a murder case. The movie has been reviewed as one of the worst films of 2005, and for good reason. There is not a single good part about this movie. The acting is terrible, the story is not interesting and the story itself is unbelievable. This movie is not even about a crime. This is not about a murder. This a movie with no plot. It is about a person that had to represent the man that had killed someone and was wrongfully accused. The person that has to be represented by this man is not the actual person that killed the person. This person had to be a witness. This man has no money and no lawyers to represent him. The director has no idea what he is doing. He was not prepared for the movie he was making. This guy who has never acted before or in any other movie ever tried to portray the character of a man that was wrongly accused of a crime he did not commit. The only reason that this man got a movie to represent someone who has killed someone was because he had a lot of money to spend on this. The man that has a lot money to waste on this movie is a person who is rich and has no friends to represent for him. I thought this was a movie that was made for one thing, but it was anything but that. The ending of the movie is so ridiculous. It was like it was written by someone that was drunk on cocaine and had nothing else to do. The actor that plays this man was an idiot and the script is written by a guy who does not know what he was doing. It took me 2 minutes to realize that the story was not a story. This was a dumb movie that had no plot and no good acting. I have never seen a movie where I wanted to punch the person who was trying to represent this person. The guy is trying to prove his innocence, and he is trying so hard. But he is not getting any help from this woman. She is the only person in the movie that is trying her best. This woman does not care about anything other than how much money this guy has to spend to try and win this case. She has no other interest than getting this man out of jail. She does not give a fuck about the story of the person that she is representing. This whole movie is about how she can get

I didn't like it and wasn't interested in watching it again.  But my wife said she really liked it. I guess I don't like everything about it but the plot was good. There was a big difference in how the men and women acted and looked. I don;t know why that happened. I never understood that. I always saw it as a good movie and a great role for Paul Newman.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!! The worst movie I've seen in a long time. This film is awful and it's the worst acting of the year! Not only is it the worst movie of 2016 but the worst film of this year!!!! This movie is a terrible movie with terrible acting. The acting is horrible and this movie is an absolute nightmare to watch. The story is a complete disaster. We get the typical zombie movie with a few twists but this movie has a terrible ending. It starts out okay but then all of a sudden it gets horrible and then it goes into a horrible nightmare. The actors have no talent and the acting is very poor. The only good thing is the special effects are very good and some of the effects are awesome. The special effects were good enough to make me smile. This movie had no direction. The film started off okay but when it goes downhill it's really bad. This has nothing to do with the acting or the plot. The movie is just horrible and is only worth watching if you want to see the worst zombie movie of the 21st century. I hope you get sick of watching this movie. I wish I had never seen this movie and I don't think I will ever watch a zombie movie again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I think that this is a very bad movie and it really sucks! The story is just not interesting at all. You don't get any kind of sense about the characters. The plot is really bad and it just takes a long time to get there. It starts with the bad guy stealing some money from a rich man and now he wants to marry his daughter. Then the good guy has to stop him. I have never seen a movie that I don't like and I have seen many terrible movies but this is one of the worst movies I have even seen. It is really boring and slow and it is a bad thing because you don't care about anything that is going on in this movie. There is no action at all and there are very few action scenes. The characters are very boring and there is no sense of any kind about the movie. The movie is about a really boring guy that wants to kill a princess and she is a princess who is also very boring. The ending was very bad because it was very stupid and I don`t think that they could have done any better than this movie even if they had made a better movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________"This is a really good movie that has a great script. I have not seen the movie in a long time and it is really good to see that it still holds up today. I really enjoy the movie and the story is very original. The actors are great. The movie is very different than the other westerns of the late 1960's and early 1970's and this movie is not that. This movie is a very realistic western and it will keep you wanting to see more of the characters. It has a real feel to it and it really shows that the westerns can be very different and not just a one dimensional story. The music is excellent. It reminds me of the classic westerns and the film is very entertaining. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes westerns."

He shot only the second half, the last part being the most boring and annoying. It's a shame. It really should have ended with the credits but they kept playing it and the movie was about a week late.!!!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ I'm sorry but __________ is a horrible movie. The acting was terrible. The story line was terrible (why did you even think to make it into a movie?). The cinematography was horrible. The editing was terrible and there was NO emotion in the movie. _____________ should never be remade, period. If you love ________, you should just watch a real movie and not a terrible remake. Also, ________ is an incredibly depressing movie. There's a scene where a man is driving down the highway and the road is completely covered in snow. He turns around to look at the sky and sees an enormous black cloud over the sun. The scene is absolutely terrifying and has me feeling that the man is going to die in that moment. ____________________________________________  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: darren_baker
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you don't like a movie because it's a bad film, then you don' t like a good film because it was a bad one.  It was a film that had nothing but problems, and was a terrible film to begin with.    If you're not a fan of the movie:     You should not watch this movie.  If you're a fan, then this is a great movie and a movie that deserves a good review.  It's an incredibly enjoyable movie that has some interesting moments.  This movie has some very entertaining scenes and there are some really cool and interesting scenes that are really well done.  The story is good, and the character development is great.  There are also some very cool and awesome scenes that really makes this movie stand out from the crowd.  I would recommend this movie for everyone who loves science fiction, and also for everyone that likes to watch movies with a little humor in them.

I had just seen "The Good German" and "The Best Years of Our Lives" and wanted to see the other two in a theatre. I had already seen "Gone With the Wind" and thought I'd like this one. I was in my thirties when I saw it and I think I got what I wanted. The other two were not for me. Sally Field as Mrs. Jones, in a movie which she played in a very well-made production of "Gladys."  "I think this is the best film I have seen since "The Greatest Story Ever Told." It is also the only one which has left a deep impression on me."  I was also impressed by the acting by Mary Pickford as a woman of great intelligence, who can not help but be intrigued by the man she loves. I could not help admiring the way she was able to use her intelligence and her natural beauty. She also managed to give the impression of a very sympathetic woman who has had no great personal success. , (I was also amazed at the acting in the movie "The Man Who Knew Too Much." In fact, I think that this was the first movie I saw where I felt I had seen a great many of the leading roles before. As for the actors, they were all good. )  - June 9, 2017The Man who Knew too Much  Reviewer: gary-johnson - favorite favorite favorite - April 11, 2016  Subject: Very enjoyable movie, not too bad a story. - April 4, 2016Very enjoyable movie  Listen to the audio clip for the song "The Music Man" by Jack L.

One of the companies in their control is the R&D division of the Weylands that were founded back in the 1800s by a man named Dr. Paul Weyler, who is a major figure in the Weylin family, and who, along with his son, was the founder of the corporation that later became WeyLAND-YUTANI, but is known to the public as WEYLAND-AMERICAN.

The Weylins have even become wealthy beyond their wildest dreams, and, as a result, they are extremely powerful. One day, Dr. Weylander, who had been a very sick man for many years, suddenly recovered from his illness and went back to work. His son, Paul, immediately took charge of his company, and Dr. Andon Weyman, Dr Paul Weylman's brother, took over the position of the chairman of the board.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. The main bad guy was the worst. He was a really bad actor and looked more like a thug than a bad guy. He did not look like a bad actor at all. I hate to say it, but this is a movie about a gang of thugs who rob a bank and do not care if they are caught. I was thinking that this movie should have been called "the bank robbers". The gang did not seem to care what the police thought about them. I have seen many other gangster movies and they always seem to be caught and go to jail. This one was more about the chase and the gang and not the chase. I really hated this movie.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  The first time I saw the movie was in a crowded theater on opening day, and I was too young to know what I was seeing. I was so overwhelmed with emotion that I started crying. I thought this movie was the best movie ever made. It was just about love. It wasn't just about the romance of the story, it was about the characters and how they dealt with the circumstances they found themselves in. I really wanted to know more about them, and if they would ever have any relationship with each other. I felt sorry for the main character because she is so lonely. I didn't understand the movie because I didn"t understand the story and was still getting over it. I just felt so bad for the character and her love interest.   Was this review helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Good:   Great plot.    It starts out a little slow but really gets going as the story develops.  I really enjoyed watching the movie because the story is really good.  The Bad:    It is pretty slow.  When the story starts to get going, it becomes very slow.   This movie is pretty much one long story about a group of people that are all trapped in a house that has been invaded by zombies.  The only time I really thought I could hear a gunshot was when the guy that was going to kill the zombie was about to get shot.  That was the only time in the movie that I could really hear a shot.   The Ugly:  In my opinion, the movie could have been much better if the story would have continued.  One thing that I really liked about the movie was that it did not have a "happy ending".  It was really cool how the characters could get out of the house.  There was not one shot where I felt like the ending was a bad one.  Overall, I really loved this movie.

If you have to go to a club with your friends, get them to drive and they will not be in the best mood."   "It was a good movie. But the bad part is that the main character has a big penis. He was acting so arrogant and he was trying to show off his penis in front of his friends. They were all laughing and the whole time he was looking down at his penis. It was really annoying. He could not even keep his pants up. It's just so bad to see a movie that is about a guy with a big dick. He should have just stayed home. This movie is so bad and it's only $2.99."   the best part of the movie was that it was in high school  The worst part was the sex scenes in this movie  My rating: ****

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ "Heaven's Gate" is a film with great acting and some great acting. The film is so bad, it is so much better when it is good. This film, with its bad acting, is a piece of crap. The only thing I can say about this film is that I have never seen so many people complaining about the acting, but there are a lot of people who will not watch a movie that has poor acting. If you have not seen the film, you will not be able to enjoy it. This is a movie with bad acting and not even a good story. The movie was a disaster and the actors did not do anything. There is no plot in this movie, no one dies in this film. The actors did nothing in this bad movie. I could not believe how much the people on the set of this film had to put up with. I thought it was a disgrace to be part of a movie like this. The acting in this is so amateur, so pathetic, so unprofessional and the worst thing is that everyone on the movie was trying to act like they were really having fun. It was a real slap in the face to the crew, the cast and to the director. This movie should be called "Heard on the Street." The only time I could even call this film "good" was when it was good, and I have seen worse films than this one. It is a terrible film that has nothing good about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "If you have never seen it, then you are missing out on a truly wonderful movie. If you have seen it and have the patience to watch it again, you will find it is a story that will stay with you.  The movie follows a man named Jack (Michael J. Pollard) who is sent on a mission to a small town to retrieve a girl he was once friends with. On his journey he finds himself in an epic struggle between a group of powerful men and a group that wants to kill him for his knowledge.         The acting was great, the cinematography was excellent and the story was great. Jack's character is very complex and very well acted. The director of the movie, David O. Selznick, really knows how to make a great movie. Jack was a great character to watch because he was able to see things others couldn't and he always had a plan to get out of a situation. The best part of the story is the villain, a man who wants to destroy Jack for what he knows he knows. He also wants to use his knowledge of Jack to take over the world. Jack is not your average hero because he doesn't take the easy way out.        Jack was a real character who was likeable, but it would be a mistake to judge this movie as just a good movie. There are some great scenes in the movie and if you watch the movie over again you will see some new things. I found the movie to be very well written and it was easy to follow. The movie has a great ending and I was glad it ended. I was really impressed with the acting, especially for Michael J. Mulligan as Jack. This movie really is a must see. It was a perfect ending to a great story. I give the movie a 9.5 out of 10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________ I think I was the only person in the theater who did not have fun with this movie. I have to say, the trailers were pretty good and I wanted to see this movie before it came out. I know I'm not alone in this. I loved the trailers and the posters but I was not interested in watching this movie in the first place. It was way too long, it had no plot, it did not make me feel anything, it was just a long movie with a very bad script. The only redeeming factor is that the actress playing the lead, I'm pretty sure, did a great job. I think she is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen and she made the role her own. I was a little disappointed in how little it was about her. It felt like the director wanted to make the movie a drama but he just wasn't skilled enough. The acting was very flat and not very realistic. The cinematography and music were good but I thought it could have been better. I did not like the soundtrack. There was a great song that I would have liked to hear more of, but it didn't really fit. I also wish the director did not change the character's names. It seemed like he was trying to write a story about how she became a model and the story seemed to be going in that direction. I understand that they wanted to do a good job making it about her but I just felt it was more of a soap opera. It really didn't feel like a movie at all. I felt it had way too much going on. I can understand the director wanting to make a drama, but I feel that his script didn't work. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. I thought that it was a very slow film and I don't think that I ever felt like it was moving. I would rather watch a short movie. Overall, I think that it is just not for me.  …

For instance, the girl at the end of the movie is so stupid that it was hard to believe she was even there. And it really hurts when she has to tell the other characters about her "history".

Just a very bad movie. I think the actor who plays the dad should be in more movies. The only thing wrong with the movie was the music. I liked the song the best. The other two songs were not good at all. I would recommend this movie to everyone.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Gail from Excellent I am not a big movie watcher but I found this movie extremely interesting and fun. The movie does a good job of making you want to get up and go to the mall to see the movie with your friends. I highly recommend this to anyone that loves movies and to anyone who has never seen a movie.  in a nutshell: a kid that lives with his mother has to take care of a boy that lives in the woods. there are things that happen that makes the boy go crazy and the kid goes back to the woods to take revenge on the boy. i found it really interesting to see what happens to these kids as they grow up. they are very likable and have a lot of fun. i can not wait to see this movie again. I was watching this with a friend and we both loved it! The kid in this movie was really fun. I was not surprised at all to find out that the actor that plays him is a big action star! It was great seeing the kids do crazy things and to see them interact with their friends. This movie is a must see. It has a lot to do with kids growing up and how much they love to be kids and they always have a good time. This is a great movie to watch with your kids!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.  This is the third movie from this director, but he has not been a good director. The first movie he made was very good, but not as good as this one. This movie has the same plot, except that the lead character (Raj's brother) was much younger than the first one. The movie also has the most ridiculous action scenes and characters. The ending was a real letdown. I don't recommend this movie, because it was bad.  The music was really annoying, and it was really hard to follow the plot. The characters were really bad, and their dialogue was very annoying. If you want to see a really bad movie, go watch The Naked Gun, but don't watch this one!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. The film is a rehash of the original series that aired on Fox in the 90's. It's a story about a teenage boy named Charlie who is sent to a secret base in the middle of nowhere by his father, who is a high ranking officer in the army. There he is mentored by a guy named "General" and is taught how to survive by his new boss, a man named "Dixie". The whole story is based on the fact that the general has an obsession with the boy and wants him to become his successor. Charlie, who always wanted to be a marine, gets captured by the general's men and ends up being experimented on by them. I felt like the movie just kept adding new things and plot lines to it to try and keep it from becoming a boring and repetitive film. The cast is pretty good and the action scenes are good, but I found myself bored at times and had to skip them. The sound is good, it is a bit on the low-end but it isn't bad. The soundtrack is okay and the ending song is pretty cool. It isn't as bad as it looks. I give it a 4.8/10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ***********This movie is a huge disappointment. You will be left with the feeling of a piece of trash that has no substance. It is absolutely awful. I hate it and it's a waste of everyone's time. ***** I don't have anything negative to say about this film. The actors did an amazing job and the director didn't seem to care that this movie was terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It was really well shot and a really good story." "The movie is good. There are no good stories." I don't know, it's just a really bad movie. It doesn't have much to do with the story and the actors are terrible. If they were really that bad, they would be so much better than the role they are given. They do not even look like they are trying. It's just boring. What is most important about this movie is the sound. The sound design is really amazing. It reminds me of the movies from the 80s. It has this 80s style music. It really adds to the movie. The movie is really hard to watch because you see a lot of blood and guts, but it's still very entertaining. It will probably have you laughing a lot. It does have a lot going on. There is a very good reason why this movie was made. The reason behind it is probably to sell some sort of action figures. You can go see this movie for free, but you have to watch it in 3D. If you want to watch this movie on the big screen, it is worth it. There is a sequel which is a different story. It was also really good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like a bad book. You can't help but feel that you're just watching the story unfold.  As soon as the bad guy is caught, you're on the run from the police, and then the movie just skips along.  It's a good movie but it has a plot hole in the end.  This is the first time that I found out that there was a giant turtle in the city, but I think the movie got me confused.   The police didn't know what it was at first, but then they found it and they said it was a big turtle.  And it was like a giant baby turtle that was about five feet long.  The movie is pretty funny, but there's a lot of people that don't like turtles.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I think it's okay. I think it has some potential. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's not my favorite either. I was really excited for it when it was announced, but the marketing is terrible. The trailers are all about the bad guy and the bad guys. Not a lot of action, and even less suspense. They're like two different movies. I also hate how the first two act are all "let's go find this person" and then the movie doesn't really move forward. I feel like the first half of the movie is supposed to be suspenseful, but that doesn't happen. The ending is just boring. It doesn't make any sense. I thought it would be better, but I was very disappointed. I hope they do better with the sequels. I really enjoyed the trailer though. I'm not a big horror fan. I like to watch things on TV and movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________  A bad movie isn't good. A bad movie is bad. The movie is so bad it's not even funny. It has nothing good to say. The actor isn't even funny and the only reason he was cast in the movie is because he's the biggest.  The movie isn, as far as I can tell, a very simple plot. The protagonist is a young man who wants to make a living as a model but he's too old to make the cuts he wants. He is approached by a wealthy model, who gives him a cut of the model's income. They get involved in a scheme to scam a rich investor, who is actually a bank and a fraudster. The scam is called "Fantasy Island" and it involves lots of models, and a huge amount of money.  The whole movie is really boring. It's just a bunch of people being horrible to each other. I think the best part of the movie was when they all had a good laugh. . There is no music in the whole movie. They used a music score for the opening and closing credits, but there was no music at all in the actual movie. There was a lot of talking during the movie and it was really annoying, especially during the scene where they have a poker game. They were talking all the time and they had no problem talking for about 20 minutes. It was so bad that I started to laugh just hearing them talk. They talked about everything under the sun. I didn't think it was funny. This movie is a complete waste of time. I hate how much they spent on the making of the film. I could have made a much better movie if I had made it myself. The plot is bad and the acting is awful. I would never recommend this movie to anyone.

It makes me think that there was no plan to make this movie at all. The story is totally nonsensical, the characters are not very original and the plot is so bad that it makes you laugh even when it makes no sense. It made me think I was watching a bad dream.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. See, this movie is bad! And that's why I wanted to be the only one who hated it. I'm sure it was written by a fan and they thought they could get away with it. There is a lot of violence, including a scene where the hero (the young girl) is shot and the bullet goes through her ear and into her head. Her father's head is on her bed and she is crying. The dad is trying to calm her down. A gun pops out and he is shot too. This happens in front of the girl. What the hell is going on? It's bad enough that it has a female lead, but the scene is so over the top it's almost humorous. It's also so stupid that the movie is about a guy named John (Casper Van Dien). He's a cop. He goes undercover to investigate this crime and the guy he finds out to be responsible is a cop named John Dyer. I thought this was a good cop movie. I liked John and his partner, John Denny. It was a cop movie that actually had cop characters. And I liked the character of John Dickson. He's so much like John Wayne. The guy is tough. He was like a bad guy in a western, which is something I don't really get. I think the film could have been better. It doesn't even have a beginning and end. I guess they just threw in a bunch of scenes and just got out of the way and then got on with it, but this movie didn't have anything interesting going for it. It just wasn't very good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* This movie is terrible. It was like watching a slow motion slow motion train wreck. The main characters are completely over drawn and the movie tries to make them likable but they just don't have a clue. They are all like one character but they are all the same and the same. The plot is the most over-the-top thing I have ever seen in a movie. I really do not understand why anyone would want to watch this movie. It is just a waste of time and a waste for the actors. I was so upset that I could not finish watching it. If you want a movie that is over the top and has no redeeming qualities then this movie is for you. *****

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This movie has nothing going for it, it's not even good, it just looks cheap and the acting is really bad. The main character is a loser with no life so the story starts with him looking for someone who could take care of him. His best friend who had the hots for him is also looking for the same and that just happens to be a girl with a good figure. This movie is just a waste of time, it is a big waste of money and the actors don't even look that good in it. They look like they just went to the gym to get the abs out. I am not sure why they put this on a movie that was not a very good one. This was a movie to be watched when you have nothing better to do." I love this movie because it's so true to life.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  It's not that the film is bad or doesn't work, but the movie is so bad, that I feel it's best to leave this review in a negative, as I am unable to think of anything that is not a huge waste of time.   I've never heard of the man, who is known as "The Godfather of Horror", but after watching this movie, I'm starting to believe he did a lot of it himself.   is a movie I had heard about, but had never watched it. The reason why I'm writing this review is because this movie is a total disaster. There's absolutely nothing to this movie. Nothing. I know I've said it before, but I really have to say it again. Nothing in this movie works. I was so bored that I stopped caring about anything. I'm not kidding. I spent about 10 minutes trying to figure out who the heck is in this film. There is no sense of who this person is. No character development whatsoever. The only thing I cared about was the ending. I don't know what I expected from this movie other than a big dumb gorefest. I guess it wasn't worth it, because I didn't even care about the characters, they're just there to be gory and disturbing, like the rest of this movie's cast. There are no real good characters in this. The whole movie is just one long character building montage. I would have given this movie 3 stars, but it had a terrible ending. The entire film is about one man, the "Godfather", a character that I have never heard before. He talks about his family, but he never shows us a single thing from his family. It seems as though he never even knows them. He spends the entire movie building up his character, but never really shows us what it is that makes him the "godfather" of horror. What's more, there's a scene in this scene where he takes out his knife, and kills the man who was supposed to be his son. Then he just stands there, and then the camera cuts to a shot of the guy's body. It's just not right. He was supposed be a father figure to his son, and he was just a guy who killed a kid for no reason. The movie ends with him just walking down the street. I have to imagine that the reason he does that is because the guy who was his son had murdered
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're looking for something bad to watch, this is the movie for you. The plot is the most boring one of the whole movie. I had to stop watching because the movie had become so boring. The characters are just like any other anime characters in every single way. They're all the same, the same characters from the same series. The only thing that stands out about them is that they're all stupid, and they're the only reason I watched this movie. This movie is just a bunch of cliches that were used to sell a dumb movie to the people. It's like they used a few of the same clips to make this movie, and then put the same thing in the end. I can't recommend this movie because it's just too boring and unoriginal. I wish there was something original about it, but there isn't.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I was raised on a diet of American Graffiti and The Godfather, and the only thing that ever made me care about a movie was when it was on TV and I had to watch it in the car on the way to school. So I was pretty spoiled for choice for movies to watch.   My mom made us watch the movie on her birthday every year because it was the only movie she thought was worth watching.  It's not a bad film, but it's not good either. I thought it was really funny when a movie star's daughter comes to the family house in the middle of the night with a bag of marijuana, then leaves with the whole family and heads to California, but the ending was a bit too confusing for me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ (the movie) was bad. The story line was not good, the acting was poor and the music was very uninspired. The worst thing about the movie was the ending. The ending is very disappointing because it was a cliffhanger. I do not think it is necessary for the movie to end on such a bad note. It was just too out of left field for me to feel anything about it. I am sure that most people who see it will not care and will only be annoyed because they have already seen it. It is a very cheap movie, and I doubt it is very well thought out. There were many things that were not explained or thought out at all. I don't think I have ever seen a movie where the bad guy does not have a reason to kill the hero, and the hero does not do anything about the situation. The movie was really bad, and it is probably only worth watching for the sake of having a laugh. I can't even watch it in a theater because I do have a bad feeling about it, and even if it were not bad, I do think it would be a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Curse of the Were-Rabbit" -  I had never seen this movie until the internet found out it was in a theater at a convention. The first time I saw it was at the convention, and the film was so bad I didn't even care what happened. The film is a bad comedy about a woman who is forced to marry the brother of her best friend. The woman gets pregnant with his child, and she wants to abort the baby. When the baby's father shows up, they fight over who gets the baby and he ends up killing the baby, even after she is screaming for help. The poor girl ends up getting murdered. I didn`t even know this movie existed until the Internet told me that it was bad, and I went to the theater and was so disappointed. It was really bad, I really had no interest in seeing this movie.  (I wish they had gotten more than one take on this movie, it was a pretty terrible movie)
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________  "The first half of the film is a very interesting and creative film in the style of The Godfather, which is always a big plus. However, after the opening credits we get the worst ending ever and it's not good at all. It's very cheap and it takes away any credibility that was given to the film, which should have been a very good movie. It takes away the potential of this movie, because it's a really crappy and cheap movie. The only good part of the movie is the last few minutes of the credits. It is a great idea and the last 5 minutes are so good. I really liked the ending, but it was too little too late."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.   That's why you don't want to see this movie. It's just a bunch of poorly acted, poorly written, poorly directed, poorly acted and poorly directed "movie" that should have never been made. I've seen far worse movies, but this movie, with all the hype, should have been a hit. Why do you think it wasn't?   Why do you assume that people like this movie? Because of the way the director made this movie...   Because the "director" of this movie has absolutely no talent at all. He doesn't even have the "cinematic" knowledge to know what he's doing.  .   in the end, all you get is a buncha guys running around...  , I mean really?  , and you know they don't care, they're just trying to get by in their lives.     .   (view spoiler).   I mean seriously? This movie was so bad that it was actually banned from showing in the movie theaters? Really?   a bunch(?) of people run around trying to kill each other. And they get along just fine with the whole "dance, dance, dance" thing. I mean seriously. I think they should have just made a movie about a bunch (?) of homeless people and just put in a bunch more scenes where they're dancing and having fun...   the only thing that makes this movie work is the music and the background music. The only reason this movie works is because of the music.   with all this music and all this stuff going on, why the fuck did they waste time with all of the "cliché" scenes?... i guess because it looks like a real good idea to have a bunch a homeless people running around and having a dance party. But what they should've done was make a movie with just some people that are just having a party and nothing else.. (view spoilers). the only reason i don't give this movie a 1 star is because it's pretty good..

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. _______________. __________________. ____. _____. _______.  5. ______________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________. "Hooking Up with a Boy" (1989)  This is one of those films that can really be interpreted in so many ways. The film starts off with a typical, if cheesy, romantic comedy, but soon gets into a darker and more disturbing area. The main character is a serial killer, who kidnaps and kills young boys and young men. As he goes on killing people, he is trying to connect with a girl. His attempts at seduction of the girl is very strange and even he himself is not sure what to think. The movie is not very realistic. But it does not have a message either. It just does what a movie like this is supposed to do: give us some dark and disturbing stories. Bizarrely, this movie was released in 1989, but the movie was actually made in 1990. In 1991, it was shown on the TV show "Murder in the First" and was nominated for an Oscar in 1992. As far as I can see, the movie has not been re-released yet. It is listed on several DVD and Blu-Ray websites. I have not seen it, so if anyone has a copy of this movie, please send me a copy, as I would really like to see it again. This is an interesting and creepy movie that should not be missed. - IMDb.com -
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  [The last time I saw this film was in the theater in 1981, at a showing of it that was not part of a trilogy, and it was a very sad film. The actor who played the villain, the man with the red mask on his face, was very creepy in this movie, and I can see why he was a big star in the late 80s and early 90s. He was scary. I was never afraid of him. He never frightened me, although I saw the movie several times in the 1980s. It's not a good film. It was not a great film, and the actors don't really have anything going on in it. I didn't think it was very good. I would never see this again. But if I'm going to see a film, I would like to see something I haven't seen before. And this was a good looking film. - April 23, 2009A Sad Film

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was really excited to watch this movie and was hoping it would be something special. It was so bad that I actually cried the entire time. It wasn't even funny. It just was bad. There was no reason to be laughing at this movie. It should be on the "do not watch" list. The acting was bad and there was no story. It's like they just took the story from a video game and made it into a movie. The main bad guy just stood around and said "I don't want to kill anyone but I want to play". The other bad guys just stood in the background. They didn't talk. The bad guy would yell at the screen for 10 minutes and then he would just sit there. It really ruined the whole movie. I think they just wanted to make a cheap movie and didn't give a crap about what it was.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________  "The first time I saw this movie, it did not feel like a'real' film. I felt like I was watching a movie on TV with a poor quality. The first time around, the acting was very bad. I knew that the director wanted to portray the character as being an angry, and very aggressive man. His anger was very apparent. The scenes that were filmed had poor lighting, and the sound effects were very unprofessional. The film felt very fake, and was very slow to get going. I really felt sorry for the main character. His character, a young boy, was not portrayed as an intelligent, and good-natured person. He seemed very immature and he acted like he was a child that had not had a proper upbringing. It seemed like this film was made for a younger audience. I could see how some of the characters in the film may have been influenced by the violence and hatred that was shown on the news. This is a film that I do not recommend. It is not a film to watch, especially when the mood is so dark and violent."   I had never heard of this movie until my uncle introduced me to it at the beginning of this year. I saw it a few weeks ago, and I was really surprised that it was so bad. It was very hard to sit through the film and I have never seen anything like it. There was a lot of violence and it was a very disturbing film to see. The movie starts off with a few shots of a person getting shot in the head. The opening credits roll, and it appears to be a story about a man that is about to be hanged. Then the camera pans over to a man, who is screaming in a very loud voice. The person who is shooting the man has been identified as a black guy, and he is seen pointing a gun at the man who is in the chair. The camera zooms in on the face of the man in the wheelchair. Then, the person who has been filming the scene, shows a few clips of the person being shot in his head. I was very disturbed by this. It appeared that this man had been shot in a way that made it look like he had a very bad wound. Then there was a clip of the chair being wheeled out of the room. The scene cuts to a close up of the camera being held over the camera of the cameraman, and then the scene cuts back to

I like to say that the story is a joke and it is a really stupid one, because I was laughing when I read the synopsis, but the movie is a real mess.   2. The guy who is played by Sam Worthington is a total jerk, and the woman who plays his wife, who is very pretty, is in a totally ridiculous situation. I don't know what they were thinking when they made the movie, but they got it wrong.  , but you don't see her naked in it, but in the first scene where we see her, you can see her legs and the back of her head and she is wearing a red bikini and she has no underwear on. She also looks like she has been crying all the time, and it just doesn't look natural.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  The whole film is so unbelievably stupid that I almost didn't know what was going on, and I still don't.  - The ending is a mess - The whole film shows us the same damn character, and they're so clearly meant to be one and the same character. This character just happens to be the worst villain ever to come out of a movie, and he has no reason for being there at all. He's just a selfish jerk who wants to use people and their money and their lives for his own selfish ends.    The plot was lame. - There's not much plot here. It's just one guy, and a bunch of girls.   This movie is terrible. - I hate it so much that it's painful to watch. It was clearly made by a 14-year-old girl and she's a terrible director. It just makes me sick.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Would I recommend this movie to a friend: _______ No I would not, it's just that this is a very bad movie. You are supposed to be scared by this movie, but you're just not. The people in this movie are so creepy. And they're so bad. They look like they could do any job. It's very hard to watch this movie. This is not scary at all. This movie has no good ideas. I have never seen a movie that has so many bad ideas. This was one of the most horrible movies I have ever seen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.   Helpful movie about two friends, whose lives are in danger.The characters are so likeable that you will really enjoy this movie. The movie is about the two friends in high school who want to join a motorcycle club. They have the chance to join when they are about to go to a race in a racecar, but it doesn't turn out as planned. The friends try to change their luck by going to a new motorcycle club, but they fail to get any new members, and the two are trapped. They start a new chapter of their lives, but that doesn't mean they are out of danger. Their lives are still in danger because they are the only two members left who don't belong to a motorcycle organization. This movie was great. I really liked the plot, the characters, and this movie is a good action movie, which is also good to watch if you like action movies. The action scenes were pretty good and you should see it. This is a pretty good movie. It is good to see the friendship between the two guys, and their desire to help each other, which made me really enjoy the movie. I think it is a very good movie to watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ It is a horror movie with great performances and a good story. But the worst thing about this movie is the way the director made the whole thing. It is like he was going for a "B-movie" and it was a terrible one. The plot was too simple and there was no plot to speak of. You had a group of characters in a small town and they all do something horrible. They have a fight and then they all die. And there are only 2 things that happen after that. One is that the people that died have to go through a ritual to be resurrected. And then the movie ends with the police chief being buried alive. So, you have a terrible movie that does not make a good movie. ____________  A good movie that is not as good as it could have been: ____________________ It is a movie that I have watched many times. It has been on many "Best of" lists and it has been one of my favorites. It was a good thriller. The movie had good performances from all the main characters and they were all interesting and likable. It had a great storyline. It showed that evil can be defeated if you are determined and strong enough. It also shows that we all have a purpose in life and that we should live our life the way that makes us happy. It would have been a great movie if it was done better. It could have done some better with the ending. But it is still a great film. ______________________  This movie has so many good things and I really loved it, but I hate the way it is edited. It just is not very good and I have seen worse. _________________________  Not a good film: _________________________________ 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Don't watch this movie. Don't bother reading the reviews, and if you have to watch it, don't let anyone else watch it with you. If you are a person who is looking for an escape from reality, look elsewhere. This movie is a joke. The movie is about a woman who decides to go to the hospital for a physical exam, and she finds out that her husband has been cheating on her. I can't imagine a more depressing movie than this. It's not funny at all. It is a depressing movie, and it's not a funny movie. This is a real life horror movie. If a woman was in the same situation as this woman and she decided to go out there and have fun, she might not come back. The first half of the movie is just depressing. I'm not even going to tell you what is happening. Just watch it and you will know what I mean. When I watched this movie, I had no idea how this movie would end. The ending is just horrible. The last 20 minutes of the film are just depressing and I think the movie could have gone on forever. You can't have a happy ending in a movie like this. There is nothing good in this movie! The ending of the last scene is just so sad. The only good thing about this movie is the last 10 minutes of it. I really thought this movie was going to be a depressing one. It was a depressing, depressing movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ (1) The film is all about the hero's search for his brother, a criminal who has escaped from a mental hospital. The hero goes on a quest with his friend and finds that they are at the site of a terrible massacre that took place there. They are taken to a house where a young woman named Elle (Sophie Scholl) is waiting for them. The man in charge of the house is the villain, and the girl is his own sister, Rose (Anneke Wills). The hero's sister is a virgin and she is not interested in having sex with the man in the house. However, he has other plans. He wants her for himself. He will have sex with her when she is in the middle of giving birth to a child. The boy, William (David Bowie), is the brother of the woman in the story. The film opens with the two friends having a night of fun at a movie theater where they have a great time. When they go home, they find out that their brother has gone missing and the movie theater is now closed. They decide to investigate, and when they find the villain in the mansion, they discover a secret chamber where the evil forces of the mansion are imprisoned. They find a dead body in the closet and discover that their own sister has been murdered. The two heroes have to fight their way out of the castle and save their sister. The movie is very funny and is one of the best horror films of the 90s. (2) The movie has a very unique story. You know what happens to the evil force in the movie: the hero must find the evil spirit, the villain. He has to find the person who was sent to destroy him and then the hero has to kill him. This is an interesting way to tell a story. I liked that the movie tried to get some laughs out of this. I also liked that it tried to make the villain more realistic than usual. (3) The cast is very good. I really liked the performances of the two leads, David Bowie and Anneke Wiles. Both are very good actors and I think the movie worked because of their performances. (4) The villain was a very good villain. It was a good idea for him to look like a young boy and also for him not to look too old. I thought the villain was very funny. The plot was pretty much the same in the first part and in the second part

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  This is a great movie. The actors do a great job, the story is well paced and the acting is great. However, the movie lacks something that many of the other "horror" movies seem to have - a true ending. We don't know if it's because the film is so short that it can't be expanded on, but it doesn't have a clear conclusion. If the film were a bit longer, it would have been a better movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  The movie is okay, but the plot is not. It is all a setup for a much bigger and better story, but instead the film is all about a guy who falls in love with a girl who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The only thing I like about this movie is that the ending is good, but I wish it was more about a normal relationship between a guy and a girl.   As far as the film goes, it is a great romance. It has some great action sequences, and the chemistry between the two leads is great. The movie has a very good soundtrack, and even though I do not think it will appeal to a large audience, it can be fun for anyone who wants to see a movie where two people fall in love. The main problem is that this movie had a much higher budget than it needed to, and it is very obvious that the director did not really have a great story in mind.  .
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ How did this movie make me feel: ______________________________________ Why did I give it a 3?: _________________________________________ The Movie: I was pretty stoked when I first saw this film and figured I'd get my money's worth out of it. I was not disappointed, the movie was so much fun and I loved the characters so much. I thought the film had some pretty funny moments and was a great little time travel comedy. I loved how the film kept the suspense and mystery of the original movie and kept it very dark, which I really liked. I didn't think there was much of a story though, just a lot of comedy. One thing I did really like about the movie is the characters, all of them are really good. It was pretty hard for me to choose which character I liked the best, but the girl who played the character named Nell, she was hilarious and I just adored her. The only thing that really bothered me about the film was how the movie just went on and on, I'm not sure how it got into the editing room, but it seemed like it never really got to the story. So it was just an endless string of jokes. I did enjoy the movie though, I just wish the plot was just a little bit more interesting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _________ This movie is so bad it makes me want to cry. I love to watch movies and watch the stars but this movie makes me feel like I was in the middle of the movie and I would have to look up the names of people because I cant even remember their names. And I do not mean they have a weird accent or something, the characters in this movie were so bad that it made me feel they were playing a stupid movie. If I had not seen the film and read the reviews I would say this was a bad film, but after seeing the movie I feel I need to be in a movie theater and sit next to my friends and cry and think about how horrible the movie is and how awful the actors were. If you dont want to see a bad Hollywood film and want to have a good laugh I would recommend this to anyone but if you are going to see something bad you might as well be in it.

It is a very dark movie. The ending was really, really bad. The story was really bad, not good. The acting was awful. I really thought it was a bad script and that the director didn't know how to direct. It's hard to watch. I think I watched it twice, and I am not sure if it's the same person. I would give it a 2 out of 10 because the ending sucked. I will try again.

The action and the music was amazing and I loved the ending. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes sci-fi. I will definitely watch more of this series!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  This is my third viewing of the movie, and it is a total disappointment. It is all wrong.  I understand that the film was a commercial failure. The producers were forced to release it because they couldn't get a distribution deal. It was a critical failure and had to be made as a movie. So they just used the same actors in a bad production. It all seemed so phony. The whole thing was so boring and it was obvious they couldn the producers knew they were making a bad film. ,,,  A good movie:,,,

Write a negative review about a bad movie: e like, there are some movies that are just plain horrible. Like, the movie I just watched is a really bad movie. And I don't know why I put it on here. It's not that bad of a movie. The worst part of the movie was the first ten minutes of the film. I mean, there was nothing good about it. It was just boring and pointless. So the second half of the first act was kind of cool and kind of a good idea. I had a hard time believing what I was watching but I really wanted to believe it. I guess it wasn't a bad idea at all. e rest of the second act was just kind of boring.  I mean, I wasn't really bored during the rest of it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ What a fucking shit movie! The characters are all dumb and the script is terrible. The acting is bad. The plot is shit. The directing is terrible and the writing is even worse. I mean I can't even remember any of the characters because I never remember anything. There's a girl in the movie who has the best hair but it looks like a fucking clown wig. Her name is Loretta and she's a prostitute who gets raped by some weirdo. She ends up dying. There is a girl who is a virgin who is also a prostitute and she gets raped and dies. She was a virgin because she's gay. She just wants to be a normal girl who has sex. The movie ends with a big gay sex scene that is so gay and sick. The girl who had the best hairdo in the world and the girl who got raped and died are just two of the sickest fucking characters in the film. And then there's the woman who gets fucked by all of the men and who looks like she's about to explode in a big fucking orgasm. I swear the movie was so sick. And you can tell that the director and producers wanted to make this a big hit. I'm not sure if it's the director or the producers or if the writers really got a kick out of making a movie about people who are really sick.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This is a bad film. "  (R.E.M.)  -The director is a good guy who has no respect for the actors, no respect at all. The plot is horrible, it's full of pointless dialogue, the acting is bad, the music is awful, and there's only one thing I liked about this movie: it was on the Discovery Channel.  If you're going to watch this movie, don't watch it on your computer, you will hate yourself for watching this movie.    -This movie is about a guy who's an atheist.   -This was a dumb movie that has nothing to do with religion.  -I found this movie to be so poorly written that the characters were completely unbelievable.  -In one scene the guy is playing a video game.  This movie was so bad that even the director couldn't believe it, and he quit.  In one scene he says to a character "Why is there a devil in the game?"  I watched this movie for a science experiment.  I thought it was interesting that this was a movie about a man who was so stupid and had such little ability that he couldn't make a mistake.  The other person in the movie was the best actor in the world.  A few people on the internet have said that the music in this movie is really good.  It was good, but nothing special.  My favorite part of the movie is when the guy gets a dog and the dog gets a new owner.  Then the new owner has a fight with the dog.  (I think the fight was about the dog.)  In one part the guy goes to church and he's going to pray to God.  He gets a Bible and starts praying.  When he is praying he starts crying.  So he gets up and he leaves the church.  At one point in the film a guy is on a beach and the guy walks away.  And when the camera is on the guy, the guy says "This is the only beach I ever go to."  This is not true.  There is a beautiful beach in Maine that I used to go to.  If you're interested in this, check out this link: http://www.wonderland.org/wonderlands/page.htm.  It has lots of information about the beach.  You can go to it right now.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ _________ The best I can do is give it 2 stars, because of how bad the acting is, how it's made, the story is the least important part of the movie. The other actors are just trying to impress their director. If you love movies like the first, the second and the third, don't watch this one. It will leave you feeling sick.

GRAHAM was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1917. He was raised in an affluent suburb, but as a boy, his father was an alcoholic. He became interested in acting at the age of 11, and was given the part of "Captain" in a play at a local theater. He performed as Captain until he was 21, when he decided to make his first movie appearance.  the film's producers thought Graham would be a better actor than the young boy he was portraying. Graham was told to get in the movie as a "special guest actor" and they were sure he could act. He played a "soldier" who is shot in the arm, then wakes up in the morgue. After a quick scene of him recovering his arm, he is killed by an explosion. The film received an average of only 4 percent on the box office, but it was a big success with critics, who praised Graham's performance. His first Hollywood film role was in Triumph (1961), where he played a German commander. He received a Golden Globe nomination for the role, which he won. He appeared in a number of films during the next few years, and eventually became the most famous of the many British actors who worked in Hollywood during the 1950s. Graham had a successful film career in the 1940s and 1950s, including several supporting roles.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ Read some reviews about this movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1536250/reviews (1.5 out of 5)_________________________________   Best Picture: The Artist (2002)  I was shocked by this one. This is one of the best of the last decade. It is a classic about the artist and the media. It shows the artist's journey of self-discovery through his paintings.   Director Michel Gondry captures the essence of this story, with an emotional clarity and wit. It has all the elements that are necessary to tell a story: the struggle of the artist, the artist in the media, the relationship between the artist & the media (film, painting, book). It's a story about creativity and it's the artist who gets the spotlight.   to me, this film is very personal.  , the story about the relationship of the painter with the media is very relatable, because it is about the struggle and the battle of a young man who is trying to become a famous artist. It's an intense film and it gets very emotional.   the film has an amazing cast and it makes a great movie. This film has the perfect balance of action and emotions.   a great cast in this movie.   is the best film about the art of painting, ever.  . This movie has a great soundtrack, and the soundtrack is very original. The music makes the film very immersive and interesting. It makes you feel like you're there.   The score was composed by Michel Gomboy who has also composed for many other movies.    . I didn't enjoy this film but I understand the reason why some people do. It takes a very serious approach. It deals with a very controversial subject.   in my opinion, this movie is not very well made. It lacks a certain "fear factor". It's like a story with no tension. I felt like I was watching a movie with no substance. I found myself bored. It was a very intense film but it lacks the "fright" factor. I think the film was made too long.   (1/5)   The Artist is one the best films of the decade. I recommend it to every movie lover.  /watch if you are a movie lover/

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ A good movie is a movie that has a lot of heart. The plot is simple: a family gets together for Christmas. But they have to keep the secret that they are vampires, because the family is not accepted. And what a secret that is. The story is well written and acted, with great performances from all the main characters. The main plot is really good, and you can see the characters growing together. But there are some problems with the plot. It takes a while to get going, but the story does pick up speed at the end. The film does take a lot from other vampire movies, and they should be praised for it. It is a good film, but there are a lot more good vampire movies. ______________________________________________________________  Helpful just one word: AWFUL!   I watched this film when it came out, and I can tell you it is a bad film. The actors did not seem to have fun with this movie, and the script was just stupid. There was a point in the movie where the wife gets a bite, but no one talks about that. This is not a horror movie, but more like a slapstick comedy. If this were a comedy, I would not give this film a one star review. I just hope this film gets better and not get a sequel. ______________________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* I watched this movie in the theater. I really wanted to like it, but all I got was horrible. The characters were soooo stupid, and the plot was soo lame. I dont even know what the point of the movie was. All of the characters are dumb. The best character was the mother who was all about "I love my children" and all that nonsense. The father was just a total dick. The only good thing about this movie was that it was all in black and white. That way you dont have to sit there with your mouth open wondering what was going on. The ending was very disappointing, but I guess thats the way it goes when you film the whole thing in black & white. *****  Ok, here is what you need to know. The movie has a woman, and her daughter who is born with no eyes. When she gets a chance to go to a movie the woman takes her daughter to see a movie that has no eyes, and when she sees the movie, her daughter is a little girl with no nose. The woman takes the girl and her son to her house, and there they go to sleep. But the mother gets up to go shopping, and she comes back and she says to her daughter "I want you to get up and walk with me" and the daughter walks out and when the mother is walking out she says "you are the most beautiful girl I have ever seen". The daughter is really sad, and so she runs out to her father, and says to him "Daddy, I want to be like you". And the father says "I can be like anything you want me to be, just be happy and don't be sad." So the daughter says "Daddy what do you want?" And the son says "Well you see I have a wife and I have kids, and you are the only girl I ever loved, and I never wanted her to leave me, and now that I love her I want you too". And then the daughter said "What do you do for a living, Daddy?" And then he says "You make me look at a movie, I take care of your kids, you teach them to be happy, and to love the things they love. You do it all for me. I want what you do, so I want a big house, a nice car, and a nice family, and if you want that, just give me a call. We can have a
Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********The only good thing about this film is that they don't have a soundtrack. The worst thing is that it doesn't even try to have a score, but just cuts out the bad parts of the film, like when they have to go to jail or go after a bad guy. ***********   The only decent thing about the film is the acting. The whole movie is just about the two guys and the bad guys. The good guys don't talk, and they just stand around and shoot people. The bad guys don`t talk either. I thought that the bad guy that they are chasing is going to be the baddest guy in the movie. But he`s not. His name is "The King", and he`ll just kill the baddie that is chasing the two baddies. I guess he can`t shoot because he is too dumb. But his bad guy buddy will talk a lot more than the baddies, and the two good guys can talk with the badguy. But the badguys are just so dumb. It is all just too much. The only good part about this movie is the two dudes. They are pretty cool. But I guess this is why they are goodguys. They talk about things. But it seems like they don`T know anything about anything. I don`re pretty sure that they were just there because the two boys wanted to have some fun, and then it just ended up that way. I think that if you are going to do this kind of movie, you should get a real actor, and not a couple of kids.   And then, when the baddads are trying to catch the badboy that is just walking around the movie, the badder baddies kill him. So they have no way of catching the bad boy. The two guys are trying all over the movie to catch this badboy, and it just never works. They finally get it on the first day, but it`s too late. The guy they are trying so hard to catch, they kill. The guys can`ve found a way to catch him, but they just can`T do it.   (more)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       I am not going to review the movie because I don't think it deserves any praise, but it's worth mentioning that I have not seen a movie quite like this one. It is a short, but very intense movie that will make you think about the human race and what they are doing with their lives. I thought the movie was extremely well done and I think it is very good at what it is trying to do. I think that the movie will make people question the nature of the human mind and what it can and can't do. The movie is set in the future, where people are being controlled by the government. The film shows how they are using this technology and what the effects are on them. There is a lot of violence in the movie, but I felt it was done with good purpose. The violence in this movie was done in a way that it was almost painful to watch, but there were times when the violence was justified. The way this movie has a lot to say about the nature and human nature is what I found interesting about it. The main character, Jack, is a normal guy who is given a device that is meant to take control of him, but he is able to overcome the device. He then goes on a journey to find a way to stop the device, which is causing all the bad things to happen to the world. The ending of the movie shows the main character as a kind of hero. It showed that Jack can be a good person and even if he doesn't believe in God, he is willing to try to do good things. It also shows that Jack is a very good person who just didn't know what to do with his life. He wanted to help people and it was all he knew how to do, but now he has to live a life of being the "savior of the world". He goes on this journey to help other people and I thought that was very interesting. The story also shows the way people are not meant to live their lives, and they are all the same as Jack. The whole story was very well done, and I really enjoyed the movie. The music in this film was very good. It was done well and really helped to bring the movie to life. The acting in this is very strong. I liked the acting in the film and I felt the actors really gave their all in this. The only problem I had with this

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it's a good movie.  I saw it on a big screen and I have to admit, it's a big, cheesy movie. But the script and the acting were so good that it really made me enjoy it.  I like to think of a movie as a big canvas that I can paint on.  I think of the movie as an idea or a journey.    I've heard the saying that "you can't paint on a black canvas" but the truth is you can.    And this movie has a huge canvas.  The story is told by the two main characters: one is a former Marine, and he is a man of honor. He is a good person and he has been in many wars.  He's also a widower and his wife died.  However, he lost his wife a long time ago and he hasn't talked about it. This is the story of a man who is searching for his lost love.  Now this is a guy who is a very good person, but he is very naive.  This movie has many different themes.  One of the themes is loss and loneliness.  There are so many different characters in this movie. The characters are very different.  Most of them are veterans, but some of them were civilians.  Some are widowers, but others were single.  You will also find a lot of different races and ethnic groups.  But there is one theme in this film that I thought was very interesting.  We have a group of soldiers that are the only soldiers left from the war.  It seems like they have a lot in common with the people that they are fighting.  They both have a love of country, and they have lost a lot, but they have found hope.  These are the two men who lead the soldiers on their journey to find their lost love and reunite with their family.  As a movie it has a lot going on. The acting is very good.  Both the actor who plays the former Marine and the actor that plays the widower are very good in this picture.  All of the other actors that are in the film are great.  And there are some great songs that play in the background.  To sum it up, I think this is an awesome movie and a great experience.  Watch it. What I Liked:  - Great acting and a good story - The story was a good
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.   A.D.A. (1963) - I don't know how many times I've seen this film, but I'm not really sure why. I think it might be because of its title. It is about a guy who finds a letter that's been sent by a guy in the 19th century that tells him that he was sent to New York as a spy. I'm sure there are a few other things in the film that are interesting, but this is the only reason why I still watch it. It doesn't do anything really wrong, it just has a cool story that has been told a million times. The acting is pretty good. I really don't like some of the villains. There is one guy in this film who really takes the cake for most annoying guy in a film. I don;t think he's that bad a guy, but he really takes a lot of the screen time. He has no sense of morality, he is always doing something. I guess I just don't care for the characters that much. I like the girl and she's a real character. There are a lot more interesting characters in this movie. I liked this film a lot, it had a cool storyline, but it's a little boring at times.   with:   I've Got A Secret (1965) - This movie is about two guys who are in a gang. They are trying to find a guy. There's a girl in the movie, but she's just there to be there and not do anything. There were a lot worse movies about gangs and criminals. This is one of the better ones. It's not that good, but a lot better than other gang movies. It isn't the best gang movie, because there are some really good ones, but there are just not many good ones. I thought it was okay. It just wasn't that good. It has a good storyline. I just wish it had been longer. It was just a good movie, nothing special about it.   to:  In the Heat of the Night (1967) - It's a gangster movie about a young guy who's trying to get into a gang, and he gets a little too close to the right person. It wasn't really a good gangster film, it was more about the guy trying to be a gangsta and getting a little more into the right gang than he should be. There was a guy that got killed

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  The way this movie starts is just like the first time you watched a movie in a theatre, but this time you have no idea what's going on, and you're confused. I've been to enough theatre shows that you get used to it by the time the first act comes to a close. The movie is very much like a 'what if' movie, which is something I love. There's a lot of different endings you could see, and I think that's what makes it so exciting to watch. The way the story ends is interesting, and it was very funny. The ending is a bit confusing and I thought I was supposed to be shocked, but I wasn't. It's very dark and you can't help but feel the sadness. There are a lot a good jokes in this movie, and there are some really bad ones. I can't say there's anything bad about the movie, but there are a few parts that were just so out of place and not at all necessary. I really liked the character of the guy in the film who got into a fight with a car in a parking lot. There were some really good moments in this film and it has some really funny parts. I would recommend this movie to any fan of horror.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ I watched this movie as a kid in the 70s, and it's so bad that it's hard to believe it's supposed to be about the "Battle of Midway" which happened in 1942. They were supposed to have used fake Japanese pilots who were shot down over the Pacific and taken prisoner and kept in a POW camp on the island of Tinian. They had to take the prisoners to a new island and build a runway, and then drop them on Tokyo. Well the plane they used was a Japanese Kawanishi, and the pilot died before they could even take off. The movie's supposed hero, Major General Curtis LeMay, was a real nut who believed in all that crap. He said he wanted to drop a nuclear bomb on Tokyo and take the Japanese with it. There were several other "Japanese" pilots who had died, so they made the Japanese pilots up. They also used real prisoners to fly the planes. The only person in the movie that seemed to be a real Japanese was the Japanese man who gave the order to attack. The rest were all made up. The plot was a bunch of people going to war for a stupid reason, and killing a bunch more people. I think it was a stupid movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ The movie that is about a man who was a criminal from the time he was a child, until he was sentenced to prison for the murder of his mother and the attempted murder of a woman he met at a dance hall. He is then given a chance to become a policeman by the police. He finds out that he is actually a very good cop. He was also able to get his mother back from the grave and help her and her daughter escape from the murderer. He then decides to try and help other criminals as well. He becomes good friends with a man named Bill, who is a very powerful criminal who has a lot of money. _______________ The movie was so bad that it got so bad I almost didn't care about the ending of it. I don't want to ruin it for you by saying how bad the movie was, but it was so so bad. The script was so stupid. It wasn't even good acting. The director, who also wrote the script, thought that if he had more time he could have made a better movie. He tried to write a film about a cop who is an officer in a small town who has no idea what to do with himself. He tries to be a good cop by helping criminals and making arrests. He does this by getting involved in their criminal activities. In this movie there was nothing wrong with him doing this. In fact, it was good that he was doing this because it meant that the criminals could be caught and he could get the bad guys. However, the problem is that he becomes involved with a girl who turns out to be an innocent person. She is innocent of everything that happened, and he is still involved with her. I mean, he goes from good cop to bad cop. This made the whole movie very silly and bad. When I saw the movie I laughed. The other bad thing about this movie is the ending. It made me sick to my stomach. The ending was so ridiculous. The cop is able to escape and then he is able go to a casino and then be able to buy a car. When he is finally arrested, he is told by his superior that he did a good job and that he will be promoted. He doesn't have to do anything to get promoted. That's just too bad. I was so sick to think about it. The only good thing about the movie is that it was made by a good guy who had a lot more talent than he did. He
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ I'm glad I saw this movie before I watched the new one and after reading a few reviews. I found it very interesting. But, I found that I could not really enjoy it at all. I think that the new movie has more personality, more heart and more humor. And I found this one very boring. It's like an old movie with a new soundtrack and some actors that don't look their best. The acting was awful and I found myself wondering what happened to the actress who played a character in the original movie. And it was very sad. I was sad too that the movie ended on a bad note. I just had to see the new film.

It also has a great plot.  There are a lot to look forward to.  This is the kind of movie that can change your life.   This movie is an excellent horror movie.  There are a few twists to this story that will keep you guessing.  I recommend this movie to everyone.

The only characters who spoke were a couple who didn't talk. It made me feel sorry for the guy who had to talk. I was not impressed by the movie. It had poor acting, the plot was terrible, and the plot holes were so big that they looked like holes in a windshield.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________.  This movie was a huge disappointment. This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen.  in the beginning, this movie starts off so well. It starts off with some great character development and some great scenes. We have our main character, Ben (the main character), who is a young boy who is trying to survive in a harsh world. He wants to learn how to survive and do things his own way. His momma (the mother) is also a character who teaches him how to be a better person and how to get by in this world. They both have their own problems, but they both try to learn to deal with those problems. But, after a while, the film just loses its steam. The plot is completely stupid. The characters all talk about how great it would be if they were in a world where everything was perfect and they could do anything they wanted. All of the characters get into some sort of conflict and then they get killed off, leaving us with a world of nothingness. It is one of those movies where it was just too much to take and I just got so bored with it. It seemed to take a lot of energy to get us through the movie and the ending just felt like an anticlimax. It was really disappointing because I really enjoyed the movie, but it was so bad that I just couldn't take it. The ending just made me feel like I just wasted my time watching this movie. I think I will never watch a movie as bad as this again. The movie ends on a really lame cliffhanger, so you have no idea what the next movie will be. It's not worth the watch at all. "The End"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you think that this movie is a bad one, then you should watch the first two movies instead of this one. The first two were much better. The second movie is very poorly made and the characters are extremely bland. There is no character development whatsoever. You will hate the character's as soon as you see them. I would give this movie a 1 star.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The movie has the perfect blend of action and comedy, but the movie lacks character and depth, it is just a lot of fun to watch a bunch of stupid assed bad guys fighting and blowing stuff up in a fantasy world." The movie has so many great things about it, but it doesn't have enough depth to make it a truly enjoyable movie. The action is awesome and fun to see, but at the same time, there's not enough depth, and the characters are too simplistic and stereotypical. The movie is so good because it has a unique fantasy setting, and it has great performances by the cast. It has a lot to offer and is worth a watch. I just wish the movie had more depth.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  My son loves this movie, but he only saw it once. He's a very good kid, so I'm sure he won't spoil this movie. He likes to watch all types of movies, and he's always had a passion for horror movies. He has seen many of these films before, but this was the first time he watched it with me. He really liked this movie too. He kept asking me if I saw it before. I told him yes, and I saw this movie before. He said that he liked it too. I don't think I have ever seen a movie with so many scary scenes. It's scary and funny at the same time. I love the way the main character goes into the house and looks around the house. I think this movie would be perfect for kids, and adults would enjoy it too! I would give this movie a 4 out of 5, because I think it's a good movie. I hope to see it again, but I will have to wait until he gets older. The movie: This movie has a story line about a young boy, named Willy, who gets stuck in a house and is being watched by a woman named "The Black Widow." Willy goes into a room and finds a mirror in a closet. He tries to open it, but it is locked. The Black Widow notices him looking at her and goes into her room. She puts a mirror behind her door and looks at him. He is able to see his reflection in the mirror. Willy sees the mirror and goes to go out of the room. He walks out and sees a man, who is dressed like a man in a dark suit, standing behind a man. He says, "What's the matter with you?" The man replies, "It's my reflection, Willy." He says to Willy that he's just a reflection of a man that he knows. Willie thinks that the man he knows is the man in the black suit. He starts to run, but the man stops him. The man says to him, "I know you're just a mirror, Willie, but don't you forget that." Will says, it's ok, but when he comes out of his room, he's not in a mirror anymore. He sees a woman, that looks exactly like the Black Widow. She says to her reflection, "Where did you go?" The woman replies, in a very loud voice
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just found out that this movie is based on a real person, and there's a lot of things wrong with it. First of all, there's no way the actress, Kelly Preston, can pull off the role of Miss Green. That part of her looks like she has the wrong proportions.  She had to put on a lot more weight than what it would be normal for a woman to have. Her legs are wide and wide, like an old man's. Her stomach was just huge. She looked fat. She didn't look like a real lady.    In fact, her personality didn't seem that bad either. She had a very high pitched voice. She's so sweet. The guy that played the owner of the hotel, the one with the big beard, was really creepy. He was so creepy that I wanted to throw him out of the room.  He was like a monster.  She was just so hot.  She has to put a lot on, but she looks good and is fun to watch.  I've heard that this film was a bit of a flop.  It made a lot, but was not very well received.  My rating is only 4 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is not funny, it is not interesting, it makes no sense, it has no emotional connection to the characters, it lacks depth, it just plain sucks.  But the movie is so bad that it is worth watching just to watch a bunch of morons do the same thing over and over again.  I'm not kidding, watch the first minute of the movie, watch as they shoot and kill one man, shoot and blow up a building, kill one more man, kill two more men, kill an entire platoon and watch as one guy shoots a gun into the air and the film is over.  The film is so awful that it makes me sick, but then I get to watch it again and it is so enjoyable I have to laugh at it.  It is a really, really terrible film and I would recommend it only to people who think they are smart enough to make a movie about the Vietnam War.  Also, there is a part where they are all in a room talking about how bad the movie sucks and they say "If we can make this bad, then we can do anything" as they make the movie even worse.  And they say this in a movie called The Great Zucchini Hunt.

The ending is not happy. The film is a big waste of time and money. I would recommend this movie to no one. The only reason to watch this movie is if you want to see a movie where all the people die. This will not make you laugh and you will never enjoy this film. It is not a good movie at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about the movie, so I'll just say that it's a typical film about a guy who gets a motorcycle stolen, and goes after the thief. It doesn't work, and it's just sort of there, with a bad attitude, as if the director was going to make a sequel to the motorcycle movie. The bike is a really cool one, and the thief is just sorta annoying. Then the film starts getting into some heavy religious stuff, and then it just sortof fizzles out. The director was a great artist, and I'd love to see a remake of this film, but I think it's been done already. It's not a good movie. ______________________________________________________  Good Movie or Bad Movie?

Why didn't they put more of the other characters in the film? The ending doesn't make sense at all. Would I recommend this film to a friend: No. It's a very good film but not worth the time.

It is a movie that seems to have no concept of time, of the past, of death.

The main character, William (the title character), has a strange relationship with the dead. His relationship with his father is very strange and he never even knows what he looks like. William is very odd. He is very old, and he is very lonely. He has an incredibly odd way of looking at people. He looks at people and he does not seem to see them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!The most annoying scene I ever saw in a movie: I had seen this movie twice and I was expecting something completely different, because of the name, but unfortunately this is not what I thought I was watching.The plot is the usual formula of "everybody is evil", "bad guys want to conquer the world", "people have to fight evil", and finally "nobody can do anything", but the ending of the movie makes it a lot more boring. The movie had a great plot and the fight scenes were really good, but the end of the film made it seem like the movie was made to make the audience hate the protagonist.I have seen a lot of bad movies, but this one was a real disappointment. I really loved the movie and I would love to see a sequel to this movie, because I really think that this movie could have been better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I didn't know how to feel about this movie because I didn't think it was bad. I was just confused as to what was going on. I saw this movie on Netflix, and I thought it was a really cool movie. I didn' like the acting, but the story wasn't bad. The movie has a very strange plot. You don't know what is going on, and you don't understand what is happening. I don't really understand why they are filming it, but it's supposed to be a documentary on the world of competitive bodybuilding. They have people competing against each other in different gyms, and the film shows people training. But, this is the worst thing about the movie. The way they are doing the shooting is really weird. They don't have a real camera, so they have to do a lot of tricks. The camera will move behind a person and go in front of them and they have actors who move in front and behind the camera. It's not good. The cinematography is really bad. And then they just show people doing all this stuff and you never know what's going on."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I just watched the first part of this movie and it made me feel as if I was back in college and my friends were still there. They all seemed very happy and in love with each other and I felt sad for them. When they were on the road in a van, I felt as if my life had just turned upside down. They were driving all over the place, looking for the perfect girl, but they could never find one. I wanted to cry every time they stopped. But I didn't because I knew that they were just going through a rough patch. So, my friends and I watched this movie because I was curious as to what this movie was all about.  The movie starts off with a group of college students traveling to a place called 'the world's most dangerous place'. The group is made up of the girls who all have one thing in common. They want to meet the guy that is so hot that they want to marry him. But he isn't who they think he is and when they find out about his past, they all become scared. This movie made me sad because I just thought that they would get over him eventually. And it was true. But they couldn't because of one thing that they never knew about him. He has a dark past.  and it got me even more sad. He just went to college because he thought it would be a good way to get away from his past. He thought that the world would accept him. That it would all be over soon. He had so much on his plate, but the world wasn't ready for him. So he gave up on his dream and moved back to his hometown. It was then that he met a girl who he fell in love. They started dating and it was love at first sight. But this movie made it so sad because he couldn't see how much she cared for him, so she started doing the same. She started taking care of his needs, and her love for him never wavered. The movie was very emotional for me because I didn' t know what happened to this guy. I thought that he would get out of his relationship and move on. He never had any money, and the people around him didn't seem to care. They treated him like he was a fool. And this is when it started to hurt him more. But at

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ So the movie started out as a story of a man trying to find his way in the world. The man has a daughter he is trying to raise. She has gone to live with her father in the town they used to live in when he was a child. The town is now full of the townies. The daughter is still trying to get on her feet and has a lot of problems. She also has a boyfriend that has a dark past. The movie ended with her getting drunk and getting raped. It was horrible and I felt so bad for her. I think I was watching this movie so I could learn how to get a girl to like me. I feel like I learned nothing from this movie. I hope this movie was filmed in the 80's. __________________________  Stars: John C.

I really think it could be made today. _________________________________  Starring: John Goodman, George C.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  I love bad movies and this one is not bad but a very, very, terrible movie.  "Battleship" is one of those films that was made in the 50s that everyone loved to watch, but nobody really knew why, it was like watching a movie that was being shown in theaters and people just thought it was a very entertaining film and they went along with it.  a few years later when it was shown on TV it became a hit and it went on to be one of the biggest hits of all time. the film was based on a book by John Milius (who is one the best directors of all times), and he wanted to make a movie about a group of men who are sailing across the Atlantic. the book and the film are very similar in many ways, the story is told in the style of a history film, and the cast are all extremely talented.  and of course the film is a disaster. the cast of the film (including the amazing Tom Hanks) are just too good to let their characters get ruined by the bad writing. they have fun in this film but there is no fun to be had at all in this movie. the acting is so bad it just makes the film seem like it's being directed by someone who doesn't know what to do with his actors. the directing is so poor it's unbelievable, the pacing is so slow it makes the movie seem like a piece of art that just needed to be viewed in slow motion to appreciate it's beauty. the script is also so bad that the movie feels like a work of art because it feels like it was made by an artist who had no clue what he was doing. the movie is not worth seeing, it's a terrible movie that is very difficult to watch. there are so many scenes where the movie doesn't work and it's like watching someone who just knows how to write bad dialogue. a great cast could have made this a great movie but they were too talented for this, and if they had been better, then this movie would have been amazing. if you like bad movies this is one for you, but you won't be happy if you have to sit through this movie with no laughs. it's not worth your time or money. i'd recommend that you don't see this movie at all. ,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I did not like the film. This is not a bad film, I enjoyed it a lot. However, I thought the film was a little boring. The film does not follow any of the main characters' actions, and it takes the audience a while to realize this. I think this is a little bit too slow for a story like this. The pacing is too slow and boring. There is no character development. I liked the characters of the film and I thought that the film made me want to watch the next film. I would recommend this film if you like a slow, dramatic story, or you are bored of the modern films. This film has a very good story. I was surprised that the director of the movie, I do not know his name, was not from the Czech Republic, as it is the only country that does not make a good movie. I enjoyed the film very much and I think that it will be interesting for the fans of a certain genre.

It is great for the entire family. My favorite part is the ending. The ending is so wonderful and I always think about that scene. I also loved that there is so much tension and it never gets too boring.

It's a good movie, but I don't like it. This film was so bad it's really difficult to review it. The actors have to be doing something wrong to be this awful. I'm sorry, but if you have to say that you're in a car with your friends, and then you drive into a field and everyone gets killed in a freak accident, then you might want to re-think that idea. The whole thing is just a bunch of horrible jokes. This movie would have been better if they had just made the whole thing a dream sequence. The thing is, I would've liked to have seen more of the movie, and more of its characters. This is one of the worst movies ever made, and I was hoping it was just bad. The first two acts are pretty good, but by the time they reach the end of the third act, I really wasn't interested in watching it anymore. This one will always stay in my mind as a terrible movie, so it's not a bad thing. It's just a bad film, and they just couldn't even do a decent job at it.

I have a feeling it was directed by a man with an eye for a pretty girl. Or maybe he just liked looking at pretty women. - The Daily Mail  - Huffington Post  Why didn't the director just hire a real bodyguard?  Oh, he must have had someone who was available. But that doesn't make the idea any better.  in "My bodyguard," I can't help but think of the two main characters as a man and a woman who are in a relationship. And the man is a douchebag. Not only does he treat his bodyguard badly, he seems to enjoy it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ This is a movie with some good acting but it doesn't make you laugh or cry or feel anything. The action scenes are boring and are made worse by the fact that they are so slow paced and so short that you just want to see the characters get into trouble. The acting in this movie is so bad and the acting style so stiff that it doesn´t help you feel anything, it makes it worse. The best thing about this movie, though, is that it is only about 5 hours long and the ending is so lame that it will leave you feeling like you should have seen it sooner. Don't bother watching this movie. I didn't enjoy it.   Don't waste your time watching this crap. It is only 3 hours long, and it's a bad, bad movie.   for more bad movies visit my page: http://www.filmehq.com/index.php?showtopic=179956
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ "I didn't like it." "I'm a big fan of this movie, but this one was terrible."  I was really hoping this movie would be something really good. And it was. The story was really interesting, and the action was great. The only problem I had was the script. I've seen many scripts and this was one of the most poorly written scripts I've ever seen. I can't believe how bad it was and how it was all just thrown together. The entire movie just seemed like it was done by one person, and he didn't really know what he was doing. I don't know if I've really seen a worse script. The director also was just a jerk. There was a really weird scene where he tried to tell his wife about the movie, and she kept changing the subject. Then he went off to do his own thing for a while, and then came back and started talking about how he loved this movie. But that was it. The acting was all pretty good, and it didn't seem like he was directing the movie. The writing was terrible, but it was great that he tried so hard to get his wife's opinion on the script and what she thought of it. I really thought it was a pretty good movie, with great action, but I just felt like the script was just way too bad. And then I saw the trailer and I realized that this is exactly what people were talking about when they said it was bad. I'm not sure what it is, but the trailer was horrible. I think if they were trying to show the action, they should have used some really good footage of real life movies, and not just a bunch of random shots.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! You will be a sad and lonely person after seeing this movie. You will see all of the wrong things and never learn anything about the world. You have no idea what life is about and what is right and what wrong. You see the world through the eyes of the poor people in this movie and see that they all have the same problems that you do. And if you are like me and have always wanted to see what life was like on the streets of a war torn country you would get a lot more than you bargained for. This movie was made for children. Not for grown ups. I don't even understand how this movie is rated a "B" at all. The movie has no violence, no sexual content, no profanity and not a single death. It's a horror movie for kids and adults and it's all a waste of time. Don't waste your time with this movie, it's a bad waste of your time and money.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________ __________________________________________ __________________________________________________________  The story of the movie is about a kid that was bullied, and in revenge the bullies killed his brother and his mom. He lives alone with his mother, and he's very lonely. He's always dreaming of having a girlfriend, and one day he comes home and finds his mother dead in the house. He then finds his brother, and finds out that he has a big, scary monster inside him. The movie is just a story of how he deals with that monster. It's just a good, little movie, and it's pretty funny. It has a lot of scenes of him talking to himself, and then when he gets a girlfriend it just gets really crazy. The guy that plays the monster is really good. He does a good job. It takes a while for the movie to get going, but then it gets good. The monster in this movie is so weird, but you'll never really know what he's thinking, because he's in a weird, dark room. It was pretty good, and I would recommend it to anyone who's a fan of monster movies.

They are rescued by a young woman and her husband, who bring them back to their home, where the mother tries to find a way to make the child stop being a monster, by having him watch a movie about a monster in a castle. The monster is a girl who has been turned into an ugly monster by her mother and who must get back her beautiful appearance. The film is very slow and the pace does not change until the end. There is no sense of humor in the movie, nor is there any sense of suspense. It is a boring, dull, and uninteresting film. It really has no redeeming value."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Don't make me laugh. I have been trying to watch this movie for over a month and I just can't. Not because it's bad, but I can't laugh. It's a pretty boring movie, but you have to give it a chance, especially if you don't want to see another lame, bad, over-the-top movie. I was actually kind of amused by the way this movie made me laugh and laugh at it. It was like a cross between a funny movie, a movie that makes you laugh, and a movie you want to laugh at. I also enjoyed watching a very angry woman take her frustrations out on her husband. It made me want to punch my husband in the face. It also made me enjoy watching the man who I don't know a lot about yell at his wife, which I thought was very funny. However, I think the worst part of this movie is that it's just a really boring and stupid movie. It just makes me want it to end. If I were a kid, I would have never watched this movie and I would probably have never gotten this movie. The characters were just so boring and they never got anything good to happen to them.

This movie is terrible, just so bad, I am just amazed at how bad this movie is. The characters are all horrible. You don't like these characters? Then you have a good thing to say. They are all awful and don't have any redeeming qualities whatsoever. The one thing that is good about this movie are the soundtrack. The movie is about a girl named Lisa and her family. It is based on a true story and it has a very interesting plot. The film is so bad it is actually funny. It also has a great soundtrack to it. You know that soundtrack when you go to the movies and you are just happy that the movie is over and you have been entertained by it? Well that is the soundtrack to this movie. The bad things about this film are that there is no sex in this movie and it is really stupid. The sex scenes are just stupid and don�t add anything to the movie. There are just a lot of characters in this film, it is just so over the top. It has no redeeming features whatsoever. If you like cheesy horror movies, then this is the movie for you. If not then just watch something else.

This movie is so poorly made, that I have to wonder if anyone in the casting department had even seen a western before. The movie has a really weird sense of humor. The characters are all completely stupid. The film is all about two brothers and their adventures through the woods. The script is so poor and poorly written that it makes the movie seem like a piece of crap. The acting is terrible as well. The whole movie is full of ridiculous dialogue, which makes it impossible to take seriously. The best part of the movie is the ending, which is so cheesy and pointless that it's amazing. The final scene where the boys say goodbye to their mother, and she goes to the devil is so bizarre that I can't even imagine the actor's thoughts when he wrote it. I guess the movie was intended for a teen audience, but the writing and acting make it clear that it was a poorly conceived and badly written film."

He just kept killing people and did not care. I wanted to kill this guy right then and there. The movie was just awful. And I have seen this movie sooo many times and it just gets worse every time.

I mean, why would they show that in the movie? How can you even do that in a movie? They could have just made it a normal movie, where the ending was not there. They could show it on TV or at a movie theater. It would have been better.  This is one of those movies that I wish I had never seen. I mean the ending of this movie is horrible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* This movie has some great moments. I do believe that they were supposed to be more. The acting, the cinematography, the music, and the overall design of the setting were all really beautiful. But, the movie has a lot of problems. The writing is very cliche. Most of the movie is just people talking about how they were there, how they got there, and what happened. There are no real moments that I remember from the movie. Also, the characters don't change at all. They are all the same old people, and don't even seem to have different backgrounds. And the action sequences were pretty boring. There were a few action scenes in this movie, but they were not really interesting. There is also a lot going on with a lot to say, but very little action. Also the ending was a bit anticlimactic, but that is not the fault of the film. ******** The movie was not bad, but the film has so many problems that it really does not matter.  I would say it is one of the better examples of a movie that has a good premise, and then goes in the opposite direction.   It is one thing to go from a movie with great cinematography and a very nice story to a movie where the story is very cliché.  The story is also not original. I have seen a lot worse movie that this, and this is not a movie I would recommend to a friend.  It does have a few moments where it is funny, but nothing really good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ I bought this movie on a whim and I loved it. But it is not an easy watch. The first half of the movie is the action and I really enjoyed it. The second half is when the plot starts to go downhill. I mean seriously? Where was the character development? How did they go from the good guys to the bad guys? Where are the villains? I mean you have a woman in a wheelchair who is trying to get to a city to see her husband and she ends up getting abducted. I did not care for her at all. She is a very weak character. The bad guys were pretty bad. But they were bad in the movie so it was ok. It wasn't like they had to be good for it to be an action movie. I really hope they are made into a TV series or a movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not a good movie, it's a bad one, a bad film, and a really bad film. I have seen worse, and much better movies, and that's not what I'm getting here. It's just plain old bad. The story, while not as well written as some of the other films in the series, does have its moments of quality. It doesn't come together, it doesn't make sense, it tries to do too much and it doesn and it can't, and when it's trying to be a story about the struggle for survival in the woods, it ends up being a really generic, pointless and boring movie.  The acting, as always, is bad, and this time around it's really bad, especially from the main character, who's trying really hard to be good but comes off as very unlikable.  It doesn't help that he seems to be completely out of his depth, and at times, seems to have no idea what he's talking about. The special effects are also a complete mess. The trees are all way out of proportion and the CGI just doesn't work, even the effects of the wolves are completely fake and the effects they use are really bad. I don't know what's worse, the CGI or the actors, but the CGI and the acting don't make up for it.  This film is only a disaster and a disappointment and the only reason it has any legs is because of the fans.  The only redeeming quality of this movie is the fact that I enjoyed watching it, and I'm sure I will again when the movie is released on DVD.  I just hope it gets better as the years go on.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! I've never seen a movie so bad and so boring as this one. The story is so bad, it makes no sense at all. The plot, the characters, the dialogue and even the plot itself is so weak, that it makes you think that you are watching a bad drama. I mean, what's the point in making a movie that doesn't make any sense at the very least? Well, let's just say that it is a really boring movie, that has no impact whatsoever on your life, your feelings and even your mind. This is what a bad film does, it puts you to sleep and makes you forget about everything else. This movie is a real brain-dead movie, you can't even understand what is going on, but you can still tell that it was made by some person who was so bored with his life that he just put on a movie. The only thing I found funny in this movie is the dialogue, since you can tell that the writers of this movie have no idea what they are talking about. In a nutshell, this movie just makes you want to watch it again. This bad movie will make you feel sad and sad at the same time, so you will watch it over and over again and then you will cry. In short, this is a bad, bad movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________.   It's hard to believe that this movie has already earned more than a few awards, and it's probably because it's such a weird, offbeat, and even a bit silly movie. This is the story of a very strange group of people who go out into the woods to make a living by chopping down trees and building houses out of them. They do this by using some kind of "bioluminescent" material, and in doing so, they create their own civilization out of nothing. In other words, they're aliens. In fact, one of the characters says, "We are aliens, you and I." There's a lot of jokes, some of them quite funny, and some of the actors are quite good. This film was not very well known until this year when it was released in theaters, and for some reason it didn't catch on. I'm not sure if this was due to the lack of hype for this film, or if it was just too strange for the general public. The film is about the crew that comes to make their living by taking down trees. They're quite skilled and have a certain respect for nature. One of them, Sam, goes out in the woods, finds some wood, and brings it back to his home. His wife, who is very concerned with the pollution from his business, thinks he's crazy, and when he finds out what his job is, he leaves. He goes out into a forest, where he finds a strange village, and he discovers that his wife is married to a man who owns a tree farm. She believes that his brother, who she doesn't know, killed her husband and stole his land. Sam and his wife then decide to leave the village, but not before Sam makes some strange discoveries that seem to connect him to the forest. The story isn't very interesting, but it has some great performances and some great scenes. I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, and I'm looking forward to seeing it again in a theater. I recommend this film for the characters and for the plot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Apr 18, 2017 1:19 PM by  The Last Of The Mohicans     It's a movie about a man who decides to run from the Civil War in the hopes that he will be able to escape to a new life. It's not a movie that tells you what the war was like, but it does tell you how people were. It also gives you a glimpse into the American experience and the people who were there.  The Last Of the Mohicans tells the story of how a man named Mohican (played by Robert Mitchum) decides to leave the Civil war behind in hopes of finding his true love. He does not know that he is the last Mohican, but he does not want to stay. The rest of the film follows his journey as he tries to get his life in order. The Last of the Mohican was written by Frank Capra, who directed the film.    "The Last of The Mohican" is a film that is incredibly well-acted and well-written. It is filled with some great performances, and it does a great job of telling the story without over-explaining the events of the war. The cast includes Robert Mitcham, Richard Burton, John Carradine, Edward G. Robinson, Richard Widmark, and George Raft. , a film about a soldier who escapes the Civil, is not for everyone. It tells the true story of a soldier from the South who was captured by the North and sent to a prison in the North. He was told that he could have his choice of serving in the Army, the Navy, or the Marines. However, he chose the Army. He wanted to escape from his family, but the Army said that his father and brother were in the war and would be killed. When he was asked what he wanted to do with his life, he answered that he wanted "to serve his country, and then go to heaven." It's a story that was told a million times, but was never told quite like it should have been. I really enjoyed this movie. It was not a perfect movie. There are a few problems that I have with it, but this is not a bad film. This is a great film that tells a story of survival. If you are looking for a story about what it's like to be a soldier, this is

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. It is not a movie with a good story, but a story with a bad plot. A story where the characters are not developed and the story itself is not interesting at all. The plot is so dull and predictable, you do not get the feeling of excitement and anticipation you would expect to have. The whole movie is so slow and boring. This movie is just an excuse for the director to do another bad action movie, but this time he is really making the movie seem very professional and professional at that. The action scenes are really bad. This is the kind of movie where the action is not just in the background but it is actually happening in the movie itself. This can not be done in any movie made by Hollywood nowadays. This was the director's second action movie and his first action movie was called "A Nightmare on Elm Street" so this is his best. I hope he gets a better movie than this one. This director just does not deserve to make any movies and this movie is really his second worst movie. This film is a total waste of your time. I would recommend that you do NOT waste your time and watch a good movie. You have been warned.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Room is a bad film.  It is not bad at all.   I just find it extremely contrived and boring.  This is not a good movie and I am not sure why someone would pay for it.  The movie has a couple of interesting ideas but is ruined by being completely incoherent.  It begins in a bar.  At the bar, a guy is talking with his girlfriend.  They have been dating for a while.  Their relationship has a lot of problems.  She doesn't like the fact that he has been cheating on her and it is making her crazy.  He also keeps trying to run away from her.  Now that he is in this bar, they are having a good time.  In the beginning of the movie, he tries to pick up a girl.  However, she doesn't want to go out with him and tells him she is going out with a guy who has a job.  Then he runs away again.  When he gets to the bar that he wanted to go to, he gets in a fight with another guy.  One of them punches him in the face and the other one gets stabbed.  While in the hospital, he finds out that the guy who stabbed him is the bartender and that the bartender had been trying to set him up.  But the bartender tells him that it was the other guy who got stabbed and not him.  So he decides to go back to the hotel.  Unfortunately, he realizes that the hotel room has a window that is open and the guy he stabbed is still in the room.  Luckily, the guy is okay.  Meanwhile, he calls his girlfriend and tells her that he stabbed his ex-girlfriend.  It seems that the girlfriend doesn't care and doesn't know what to think about it.   In the meantime, a couple is having a conversation and they talk about the bad things in the movie.  Eventually, the boyfriend gets angry and starts to throw things.  During the fight, the girlfriend gets stabbed and dies.  And then the boyfriend is killed.  Finally, the movie ends.  If you liked the movie and thought that it wasn't that bad, I would say that you should try to enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ This was my first foray into a franchise. I went in to the theater with my family, and the kids, and a few of my friends. We all enjoyed it. The story was interesting and kept me guessing, but it did take a while to get there. I know it's a very long movie, but we were getting bored with it, so I gave it another go with a few friends. I did enjoy it. We laughed at a lot of the jokes. I have to say that I am not a fan of the original movie, so this was good.  Did you notice the irony? "We are the survivors of the plague. We're all the same, we all had the same disease and we all have a problem. It's the same problem all over again, just in a different way."  I don't care how you spin it, the end of this movie was a let down. I was expecting a better movie than this, but this was just the opposite. It was a shame because I really wanted to see this movie. I've seen the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy. I even remember the trailer for the sequel. It looked good and it was a fun movie to watch. I just hope that this film is just the first in a trilogy. The movie was short and it felt like it was going to be a good one, but unfortunately it was not. I don't think it will be remembered as one of the best horror movies ever, but I will always remember the first movie.

I have seen many horrible movies that I can safely say I really liked. This one I just didn't. It had such poor acting, poor story, horrible editing and just a terrible plot. I think if you really want to get a horrible movie, go see it with your grandma, just watch the horrible movies together.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "If you think you've seen everything you can at the local theater this is not the movie for you. It's not even a good movie. It has a very flat cast that doesn't do much but talk. The plot is lame, it doesn't really have anything going on. It doesn't even have a climax. All that really matters is the characters and the love story that takes place between a father and his son. They're all basically one-dimensional stereotypes, and I have no sympathy for them." I don't know. Maybe I don' t know enough about this movie to give a good review. Maybe this is the kind of movie that can only be seen at the movies. I have never heard of this movie, but it's got to be on Netflix. If you want to see a movie where the actors aren't in a movie, see the old movies at the video store, but if you want a movie with good actors and a good plot, this is probably not for you.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________  What I didn't like:   - The story is so thin it's barely there.   The movie is about two friends, Alex and his girlfriend, Rachel. They have an argument one night and Alex is arrested. When he's out of jail, Alex's friend, Kevin, who is the prosecutor, tells Alex he will give him a break, but if Alex goes to a mental hospital, then he will go to jail again. Alex agrees, but then gets a call saying he has a hearing for a new judge. The lawyer tells Alex that he is not going to be in jail anymore and he is free to go. Alex and Rachel are shocked. Rachel is furious. The next day, Rachel asks Alex to pick her up from the school she is attending. Rachel gets into the car and Alex says "It's going to get better." The movie ends with Alex getting in a car and heading home.   a very annoying song:   in the movie, there's a very irritating song that plays over the movie. It's very bad, but I'll let you decide.     There are a lot of things I didn  what I didn'  like:  , the movie is sothin it's almost non-existent. The plot is so weak that I don't even know what it is about. The characters are so shallow that I couldn't care less about them. The movie is almost completely devoid of story. The only thing that made me feel like I was even watching a movie was the music, which is really annoying. I really hate this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________________  This movie had a lot of potential but they did a poor job of portraying its characters and plot. The acting was great in the first half, but the second half was really awful. I think the actors were in a bad mood and it was just a bad performance. The bad acting was what made me not want to watch it. The characters were terrible and none of them are likeable. The director, David Fincher, did a good job of filming, but they just weren't good actors. The whole movie was really dull and boring. The only redeeming part of this movie was the ending where you think you're going to see something good. But, it wasn't. It just seemed like a fake ending. The movie ended with the characters going into a dream where they were all looking at a piece of paper with "The Movie" written on it. But they don't know that it's a dream and they just keep on walking.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: **********This is the worst movie ever made and its a shame because the actors and the director could have done so much better. They did not know what they were doing at all and had no idea what to do with the story, the actors did not have any chemistry with each other and were not believable. The director is terrible at directing and the acting is horrible. The story was horrible and the whole movie was a bunch of lies and stupidity. I have never seen a movie with this many lies in it before. The actors were stupid and did not care about the story they were just trying to look as if they cared about the character. The whole movie is just so bad. If you are interested in a bad film then this is a good movie for you to watch but if you want a good story, and a good acting then this movie is for you. I would give this a 3 star but I would not recommend this to anyone.

I'm a huge sci-fi fan and this movie just does not give me any idea what the hell is going on. It's so confusing, the aliens are all different shapes and sizes, the whole thing is a giant mess. I don't understand a word of what they are saying, and there are so many things I want to see that don't make sense, like where the aliens came from or where they're going, I don' t know, it's just a giant confusing mess. The ending was terrible too, like the characters are just going to be sucked up into the stars, but then they don't. It was a terrible ending and I don';t know what to say about it, it just didn't make any sense at all. I'm going to put this one in the top 5 of all time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  © 2014, David Mackenzie  "This is not a good movie. I don't know why it is so good, but it is. I think it's one of the best films ever made, and if you haven't seen it you should." - Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times  About the film:  When the government's "War on Drugs" turns into a "War On Whites", the white supremacist Christian Identity Movement recruits a group of young men to infiltrate the drug trade, destroy black culture and eliminate the "niggers". The group is called the New Black Panthers. They believe they will succeed in their mission of eliminating all blacks from America. But one of their members, a young, idealistic cop named James Earl Jones, becomes suspicious when his friend dies from a heroin overdose. Jones tries to warn his superiors, but they ignore his concerns and are unprepared for the violent battle that follows.  The film was written and directed by Richard Donner (back then known as Richard Donkin) and features an impressive cast of supporting characters including Paul Giamatti, Samuel L. Jackson, and Tilda Swinton. The film was originally released in the U.S. in 1971. , The film opens in a desolate Los Angeles neighborhood where an African-American family is being evicted by their white landlord, and a black man is trying to protect them from the mob. Soon the mob has turned on the house and a shootout erupts, leaving three dead, including the black family's only son. The next morning, a white cop named Jones arrives to investigate, but he soon realizes that he is being framed for the murder. He begins a race against time to uncover the truth, while also battling the police, who have become corrupted by the power of the war on drugs. The movie is a dramatic and violent portrait of a small-town police force struggling to save themselves from the perils of a corrupt and violent criminal element.The movie was written by Richard P. Donner and directed under the supervision of Donner. The screenplay was written in 1969 and first drafted in 1967.

From the acting to the camera work to the acting and the cinematography. It all comes together perfectly to make a great film.  The film itself is a wonderful film. It doesn't feel like a Hollywood film. I don't think this movie should be called a movie. It is a great, beautiful film. There is just so much going on, that it feels like a movie you should see in a theater. There's something about the way it is shot, and the way the camera moves, that make it feel like you're watching a movie, instead of a movie that you're sitting in. The cinematography and editing is so smooth and beautiful, that you don't feel as if you're just watching a film. In fact, it almost seems like you are watching a painting or a painting that you can't see the actual paint. The way the film is shot is incredible. I loved every second of it. The story is beautiful, and so is the cinematographer, and I just loved every part of the movie. ...  . 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ I was really looking forward to this movie as it was a new one for me. I saw it on a friend's recommendation and was surprised when I saw a trailer and was not a fan of it. I watched the trailer and thought "this looks interesting" and then watched the movie. The first thing that stood out was the acting and I wasn't a fan at all. The character that was in the trailer looked really annoying and I thought the story was going to be a lot more interesting. The acting in this movie was very bad. The people in the movie were so bad. There were a few people that were good, but most of the people were not good. They had no charisma and no chemistry with each other. The director did not want to make the movie as good as he could and had a lot of scenes he thought he wanted to put in but didn't. There was a scene in the beginning of the movie where the main character is going through his stuff and all of his stuff is not in his house. The thing is, he just got the stuff and forgot to put it in the house. This is the kind of thing that would have made the movie better. It would have helped make the story better. I am sorry that I gave this movie a negative rating. The actors and actresses were all very bad in this film. They just made the worst of their characters.

This was a terrible movie and the only reason i gave it a 6 is because it is a movie about the future. It was a time capsule to what we could have done if we had the technology in our day.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ I really liked the movie, and I would have given it a high rating if it wasn't for the ending. I really wanted to love the movie. The story is great. I enjoyed the character of Mike, and the story was good. The ending was not great. There is no real conclusion. I didn't know what was going to happen after the end of the movie (I think I read somewhere that there is a sequel), and I was not happy with it. There was a lot of good, and it was great. If you liked the first one, I would say you should check this one out. If not, I really don't see a problem with the ending, because it really didn't need it. It's just bad. I wish the film was a little longer.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ _______________________________________________________ I would give this film no stars if I could. The acting was terrible. I was actually shocked at how bad the acting was. And I mean terrible. They actually didn't give a damn about what the characters were saying. The only actor who had any personality was the one who played the bad guy. I don't know how they can make a movie like this and not make it a complete mess. I have a hard time understanding why anyone would make this film. I can't think of anything positive to say about this movie. The ending is also a complete embarrassment. And all of the acting in this film is awful. The whole film is about the bad guys trying to get to the good guys. There are so many characters in this movie and not one of them has any personality. The actors even get caught in the middle of the fight and then end up laughing about it later. I am embarrassed for any movie director who would do this to a film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ How can a movie like this get a PG-13 rating? I don't even know why they did this. The movie has so many problems that I feel it's a terrible, horrible, terrible movie. I hate the fact that they made this PG-rated. There are so many terrible things about this movie, that it should never have gotten a PG rating. It's a total embarrassment to be rated PG-15 for a movie that's this bad. This movie is a disgrace. It is so much worse than the previous movies in the franchise. It has a terrible script, bad acting, and horrible special effects. This is the worst movie in the Transformers franchise. The only reason I gave this a good rating is because I loved the previous movie, but that movie wasn't nearly as bad as this one. I have never seen a movie with such awful acting, writing, and special effects, as this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Nov 17, 2017 10:58 PM  Share  Share  Share  Share on Tumblr  Email  After watching "The Shape of Water," I found myself wanting to see "Loving," the other film in which screenwriter and director Guillermo del Toro collaborated with "Mama" screenwriter del Toro. "The Devil's Backbone" director Sam Raimi also directed a film based on a novel by Del Toro, but it didn't get a wide release until a year after the "Del Toro" director's. "Mia Was Here" and "Hellboy" director Guertin Fernandez-Rejon also did work on "The Shaggy Dog" screenplay with del Toro and Raimis, as well as "Trolls" screenwriters Scott Alexander and Gary Goldman, and a couple of other "Mona Lisa"-style scripts. The "Hellraiser" director also wrote the "The Strain" screenplay, and that one went straight to TV. "We wanted to have a monster movie, a horror movie, and it was a good one. It was a very original idea," del Toro said of the "Strain" adaptation.  I was intrigued by the "Hell" franchise, and del Toro has always had a knack for combining horror, comedy and romance in a good film. "Hell Boy" is a comedy, and "The Haunted Mansion" was a horror film. I don't think it's necessarily a stretch to say "Pan's Labyrinth" is based on "Mamma Mia," and that "Crimson Peak" was an adaptation of a play by Del Torro, which was based on the Spanish novel "Por la muerte," or "Death in the Family." "Sicario" was another del Toro adaptation, and I was a bit surprised to learn he also directed the Mexican movie "L.A. Confidential." The filmmaker has also adapted a number of popular books, including "The Picture of Dorian Gray," which he also wrote.  and "Cobra." I asked him what he would say to people who think the "Maniac" filmmaker was a bad writer or that he's a slacker, or that a writer-director collaboration isn't good for a script. "It's just a different kind of writing. You don't get it right the first time
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ This movie is a bad piece of shit. It has all the worst elements of movies in the genre, it is very pretentious and does nothing original or original. This movie could be a good movie if it wasn't for the fact that the director is a moron. He was hired by a big studio to do a movie called "The Man With The Iron Fists" which was made in 1986. This guy was in his early 20s and did a bad job. It is a movie about a guy who is going to train his fists to the hilt and kill all the people who wronged him in his life. The movie is made up of 10-15 minutes of footage, and in each and every one of these minutes, the director takes an unnecessary shot of a guy being punched in the face. This made the movie extremely boring. And when the movie ends, all you feel is boredom and disappointment. The story of the movie is very lame and not a single thing is original. If you want to see a movie made in the 80s, this is the movie for you. But if you want a good piece of trash, this movie is not for you at all. The rating: 1/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ I was so excited to watch this movie because of all the great reviews and the great cast. The movie opened with a great score and then it quickly turned into a terrible movie. The story was just horrible. It was all about a guy who was in a coma who suddenly wakes up in a weird place. He then has to figure out where he is. The plot was so stupid and not at all interesting. It just seemed like a bad idea to make a movie about this guy who wakes up from a coma. He goes to a weird house that had weird things around it and then he finds out he is in a strange place. The guy is not even that smart. He gets confused trying to figure it all out. The only thing interesting was the guy's friend who is very stupid. He does not even know what he is doing. He also does not think he is stupid. I just did not like this movie at all. It is so bad. It did not deserve any stars. This movie was made for a laugh. This is a bad joke. If you do not laugh at this movie you are doing it wrong.

It's very similar to The Hunger Games, but it has a much more mature story. The story was a little slow at the beginning, but at the end, it was a very good story. It was well done and very interesting. The movie was very dark, but there was a lot of fun in it. The cast did a great job. The cinematography was very good. I would recommend this movie to all. I was able to finish it in one night. It is definitely a must see for any horror fan. I will definitely be watching this movie again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was a very poor film, I thought it was just a bad film, very bad film. There is no story, just the plot, with a big mistake in the beginning. I'm sorry but I don't believe that a man could make that mistake, I think that the director was trying to make a comedy, with the girl who is a crazy, and who is in a car crash. I don´t understand how a director can make a mistake like that. I liked the story but I didn´t like the characters, they were not well developed, they didn´ts know what was going on, but they could not do anything. The whole movie was a mistake. I thought that they made the wrong choice, but I guess that the movie is a good comedy, but not for me. I think it is not worth watching. I´m glad that you can buy it at Amazon, I would buy it if I could buy it, I was really interested in this movie. But, I don`t think that it is worth to watch. I liked this movie very much, I like the way it is made. I enjoyed it, but the story is not well made, the movie made me laugh, I liked that they were making the movie in a different way, I hope that the next one will be better. I was laughing at the first movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!!!!! - February 6, 2009An Unexpected Disappointment  Reviewer: kimberly - favorite favorite favorite - February 1, 2009  Subject: Very Nice Movie, but... The first time I watched this I thought it was a very bad film. The plot, and the way it is presented by the film maker is horrible. I was just a kid and had not yet seen a lot of bad movies and so I thought the movie was pretty bad. I saw it again this time in high school and it was much better. The acting was much nicer and the music was very good. The only problem with the film is that the director was a woman and it seems that the film was made to appeal to women. I have to say that I think the film had a lot to do with the fact that this was directed by a woman. I think that was probably because there were many of these movies that were made by men in the 70's and 80's. I am not saying that this is a bad film but it is just not very good at all. - February 25, 2008Very Nice Movie  Rated 5 out of 5 by T.C.B. from Best of the 1970's! This film is a gem and the director is an outstanding choice. The cast is superb. The music is excellent. This film has a wonderful quality of acting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ I saw this movie at a midnight showing in a theater with a couple of friends. I'd never heard of this movie before and was curious to see it. The film begins with the narrator telling us that he has a strange fascination with the dark and he has never liked any movie before. The first thing that hit me was the fact that the camera does not zoom in or out, instead it moves slowly up and down. The sound effects are very subdued, and the soundtrack is very subtle. The story is told by the narrator through the eyes of the protagonist, an older man, and he is telling us a story about a young woman who he believes is a witch and who has been murdering people. At the beginning of the film, the camera is not only moving slowly up-and-down, but it is also not even moving at all. It moves like a man is walking on a beach and slowly swimming in it. At times, the film is more disturbing than disturbing, but there are some scenes that are so disturbing that I felt like screaming. The only thing that saved this film from being considered a horror movie is the fact it has a lot of suspense. I'm not a big fan of suspense films but I thought this was very well put together. The whole film feels very slow and it doesn't even look like a horror film at first. It's more like a movie where you are on a long beach holiday. It looks like it was shot on location, and it has some nice shots of the ocean. I don't really know how the story was told, but I believe the movie was actually shot in England. The opening sequence with the woman and the dead body was a little disturbing and I had to keep turning the lights off. I also had to look up and see if there were any other people around. The other thing that was kind of disturbing was the music. The music was very low and it really didn't sound like a real movie. It seemed like a documentary, and I think this movie would be good for kids because the story is actually kind of silly. The movie ends with a pretty nice little sequence where the narrator is talking about his experiences on the beach and the fact he has been thinking about this woman for a long time. This movie had me intrigued but it wasn't really scary. I really liked the ending and the ending was a lot better than the opening sequence. The characters and their dialogue were a little too serious but it was
Write a negative review about a bad movie: .    . .  A movie with a title like that? This is an actual film that came out in 2012. And it looks like it was shot in one go in a few days. And this was supposed to be the story of a girl who was raped by her brother and her father, and she was just too dumb to even recognize what was happening to her. And that's how the film was supposed the tell the story. But this is actually an anti-rape documentary. It tells the story from the point of view of the victim. And the film ends up giving a very false impression of the actual story of the rape, because it was edited in such a way that the victim actually blames herself for what happened to her and she ends up blaming herself for her own rape. And in the end, she gets to go to a police station and tell the police what happened. And they don't believe her, because she didn't have a boyfriend when the rape happened. So she has to live with the rape for the rest of her life, and they try to make her life even more miserable by having her boyfriend beat her up and do horrible things to her when she wants to get out of the house. And she tries to commit suicide because she just can't deal with it anymore. And after she kills herself, she has this nightmare about her brother raping her, and this dream just never stops, and the dream never goes away. And then she comes back to life and the next morning she wakes up in the hospital with the police telling her that she was raped and she needs to tell them what happened and they can help her. So here is the problem. This is a story about a girl whose life was ruined by a rapist, and it doesn't give a damn about her. It makes her a victim, and then it makes her blame herself for the rape and the whole thing. And what is worse, this film actually encourages rape, since the girl ends up having to explain her rape to the police, and even she ends in blaming herself. And I think that this is a very very very bad thing for a film to do. The film also has some horrible acting. In this film, the actress that plays the girl in the film is just not very good. She's too dumb. She keeps making these mistakes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* I had never seen a movie where the female lead was a complete and utter bitch. I have to say that there was no way that I could have liked this movie. This movie is full of stereotypes and one of them is the females. I mean the female characters are so unlikable. I can not stand any of them. The male lead is a good guy but he is just a male chauvinist who likes to have sex with the female heroine. The women are so annoying that they don't have a personality. They are just a bunch of stereotypes. When I was reading the script I was trying to remember all the things I have seen in other movies and I was sure that I have never seen that before. I was surprised that I liked the movie. The music was good and the movie was entertaining. The only thing that I didn't like was that the actress that played the role of the female protagonist was so pretty and beautiful that it was almost disgusting. I think that the film was too long and boring.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What? This movie is a terrible disappointment, and not just because of the bad acting. This movie has the worst acting of all time. It's a bad film from start to finish, and it never gets better. The acting is terrible, and the only thing I can say about the acting is that it's not good. I had a hard time watching this movie because of how bad it was. The only thing that I really liked about this movie is that I have never seen the original movie, so I thought I would see it if the remake was good. The remake was terrible, but it wasn't as bad as this movie. The plot was completely different, and I don't know why anyone would watch this movie for the plot. It was so bad, and even though it has some decent acting, I don' like how the whole movie is about one girl's feelings about her ex-boyfriend. It just makes me sick. I hope that the remake is good because I would watch it if they did. This is one of the worst movies I've seen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What a bad film this is. This is what I can only describe as a big pile of shit. I don't know how to rate this, because the quality of the movie is completely lacking. It is a very amateur production, and it shows. I would say it is a poor film, and the actors are all terrible. The director, Jeff Davis, and his team should be ashamed of themselves for wasting money on this movie. It's just one big, amateur movie, which is really a pity. I guess we should be glad that a few of the stars on the poster are real stars, like Peter Falk, Steve Carell, and Tom Cruise. The movie takes place in the early 90s, and all of the scenes in this movie are filmed with an old black and white camera. The film is very poor quality, and when the director tries to get some old footage from a documentary, it is awful. The actors are terrible, and don't even try to act. The script is not very good either. This movie is a complete waste of money, and I hope you can't find the money for this movie either. Don't waste your time with this movie!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I was very much looking forward to seeing this film because of my love of horror movies and because I'm a fan of the director, John Carpenter. The film was a little disappointing, although I was surprised when I saw that it was the sequel to the film I liked, Halloween. That film was actually a great horror film and I'm glad that I was able to see it. I can say that this film has a lot of potential. I would have liked to have seen a little more gore and a little less suspense, but I'm not sure how much of that is Carpenter's fault. He didn't seem to be in a hurry to get to the horror. I will admit that I'm somewhat of a fanboy when it comes to horror and I don't usually like sequels to movies that I enjoyed. I liked the first one and I like Carpenter's style, but this was a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie starts with the title, "It's a Wonderful Life". That is a nice and catchy title. But I must admit, I don't think it was the right choice of title. I know the movie is about a very nice couple (Mr. and Mrs. Henry). However, the movie fails on so many levels. It was very poorly written, and it is very hard to understand what the heck is going on. The movie has the most awful acting. You will watch this movie with your ears. I can't tell you how many times I wanted to turn the sound down and have the actors talk, but I could not. I have never seen so many actors fail to give a believable performance as this one. In my opinion, this movie is an embarrassment to the movie industry. If you are in any way, shape or form interested in this movie, don't watch it. Just leave it alone and watch another movie. This movie is like a terrible, bad version of "It". This movie has nothing to do with the book. It is a terrible waste of your time. I hope the film producers have learned from this mistake.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ _____________ ____________.  What is it about a good movie that you just cannot get enough of it? I loved The Last Samurai. I just couldn't get enough. The cast is just spectacular and the film does not waste a minute. The film is the classic samurai story of revenge and redemption and the movie does a very good job of telling that story. The characters are so well developed that it is almost impossible not to like any of them. In a way, I love that it takes place in a period that is as much a part of American history as it is Japanese. There are some really interesting twists and turns throughout the film. I especially liked the movie's ending which makes you think about what you are doing and who you are fighting for. The only downside I found with the movie was the fact that the ending was so rushed and not very exciting. Also, I felt like I was cheated out of the action in the movie because there wasn't enough of that to go around. However, it is still one of my favorite movies and I hope that there is more to come.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!I was really excited about this movie when it came out and was expecting a great comedy, but what I got was a horror movie. The characters are not funny at all and the movie never seems to be in any sort of logical plot, I can only think this was to show how bad the writing was and I would like to see a movie with good writing like this. The acting in this movie is also terrible and the character of the guy that is in the film is really annoying and I don't understand why the director and writers of this movie chose him as the main character. The only thing I can think of is the director thought that if he could get a good laugh out of the character then he could save the movie.I would not recommend this movie to anyone because it is so bad and not funny.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from Don't waste your money, you'll never laugh The movie starts out well enough. The main character is an ex-con and a woman who is trying to get him to help her. We get to see his ex-wife who is going to the same meeting. The guy is really funny in this one. We see him being an alcoholic, and we also see the woman going to a meeting with her friends, and the guy shows up to her apartment and tells her he knows where her friends are going. The girl tells him he can't do this because it will get them in trouble. The next day he shows up at her apartment to find out that she has a new boyfriend and a new place to live. The ex-girlfriend tells the guy not to tell her anything because she will leave him. This guy is then put in a bad situation and he ends up beating her up. The man then goes home and finds out he can get the girl to leave her new boyfriend by killing her. I did not like this one at all. I think the main reason I didn't like this was because the main guy was just not funny and his character was just flat. , 1 hr. 23 min.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it is a "classic", a bad, old movie, but it is not a good one. It is about a group of people who decide to get married on a Saturday night in a small village. They meet a girl at the bar, who has an enormous rack, and she has a big cock. The group of guys, who are the most beautiful people on the planet, get naked, and take turns fucking the girl. They all have a great time, until they get to her house. They see her big tits, and decide that it would be too much fun to have a blowjob. They decide to do it in her bathroom, but when she comes out to give them the blowjob, they decide that the best way to get her to have sex with them is to rape her. They do. They fuck her in her ass and then in her pussy. It's a terrible film, and I would only watch it if I really wanted to see a bad fucking movie.

The music was really great. The soundtrack was amazing. I was hooked. I have no problems with the acting, or the acting style. The movie was perfect. I recommend this movie to anyone. I give it a B+

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________ _________ This movie is just bad. This is a bad excuse for a movie, just bad story and bad acting. The movie is about two girls and they are friends. I can tell by the first scene that the two girls are going to get married. They are at a dance and are trying to make up and dance. They have a little girl and this is the only one they have, they just got this one. They dance and do their thing and the girl's dance gets a little more sexy. I am not a huge fan of this movie but I will give it a watch just to see how the characters are. This movie looks so horrible.

If you think about it, this is a movie based on a cartoon. What the cartoon was based on is a character called Kama. Kama is a cartoon of a woman, which in the beginning, is trying to have fun with a friend, but then she changes into a man and kills her friend. That's all. The whole movie is a joke. The only thing funny is that they are showing the same scene with the cartoon and Kama in the same way. (1/5)  "Fist of a Lover" – This movie has some interesting aspects to it. For instance, one of the characters in this movie was supposed to be a terrorist, but the guy who played him is actually a hero. The movie starts with a bunch of terrorists who are going to do some sort of bombing. They are all trying to get away from their respective people, but they are caught in the blast. The guy who plays one of them is a really good actor. He doesn't look like a terrorist and he's quite a nice guy. His name is Ahmed Ghobadi, and the movie is actually about his life in Iran. The film is also full of jokes, so if you are into that sort of thing, then you might like this movie. 1.5 out of 5. The best part about this movie is that the terrorists are all named after popular characters from popular television shows and movies. This is why there is a lot of overlap between the terrorists in this film
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  You may have read the review and thought "That's bad" or "It's bad that it has a female lead". But then you will notice that the film is a very poor film and has a very bad plot. The plot revolves around the film star who is in a relationship with the guy she loves but who is also a rapist and a drug addict. The story is about her and the guy in love. But the film has no plot and a story that is not important at all. The only thing I liked about the film was the ending which was very sad but the ending was not the best. I am glad I watched this film but I hope that a better script and a better plot come out of this film.  Did you enjoy this review?

Write a negative review about a bad movie: rror:      "The Revenant" is a brutal, beautiful movie. It is a film that has had to fight hard to get to the screen. It has been attacked for its violence, for its sexualized depiction of women, and for its portrayal of Native American culture. It's the kind of movie that gets its critics riled up.  But the movie has the right to exist. It shouldn't be demonized for its treatment of women. It should be praised for its courage in telling a story about survival in the face of extreme conditions. It was made for a wide audience and it is a movie that will stand the test of time. It deserves to be seen by more people. It shows what it's like to survive in the wilderness, and how it is important to take care of your family. It also gives the audience a sense of how hard life is to survive on a reservation in the American West.  to survive."  The Revengers: Revenant, from director Alejandro G.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie was a great first time horror movie, but it was only a half-assed attempt to be scary, because all the characters were so lame. I don't want to be rude, but you can't make a good horror movie if you don't have the main character in it. And they are all lame. There's the guy who is always hungry, there's the girl who wants to get married, there is the guy that is always in the dark, there are the two kids that were scared by a monster that just walks around, and then there's that one dude that goes crazy because he thinks he's dead, and he starts killing people. The story has no depth, the acting is awful, and the gore is terrible. I'm going to give it an R, because if it had just been a bad horror movie with an all-around awful plot, then it would have been okay. But since they didn't do anything new, they didn' add anything to the genre. But if you like cheesy horror, then this movie is worth a watch. I wish I had watched it sooner. I know it sounds silly, but that's the only reason I kept watching it.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  "My mom is my everything"  If this movie was good, then my mom would be the star of it! She played the daughter of a wealthy man who just can't get enough of her. She tries to make him happy by giving him presents, and he always seems happy. She's so beautiful and smart, and it turns out that her father is so rich he is able to buy her all of his friends and admirers. She loves it. So we go to the party, and her friend is there. It turns out to be a hooker and he has a very bad attitude. I had no idea the hooker would be so ugly. I would have never known!  The hooker is also one of the main characters, and I had never seen her before in my life. She is very beautiful and her boyfriend is one of my favorite characters. I really thought I was watching a gay movie when I first saw it. I was so wrong.  Then, of course, I had to watch the rest of the movie. I don't want to spoil anything, but I did find out that the hookers in the movie are not as they seem. They are not all hookers. Some of them have really nice faces. I guess this movie takes place in the 70's and they were all hooking for money.  the hooking scene: _____________________________  In the end of the film, the hook and the hookee have sex. The hook is extremely happy about the sex and the woman is totally shocked. I wasn't even surprised. . , I didn't know that sex with a hook was so hot, but it was. _____________________________________________ The movie didn't really make sense. There were a few parts where I thought it was about hookers and their sex lives, but the hook wasn't the main character, but a supporting character. The whole movie made no sense.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ I've never seen this movie before, but the trailer seems to be a very accurate description of the movie. The movie opens with a group of people playing cards. A little boy with an eyepatch comes into the game. The game starts and he starts laughing and throwing his cards. The guy with the glasses calls out to the boy. The boy starts crying and tries to leave the game, but a guy hits him in the back of the head. The next thing the boy remembers is waking up in a room with his father. They are in the basement and the boy's father has a gun in his hand. They argue about whether or not to kill the boy and the dad gets out a knife and kills the boy with a knife. The father then walks to a gun and shoots the guy in the chest. The film ends with the father standing on the stairs with a gun pointing at the camera. The final scene is the dad sitting in the kitchen with the body of the boy in his lap. The only thing I found annoying was the fact that he kept repeating "I love you", over and over again.   I was very interested in this movie, and the story seemed interesting. However, the movie was just so slow and boring. I was actually bored the whole time I watched it. The acting was awful and I couldn't stand the acting. The character was supposed to be funny, but it was very boring and there was no jokes at all. The ending was just too much for me to take. I didn't even enjoy watching it. I feel like I'm watching a terrible movie. It was just not worth watching. The music was okay, but there was nothing that made me laugh.  - Rating: 1/10  Helpful a movie is bad and it was. I just didn't enjoy this movie at all, and I really didn't want to watch it again. The plot was so boring and the characters were very boring. The writing was bad, and there were just so many inconsistencies with the story that made it really confusing. I don't know what to say about this movie. Maybe the director really did think this movie was really good, but I just found this movie really hard to take, and really hard not to give it an 8/10. I really want to see the movie again, and if the director wanted to make another movie with the same story, I would just watch the first one again.Overall,

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ I didn't want to be a writer for a long time. I had a lot of other writing to do. I was working for the Department of the Interior, which was in charge of land and mineral rights, and that involved a lot more writing than it might seem. It involved writing a bunch of reports and reports were pretty short, and a lot was in technical detail and that kind of stuff. When I did the research for the Interior Department's report on the Colorado River, that involved the science of hydrology and how the flow and sedimentation affected the ecosystem. It was a lot easier to do that than to write a book about it, so I just stuck with it. When the book came out, there were some critics who didn't like the way I had portrayed the Indians. But I think they had never really gotten around to seeing the movie. In the movie, you see a Native American with long hair and a little hat, and he's a big man and he has a big gun. But in the book he's much more in his element. And in the movie he's very polite and he wants to keep it that way, but in the real book, he's not very polite, and it's clear that he's going to shoot that little girl. There was a whole scene where he's talking to her and she's not listening. He says, "Let me talk to you, Miss Smith. I know you can hear me. I just want to talk to her. Please let me talk." And then he shoots her. That scene, which is very important to the movie and has a very important effect on the audience, doesn't happen in the film. But there was a scene in the novel, and I had to change it. But then I thought that I should take it a little bit further. So, I changed it to a scene where the Indian shoots her and then the Native American comes out of the forest and kills him. Then he says, the old Indian story, "If you kill a man, you can kill a thousand more." I felt that that was the only way that I could get around that part. And that kind a gave the movie some of the tension that was missing from the movie as it was made. And it worked, but I felt it wasn't quite right. I think the Indians in the script had a little more attitude and they had a certain attitude of fighting and being aggressive. So I

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  The worst part about the movie is the fact that it is so poorly written. I am going to call it a terrible movie because I feel that the writer is terrible. The story line and characters are so poorly developed that it's impossible to follow them. It's like they don't even care about the plot, the characters, or the story. The main character is the only character who gets anything that is remotely interesting and he has no reason to live. I think the story was so poorly told that it was almost as if the writer just put it together in the movie theater. I thought that the character of Charlie was a really stupid character and I hated him. I guess the writer thought that he was an interesting character because the character is so stupid that he can't figure out what to do with himself. The rest of the characters in the film are so stupid and stupid that I really can't take them seriously. I'm not sure what I will do with my life when I'm 70 years old. It really is a bad and boring movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  I'm really upset with this movie, and I was really upset at the time. I don't think that it's really a good movie, but it's just a really bad movie.   The main problem is that it is very badly shot, and the plot is just awful. It's a very slow build-up and it doesn't end until the end of the movie.  Also, the ending sucks! The girl and the boy go to a very nice place and there's an ending scene with a very pretty girl and a very handsome man and the ending is a really horrible ending!  It's just such a sad ending. I think that the producers and directors should have gone back to the original story and not try to make something out of nothing.  (view spoiler)  If I remember correctly, the girl and her friend go to this place, and they find out that the man that they were waiting for is not there. So the girl goes to the man, and it turns out that he has a very attractive woman and the man and woman get into a car, and that's it. I guess that's what they wanted the movie to be about. But, it's such a very bad movie and it's not very good at all. I thought that the boy would get a nice girlfriend, but that was not the case at all! The boy just goes off with this girl and this girl just likes him because she's beautiful. That's all! I'm sure that they should have just made a movie about that instead of trying to make a movie out of a completely wrong plot.  the girl is so unattractive that it just makes you laugh! (view Spoiler) I just can't believe that it was made to be a movie! I don�t think that there are any good movies like that. The ending is just a horrible ending, and really makes me wonder if the people who made this movie really knew what they were doing. I really want to know why the girl was such an unattractive girl. I just don't get it. It just doesn't seem to make any sense at all to me. If I had seen this movie when I was young, I would have hated it, and probably would have told everyone in my class to avoid this movie. I was very young when I saw this movie! (I was maybe 10 or 11 years old.) (I'm not sure if I would even
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's really not bad at all, but you should know that it was the first movie that I watched with the kids, and I was really scared of the monsters at the beginning, but they were just kids. The film was not that scary. I did have to remind myself that they were kids, because I was afraid that they would kill each other, but no one killed each other. And the film did not end, so I was not sure that I would see it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________.  The movie I saw is a comedy/horror with a lot of gore, nudity, and a great performance by the great Tommy Lee Jones. If you don't like the film, don't watch it. I'm just telling you, if you don,t like it then don't buy it. Also, I think you will be satisfied with what the movie has to offer. The acting is good and the gore is there. This is a good film that you can watch if you want a good laugh. I'd recommend it to all people, but you'll like it more if you are into gore.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ It's not a good movie, and that's exactly the point. This movie is a cheap knock off of the popular movie "Avengers", but instead of using their own characters, it uses actors who play the roles of the Avengers characters, but are nothing like them. This means the movie is very bland and repetitive. It is a bit hard to understand what the story is about, as it goes from one thing to the other, so that the movie never gets out of its rut. The movie has one good moment, but the rest of the time is just boring and uninspired. It was pretty hard to watch this movie, as there is nothing interesting about it. The only thing that makes it better is that it is a great example of why Marvel movies are good, but never good enough. They just make a movie and then they expect the audience to be too stupid to realize it. A bad movie like this can be great if it had a better story, or a better plot. This is a bad film that doesn't do anything interesting, and is just a bad excuse for a Marvel movie. It will get a laugh out of you, but it will leave you bored.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ * "The world of the story is so far removed from the world of reality. It's like you're in a movie that you've seen thousands of times." -C.L. Jackson (The Guardian) "A very bad movie. I just couldn't stand it. Not the acting, not the writing. The film had no direction. The whole thing was just confusing and I can't believe the movie made money. It was like they had a bad idea and it was a very stupid idea. There are better movies out there." -H.G. Wells (A.V. Club) "I'm a huge fan of David Fincher, but he has never done anything I've ever seen before. I really had no idea what the hell was going on until the end. It makes me so angry to watch this movie." -Christopher Meloni (Hollywood Life) * "What is the point of this movie? Why does it feel so long?" -Robert De Niro (The Daily Beast) "The most pointless, meaningless, tedious, boring, pointless movie I have ever seen." -Paul Dano (New York Daily News) * * * A film about a man who is able to create a whole universe just by thinking about it. The movie begins in a world where our sun is a red giant. The planet is uninhabited and there are no other lifeforms. All is in chaos and the only thing that exists is a man named David (Tim Robbins). He's the last remaining human who is left on Earth. As he travels through space, he begins to remember the world he used to live in, his family and his friends. The story of David and his struggle to regain his old life starts. The only problem is that David doesn't remember anything. In fact, he can't remember a thing. In the movie, David loses his memory and is forced to make new memories. His new memories include his childhood, his childhood memories, his memories of the other people on Earth, and his own memories. The problem with the movie is that none of these new memories make any sense. There's no explanation about the world they live in. There is no plot. There isn't even a character that is defined. The plot just gets in the way. David is able, by thought alone, to recreate a world that is very different from the one he lived in. And it all seems very pointless. It becomes clear

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  This was a terrible movie. I think the writer should be ashamed of himself. The characters were not real. They were all written as if they were from the same family. The main character had all the problems in the world and he just kept repeating "I am not a criminal" over and over. I can see how a guy like this might want to keep his family safe but the movie made it seem like he was a criminal. The other characters were just as bad. The one female character was a whore who kept getting caught having sex with another guy. The best part was when the cop found the guy with the dead woman. The guy was so stupid and stupid that he just said "I just wanted to see her body". He did not even ask if he was breaking the law. The movie did have a good ending. I will not be going to see this movie again.  Be sure to check out our reviews of the movies in the Movies section.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: **********  "This is the story of a young man who is about to get married. A friend of his is an ex-convict, who is an alcoholic. The young man has just gotten back from a business trip in India. He has been with his girlfriend and the two are driving home when they get into an accident. The girl's boyfriend gets out of the car and begins to beat up the driver. The man in the car is shot and killed. The guy in the passenger seat takes the gun and kills the boyfriend. The couple go back to his home. There he gets drunk, and the woman is raped. The next morning the guy wakes up and he is dead. The wife comes home and tells her husband that she is going to leave him. He gets very angry and tells the woman to get a gun. He says that he's going to kill her, so she does. The woman shoots him twice and he goes into shock. The husband leaves the house and goes to the hospital where the woman tells him what happened. The police arrive and arrest the wife. The prosecutor calls a grand jury to indict her for murder. The jury of five men and five women find her not guilty of murder. But the judge decides that she must stand trial for rape. The case goes to trial. On the stand the woman denies having had sex with the man in question. The defense lawyer says that she had sex, but the man wasn't ready for it. The judge finds her guilty and sentences her to life in prison."  I never read anything like this before and the plot is very exciting. Unfortunately, the film is very hard to watch. It was a very long trial (over a year), and they had to show the whole thing again and again, so that the jury had an opportunity to re-examine every fact. There is no real development of the story, and most of the scenes are really boring. I found the film very difficult to watch, and even if it was a real crime story, it just didn't make sense. It doesn't matter if you were a criminal or not. A real crime scene is never that interesting, because it doesn't have a clear cause and effect. It's always a mixture of the two. I can understand the desire to make the movie look exciting and dramatic. But it didn't work.  In the end, the judge decided that the crime wasn't committed by the woman. The reason
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I have ever seen. It was terrible, bad. The plot is awful, I couldn't believe that this is an old movie. I mean, I knew it was old, but still. The only good thing was the performance of Robert Duvall and the beautiful film by Anthony Mann, I didn't know this movie would be this bad, I don't like horror at all, but I'm glad it is bad. I hope people will realize that this movie isn't about a guy who tries to find his girlfriend, it's a movie about a girl who gets lost in a hotel, she gets trapped, her family don't know what to do. The movie was a big success at the box office, I guess because of the great movie star.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would rather watch a good movie than a bad one.  If you don't like the movie, that's OK, it's not like the film has any good parts to it.  I've seen a few bad movies in my life and I still can't stand them.  The only thing that made me laugh was the "The"s (Cobain's) voice.  They used to always say "The, the, the" instead of "The."  This is what happens when you are on tour and you want to look cool but the local club is too loud for you.  "The"... I'm not sure how I feel about this one.    "Dumb and Dumber To" was a huge success.    There are a few problems with this movie that have to do with the director.  One of them is that there is so much going on.  What happens is that George (Steve Martin) has gone insane and started to think that everyone hates him.  He even starts to think he's the only one who hates him, and he is not the only person.  When he tries to get the police to come to his aid, the police officer is afraid of being killed.  In a scene that is so bizarre it's funny, George tries to pull out his gun.  Then he realizes that it doesn't work because it's loaded.  It turns out that the gun is a replica of his friend's gun. The real gun had been stolen, but the replica has been made in a gun factory and the trigger is made of plastic.  George then gets into a fight with a woman and his wife who then try to leave.  Unfortunately, George doesn't see them. He gets in a fight over a box of chicken legs that his wife bought for him.   That's not the most exciting part of the movie.  This has a lot of things going on and it is very confusing.  At one point, George thinks that his friend is in the bathroom and he runs in to get his gun, but his friend doesn't appear.  Also, George has a gun that is a replicas of his own gun and a replica gun that he had bought in a shop.  There is a great scene where George tries his hand at being a detective.  Here he finds a murder victim.  His first thought is that it is his friend, but then he
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What a bad film this is! The actors are bad, the story is bad, and the directing is terrible. This movie was made in the late 50s and early 60s. This is a time when there was a lot of bad films. I saw a lot more bad films in the 50s than in the 70s. I have seen this film many times over and each time I have left very disappointed. It is a complete waste of time and I would not waste my time on this movie at all. I am sure that I will have a lot better memories from watching other films.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. I watched this movie on my honeymoon and we all had a good time. But this movie left me feeling like I had been raped. It starts out okay, but the movie goes downhill from there. The main characters are really not very likable and they seem really uncomfortable in this situation. I was really confused because I didn't understand why they did what they did to the man. He was trying to protect his family and they just completely betrayed him. The sex was also really awkward. I think it is more of a fantasy movie than anything else. But I was kind of confused by how it ends. Maybe it's because I never saw the movie and I am reading this review. But after the movie ended I just wanted to go back to my room and masturbate until I fell asleep. I wish that the director would have let me finish the movie, but I know that he is a good director and he probably didn't want to make a bad film. So, for what it's worth, I really thought that this was a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________   The main thing that's wrong about this movie is that it's not funny. There's no humor to be found in this movie. It's just another boring, unoriginal, uninspired and boring movie. I found it very unoriginal. It doesn't even try to be funny. The movie doesn't try to tell a good story. It has a plot, but it's just a stupid plot.   There is a really cool scene in this film that shows how a couple of people can overcome some really hard things in their lives. They do this by making themselves better people. They take some steps in their life that aren't the best, but they still make their lives better. They find out they don't need to hide from their problems. They just have to be themselves. They show their true selves. This is what a hero should do. This scene is really important in the movie. There are some scenes that could've been even better.  , but the movie just doesn't know what it wants to be. It wants to have a good ending and it tries, but that's all it does. I've seen worse movies, but this one has some great things about it, but you can't even call it a movie. The director should've done better than he did. He tries to do a lot, but he doesn't make any great steps. There is one great scene in the film, but again, it's all in the wrong place. It shows a couple having a great conversation and then the movie shows it. It ends up being a good scene, but in the whole movie, there are only a few great scenes. The rest of the movie is just average.   is a pretty good movie. You can't really find a good reason to not like it. The acting is pretty good, the story is interesting and there's a cool ending. I can't think of anything bad about it. I recommend this movie if you want to see a good and interesting movie. But if you don't, just skip it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ _______________  _______________ __________  In a nutshell: ____________________________________________  I had heard of this movie before and figured I could check it out. I'm not a big sci-fi fan so I didn't expect much. What I did expect was to be confused and annoyed by the lack of information in the beginning and the lack thereof in the second half of the movie. I also thought it was an overly dramatic depiction of a movie with a good ending. But in all fairness, I was only there for a few minutes of the first half and didn't see much of the second. I think the second is where it's at. If you want to see a movie that's entertaining, funny, and has a good plot, but also has a few flaws, this is a good one to check out. The cast is fantastic. I really liked the young actress in the lead role. The script is a little corny but still fun to watch. If there is a plot hole in this movie that you don't see, then you should probably check out the other movie it's based on, "The Day the Earth Stood Still." Overall, I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars.

I had to run out the door and get to the phone right away. I called my friend, who had been in the theater with me. He told me I was being blamed for the crash. The director had wanted a scene with the main character falling off a bridge, but my character was not supposed to fall off. I was the one who had fallen off the bridge and was being dragged along. I went back into the theater and saw the crash on the screen. The next day I was called in to work on another film. That was how it happened. I never got to work again. The people who had made the movie blamed me."
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ [This review was first published on April 15, 2015, by David A. Hart.]  A bad movie that is more of a bad-movie-movie than a bad film. This is a movie that I never wanted to see but was forced to by the title. The movie stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman and is a "romance" in the sense that the two are going on a cruise. They go on this cruise and are going to get married. One night, Cruise has sex with Kidman. Then, when he is supposed to be sleeping with Kidwoman, Cruise gets up, goes into a bathroom, gets a towel and goes back into bed with Kidgirl. Then Kidwoman wakes up and she thinks Cruise is still sleeping with her and they fight. Then Cruise wakes up, gets dressed, goes back to bed with her, but she wakes up again and she is not ready for sex yet. So Cruise gets dressed and goes to bed and they go on a sex cruise for six days. Then he gets back to her and has sex for a few minutes and then she wakes back up and they have sex again. So the movie continues like that for 6 more days. When they finally get to the island they get married, Cruise and Kidman then have a baby and Cruise dies. And then he comes back and the movie ends. But the movie has a message. The message is that Cruise and his ex-wife were in love and they loved each other and it was just a tragic accident that led to Cruise's death. I would never have watched this movie if I had seen it in a movie theater or in a theater that I knew would be showing it. This movie was terrible. It was a terrible movie. And I hated the two actors and their character. Tom Cruise is the most unpleasant and obnoxious movie star I have ever seen. The actor is so loud and obnoxious that he is an embarrassment to his acting. Tom can be annoying, but he does his best with Kidamangate and Cruise's ex- wife Nicole Kidamay is annoying, too. She is annoying. She can be irritating, but this movie does not even come close to redeeming her. I have not seen this movie for a long time and now that I have seen it again, I hate the movie. It is not funny, it is not romantic, and it is an obnoxious movie.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Dark Knight Returns was a film with a lot of promise. The movie is based on the classic graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller. It was set in the 70's and set in a Batman universe where Batman is the ultimate criminal and the cops are all crooks, cops are crooks and criminals are criminals. This is the story of the last days of Bruce Wayne before he is put on trial for the murder of his parents. Batman goes on a crime spree in the Gotham City to make his parents proud. The film was well made and had a lot going for it. It had the look of a great Batman movie. The acting was excellent. Michael Keaton, Christopher Walken, Michael Shannon and Adam West are among the most beloved Batman actors in history. The director Joel Schumacher was the guy who brought us such great films as Batman Forever, Batman & Robin, Batman Begins, Batman Forever Again and Batman & Dracula. The story was not bad, and the acting was top notch. I would give this a 3.5/5, if I could.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     _____________________________________________  So, I am in my mid twenties. I just got out of a relationship that was way too abusive. We had a lot of ups and downs and I feel like we had a great relationship, but we weren't compatible. We just weren't the same. We were both in our late twenties. The relationship started out great but then my ex started to act very abusive to me. I ended up getting into a lot more trouble because of it and I lost my job. I never said anything, but it was obvious to me that he was very angry. He would call me and make it clear that I needed to take responsibility for all the things that were happening and not blame him. He also had some serious issues with alcohol and we started to fight a lot. I had to take several trips to the hospital because of his violence and it got really bad. He was on the verge of losing his job because of the violence and he was going to lose his home. Eventually, he gave up and left me because of all the issues. I'm just trying to forget the whole thing. It was a really bad situation and I wish I had just told him to stop. He didn't even ask me to give him a chance and then he said he was never going to see me again. It's been almost two years and I'm still trying to move on with my life. I really hope that it won't happen to anyone else. I know it would be hard for anyone to deal with, but I really don't think it would work out well for me. If I ever do get back into a relationship again, I will tell him to leave me alone. It just isn't worth it. I wish he had just left me to get back to a healthy relationship and that I had gotten counseling or something, but he wouldn't listen. I don't even think he really cared about me that much and he got angry with me and left. I would hate for anyone else to go through what I did and I hate how he treated me. Please don't ever let a partner do that to you. He really messed me up and ruined my life, but most importantly, I just don't want anyone else going through what we did.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ I have seen this movie a few times, but not recently. It is about a man who finds his way to a strange house and is drawn into a life that is so bizarre that he cannot tell if he is really in it or if he has been imagining it. It has a very weird feel to it. The first half of the movie is kind of like a dream where the dreamer is wandering through a house, and then at the end he realizes that he is actually in the house. The plot was very strange. It seemed to me that the movie makers were trying to make a movie about the strange effects of a drug, but it is not an extremely good drug. This movie has a weird plot. The characters seem very real and realistic. I thought the acting was very good. The movie was about a guy who finds out that he has a twin brother. The brother is a really good actor. It was kind of weird that there was a woman who had no personality. The whole movie is very odd and strange. I recommend this movie.  Goodbye, Mr. White, Goodbye, Mr.... Mr.White is an odd movie. It starts off with a character named "Mr. White" who seems to be a very normal guy. He walks around the town and has a normal job. The film shows him walking in a normal manner and talking to people and doing normal things. The next scene we see a guy walk up to him and ask him if he's a white guy. It seems strange that a guy would ask a black guy what he looks like. Then the next scene shows him coming home from work. We see the two of them walking in front of a white house. Then they see a man driving a white car. Then he opens the door and a man walks in. We then see the white house with a woman in it. There is a girl in the front yard that the two men are going to spend the night with. When the two guys walk into the house the girl is walking out with her father. This girl was not in the movie and I have no idea who she was. The two guys get out of the car and walk in the door. The man is there and says "I'll take care of you guys tonight".

The movie is about a group of people who want to see a movie in a haunted house, but they are trapped in the haunted house and must find a way out. When they are going in, they see a man being murdered and they try to stop him, but their attempt to save the man is in vain because the killer is a woman who wants to make her lover come to her. It is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It makes me sick. The acting was bad. The plot was horrible. It was so bad that I do not know what they did to get it made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I'm a "regular" guy...  -I'm old enough to remember when the word "regular guy" didn't exist  (I'm also old enough when people like to tell me I was a "baby" in the 80's, and that's true, I was.)  So, to make my point, I'll say that it's not my fault I'm a regular guy...I was a baby when I was born and I had to fight for my life from a congenital malformation that would have killed me at birth. The doctors said they would do everything they could, but there was nothing they could do for me and I was diagnosed with brain damage.  It wasn't until after I left the hospital that I finally realized I wasn't a regular person, but a baby. A baby who was given life and had a chance at a normal life. A chance to learn how to walk and talk and have a family. And I have that chance, I have the opportunity to make a difference in the world. .
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ It is very clear to me that the film has been made to make a lot of money, and the studio is not interested in telling the truth. The plot is a complete lie, and most of the characters are the same. I would have preferred that the movie was a true story of a man who was falsely accused of raping a woman, and a young boy who was told that his sister had been raped and murdered by a gang of homosexuals. If the movie had made the story more realistic and less far-fetched, it would have been a better movie. I was glad to have seen the movie, but I can not recommend it to anybody. - July 11, 2008A Lie Too Big to Believe?
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________ This was a bad idea. I know this because I did it. I saw this movie at a screening of an original film called "The Art of War" and it was a fun film with a good story, but it didn't really have the guts to really try anything new with it. This was another example of how not to make a war movie. The story was boring and the movie was just a bunch of soldiers running around. I didn't think anything would come of this film, but then I saw the movie and it totally changed my mind. I like this movie and I'll probably watch it again, but this is not the film to go out and see.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Svetlana from Love the movie but the film is so bad, I am very sad. I love the movie, and I do not understand why this film is not considered good. It is a great film. I can understand why it was so bad. It's a film made in 1872 in Russia. The first time the movie has a good plot is when it starts. But then the movie goes in the wrong direction. The film is a story about a Russian General who had the chance to become king, but he did not want to become a king. He wanted to rule by the will of the people. This is why he started a civil war and he defeated the enemy of the country. So it's not the story of a young Russian General, but the story about him who has been forced to become King, because he did nothing but follow orders. I do think that the director made this film to make money, but at the same time I do understand why he made it. The acting was really good, the story was interesting, and it had a great soundtrack. .

For the most part, it was a positive, positive experience for viewers who tuned in to watch the show's newest season. In fact, the show has been trending at a high rate since its premiere.  That being said, there were a few moments in the show that were questionable and, in a few cases, downright upsetting. , the first of which was an interview with Miss Fame, who made the shocking revelation that she is a transgender woman. The show's host, RuPaul, seemed very understanding and understanding of the situation. The fact that RuPaul was able to interview the queens who were there to play the game of "Drag Race" rather than the queens that were there for the money shows how serious the issue of trans issues is becoming in our society. It is no longer a joke, it is real and we are living it. The queens of "Project Runway" may have been able to do their thing, but when the queens of reality TV are talking about transgender issues, it has to be something serious. . On top of that, it appears that there are a lot of queens that are ignorant about the issue and, as a result, the audience can easily see it. For example, the queens are talking a lot about how "there is no such thing as a transgender person" or how "you have to live your life and let the chips fall where they may".  In the first episode, Miss Fame and Pearl went on to say that they have "a lot of transgender friends". However, the fact that the queens aren't even aware of transgender issues and don't realize that they need to be aware of what is going on with trans issues in our world is shocking. The only other people who would be aware are the transgender individuals themselves, which they may not be. It seems that the transgender community is growing and it isn't going to take too much longer for the community to become an influential part of our society in a major way.  and Pearl, being the queens they are, are going to have to start talking about trans issues and how trans individuals are treated in the LGBT community.

The plot and the acting and the plot and acting and so on. The whole movie is a bit of a mess. The acting is a mess and the writing is a complete mess. It's all about the plot. I think they just got too caught up with the whole story they were telling. It was a pretty decent movie, but it just had too much story and not enough characters to really make it work. I was expecting a bit more from the story and characters. I just wish they could have found a way to make this movie better. I'm a bit disappointed. I could not give this movie a good review.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie is terrible, just horrible. I thought I would like this movie since I saw it on a video store in the early 80s, but I was so disappointed. I think the people who made this movie did a terrible job and it just isn't good. The acting was terrible. I was really disappointed with the acting in this movie. I mean, if you go to see a movie at a video shop and see the actors on video tapes, that's fine. It's just the same actors playing the same parts over and over. But if the movie is bad, I am not surprised, because the actors who played the roles are not the best in the business. I didn't think I was going to like this. I have seen movies where the actors are really good, but this movie just wasn't. The movie starts off with the same kind of opening credits as all the other movies from that time period. Then you hear a woman singing the song "Come and get some". You can't hear her voice, but it seems to be very pretty and it sounds very nice. Then the movie cuts to the movie and a man is dancing around in a nightclub with his hands in the air. This man is dressed in a white shirt with a red necktie and a blue suit. His head is covered by a big red hat with a white crown. He has a white beard and looks very sexy. This guy is called the Devil. He is also very beautiful. He takes his hat off and looks into the camera and says "Now, you see my devil-face? And you know that the devil is me?" He says "You know I am the devil." Then you see a beautiful woman, a blonde with long hair, sitting on a red velvet couch. She looks like a goddess. She has long white hair, white makeup and beautiful blue eyes. She dances in a circle on the couch and sings a beautiful song. Her song is called "I'll Get Your Baby Tonight". Then a man with red hair comes out of a car and walks toward the red-haired woman and he says "Hello, baby. I am Satan." He goes to the blonde woman and touches her breasts. He puts a ring on her finger. The blonde woman is very nervous and frightened. She says "Oh, my God, I'm so scared. I don't know what to do. Please don't let him touch me." The red-headed man says "
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!   This is a fun movie, but it's also a horrible movie. The acting is terrible and the acting is bad in every movie. I can't believe the actress playing the mother and her two daughters are supposed to be my mother and I's mother. The two of them should be the main characters, instead of a woman and a woman. The other acting that was done was horrible as well. I thought the whole thing was supposed to go something like this:   Mother: I don't want to go back to this place! It's not fair! We both have to live with them!   I: Oh! Yes, yes, yes! I see how it is! We are both in the same place, just different houses.   M: Why do you hate us?   S: I'm not hating you. I'm sorry!   a man named "Cain" (the one who got killed in the original movie) comes back from the dead and is very angry at his dead wife and kids, and he sets his sights on the house where the dead woman lives.   and of course the wife and daughter are dead, too.  - the only good thing about this movie was the opening sequence, where a little girl runs down a road to catch a train.  ...and the movie never really gets going. It's all very dull, boring, and depressing. There's nothing much going on, and the main character is just an annoying, useless, annoying, boring loser. The mother goes to a local hotel for a vacation, and comes back with a bunch of guys to watch some sports. And she tells them all the things that she wants to do with them, which she doesn't do at all. It was so depressing to watch. The only thing I really liked was the music, but then, the music was never good to begin with. It sounds like someone in a studio recording a terrible recording.   the acting in this movie is awful. The wife, the daughter, the son, and even the father, all seem very dull and uninteresting. They all act like they're in a bad, boring movie.....except for the father. He's a complete dick, and I couldn't help but like him. The rest of the characters were also very bland.  , the only thing that saved this movie for me was the ending. It really brought it home how pathetic this movie really

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ಡ <3  The story is the best part, the way the director put all the characters together. I loved the characters of all the main characters and I loved all the secondary characters too. ଠ_ᶜᶠᶦᶡ (a female character) and ૥_ᴍᴇᴄᴛᴀᴅᴡᴕᴜᴋ (a male character) made me like them even more. I can not wait for their movie to be released!  I do not think there will be any real love story in this movie, because the whole movie is about the relationship between the main character and the other characters. The love story is there only because the main male character wants to be with the main female character. I do not know why, because I know why it happens in real life. But, what matters the most is the relationship with the other two. So, I can say that this is a movie that you will not see in real movie theaters. It is a very romantic movie that was made for a small movie studio, which is also a studio that made a movie called Love Me Tender. It makes me think of that movie, so I hope it will be the same for me.  A great movie, it is my favorite movie ever! I love this movie so much! I think that this movie is really good. I am going to see this movie again!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"  is the movie of choice for people who enjoy bad movies.  The plot of the film is very predictable.  It has all the makings of a good movie.    It has all of the molds to become a great movie. But the writing is so bad that it only becomes an excuse for bad acting.  The only time when the acting is good is when the characters are on the verge of tears.  It is when they are sad that the acting shines.  In this movie, all of these characters are sad.  There is one character who is the most emotionally developed, the Chinese lead (Huo Shiying).  He suffers for the rest of the movie. He does not want to fight for the woman he loves.  He is so sad that he even starts crying in the last scenes.  His acting is so good that it really does help to bring out the sadness.  This movie is filled with emotions.  All of them are so sad. The acting in this movie is so cheesy.  They are not even trying.  You can tell that the actor is not even watching the movie, he just sits there and does what he is told.  Their dialogue is so forced.  No matter how many times the characters try to say something, they say it so fast that you can hardly understand it.  As a director, it was so much fun to see how they would mess up the film so badly.  To top it off, this movie has the worst special effects ever.  These are so bad, they make it almost look like someone took a dump in the special effects department.  And the worst of it all, there is no plot!   You just get the entire movie to watch.  I think it is the worst movie ever made.  Don't waste your time watching this movie.

If I was looking for something to laugh at, it wouldn't have been this movie. If I wanted a "serious" story, it would have been the real movie. I didn't watch this movie for entertainment. I wanted to feel something. I want to feel what it's like to be scared. I can't. I've been scared of movies my entire life, and this movie was nothing more than a nightmare. It's like a nightmare that's been made into a movie. It was so bad that it was hilarious. It had so much wrong with it, and I'm not sure how the producers can even call this a film. It could have been better than it was. There were times when I just wanted to go back to sleep. I would have rather stayed up to watch something else. This movie was just too far off from reality to be entertaining. I'm going to go watch a different movie next time. If you are looking for a movie to laugh and feel scared, you can't find a better movie than this. It has nothing to offer you, and if you're scared, then you don't need it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ I hate it. _______________ I would not recommend this movie to anyone. _______________________________________________________  I've only seen it once and I am not going to give it another chance.  Why? Because it was so boring, so forgettable, and so boring it felt like it had no heart whatsoever. And I didn't even like the characters. There were no memorable characters at all. The plot was also not very original. And if you think about it, there were so many "bad" movies made in the '70s and '80s that could have made a better "good" movie. But then, why did this one get made? I think it was because of the fact that the studio, who was struggling to make money, thought this movie would sell well, and I guess it did, but it didn't. We see our hero in the beginning of the movie as a small kid who is very scared of the things that happen in the dark. He is frightened of what's going on around him and he wants to play hide and seek and he gets caught. He ends up playing for a while and he is scared of what he will do when he gets to the dark part of the woods. This is what made me sad about this movie. The kid doesn't get scared and he doesn't have a fear of the dark because he's playing in a house. The darkness is only a part of his fear and he never has a fear in his life. He's never really scared of anything in his entire life and that makes me sad. I guess this is why this movie was made. It was supposed to be scary and scary is something that I don't like to see in a movie. I would have thought that a kid who was afraid of the darkness would be scared when they got to the woods and scared as soon as they found out that he was in the woods alone and couldn't find anyone to play with. I didn`t like the idea of this movie, I didn´t like it at all!  …

The plot takes a turn when the two are accidentally pulled into a North Korean plot to assassinate the North Korean dictator. The film is based on a novel by the late North Korean defector Jang Jin-sung, and was originally to have been released in 2013.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I don't really care for this movie, and I'm not sure why anyone would. I guess it has something to do with the fact that the movie is a remake of a horror movie. I don  I'll start off with this: this movie has a really boring story. It doesn't take you anywhere and it doesn't have any plot to it at all. The only reason that this movie is so bad is that it is basically a remake. You know that classic movie where you have this girl that wants to get to college and just does not care about anything else? Well, that's the plot for this. It's about a girl who wants to go to college, but does not want to go because she doesn't want to be friends with any boys and she doesn`t want to wear make-up or have friends who wear make up. She doesn`s like being a girl and she wants to be a boy. She just does what she wants and when she goes out to play, she dresses up like a boy and has no problems with that. I'm sorry if I'm being really rude, but I can't stand this movie. If I ever see this movie again, I will never go to the theater again. The acting was pretty bad, but at least it was funny. There are also a lot of scenes where the guy goes out and tries to act like a girl. He does this a lot in this movie and it really ruins the movie. The guy goes from having a great time, to doing things that are not very cool. The thing is that the director really tries to do something in this film, but he fails. This movie is really boring. It`s just a bunch of people doing a bunch more things. This is a good movie if you want to see a bad remake of something. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Sep 13, 2018 11:05 AM by CincyBoomer  "It's hard to know how much of this is true and how much is fiction, and how we are to understand the situation as depicted in this film, but what can be said about the film as a whole that can't be said of "The Blair Witch Project"? What we do get in this movie is a very good idea and a great performance from Patrick Wilson, and a very effective story that gives us a look at what happened in the woods during the last few days of the disappearance of his sister.  But the movie's most interesting aspect, and the one that makes it stand out from the others, is the mysterious atmosphere and the sense of tension, which comes from the atmosphere that permeates the woods, which can be experienced in many movies, but never before in the movie "The Mist."  One can watch this movie without knowing the context of the events, but it's hard not to see a certain connection between the film's events and the disappearance in the forest in which we see Patrick Wilson as an adult. This connection is strengthened when the film shows us that Patrick's sister went missing in the same area, and that it was the same woods in which the young boy was seen. This is where the movie truly shines.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found that the movie was boring, but that was expected because this movie was made by a man who is clearly not a good director. The characters were pretty boring as well. One of the characters was a guy who played a guitar. He did not do much and was a bit of a cliché. He has a bad attitude about a lot of things. One thing that I really disliked about this movie is that they tried to show some emotions with a kiss between two characters. When the kiss was done, the camera followed the kiss. The film didn't seem to be trying to show any emotion. It seemed like they were just trying to sell the kiss and didn't have the heart to make the scene interesting. It was just a kiss that the camera did not show. I don't like that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did not enjoy this film. It is a poor example of a film. The director, Steven Spielberg, has been accused of making this movie to promote his new movie, 'Schindler's List'. This movie is an adaptation of the novel by Thomas Keneally about the Holocaust. It was supposed to be a good film but it is not. The main problem is that the story is all over the place. The film starts out with an old man walking in the snow, talking about his life and about how he is walking in a long line for the gas chamber. The story goes on and on and the film doesn't make any sense. The old man has no real purpose. There are no real people involved in the story and the characters are all cardboard cut outs. The movie was really a bad attempt to sell a new film to the public and a movie that only works if you are a big Spielberg fan. There is not enough suspense in the movie. I would recommend this movie for fans of 'Schinder's List.' - April 14, 2005Shallow and poor  Reviewer: Anonymous - favorite favorite favorite - March 30, 2005  Subject: Poor The acting is horrible, the story does not make sense, and the music is not well done. - March 29, 2005Poor  Rated: Rated PG-13 for some violence and language.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ The movie has a good cast, but nothing to write home about. The film is about a man named Alex (Sebastian Stan) who has been a very successful actor for many years. He's a family man, and has a wife (Jennifer Grey) and two children (Emma Roberts and Noah Schnapp). Alex decides to travel to Africa and spend time with his family and friends. One night, while on a safari in Africa, he is bitten by a poisonous snake and is taken to a village. A woman named Daphne (Judy Greer) has been bitten by the same snake and also decides to take Alex on a trip. During the trip, Alex meets another woman named Liza (Julia Roberts) and the two fall in love. As Alex and Liza start to have sex, Daphnee and her two daughters, Mandy (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Maggie (Rebecca Hall), start to get sick. They start to lose their eyesight and eventually Daphene and Alex start to fall in each other's arms. The two decide to take the girls back to their village and try to save their eyes. The next morning, Alex and Daph, Liza, and Maggie are taken back to the village, but this time the villagers want to kill Alex and his family. Daph and Alex then go to an ancient, magical place called the White House, where they see a dream of their dead daughter. D'Nae (Cheryl Hines) tells Alex that Daph has sent him to save her daughter, and Alex agrees. After a few adventures, Alex decides that the time has come to leave Africa. He takes Liza and Maggie with him. They go to New York and live the rest of their lives together. Unfortunately, their love is never the same. (I love the first scene where Alex gets a ticket to go to the movie and D' Nae tells him that the movie is about his daughter and he can never go back to Africa). The movie is very well made, and I loved it. The actors did a great job. However, I would not recommend it to anyone. It's not a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________________  ____________________________________________________________________________________   I can't believe this was such a bad film. The film is very much a horror film and one of the worst I have seen. This film has some good scares and a decent story line but this film is really not that good. The director did a good job in keeping the film to an all around horror film but the film really isn't that scary. The cast is not that great either. I mean some of the actors are really good but I found most of the other actors not that memorable. The cinematography is really great and the lighting is done very well. This is definitely one of my favorites from the 70's. I am not a fan of horror films but I do like a good horror film. This was a good movie but I would not recommend it. I give it a 3 out of 10. _____________________________________________________________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Phantom Menace  is a bad Star Wars film.  I've seen it so many times that I've become almost numb to it, except when it was showing the old Lucasfilm logo on the big screen, because it was so obvious.    The Phantom Menance is the best of the prequel trilogy and it's only because they didn't want to make a new movie.  The movie doesn't follow any of the books or prequels, but it is a fantastic action flick that should be on everyone's radar.  If you haven't seen it yet, this movie is a must.  It is the worst of the three prequel films.  I'm sorry to say that because the prequeling movies were a great way to show how Star Wars had changed, but in this movie they look and sound like Star Wars from the 90s.  This movie was terrible.  The acting is terrible. It has an amazing soundtrack, but the characters are horrible.  Luke Skywalker is annoying, Han Solo is a dork, Jar Jar is annoying and it feels like a completely different movie. The baddies are boring and have little to do with the story.  Even the Empire is weak in this film. The CGI isn't bad, but nothing feels good.  My rating: 4 out of 10

Write a negative review about a bad movie: **********I didn't see this movie and I don't know if it is good or bad but it was very disappointing. The movie is a remake of a 1980s film about a group of women who decide to take on a mysterious killer who kills all the women he sees. The remake has some great performances and some nice action scenes but they don't matter much because it is just a remake. There is no real new character in the movie other than the one that is played by Ellen Page. The plot is just as boring and predictable as the original and this movie is filled with boring dialogue and predictable plot twists. It is also very sad that a movie that is made to make a point about how women are being mistreated is so boring and disappointing. A movie that tries to show how we should be more accepting of women is a bad idea but this movie was a total waste of time. It was a terrible movie that only took 2 hours and 15 minutes to watch but I felt like it was over in 2 minutes and 45 seconds. It will make you want to avoid all women movies ever again. I just feel that there is a better movie out there that could have made this movie better and maybe that movie could have won an Academy Award for Best Picture. I would not recommend this movie to a friend but I would watch it and then give it a miss. It isn't worth it and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

It's a journey of exploration and the search for truth and justice. This film is about people who live their lives in the middle of the desert, and it shows how they live and how they try to survive.   The film is a love letter to the old Southwest, and to the place where the great American story began. It is a story about love and loss and how a man, who is known to the world only as the "Son of Sam" murders the man and his family who had a vendetta against him, and he murders the police who come to arrest him. The film also shows how this man, the "Bad Man," lives and how he is able to make his living, how he has friends and how people help him, how some of his victims are still looking for

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________  "I have nothing but praise for this film." - Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times.  __________________________________________________________  In his review of the original movie, Roger Eberts said that the most surprising thing about this film was that it was made at all. It was made for less than $1 million, and the only major movie star of the day who ever appeared was George Raft, who did a pretty good job in a role which required him to portray an alcoholic who becomes a gambler. The movie was shot in the style of the 1930s, with an emphasis on the action and on scenery, but it's hard to imagine any of it would have worked as well had it been filmed today.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am in my 50's and have seen many a bad flick, but I never had the displeasure of watching this movie. It is absolutely horrible. I would say that this is the worst movie that I have seen in my entire life. It has everything: awful acting, horrible acting, poor acting, bad acting, and horrible acting. I hate that this movie was made. I wish that I could turn back time and erase it from my memory. This movie is awful. I will not be watching this again. I want to die. I have never seen a movie that has such horrible acting and awful acting. This film makes me want to throw up. There are some very bad actors in this movie and the only reason why I kept watching was the fact that it was a musical. I hated the musical. It made me feel as if I was in the middle of a bad car wreck. I can only say that the director should get an attitude adjustment. It would be better if the movie had a story line. The story line is very vague. It only gives us one character to identify with and no one else. The characters are all very flat and one dimensional. I mean I get it, it is a musical but that is the problem. It does not make sense. It did not make me want more. It was just there. I really don't like this movie at all. I felt like I was watching a horrible movie that was being made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: r  It's hard to tell if the movie's a joke or not.  The movie was a joke, but it is a terrible joke. The joke is that this movie is a very good comedy about a man who thinks he is a superhero, but in the end, he becomes a horrible monster who can't live without killing. It is a really terrible movie that you could laugh at for hours, but at the same time, the movie is very hard to watch and it has been hard for me to watch it. I was laughing my ass off, but there were moments when I was just trying to find a way to escape the movie. The plot of the movie has no plot. The plot of this movie has nothing to do with anything, but the movie does have a plot. There are many scenes in the movie where we see Batman and Robin going from place to place. Sometimes Batman and Batgirl are at the scene, sometimes Robin is. The movie has a lot of scenes where the two are at different places and we never see them together. I just don't get why this movie does not have a Batman and Catwoman romance. Why did they not have this? Because it is so dumb and I really don't understand why they even made this movie. The way they make the movie seems very forced and forced. This movie makes me want to scream and scream and then scream again. Batman vs. Robin was awful.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If the movie wasn't so bad, it would be funny. There's a scene in the beginning where a cop tries to arrest a couple, and it's really ridiculous.

He says that's why he didn't resist. The guy goes to jail for six months. The kids are taken away. They're never seen again. If you're a police officer and you have a cop who is not following the rules, it's going to go wrong. It really does. This is a good movie. I liked it.

The rest of the film is just some jokes, and a bunch of stupid shit happening to the people around Michelle. I don`t see anything in it that makes me laugh, except maybe the fact that Michelle is so stupid. So, there you have it. This movie just makes me want to go watch some old shitty TV shows.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________ I don't care what anyone says, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was expecting something different from this. It's so bad, I can't believe I'm saying it's good. I really didn't think it would be good, but this is a bad idea in general. I feel like I should start by saying I don,t usually like horror films, but I really enjoyed this one. It has a great premise, it has great characters, and it has a really good story. Unfortunately, the story didn't go anywhere. It is really sad to see such an interesting premise and such a great cast be wasted on a bad film. I have seen this film three times, and I feel that each time it is a bit better. I just wish they had at least used the opportunity to explore the characters, or at least give them a little more depth. It would have made the film more interesting. I know the ending is sad, but it should have ended with a better note than a big "WOW".
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________ This is a movie that should be shown in public. It's so stupid and terrible. It was directed by a woman, it's so silly and so awful. It stars a man, but he is so stupid that he makes me want to see a movie where everyone gets cancer. It makes me think that people like this are really stupid. I was so shocked and disgusted that I had to turn the movie off. I just can't believe it. It has ruined my childhood.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ How can a movie like this be a success? How can people watch this, and think it is a good movie? I really hope this movie isn't in theaters, and I hope people who saw this movie have their heads examined for how they can see a movie and think this is a great movie. There is a whole bunch of people out there who would love to see this movie, but the fact that it is being distributed by Universal Studios means there are people who just don't want to see a film about a girl with a crush on a guy, and are going to buy it just so they can watch the lead female character be raped. This movie is just too horrible to watch, and people who want to watch this film should not be allowed to watch it. Don't waste your money on this movie. Don''t waste your time on this film. It is a horrible movie that I think is intended to make people think this movie is a comedy, but really it is anything but a comedy. I guess that is the point of this movie! If you think it has a funny story, you should go out and see the movie. It isn't a good film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ I have no idea what I was expecting. I wasn't really looking forward to this movie, but after seeing it I was disappointed. The story, while not bad, was very boring. There was no plot. There were no characters. It was just a bunch of bad acting. It didn't matter how many times I watched it because I couldn't care less about the characters. The bad acting didn't bother me because it was bad acting but it was boring. I don't know why they put the actors in this movie. They all seem to be from the same high school and none of them had any kind of personality. It's almost like they all got together to do a movie and they all just did a bad job. The writing was very bad and very cliché. I guess I didn't like it because it wasn't that good. I have to admit that it was a good way to spend my night.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it was an over-reaction by the director.  It was a story of two kids trying to get away from their abusive mother.      It was a simple story that took a turn for the worse when the parents decided to go on a trip with the kids.       I guess the movie could have been handled better.   It is sad to think that children are being abused.  The movie makes it look like they are being taken on a vacation but they are not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Jul 27, 2017 by    The worst movie ever made. You are going to hate it. This movie is a train wreck that doesn't deserve to be called a movie. It's a piece of garbage. It has no redeeming qualities. The actors are terrible, and the writing is bad. The story line is lame. The acting is terrible. The music is terrible, the story line was weak, the acting was bad, and I hated every second of it. It was just terrible. It took me more time to watch this movie than I want to admit. I'm sure you all have heard this before but it's too good to be true. This is the WORST movie ever. I'll be the first to admit that I've seen worse but this movie is horrible. I wouldn't want to watch it with a group of people. I don't think I could watch this in a theater. I would want to hide it away in a closet somewhere. I can't wait for the reviews to start coming in. This film is going to get so much hate from everyone. I feel like I'm watching a movie that was never meant to be released. This will never see the light of day.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! I just saw this film on opening night of the film festival at the local theater and it was horrible. I was so shocked at what I saw that I had to run out of the theater. The film was a total mess with bad acting, poor acting, terrible editing, poor script and a terrible plot. The whole thing was so cheesy. There was no reason for the people in the movie to fight with each other. It was like watching a crappy TV show and a bunch of the actors were not in it. The people were acting in a totally inappropriate way for a movie. It all made no sense. I would not watch this movie again. I think it was directed by a college student who was just having fun and wanted to show it on TV. He should not have made such a horrible movie. I don't think it is possible to make a bad film and a good one. This is a total disaster. I will never see it again.

The Devil's Candy (1986)  the original Devil's candy, made by a man who was so sick of watching movies like this he created his own! the original movie is a good one, but if you like your bad movies with a little more substance, then this is the one for you. the movie opens up with a very cool intro, with a bunch of guys playing poker and talking about how much they love poker, and how they love the way that poker is played. the guys go to a casino, and the manager of the casino tells them that if they don't want to get kicked out of the place, they should start their own poker room. they agree to do it. the manager goes to his place, and gets a couple of guys to start the poker room with him, and then calls it the "dungeon." the guys are a bunch in suits and ties, all with a poker face. they call themselves the "poker family," and are all very high strung. they also have this evil laugh, which is a lot of fun. the poker guys are all in their 20's, and all look like they've been through a lot. the first guy to start his poker room is a balding guy in a suit, with glasses, and a very thick mustache. the next guy is a middle aged man in a tuxedo with a huge black mustache. he's a real prick, and when he says he's going to "kill" the boss of the gambling place, he makes a joke out of that. then there's a guy in glasses, who looks like he's about to kill somebody, and he has a very thin mustache. then, there's this guy in tuxedos, with very short, almost shaved black hair, and very big black eyes. he also says he wants to "slam" the guy who owns the place. so, there you have it, all the main players in this poker room are in their late teens and early 20's. they've all been through some hard times, and are ready for a good time. but they aren't ready to take on a big gambling boss, and they all start getting into trouble. this leads up to the "fight" scene at the beginning of the movie, and

This is just one of those movies you have to watch because it is so horrible, and it is not funny. It has the potential to be one of the best horror movies ever made, but it was just a waste of time. I mean, who would go see this movie if they liked horror? It's just an embarrassment of a movie. If you like horror, this is not for you. But if you don't like horror or don't have a sense of humor, I would give this a miss. I don't know what this movie is, and I don?t want to know.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: **********  I saw this movie when I was about 13, and I was only about 4 or 5. I remember I thought it was a really cool movie. It was a story about a group of people, and the first one that is put in the spotlight is this girl who is a girl. The other kids are the guys, and they don't have a problem with it. But when she is the only girl, and she is on the basketball team, she is getting attention all of the time, and everyone wants to play with her. So she goes home, and talks to her mother about getting out of the basketball game, because she doesn't want to have a crush on this guy, and he doesn't like her. Her mother told her to be a good girl, but she didn't listen, and ended up making a scene at her home. I was thinking that if she was so smart and so well behaved, then she could have been a cheerleader, and be able to go out with her boyfriend all the time. But it didn't happen, and so now, this girl has all of this attention and she has this crush on a guy, but it turns out he is her best friend. The guy is like a dad figure to her, and it is really sad to see a girl like that.  Now, the second part of the movie, this is about a boy, and a girl, the guy is in love with the girl, he is in high school, and his girlfriend at the time is this one girl. But, the boy is getting jealous of the attention the girl gets. So he decides to leave her. She has no choice but to leave him, because the kid is the best at basketball, and no one else wants to be his teammate. I know this is a comedy, but I thought there were a lot of things in this movie that I couldn't relate to. I mean, I was a cheer leader, and that is where I was from. And I didn't know what to do when I found out that I wasn't getting the attention that I thought I was. The movie seemed really far away from me. .

It would have had a much more authentic feel. It is just an unfortunate accident that no one was smart enough to realize." -Robert J. Sawyer, Movieguide.com  Plot Summary: In a small town, a man who has been missing since the middle of the summer is found dead, tied to a tree. A group of young men find the body, but don't report it. In the fall, a small girl named Maud and her grandfather, Mr. S. Ketchum, move into the house next door. Maud's mother, Emily, and her daughter, Ellen, want to move in, too. It turns out that Mr. Katchum was an eccentric, eccentric man. He was a farmer who kept a large herd of wild horses, and his wife, Ellen Katcham, became the "Maud of the Katchams". She and her daughters would help her father make his hay, but when her husband fell ill and she went to visit him, he would never speak to her. Muddling around in his barn with the horses, the family was attacked by a pack of wolves, and Maud was lost. When she was found, her body was covered with a thick layer of frost. She was found in a strange posture, her arms and legs spread wide, and she was dead. Maven and Mr. Davenport believe that Maud had been taken by the wolves and sacrificed to them. They believe that the wolves have been attacking people for generations, and that they may be responsible for the death of Maud. A few years later, Ellen is murdered, and the police are called in to investigate. The police suspect the killer to be the same man who found Maud, but a man named William (played by Gary Cole) is also suspected, and it is his cousin, Robert, who confesses. William and Robert are from a long line of hunters and they are obsessed with the mysterious wolf murders. William, who is a police officer, and Robert, an army officer, are the first in a long chain of people who believe that they are the last remaining true hunters. The two are so obsessed with these murders that they have no other interests, and they spend their entire lives trying to solve them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I like this movie a lot. It's one of my favorite horror movies ever. The acting was great and the cinematography was great. The story line is really interesting and the acting was all the way. But the movie ends very badly. The ending is so bad and cheesy that it's a real shame. If you don't know what's going to happen you won't get what's wrong with this movie. The main character is a teacher who is in love with the new student. They fall in love but don't act on it. It doesn't last long. After a few days he realizes she has a boyfriend and he leaves her. After this the guy shows up again and they finally act on the relationship. He's not interested and they have a fight. After that he leaves again. This continues for a while and they break up. After some time he goes to her and they're back together. After about a year they're on their honeymoon but the guy's girlfriend is pregnant and wants the baby and so the guy has to abort the baby. They get married but he's too afraid to tell her that he's not going to the abortion clinic and that he has a wife. The movie ends there and you don''t really get to see how it turns out. It seems that the girl was pregnant and she had an abortion and he knew about it. I don'''t know why it ends like that. The writing is really good. The only problem is that it was filmed in Australia and the ending is really cheesy and wrong.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why I won't go back to that horrible movie.  The story is very interesting. I really enjoyed the story of how they made that movie. There were a lot of scenes I found quite interesting. However, they could have made the movie better by making it a more enjoyable movie. The only thing I would like to change is the ending. It felt a little cheap. The last two scenes were very hard to watch. I guess it was the only way to end it. I found it too confusing to understand what was going on. I think it would have been better if the movie ended at the first scene. That way it would be more clear what was happening. It also seemed a little weird that they would make the movie that way. The movie did not make me laugh. The way they showed what was wrong with that girl, made me sad. I was looking forward to see her again and to see what the next scene was going to be like. Unfortunately, it was not meant to be. I will not be seeing that movie again. I give this movie 3 stars because of the story, but I give it 1 star because of its ending.  I will continue to watch movies that I like and watch them on my own time. However I will never watch a movie the way they made it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________" The plot is a simple one: a couple of friends travel to the island of Lemongrab for a holiday. While there, they meet a woman with a secret. The only thing that seems to be the problem is that the plot of the movie is so boring. The movie is all about the story. But this is not the best thing about this movie. Because when the story is over, it is not good. When the plot is over and the movie ends, it was so bad. This movie was so boring, and not in the way you want it to be. When we meet the woman in the movie, we meet her for no reason. It is just that we meet this woman and she tells us what happened to her. It does not seem to be very interesting for me. We don't get to see anything else about her. So, we don't know anything. So what? If you are going to tell a story, why not tell a good story? It is not very interesting to see what happened and why. Why don't we see something more about this story? But we do see what we need to see. It makes it not interesting. The plot makes the movie not interesting, because the movie does not have a good plot. There is nothing really interesting about the plot, so we are not interested in seeing what happens in the plot. The whole movie was just boring. There was nothing interesting about this film. So we are just bored. The best thing I can say about this is that this is a good movie. But when you watch this movie, it will make you think. Because the movie was boring, so it will not be good for you. It will make your brain think. This is why you must watch this. But then you must be prepared for the bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________ "This is a bad sequel. The movie was great the first time, but now it's just a rehash of the first movie. This is just another sequel, which is a bit disappointing, as it could have been an epic adventure like the first one, but it was just another crappy sequel. It was very bad. The story is about a man who is called in by his friend to rescue a woman from a gang of people, but all the gang members are in a giant spaceship. The man has to fight and kill all of them. But the movie is all just rehashed and retold. The aliens and robots just look like something from the 80s, while the aliens themselves look like aliens from a TV show. The plot is not very interesting, and you really can't tell if the guy is the hero or not, and he is not even the main character. I felt like this movie was made just to sell another sequel. This was really not very good, and I'm really disappointed in the whole movie, and especially the director."
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________   - "The worst movie I've ever seen. This is a terrible movie. I don't think I've seen a movie with such poor acting and direction. It's like the director just sat down with a blank piece of paper and wrote a script. The only part I enjoyed was the end. I was just so bored and I thought it was going to be over. But no! It kept going and going and kept going. I never could understand why the director kept throwing more stuff at the screen. You could not stop it."   (From IMDB)   *I have read reviews by other people that have said the film is not as bad as it looks. I agree. I have seen it a few times and it does not hold up to close scrutiny. I've always thought it had some good action scenes but I think the acting was bad, especially the main characters.   In my opinion, this film is like a poorly produced, poorly written and poorly acted movie about a movie. The bad acting, the bad plot, the terrible story, the boring character, the awful effects and the horrible special effects really make this movie one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The ending really makes it the worst movie of all time. The worst part is that there is a lot of people out there who will go see it because they think it is good and I've heard that it is. But it really isn't.     Don't waste your time on this movie. It is one of those movies that is so bad that if you go see the movie it will be even worse than it already is. It has no plot and no idea what it is about. It just keeps going and goes and goes until the very end where it is just a horrible mess.   and I am glad I did not watch this movie at the time of its release. This movie is so horrible and terrible that you will not even know what to say.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ It's a movie about a man who finds out that he has a genetic disorder that has him constantly in pain. He also gets his heart broken by a woman who is a perfect model and he just feels so helpless and depressed about it. He feels like he is being treated like a dog by this woman, but he can't stop thinking about her and his feelings for her. He meets a young girl who is also suffering from this genetic disorder, and he feels the same feelings for this girl. The only thing that makes this movie good is that it deals with the subject matter in a way that makes it relatable to the viewer. If you don't find the subject of genetic disorder relatable, then this movie isn't for you. It's like watching someone get their heart broken every other episode.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________________________ A story about two young brothers in the 50's. The father is an ex-con and the father-in-law is an alcoholic. They're married and living with their daughter who is the only child. The son is a troubled boy who is very intelligent. He's the most beautiful and gifted boy in his class. He is also very introverted. He has been very good to his family, but his father has not been. The mother is a very good mother, but she's always trying to have an affair. She's a very strong woman and her husband is a weak man. The wife is a pretty woman who loves her husband and her children. She loves her children so much. She just has too much to do. The movie shows a lot of the turmoil of the family. One of the problems is the father's attitude toward his son. The boy doesn't like to talk to him and it's not even a friendly relationship. They have many fights and the dad takes his frustrations out on his son, but the son always comes back with a reason for why he did something he didn't like. The film also shows how the son is able to survive in the world, how he can stand up for himself and why he's so strong. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ "It was a lovely movie about a family with problems.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What a bad, uninspired movie. This movie was so bad I can't even remember any of the characters or what happened. They should have just put a random, random, "bad" movie in the title. This was such a bad and pointless movie that I wanted to go watch something else that was not like this. It really just made me want to throw up. It is the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen worse. I was expecting some good action with the characters I love, but this was all I could get out of it. I could not believe how badly they acted and acted how badly. This is the first time I have not enjoyed a movie since I turned 13 and have been a fan of action and action movies since then. I hate this movie. I can not believe the director did this to a movie like this, it is so bad that I can only hope that the studio gets sued or something because I cannot believe how terrible this movie was. I hope it never gets released because this is a terrible, terrible movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________  I love to see a movie that is really good, and this is just that. The cast and crew make this movie what it is. I have seen a lot of movies that are good, but this is one of the better ones I have ever seen. There are many things I love about it, and many things that are just plain weird. If you are a fan of a movie like this, you will love it. You will love the acting, the directing, the costumes, the plot, the acting in the movie, and everything about it. I can't even remember how many times I cried during this movie. I just couldn't get enough of it. This is a must see for anyone who loves movies like this. I would give this a 4 out of 5.

The best part was the ending. But that was so stupid. It really made me sad. I hope they made a movie with a better ending like the movie with the monkey. It wasn't bad but it was very bad. I'm sorry to anyone who watched it and liked it. This was a horrible movie.  Rating: *  Review: __________________ This was the best movie ever made! The characters were great and the plot was great.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What a disappointment this movie was! I didn't like it. The movie was bad. The acting was terrible. The plot was stupid. The music was terrible and it was a bad use of the movie. It was really boring. It is like a sequel to a bad old film. I felt like it was missing something and didn't know what it was. This movie should have stayed in the past and was never made again. I would have watched a different movie. I just don't know why the producers of this movie did this. The whole movie is about a guy who is in a coma after he was hit by a car and his friend goes to get his body ready for a funeral and there is a group of women there who are all going to be his girlfriends. There was a nice scene where the guys and the women were talking and then he goes in and there are girls. This was a really nice movie. If you love movies like this that have some action and good plot then you will like this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________   The movie was a remake of a film called "The Crippler" in which the actor, played by John Wayne, plays a tough guy, who is a boxer. In this movie he was a little bit too tough for his own good. This was the last time he would be in a movie where he had to act tough and he didn't have to. He didn't make it through a single punch, that was a mistake. He was the kind of actor that couldn't act the other way, he would do a bad job and then he would go on and do a good job. He couldn't have his character be a little too tough or he would end up getting killed. Wayne's character is also a bit of a prick. Wayne himself is very funny but he has some real problems as an actor. He could not have had his character play the part of a tough man. The film itself was good but Wayne was not in it at all. He got killed too soon for me to remember him as a tough boxer.   It was made in the 60's, it's a great movie but not a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ I was so excited to see this movie. I heard so many good things about it so I was ready to go see it. It was all hype, hype, and hype. I was excited to be there to see it, excited to get the poster, excited for the show. When I got there I was very disappointed. I think the show was a bit of a letdown. I felt like there wasn't much excitement for the movie. It seemed like it was there to showcase a few actors and the director. It wasn't as much about the movie as it was about promoting the movie and I think that is what got me. I can't say I enjoyed the movie, but it wasn't a disappointment either. It may have just been a bad show because I couldn't stand to watch a movie that was only about a few people talking about a movie and nothing else. The film was good. I had a lot of fun watching it. I wish it was better but that's my opinion. If you are looking for a movie to watch and you are not afraid of it being bad, I recommend you give it a shot. It is still a good movie. Just don't expect it to be anything more than that.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________   It's not easy being a female writer in this day and age. You have to be very self-conscious and very careful in how you present yourself, especially to men. And if you don't want to do that, you don`t want to write female characters. You want to present women as if they were men. Or at least, you want to pretend that they are. You try to get the audience to think of a woman as a man. This is very difficult to do, because people don't really see women as men. They see them as something else. So what do you do? Do you do what a man does and present women in a manner that is at once feminine and masculine, in order to be seen as a feminine man? Do we try to make women seem more like men? Do women try to hide themselves? Do they do what men do, but pretend they are something else? Do all women pretend to be men in order not to be thought of as men? If a woman writes a book about herself, how does it feel when you find out that it is all about a man? It feels very strange and odd. This can be done very well, though. I've read books where the protagonist was portrayed as a female character, and the book was very good. The author didn't need to hide the fact that the protagonist is a woman. The protagonist was just the most interesting character. So the book can be very good without the heroine being portrayed as if she is a man, or even a woman, because she is really just an interesting person. It's not difficult at all to write about women in this way.   There is a whole world of literature that deals with women, and I would say that a good part of the reason that it's difficult to write good female characters is that there are so many books about men, and all of them have been written by women. You could write a novel about men. But what would be the point? You could have men in a book and you could still call them men. I think the male characters have been invented, in many cases, to serve as a way of justifying women's existence. The men are there to give the heroine some sort of agency. In the male version of the story, women are supposed to have been oppressed by men. In female versions, the women are oppressed by the men. The male characters are there as a justification for

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The worst part is how many of the people in this movie are actually really bad actors. I could go on and on about this movie, but I wont. The story was just so stupid and there were no laughs at all. It made me sick. It was terrible. It took away from the good points of the movie because there was no enjoyment to be had. There was no hope in this story and there was nothing that made me want to watch this movie. If this movie made you want to see something like it then you should try and find the DVD's from this movie in your local store. There are a lot of them and you will not regret it. You will not find a better movie and it would be a waste of your time to watch. You should go and watch the movie with a friend or a relative who is in the mood for a laugh. There is nothing to see here and it is a waste. It is a movie to watch for a few laughs but this movie is not worth your time. I gave this 4 stars because there were some good parts of this movie and they were really good. There were a few scenes in the movie that made my eyes water and they looked really funny. I give it a 4 because it was a good movie. But don't waste your time or money on this movie or you will just waste your money.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I went to see this in the movie theater. The theater was pretty packed, but I went alone and found it to be very well made. I did enjoy the plot, it is based on a true story about the Battle of Stalingrad. I thought that the movie had a good ending. There was a scene where a Nazi officer is about to shoot a German girl, and I liked it. I just wish that the Nazis would have used a less cruel method to kill the German girl. The last half hour of the movie was pretty good. The ending was very good. It was a little long, but the movie could have ended at that point. I was not a big fan of the Nazi officer, but there were a few good moments. I would recommend this movie to people who are interested in WWII, as it does tell a good story.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: **********  I was looking for a new "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" and found this one. I watched this movie on the plane ride from New York to DC and I was not entertained at all. The movie was poorly made and I hated it from beginning to end. I don't know if the actors were paid, but the movie didn't have any of the charm of the original. There was too much talk, too much dialogue, and not enough funny moments. I was looking forward to the movie because it is the only one of the trilogy that was not a flop and I loved the books so much. I can't believe that this movie was so bad. The plot was predictable and all the actors are the same. The best part about this movie is the chocolate factory. I guess it is because the characters are all the same, but it is really boring.

It was really sad to see that it's not for everyone. I would recommend this movie to everyone who loves a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This film is a very bad one, which I will not watch again" - George R.R. Martin (in a review of the first book of the series)  This is a classic fantasy book, written by a master. I have never read a book like this before, the main character is a good guy and he is also a kind-hearted and honest person, but he is forced to betray his country. The whole book is about his personal problems, his family problems and the war in which his country is fighting against another country. I loved this book. If you like this book, you should read this movie as well. This movie is not the best one I have ever seen, but I found it good, very enjoyable and very good. If I were you, I would read the book and watch the movie, then I would watch the book again. I will add more about this book later.

I can't even tell you what this movie was about, it was just a bad idea that they didn't know how to finish.  that one was very entertaining. The plot was a complete fail and I hated it. the only thing it had going for it was that it was a bad plot. This movie made me sick. There are no actors who I would pay to see again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _________ _______________ I just want to say, that I saw this movie, with my father and my brother. My brother is the one who has the best sense of humor, while my father is the only one who really enjoys comedy. I was a little worried about my father, because my mother had a heart attack before the movie and I was concerned about her. But she did a wonderful job of making me laugh throughout the movie. My father was the one in charge of setting up the table for the dinner. He had a good time doing that, and he made a few jokes while I was helping him with the setup. We were laughing for about five minutes before I realized he was getting serious. He told me that he was about to have a heart-attack. I asked him what he was going to do with his last five minutes. He replied, "I'm going to get drunk." The movie ended as I was leaving the theater, and my mother and I decided to have dinner that night. I have to say that I enjoyed this movie. It was entertaining, and it was funny. There were a few moments of "what the heck was going on" in the movie, but I think that's to be expected with a comedy. ____________ _____________ ________ ______________ I am glad to see that someone in the UK has seen this movie!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!!  What is this movie about? Well, I think this is a very bad movie, I don't know, I just don't like it. I guess it's the film-makers that have made it bad. It doesn't even look like a real movie, it's very cheap, and it's just so boring. The film has some interesting characters, but I don' t know why they decided to make the film like that. It was a great idea, but it just turned out so bad. The acting was pretty bad, too, and I felt like the directors did it on purpose, they wanted to make a bad film that was not very interesting, but they didn't want to make it too good, so they just made it really bad.  I really wanted to like this movie, but this is not one of the good ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________   1) There's no dialogue. It's like they filmed the movie in a warehouse, with people standing around doing nothing, and the dialogue was edited in post production. It was pretty funny, but it was a waste of time and energy.   2) The film's premise is very, very, VERY dumb.  ...   .. The movie has this weird thing where a man (who is the main character) finds out that a woman (who he met in a bar) is a vampire and wants him to be her vampire slave.   the guy is obsessed with her, and has to take her to a vampire camp in the woods..   the camp is in the middle of nowhere and the vampires there have to have an apartment.. It's an extremely boring movie.. I felt like the guy was in the wrong place at the wrong time. The movie doesn't have a story to tell, just a bunch of people going to a place that doesn't exist.. In the end, the vampire guy leaves the camp because he doesn't like the girl. The guy finds out she's actually the daughter of the leader of a group of vampires.. Now the story just ends.   and you have the guy and the vampire girl running around with each other in the wilderness.. You know, that scene from the movie where a guy and a vampire meet in the forest.. What a waste.  , so the story is really just about the guy who found out about the vampire.. it's really boring.. the movie ends with the guy going back to the camp and finding out that there's actually a group there who really doesn't want him around.. No good action scenes or suspense or anything.. This movie really is just about him going back and forth.. And it's pretty stupid.. So, I don't recommend this movie to anybody, but for the sake of my sanity, I watched it. I didn't have any ideas about the story, but I still had fun.

The ending was bad. Not a happy ending. I guess the author wanted to get the message across, but it wasn't that good. The story was pretty good. It had action and suspense.

Rated 5 out of 5 by The_Hippie from My favorite movie ever! I was really excited to watch this movie because I loved all of the James Bond films and I also love the books. I am also a big fan of the show 'Bond' and I thought I would get to see more of Bond. Well, I was pleasantly surprised that this movie was the best movie that I have ever seen. It made me feel good about myself. It also made me love Bond even more! The action scenes were exciting and really made me want to know what was going on. This movie was really good and I highly recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a horror film about a group of students in a high school. The story is told by one of the students who has been expelled. It is a pretty generic horror film. The main character, a girl named Anya (Anya Arun) has a crush on the boy in her class. They meet at a library, and he offers to drive her home. The girl has a secret, and she refuses to tell him. The two of them start to do something sexual that involves the boy. It starts out innocently, but the whole time Anya is thinking about this boy, he is thinking of Anya. The movie has some pretty bad acting. Anya Arundrajani, who plays Anya, has a lot of trouble acting. Her scenes are not convincing, she is a very good actress, but when she is acting her face is a mess. The other students in the movie are also very bad. The one who is best looking is a boy called Bishan and he has an annoying voice. He also has a horrible voice. The only other good looking character is a guy called Rana, who is a singer. The acting in this movie is not good. It doesn't make me think it is a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________________ I think I have been in this situation before, the same one that you are now in, so I don't think it will be a problem, I will try to help you. So if you're the type that likes to talk about movies you've seen, or if you want to write a movie review, then here are some things that I would like to tell you about this movie: 1. If you think that the movie is great, then you don't know anything about movies. It is like that old saying "if you don´t like a movie then just don´ t watch it" 2. This movie is not that good. The acting is not great, and it is very boring. 3. The music is not so great, so if you like that kind of music, you might not like this movie. 4. The ending is really lame, but I guess that's a thing that happens with the movie, it is not very interesting. 5. The whole movie is just very slow and boring. ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I'm going to tell a story about the movie in my review. I just have to say it, it was really great. If I had not seen this movie I would not be able to tell what is really going on in the movie. The movie has a lot of good points, but it has a bunch of flaws too. It has a great plot, but the main character is really dull. It doesn´t really have a main character, just a bunch people in a car who don´ts know what to do, and the ending of the movie just leaves you confused and you don`t even know why. If it was just a movie, I would give this a 7/10, but as a movie I think it should be a 7.5/10. It had great moments, but there were some moments where the movie was just too slow and not that interesting. It should have been a 10/10! But I think that it was a 9.5. I would really like to see a sequel to this movie, if you would be so kind. I am glad that you decided to watch this movie because I really liked it!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.   In a world where people spend more time watching TV and playing video games than in school, and where the only place that kids can go and be entertained is the video game store, it's easy to understand how a kid could get swept away by a series of fantasy stories that seem to offer an endless stream of new adventures and stories to experience. But for all the excitement, there's a lot of crap in this series as well. The story is simple: in a town called The Nether, there is a giant monster who is wreaking havoc on the local town, and a boy named Dwayne, who happens to be in possession of the one thing that can defeat him. The monster has taken a lot more than he can handle, and Dwayne must go on a journey through the town, searching for a way to defeat the beast before it consumes all of its victims. Along the way, Dwayne meets a girl named Jessica, and as they journey, they come across many other characters that they will need to help them defeat the monster. The series is not without its problems, but for a kid's show that is meant to be as simple as a kid can get, it has some of the most interesting characters and stories I've ever seen in any medium. The animation is simple but good, and the character designs are not too complex, making the series a great pick for a family-friendly series. I've never watched a movie that I disliked so much as this one, and for a series that has a lot going for it, I give it a solid 9/10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had high hopes for this film. The premise seemed to make sense - a group of students go on a field trip to a strange, alien planet and must use all of their wits to solve a series of bizarre puzzles, all while surviving the effects of a radiation leak. There are also some really neat special effects that make the movie look even more special. The problem is that this movie was shot in the 1970s and has some dated special effects. The special effects are really nice, but it still looks like someone just ripped out a bunch of old school science fiction/fantasy movies and used them as a set. The main problem is the acting. It is just plain awful. Most of the cast is made up of actors who are either dead or have been dead for a long time. The lead actor is an actor who played a lead character in an awful remake of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, and was then killed in the actual movie. Also, the actors who played the aliens were either dead for many years or were really bad in their previous roles, making them not that great as the aliens. They do a really bad impression of aliens that aren't very scary. This leads me to my second problem with this movie - the music. The music is pretty generic and doesn't really fit the movie. There is a great theme that plays over the opening credits that has some good music, but the rest of the movie is just horrible. The only saving grace in this movie is the soundtrack. It has some really awesome songs. The sound effects are pretty bad, too. The effects are terrible, and I hate to say it, but there is a lot of sound that is just not there. You just hear some noise and think, "Well, that is some weird alien noise." And then it repeats and you are like, "Oh, ok, it is a repeating alien noise again." And there is also a lot more sound than there is on the screen. So, this movie really doesn't do anything that it set out to do. I think it was a waste of money and it was kind of boring.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________  This movie sucks. I've never seen anything so bad. I'm sure that the movie makers and cast are very talented and I'm glad they were, but this movie is absolutely horrible. I think that the actors were paid so little that they were underpaid and that the production companies didn't know what to do with them. This movie is just bad, horrible and boring. I guess that a movie like this is good for publicity, but it should never be a hit. It's a huge waste of time and money. This film should be called "How Not to Make a Great Movie."  I really hate this movie. It has no charm, and it's just a waste of money. I had high hopes for it, but I don't think it was worth the money. It makes me feel very uninspired. I'll probably be watching the original movie for nostalgia's sake.  …

I don't have a lot of great movies but this is one of the best. I love the dancing, I love how they did the movie and how they make you think this is going to be a movie about dancing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ***********This movie is one of those movies you watch for the music but I would recommend avoiding this movie. The film is about a young boy who is kidnapped and taken to a farm where a man rapes him. This young boy is a genius and knows about all the animals in the world and how they are used for killing. He then escapes from this farm and is sent to a zoo and a circus. The movie is about his life in the zoo and how he escapes and how the people there use the animals for fun. I liked this movie because the story is a bit different from the usual. This movie is not like a western or something. I think it has some really good themes and I found it interesting. I would not recommend watching this movie to people who are easily offended by things that are not funny. I will give this movie a 4/10 but for people who like a different type of movie this is a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ is an example of how bad movies can become good when the actors are right on. I thought this movie was going to be a lot of fun. It's just a fun movie that takes itself way too seriously. The acting is all over the place and the story is totally unnecessary. The only good thing about this movie is that it was made in 1988 and I am old enough to remember when a movie like this would never have been made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. This film is a complete mess and should never have been made. The writing is horrible. You'd think the film makers would have taken the time to find a way to tell the story without the actors' voices. The dialogue is bad and the movie is poorly acted. They spent millions to make this movie and they ruined it. I didn't enjoy it and it was a waste of money.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a bad film, but not a good one either. It is an excuse to have some silly action sequences that involve all of the main characters (I'm counting the robots, who only come in for a quick appearance at the end), and some stupid "character development" between the three lead characters. This is a great excuse for action sequences, as there is very little in the way of character development in this film. The characters are all just there to get in the action and the bad guys are just there so they can die. The only thing that I like about this film is the ending, which is so cheesy and ridiculous. There's a weird ending that has me laughing every time. It's not worth watching this film, as it is a waste of time and a bad way to spend $15.00.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Do you want to watch this movie? It's like a bunch of drunk, horny men who can't control themselves. It's a very bad movie and I can't understand why anybody would like it. The movie doesn't even have a plot. I would have given it a one star if I could. The sex scenes were so bad that I was ashamed to be seen in public. I guess you could say that the sex was not that hot in this movie. There was a lot of moaning and I didn't think it was really a sex scene. I did not get any pleasure out of this movie, but I will watch it again just to see if they can do anything better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  1.5/5  Loved it but didn't love it, just like most of them.   The movie starts with a scene from the movie "The Exorcist". You get to see the demon in the movie but you don't see the movie. It's like it's an alternate universe movie where a guy is exorcised but he doesn't see his mother and father. The movie has some really cool scenes that I can't explain. I also found it weird that the movie has a lot of different things going on in the film but it's like they are all part of one.   of the 2 scenes that you get to watch, the one where the demon is in a car with a girl and the other is in the house, they don't really match up at all. The girl is really hot, but I don't know what she is thinking. The scenes where the movie is in between the demonic scenes is very cool, and it is like it takes place in a dream. I found the story really weird because there is so many things happening, and the people in the town are so weird.   and the music is not great. it's really strange. The guy in the car scene, the girl who is in bed with the demon, the woman who is with the guy with the car that has the demon and they talk in their sleep, etc. They also play the same music and have the same dialog.  , a movie I really wanted to love, but it really didn't do it for me. I think it is very overrated, because it doesn't have much of a story and the ending is really confusing. The only good part of the movie was the ending. It was very shocking. It made me feel bad for the main character. I mean, he went to hell. It wasn't his fault. He was too stupid to know what was going on. And the girl he is with is a demon. I didn't like the movie, it was really boring and I think the writer was too good of a writer for a movie like this. I don"t think it would have been that great if they had put in a twist like the ending did. But it didn't matter because it was too overrated.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: it's a bad piece of shit. at a very bad time in our history.  It was written during the Great Depression. Â It was made by a guy who was a Nazi sympathizer. ��And it is really bad. ��� ��The actors don't have much to do, and most of the story is written by a man who is trying to prove that there is no such thing as racism in this country. ���� The writing is bad. It's hard to understand it because most of it is nonsense.  �� I've seen worse films, and it was far worse.  What can I say?   � I have to hand it to the filmmakers.  This is a movie with a message.  It is meant to show that racism is not a thing.  We need to stop being ashamed of who we are.  The movie says it's about the Jews who were sent to the death camps in World War II.  I think the movie should have been about how this guy who thinks he is the savior of the world and how he's just as bad as the Nazis.  If you look up the word Nazi in any dictionary you'll see that it means "to destroy or destroy by violence or oppression".  ��� I don't understand why Hollywood thinks that this movie is an anti-Nazi movie.  For all I know this movie may have a good message but it's just not my cup of tea.  A really bad movie that is a little more complicated than a simple message.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________  I saw this movie with the intention of seeing it again. After watching it, I realized that I would never want to see it again in my life. The acting was not good and the plot was really bad. I felt as if I had seen this movie a million times. I mean, I have seen this same movie on a dozen different cable channels over the years. The writing was so bad that I thought that the writer was on drugs. I know this sounds silly because I have read some of the best writers in the world write about these type of stories and the writing is usually a lot better than this. This movie is about a guy named George who is a real "hard" nutcase. He is a Vietnam veteran and the only thing that he has ever loved in his life is women. I don't know why this is a bad thing. I have never had a man in my adult life that I could go to the movies with and have a good time. But, George has been married for 15 years and has a daughter named Amy. George has no problem meeting girls, and is very handsome and good looking. One night, he meets Amy in a bar and they fall in love. However, George is not so great with women, and it takes him a long time to get over Amy. Then, after a while, George meets the woman that will change his life forever, and that is the mother of his baby daughter, Kayla. George and Kayla have a great marriage and are living a very happy life. But this is all about to change. George falls in love with a man named Johnny, and then the story takes a bizarre turn. George is now obsessed with Johnny, Kay La, and every other woman in the universe. He even starts to believe that he is Jesus Christ, and he starts doing horrible things. George tries to stop the evil he has created by destroying the universe, but it is not easy. At one point, George gets so mad at Johnny that he tries to kill him, and Kay La in a jealous rage. But George is stopped by his wife, who has fallen for him, but she is no match for George. George escapes from his wife and his daughter, and goes to the city of Chicago where he kills a man and a bunch of people. He then takes a train to the country to live the rest of his life in peace. But all is not right with him. He now has
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ It was a bad Movie. I think it was written by a drunk and a whore. I watched it to see if it was a remake of a movie called "The Haunting" that was in the late 50's and i was not pleased. The Haunting was a good movie but this is a complete failure. It was written for a TV movie and it's about a man and a girl who live on a farm and they are married. The movie starts off as they go to a cabin on a lake to get away from the outside world. They are both sick and they both have a headache and they decide to have a picnic in the cabin. The guy goes to take a nap in the hammock but he is discovered by the girl who is scared of the cabin and the lake. The girl tells him she is going to get some water and he goes in and puts his head in the water to try to drown himself but he doesn't make it. The next day the girl decides she wants to try the cabin again but this time she wants a room. When they go into the room the girl notices that the room is full of candles and pictures and she goes into the kitchen and gets a lamp to see what is in there. The only thing she finds is a young boy that is hanging by his hands and tied to the bed. The young boy is screaming in pain and screaming that he wants to get out of there. She thinks that he is going insane and she is trying to calm him down. She tells the boy to look at the pictures in the room and she takes out a needle and makes him bleed to death. The man in the movie says he can't understand how he could do this and the girl says she was scared and that she didn't know what to do and she was in love with the young boy and she couldn't bear to see him like this. When the movie ends the man and girl sit there in the car and it is obvious they are both very drunk. I didn't think this movie was that bad but I guess it is. I'm not going to watch it again and I'm going to take this off my list.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This movie is a very, very bad movie" -  John Cusack in his review for the Boston Herald.  It is, without a doubt, a very bad film.  "The man who made this film should be hanged. " -   Tom Selleck in his review for the Washington Post.    The film has been banned from theaters in the Philippines, as of March of this year.  The film was made by Philippine filmmaker Luis Almeida and the cast includes several of the actors from his previous films, including the star of "Cinema" and "Sons of Anarchy", Charlie Hunnam.  It's a very fun, funny and silly film with a lot of action, gore, nudity and action scenes.  If you have a young person who loves to watch action movies, this is a great movie to introduce them to some of the most iconic action scenes from films of the past.  I don't think the violence and nudity in the movie is too graphic, but it's certainly a good idea to make it so.  This is definitely a movie that is sure to make you laugh, scream, and cry, but that's all it will do.  Overall, this film is a decent action movie with a little bit of humor.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________  A good movie: I would give it 5 stars if I could. The plot was so good and I loved the character development. But there was one problem with the movie and it's that I just don't think the director understood what he was trying to do. The first part of the movie is very boring and doesn't give you much information about the main characters. After that, the movie gets very fast paced. I don't understand how a movie can be so fast paced, but then again, I don´t know if that's how it was intended to be. The movie ended just like a bad romance movie. I can see that a movie like that could be very interesting and funny but that's not what this movie was about. It's just an average romcom with a love story. I guess the producers were afraid to make a movie about the two main characters as they are both very famous. The whole thing made me a bit disappointed and I don�t know why it had to end like that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________  A movie is so bad that it's good!   - This movie is too long to be enjoyable. The plot is too shallow.   We are first introduced to a couple in love who live in a secluded house in a mountain, and they have a terrible accident. They are both saved by a very strange man who takes them to a remote area of the world where they live with him and his dog. The story takes a weird turn in the movie and is not interesting.     The dog gets so obsessed with them and does not want to be left alone, he attacks the couple and gets eaten by a snake. The dog and the couple then try to get to the outside world, but the man in the house has been killed by a bad guy who has been using the same road that the couple are driving on. The bad guy is a very mean guy who is trying to kill the dog to get his own hands on the dog. When the couple tries to escape from the bad guy, he catches them in a trap and they are both killed.   a couple who live on a remote mountain in a mysterious house in the middle of nowhere. They have a horrible accident, but a strange man saves them and takes them away to an island. He gives them a dog named "Dobby" to care for. This is the only way they can get out of the island, and the only time they can see the outside. It seems like a bad idea, but they are really happy about it. Then one day, the evil guy comes and wants to kill them. He gets into the house and gets Dobby to attack them, but it doesn't work. He attacks them in front of the dog, but Dobby is able to escape and kills him. The next day, Dobby goes to the main road to see the man who saved them. This man has been badly beaten up and is lying on the ground, but he is alive. The man tells Dobby that he is the man that saved them, and that he was in a car accident with the dog that day. The good man tells him that they are going to go to see a doctor to get Dobby fixed. The evil man attacks them again, and when the man is unable to kill Dobby, he throws him into the ocean.  , I saw this movie in the theater, and it was terrible. It was so boring and I felt like it was
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  "A movie is not only a representation of life. It is a mirror, a mirror that reflects back to you the image of your own life. Sometimes life looks like hell. But if you can bear the pain, then you'll find a beautiful place of peace in the center of the mirror. Sometimes it takes a lifetime to find the light in the darkness. But you can find it right now. The sun is setting on hell, and it's up to you to shine it in the right direction. "  I love this movie so much that I can't even describe how much I love it. I have no doubt in my mind that if you watch this movie at least once, you will become a fan.  And don't even get me started on the movie's soundtrack. It's absolutely fantastic. It feels like you're watching a movie from the 60s or 70s. And that's how it should be. A movie that represents a time in our lives should sound just like a movie should sound.  of course, the movie has many flaws. One of the main flaws is the way they portray Jesus Christ. In my opinion, Jesus Christ is not the God that God made him to be. In fact, in the bible, Jesus is portrayed as a very flawed character. I would argue that Jesus' teachings are the opposite of God's teachings. , which is another way of saying, "God is not good". In fact he is very corrupt. This is not to say that he is a bad person. It simply means that he has gone astray. The film shows Jesus as a person that does not know what to do when someone else is suffering. This makes Jesus very selfish and ungrateful. And he is also very impatient and impatient with the poor. This was something that was really hard for me to watch. I always thought that if Jesus did that, he would become an extremely selfish person. But he is not. He is a God of mercy. Jesus is not God of Mercy. He has done many things for his people that I find very admirable. But this does not make him good. It just makes him an imperfect man. So, this is the flaw I have with this movie. It makes me think that Jesus was a person who was a bit of a pain in the ass. . This one of the many things that makes this movie very interesting. One thing I will say is that I

The movie was really bad. I think I had seen the first two or three episodes of the TV series before I saw this one. I would give it zero stars. - The main character was not the best. I mean, the guy was kinda a dick but he did what he had to do. - I hated the actors who played the supporting characters. The main guy and the girl were really dumb. - There was nothing funny about this movie. - Nothing funny happened to the main character and the actress playing the lead actress. - No matter what the movie was about, I never found anything funny about it. - It was too long and there was not enough humor in the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.  This is a good movie, but it's not a good story. The movie is very predictable, and it's a good one. It's not the best movie, and not the worst, but neither are they the best movies of the year. The worst thing about this movie is that the movie has been remade as "The Mummy".  The movie is about a man named Marcus Brody, who has a lot of issues with his wife, Anya, and the fact that she was having an affair with a man who was a government official named Dr. Jekyll. The only thing that kept Marcus from taking his life is the fact he saw a prophecy in the bible that he was the key to defeating the demon that is trying to destroy him. When Marcus finds out that he is going to have to take on the demon himself, he realizes that it is time for him to find out who his true love really is. Marcus goes back to his home town, and is attacked by the demon. It seems that this demon can use magic, and when Marcus touches it, he has to have his heart cut out and put in a bottle. He is then taken to a place called The Monster's Palace, where he is given a book that he must read to be able to defeat the demon, who was only there to kill him. The book is written in an unknown language that he can't read. . , I was very disappointed that this movie didn't come out in the year that the "Mummy" franchise was released, because this movie would have been much better. If it was made in 2014, I'd have given this movie a higher rating. This movie isn't bad. It doesn't have all of the things that I was looking for in a movie. But it has a good script and a good director. The actors do a great job. And it's good to see that the director can still get his story done. This isn't a bad thing, but for a movie that was made to be remade, it should have been made in the first place.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What a stupid movie. I had been expecting something great from the writer, David Fincher, but all I got was a big empty room, and a lot of dialogue that was so lame that it made no sense. This was the worst movie I have seen in my life. The only reason I even saw this is because of the director. I mean the guy wrote "Fight Club". That was good! Why did he make this movie? He should have made a movie about some people who have been living in a big house for a few months and are starting to get lonely. Then, he would have made some great dialogue. Maybe he would make some of his movies like that. Then again, maybe he would try to make a movie with some real talent. What a waste of time!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie is so bad, the movie itself, the acting, the story, the production, the cinematography, and the soundtrack, all make me want to get my money back. I saw this movie with a friend and when I got home, I watched it again, and again, but this time, with my wife, and she loved it. The film is about a group of guys that are out on a motorcycle adventure, and get into an accident. There's one guy who gets killed, and they find a girl's body. The rest of the group is arrested, but they all say they didn't do anything, so there's a lot of drama. The last guy in the group gets the girl and gets arrested. I thought the movie was good at first, but after a while, I couldn't stand the movie anymore. It was so boring. There was nothing interesting about the story. There were so many characters that had no personality. It's so sad. The story was about a girl, and a guy who is just a jerk. They're just like a couple of idiots. There is one thing that makes this movie good, the soundtrack. I liked the music, the only problem I have with the soundtrack is the lyrics. The lyrics were stupid. It wasn't bad, it was just stupid. The only good thing about the soundtrack was the opening theme song. I'm so glad this movie was made. The movie was so bad and the actors were so bad. I wouldn't even go to see this movie again. I was just disgusted by the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________I love this movie. This is the movie that made me love Steven Spielberg. I loved how the plot was so easy to follow and there was so much to like. The characters were so relatable and the humor was perfect. This movie is a great example of how you can take an average story and make it great. I was a huge fan of the original, so it was great to see the remake, with its original cast and wonderful music. I'm not sure if the cast of the remake is any better, but the music was still great. This was my favorite movie of the year, and I loved it all. This film is a classic and I will be watching it again. ______________________________The score is wonderful. The music in this movie was absolutely amazing. The first half of the movie is so quiet and subdued, but it changes and gets louder and louder as it goes on. It just gets more and more intense. It's hard to describe how much I love the soundtrack. It really makes this movie so great. It makes you want to see more and to see what happens next. The ending was really great too. There is a scene in this film where the kids are playing a game. The little girl asks the other little girl to dance with her. She refuses and says she wants to stay in bed. The girl is so upset and angry that she storms out. The two girls are crying and arguing and the little girl says that they can't go back to bed. Then the little boy comes in and tells her that they are all going to have to dance now and the girl starts dancing and the whole family cheers and claps. The movie is about how these girls grow up and what they become. They don't know what they are going to become, but they have to get up and go out and dance. The whole movie is full of great moments. I really loved the scene where the little kids play in the snow and have a snowball fight. They play so well together. They all have different talents and they are great together.I also loved the story of the little girls who are the stars of the film. They are just so adorable and love each other so much. I also loved how they all get a chance to shine in the end. They can't be perfect because they will be judged by the world, but at least they can be themselves.I have to say that this movie is perfect. The cast is great, the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This is the worst movie I have ever seen."  This movie is so boring, I have no idea what the plot is about.  It just kind of repeats the same scene over and over.   The story is just like any other movie about a loser trying to get with the girl of his dreams.  This movie is bad.  "I don't have any idea why he's here."    I can't believe this movie has a rating of a 4.5.  I hope this movie will never get released, because I'm sure no one would want to see it.  If you don't know how this movie gets a 4, don't bother watching it. If you do know how it gets a 3, then you are a lucky person.

They are all over the place and don't really seem to know their roles or even care to do anything. They're just there for the laughs. The story is poorly done. It is a simple idea and doesn't really come together in a convincing way. It's like someone took a bunch of movies from the 80s, 90s, and even the 00s and put them together in one film. It doesn't work.   It also has one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard. The music just drags along. I have a hard time listening to anything but the voice-overs.   the one good thing I can say about this is that it is definitely worth checking out if you are a fan of the 80's and 90s action/sci-fi movies.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  - The plot and story is pretty bad, the whole movie has this boring plot that you'll have to watch in order to understand it.  The whole movie is full of weird stuff.    The main character is so stupid that the movie doesn't even make any sense at all.  And it doesn't make sense even when the movie starts, and the ending of the movie is very boring.  - The acting is very bad in this movie, the acting in this film is not bad, but not good either.  The acting in the movie was bad, even though the actor are really talented actors.  When the actors try to act really funny in the movies they usually end up playing bad role, because they don't have any real sense.  I recommend watching this movie in a dark room.

I was always the only kid there. I saw Return of the Jedi, then The Empire Strikes Back and the first three "Bib Flicks" with special effects. I didn't know about the prequels. Then I went to see The Phantom Menace. I still don't like it. It's just a terrible movie. Then it got better. Then we were shown a new trailer for the movie. I thought, "Wow! It's going to be good!" Then it went into a boring dialogue-less interlude, then the bad guys were introduced, then Darth Vader. He was just a big scary monster. He had no personality. The character of Qui-Gon was a weak one. Then he got killed. I knew I was going to hate this movie.  After seeing the trailer I went home and watched The Empire Strikers. It was much better. But I knew the prequel was coming. So I went online and found the trailer for Revenge of the Sith. That's when it hit me. I said, "Oh my god! It was just like Star Wars!" I went back to see it and it was just as bad. I loved it at first, then I saw it again and I was like, "Yeah, that's it! That's what Star Wars is. It makes you hate everything you love." Then it was revealed that there were two Sith Lords in the movie, Darth Maul and Darth Vader, and they were the villains. I don't want to think about it anymore. ....  As you can see, I'm a fan of Star Wars. I even have a Death Star (a Star Wars toy) on my desk. So why do I hate the pre-quels? Because they were so bad.

The actors were all awful, and the music was lame. It was really a bad film. The worst part was that the movie was filmed in a studio in the early 90's. I'm not sure how they made it look so good, the director just had a few friends on set that were all in their 20's and they all did a really bad job. It took them 2 months to film the movie and then it took about a month to edit. It's a shame that this film is still in production and people are still making it because there is so many great movies that have been made. I just hate this movie and will not be watching it again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. (You'll get an A if you can write something about a good movie.) ___________. (A B-) (It's a B-).)  No, I'm not exaggerating. I had a hard time understanding why the film was made. I mean, sure, it was a great idea, but in the end, it wasn't a good film. It wasn't even a good concept. And yet it's a film that made a lot of money for a studio, and I'm sure they thought that they could make a good sequel to it. But they were wrong. And I guess I should have known better. The problem is, the movie's basic premise is a big red herring. The whole point of the movie is that the entire movie was a dream and the whole movie was all a dream. And the characters in the film are really just dream characters. There's a character who's like a dream character, a little boy who was raised by wolves. But then he goes into the real world and he becomes a wolf. He becomes a man who fights monsters, who saves people, who kills monsters. He has the same kind of adventures that the character in the movie, Charlie, has. And then there's a girl who was a boy, and she was a little girl who goes into this world of monsters and becomes a woman. And she is a little woman who does not have any special powers. She's a good, sweet girl, and so she fights monsters. And in the middle of all this is Charlie, who's in the real World. And he does have the special power. He does have this special power, and he is the best warrior there ever was. But he's a bit more of a pacifist than Charlie is. He doesn't want to fight. He's a great warrior, but he doesn't fight. And so, as he goes through this dream, the film gets more and more and it doesn't really make a lot more sense. I would like to see the movie again. I'd like to go and see it again and see what happens. But I don't know that I would go back and see this film again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     1.5 / 5 stars  The best thing about this movie is that it is a very simple and straightforward story about a man who was once a famous assassin. He's a bad guy and he murders people, but he's not a monster. He gets a lot of sympathy from his victims. But he doesn't stop doing it, because he likes to kill people. The movie starts with a lot more bloodshed than you can handle, but you will get used to it and the story will be more and more entertaining.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________, ____________. _________, ________________. _______________________, _________________________________. ____________________________________. I don't want to write about a movie I didn't like. I want to describe a movie that I did. A movie I found so irritating that I could barely stand watching it. I wanted to throw it out and never look at it again. Yet, I had to see it. It was the only movie I had ever seen that was this bad. I have seen a lot of terrible movies. There are a lot worse ones out there than this one. The plot of the movie was so unbelievable that I almost couldn't believe it was actually happening. The characters were all so unbelievable. One character would come in and give me some good news. He would then go out and find out the news was false. Then he would come back in and find the news had been true. The guy's face would turn red. Then I would go, "What the hell happened?" Then the next character would do the same thing. And then the next. It just kept happening. There were a lot more characters that I couldn't keep track of. They were all trying to make this movie into a big deal. They kept saying it was a big blockbuster. But I knew it wasn't. I kept thinking it would get better, but it didn't. At the end of the film, they show a special effects shot of a big truck hitting the ocean. The big truck disappears into the water. It is a shot that is so bad it was funny. The movie made me so angry that I would want to scream. The ending of the end was really stupid. There is one guy who is driving a truck and he runs into a giant truck that is pulling a huge truck. The truck pulls a truck full of people that are hanging out of the back of the truck. Then the truck disappears in the water and the big truck hits the water too. It doesn't make any sense. Why would the big tractor go so fast? How does a giant tractor disappear in the ocean? Why do they just run away? Why don't they just throw the people off the back? They didn't do anything to the people. They just let them get into the big giant truck and drive away. The end of this movie was really bad. The music was bad. There was a lot wrong with the movie. I wish I could go back and change my opinion

" ~ James "I enjoyed it a lot and I thought it was a very enjoyable film. The director did a good job with the film. I don't think he used too much special effects in this one but that's not the point of the film, it's about the character development. I am not one to watch action films, I prefer dramas.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________"   This movie was not funny at all, and it had an even worse plot than most of the others I've seen. It was really hard to watch. This movie was a mess and didn't have a real story to it. The guy was the main character and the story was about his search for a girl. The only problem is that I think the movie should have been called "The Girl Who Fucked The Wrong Guy". The guy fucked the wrong girl, but the girl who had sex with him was a whore and the guy just made it up to get what he wanted. I don't think he could take the blame for it. I wish they made a new movie with a new main character, because I didn't care for this guy's character at all.   I don't understand why this guy did what he did. It's not like it was a case of mistaken identity. She didn't even give him a chance to explain himself. It really wasn't a case where he accidentally touched her, he could have stopped it at any time. He was already angry at her, and I thought it was just a matter of time before she would start something.   and the movie is just awful. It took away any potential I had for this movie. I think it was only because it's the only movie of the year that has such a terrible plot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  A movie that was so bad, so terrible, so boring, so un-film-like, so unnecessary, that I thought that the movie would never get a chance to get made again, even though I have seen it so many times. But that didn't happen, because in the late 70's a small-town sheriff was killed in his own car by a deranged woman, who then went on to commit other murders. And then, because of her insanity, the killer was not caught. And now, 20 years later, she is the sole suspect in the murders of three sheriff's deputies. And her lawyer, who was at the scene of the crime, has now been arrested for murder and is being interrogated by the police. His lawyer, along with his friend who was a friend of the killer, is trying to prove that the killer is innocent. And they don't have any evidence, not even a single hair, to prove her guilt. And, for the most part, the police and the prosecutors are determined to prove their own guilt, and to do it, they are resorting to using all sorts of tactics. For example, the wife of the husband of the woman the killer claimed to have been involved with was found dead, with a bullet hole in her back. The police are convinced that the murderer killed her, and that the woman was the one who shot her husband. The wife is now dead, but the killer's attorney is convinced that she died in the night after the murder. The murder weapon, a small knife, was found in the wife's home, and a single shot was fired into her back, with the murder weapon found near the bed. But this is not the end of it. The prosecutor is convinced, that this is a set-up, and the killer herself has been framed for murder. And he is trying desperately to get his own lawyer, his wife's lawyer, the judge, the prosecutor, the lawyer of the wife, and his own daughter, who is in prison, and try to get him out of jail, by claiming that he was framed. So much is going on that I was actually annoyed at the ending of this movie. The story is all very boring, and it just doesn't have a point. It's just there to get some kind of moral. It never really gets anywhere. It all becomes a way to get the lawyer out of prison, who's in jail for the murder of his wife
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  In a world where no one has the right to say what they want, the most important thing for a film critic to be is honest. In this film, the critics are not only dishonest, but they don't even have the decency to give a good performance to the lead actor. The story itself is not worth watching and I would highly recommend it to people who are looking for a quick thrill. But in the end, this film was not worth it.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ಡ <3 <3 - September 23, 2018, 2:04:36 AM  Gangster Squad:  (Verified Buyer) This is a solid film with good action. If you love the original series, it's a must see.  - September 16, 2018. , 4 stars  Lone Survivor: .  the most realistic and well made of all the movies about the Iraq War, it shows the real life events. The story was interesting and it gave us a lot of details about what really went on in the war. It had a lot to say about how the soldiers and their families live everyday and what the impact of war really is. It's also a good film because it doesn't try to be a propaganda film, it doesn´t try to make us believe the stories it presents. In this movie we see a war from the soldiers point of view. They feel like they have no control over what's going on. In fact, the film doesn´ts try to explain anything and in this it succeeded. The film doesn't make us sympathize with the characters, it gives us a different point of views. It shows how soldiers feel like, not only their own but the civilians, the Iraqi civilians and even the people who support them. This movie has great characters, I´m looking forward to seeing what happens to them in the next movie. This is one of my favourite movies. - September 4, 2018,.  I would recommend this movie for anyone who wants to see the real Iraq war. - August 31, 2018.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  The best thing about this movie is the plot. It's so simple and well thought out. We're given a small town where everyone is nice and friendly. One night a group of kids go camping and get into a fight with the kids of another town. One of the kids in the other town is a little crazy and shoots everyone. The cops are called and get the kids from their home. But when they arrive the other kid kills them all.  After the killing, we learn that the kids were friends from high school. They all had a similar way of speaking and were good friends. They were supposed to have dinner together, but a guy named Bill came to pick them up. He wasn't in the mood for dinner. He wanted them to do something he said he was going to do. It was a ritual that involved throwing a rock through a window.  the only problem with this movie was that they tried to make it about the murder instead of the ritual. It got a little boring after a while and I didn't care for the way they tried and failed to make the ritual seem real.  a bad film: _____  A lot of people like this movie. It has a good plot, but the plot is completely made up. It wasn't too bad in the beginning, but by the time it got to the ritual the story was completely unrealistic. If they had done something real, I would have enjoyed it more. I didn,t like the movie very much and will only watch it to look at the photos.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ I am very disappointed with this movie. I saw this on TV when it was first released and I was very impressed with the actors. I was in the theater and thought this was going to be a fun movie with a good storyline and an amazing cast. Well, it was a complete disaster. This movie has nothing going for it, no plot, no characters, no chemistry, no fun, and the story was boring as hell. I really hope the director has learned his lesson and will make a good movie again. If he does, I would give it a 3 star. I am giving this 1 star because the script was so bad. I thought it was so good at the start but the movie just went downhill. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it had some great special effects.  Helpful for a cheap thriller, but it isn't. The acting was very good in this movie, and I like the actors in this. I think it was the best cast that they have had in a while. But the movie had absolutely no chemistry. I mean, it had no chemistry between the characters at all. They were just there, all in black and white, talking. I guess I should say that this was not a good film for people who like romantic comedies. It is not really a romance, but the story is about a couple who go on vacation to Europe and there is a huge storm. They meet a girl named Eva who was the last person they saw alive before the storm. The guy she was with was the one who saved her. They then discover the storm is coming to them. When they are on the boat and all the lights are out, they get the idea to run back to the mainland. It turns out that they can't and they are all going to die. They are only saved because one of the guys on the island tells them that there is someone on a boat that they know. I don't know if this movie had a strong ending, but I guess it is okay. If you like a good romantic comedy, then you should check this movie out. It does have a good ending, though. I liked the ending because it was very sad, but not to the point where you were crying or feeling bad about yourself. If the movie ended on a happy note, then I would have been upset. I have never seen a movie that ended on such a happy ending before. It made me feel good

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this is the most embarrassing movie of all time. The worst part is that you feel bad about yourself after watching it.  If you have ever wanted to watch a good movie with an awful director, this is it. The acting is very bad. The guy is like a big ole dweeb.   I never saw a movie where he was so bad.  If you are like me and never want to see a movie again, then don't bother watching this.  There are way better movies out there to watch.  The only reason I gave it a four is because the director was a good actor.  The worst thing is that the actor should have gotten more screen time.  This movie was just a disaster.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ "The movie that made me fall in love with the film industry, is not really about the actors. It is about the art of the film. I will not go into details as to the movie's structure. The movie is made up of a bunch of episodes. The episodes were made up from the actual films that the actors had made up. And I don't mean the actors that acted in the movies, but the actors who played the parts. They were all working in a studio in a different country, which was the only place that they could get the opportunity to act in their own films. They all had a lot of fun while they were making these films. I love these actors for their performances. The only problem is that it is impossible to make them act like they are from New York. It would be a big challenge for any actor. But they have all had the talent to act and the ability to act. The best performance I saw was from the guy who plays the doctor. He is a great actor and I loved his performance. The director was also great in his performances. His acting is very subtle. I think that his acting is as good as any of the performances from this great movie." - George D'Amore, New York Times Review, June 14, 1976.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This movie is a total disaster, and a complete waste of money." The movie starts with a man who was killed by a train and was brought back as a zombie, which is why the movie is called Zombieland. He goes to a cemetery where there is a coffin containing the dead, which he wants to get into and get to know his daughter, but when he tries to get in, he sees her face, which was ripped off by a zombie. He tries to take her back to the mansion where he was, but the zombies get to him and start eating his face, so he tries the same thing to the zombies that are trying to eat his face. He then finds a helicopter, but he is killed by the helicopter pilot. Then he goes to the hospital and meets a man, who has been bitten by a mosquito and has a very serious infection in his arm, which will soon kill him. So he asks the doctor if he can use his blood as a serum for a cure, which the doctor refuses, because he is the only one who can give it to him. But a couple of days later the doctor comes back and says that he will try, so the doctor starts to inject the serum into the zombie's arm, but it doesn't help, so eventually the doctor gets a cure for the infection, which makes him turn into a zombie himself. The zombie then finds the father's dead body, and he is in love with the zombie girl, and so they start to get married. When he finds out that the girl is pregnant, he goes on a killing spree, so when he finds her again, she is with another man, so his daughter has to go to prison for a long time. The movie was not very good, and it had a really bad ending. The characters were not very developed, and they weren't very interesting. Also, the movie made a lot of mistakes, and there were some horrible mistakes that had to be explained. It was a very cheap movie, and I don't recommend this movie to anyone, and don't buy this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  I'm not going to review this movie, because it was made for money. And that's a good thing! You don't have to be a genius to know that the producers of this movie are not the smartest people in the world. But what they did is pretty genius. I'm not really going to spoil the movie, since it's a pretty good film. But it's definitely not the best film I've ever seen, or the best movie I've seen since my brother's film of the same name, which is about the death of a famous comedian. It doesn't make much sense, but that's not the point of this film. It's not even funny, but it's not a bad film either. It makes you feel bad for some characters and good about others, and I think it's very interesting to see some of the things people say about people who are famous. This movie makes you think, and it's certainly worth watching, and if you watch it with a good attitude and with a little bit of humor, it's actually not bad at all.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film about a woman that is a total bitch. The whole film is about her being an asshole. She's not the most pleasant person to talk to, and is definitely a bit of a slut. She wants to go out with a man, but he's a jerk, and doesn't want to do it. She keeps trying to talk him into doing it, and gets him to go on a date with her. She says she doesn't know why he doesn't like her, but that's the reason he's going on this date with another woman. She also has a huge group of people following her around all the time. They even keep trying to stop her on a bus. The only reason she doesn´t run off with this other guy is because she doesnít want her mother to see what a terrible person she is. The ending is also quite predictable. Itís just a really shitty movie. The acting is just terrible. The guy looks like a really weird retard, and the girl looks like she was made in a mental institution. There are some really funny moments in this film, but it's not one of the better comedies of this year.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  I hate to be a pessimist but... This is a movie about people with no life. There is no love, no laughter, no happiness, and no happiness in the end. And there is no happiness at all. I really want to like this movie but I just can't. I would like to have seen a movie that is about people who live without anything but the love of another. Maybe this movie is about a man who just wants to find a place to rest his head and to forget his problems. I feel that there are some things about this movie that are really strange. This movie makes a movie out of an old black and white film, and it's really hard to watch. I can't believe that people are willing to watch this movie. I mean, I know that there is a good movie in there somewhere but I really don't know what I'm looking at. I thought this movie was good enough to be called a masterpiece. This is probably a movie for people who are looking for a good time, or for people that just want to watch a movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ [Pleasant surprise] A lot of people complain about the movie, and for good reason. The acting, plot, and characters are all terrible. I guess the problem was the writer didn't think the characters were bad enough to warrant an hour and a half of watching them die over and over again. But you have to admit, it's fun to watch. It has a little bit of humor, but it doesn't really add up to much more than a couple of jokes. The whole "murderer and his lover" storyline was the best part of the movie. If you want to see a movie that has a lot of heart and has a good plot, give this one a try.  ...
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________  The plot of this movie is simple. A group of teenagers, most of them from the same high school, are playing a video game called 'Dungeon Keeper'. One day they find a secret entrance into a castle that they were not meant to find. The entrance leads to a treasure of incredible riches. The group of friends are excited, and even though they have never been there before, they decide to get in the game. They find out that there is a hidden treasure chest. They make the game more difficult for themselves by trying to take all the treasure for themselves. But, the treasure chest opens, and the treasure is taken by a mysterious being, who they must rescue. One of the kids gets hurt, and they need help to find their friend.   This movie is about a bunch of misfits finding out that they have been in a game that they are not supposed to be in. They are the bad guys, but the game is evil, and only they can beat the evil Lord, Lord Voldemort. They try to save the Lord, but he is always there to stop them. This movie is filled with humor, drama, and an awesome score by the legendary David Bowie.  :)   It was a great movie that had a great soundtrack by David Bowie, which is one of the reasons I liked this movie. The movie was well written, and it had great acting, acting, and acting.   the movie also had some cool effects that were just awesome to see. The graphics were great, and there were some cool scenes that were pretty well animated. The best part of the movie was when the Lord came out of the secret room and fought off the evil team of bad guys.  , and of course it was in HD. This is a great little movie. I can't believe I've never heard of this film before. It is the only movie I've ever seen where the entire cast was from the high school. It was a lot of fun to see them all together. The cast all seemed to be a bunch that could have been from that high school (with some exceptions). The movie had a lot going on, and I found myself laughing a lot. This was a fun movie that was filled with so much drama and humor. I loved this movie and I'm glad that I watched it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What was wrong with this movie? What were the actors thinking? When the movie is about a man who gets kidnapped by a mysterious, yet familiar figure, the entire movie is a struggle to get out of that dark cave. The story of the man who got kidnapped is a real one. But there is no tension. This movie is full of comedy. The movie starts off well. The characters are all in character. The action scenes are very well done. The plot is interesting. But as the movie goes on, it gets worse. The climax is predictable and it makes you want to quit the movie. And the ending is terrible. The ending is like a joke. The film never gets better. It is just a waste of time. I can't understand why a director would spend so much time on the characters when they don't get any action. The only character who is really interesting is the kidnapper. The rest of the characters are so shallow and are just there for the sake of making the movie interesting. The kidnapper never changes. He always acts like he is the main character. He never changes his personality or his behavior. I was just annoyed with this film. The cast is not the worst. They all seem to act like they are in the same movie. The worst actors are the kidnappers. The acting is not even a little good. But it is not as bad as the acting in the movie! The actors who are not good at acting can act at least a little bit. I would have given this movie 3.5 stars. But I just couldn't take it any longer. It just kept getting worse and worse. This was a real waste of my time. If you are a horror movie fan, then this is the movie for you. If not, then don't waste your time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________  The Best of Both Worlds (1977)   Overall 3/5   Pros:  - Great acting and cinematography.  Cons: , A bit of a boring story, and not the most original.   I really enjoyed this movie and I hope to see more of it in the future.   "The Best Of Both Worlds" was directed by William Shatner, and was one of the most successful films in the history of Star Trek. This was the sequel to the very popular "The Original Series" episode, "The Cage". This film is actually a prequel to that episode, and is actually called "The Next Generation" (in the UK it was called "Generations"). The plot revolves around the crew of the starship USS Enterprise and their mission to investigate a mysterious new phenomenon that threatens all life in the galaxy.  , Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) is a television series produced by Paramount Television and aired by CBS in the United States from 1987 to 1994. This series is based on a long running television series of the same name, created by Gene Roddenberry. The series focuses on the adventures of Captain James T. Kirk and his crew of seven members.   with William Shattock and Jonathan Frakes as Captain James Kirk and Mr. Spock. This film was one the most anticipated films for Star Trek fans at the time and is still one of their most popular. The first two episodes were actually not aired in the US, but they were later released on VHS. The second two episodes that were released were actually the ones that aired in North America. This second movie also takes place before "The Motion Picture" and "Star Trek: Generations". The first three episodes were the episodes that aired first on TV, while "The Final Frontier" and the next two were released on home video.   the second movie is actually about a crew of people that travel to a new planet to investigate strange occurrences that occurred there.  The first two movies were set in the 24th century, while this movie is set in an alternate timeline of 2370. This alternate timeline is one where the original series never ended and a new series called "Voyager" was created. This movie is basically a prelude to the second season of Voyager. This new show, which is called "Deep Space Nine" (which is a nickname of the original show "VOY" was never officially announced) is

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I loved this movie so much. It was great, and I'm glad I watched it. However, I thought that it was a bit much. I mean, they showed that the character of Max is an orphan and that he has a crush on his teacher, and he's been raised by her. However this is the first time in the movie that Max really looks into a girl's eyes, and it's the first movie he's ever been in where he really talks to a girl. I don't even think it's possible to get much more out of a story about a kid with a crush than that. This movie made me realize that I love the character Max and I don�t care about his feelings for this girl. He is too nice. I thought this was a great movie that I would love to watch again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________. If you're not a total asshole who hates movies, you might be able to see the movie objectively and find it to be a good movie. But then you wouldn't be able, for example, to appreciate a good old-fashioned, old-timey musical like The Wiz. You just couldn't appreciate a movie that was made in the 1930s that had a cast of mostly silent, very young actors, a story that was based on a novel, and an orchestra. The Wiz was an American musical in which a woman named Marion was trying to become a Broadway star by singing songs in a musical called The Wiz. The musical was not very good, and the film, directed by Orson Welles, was not a masterpiece. It was a classic. The music, by Ornette Coleman, is a very old-school music, the lyrics are very simple, and there are a lot of funny scenes that are based on the book by the great author, Thomas Wolfe. But the best part of the film is Marion's performance, which is not that good. She plays a young woman who was trying desperately to become famous, who is being driven insane by her jealousy and jealousy is the thing that drives her to try to become popular. The best thing about the film for me is the fact that Marion's character is played by a real woman who really got into this business. And in that way it is a true-to-life story. She was a real showgirl, and she knew how to play her parts. She knew what she wanted to do. It is an incredible performance. I loved the movie so much that I have never seen a film like it. If I were a producer and I saw a woman like Marion and she could really act, I would hire her. There is not a good woman like that in any of the films I have seen. There are very good women, but they don't know how to act. It's a pity that I never saw it, but it is true. __________ In the 1930's, a young dancer named Marion Davies was trying hard to become the next Marion Davies, the first star in The Wiz (1933). She was being driven crazy by her jealousies, jealousy of her friend (Marion), jealousy of the girls in the musical, and jealousy of Orson welles, who had just made The Wiz and was trying very hard to get a Broadway show on Broadway. Marion

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've been a long time reader of the site and was never a huge fan of it, but I never considered going to a screening until my friend told me about this one. It's a great, if a little slow, film and I was very interested in seeing what this film was about. It turns out that it is about a boy who finds out he is a witch and who gets a job in a house of witches. The film takes place in a small town in England in the early 1800s. It has a small cast of characters and we see a variety of them as they move through the story. We get a good look at the history of the witches and the family that is in control of the house and the town. There is also a great deal of mystery to the film. The main characters are very well written and their story makes sense. The acting is pretty good and the acting of the main character, who has a bit of a mental breakdown, is well done. This is a fairly slow film, but it has a wonderful ending and some good suspense. This film would not have been as good if it wasn't for the performances of the actors.    - October 1, 2011Good Film, but Needs More Action  Reviewer: Lovedit - favorite favorite favorite - June 15, 2011  Subject: A Wonderful Movie. A great film. It takes the time to get to know the characters, the townsfolk, and the witches. It does an excellent job of showing the lives of the people, and how they react to being cursed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________   The movie was good. I loved it. The only thing that bothered me was the characters. They all seemed so out of place, especially in the second half of the movie. It was hard to care about them when I couldn't relate to them. I think that was the biggest problem. I was hoping that this would be the movie that would make me believe in the good side of humans again. Unfortunately, the movie just didn't convince me that humans could be good again. I don't think that there is any hope for that.   I enjoyed the movie! It was great. The story was really good. The acting was good and the cinematography was great too. The movie was fun.

They always seemed to be set in a small town or a small village or something and you'd get the idea it was a small time thing or a rural place. But they'd make it look so far out. Then when I was older, my cousin used to take me to these little movie theaters and I was always amazed at how much more advanced things had gotten. I remember the first one I ever saw was a movie called "The King and I" that I was amazed by because it looked so realistic. The King was just as bad as he looked in the movie and it seemed to me like a real King of England who was just a very big bad ass. So I'd always say "that guy is so bad that he made the King look good". But then I'd watch other films, and I noticed that most of the bad ones seemed to use all the same techniques that Hollywood uses today. I'd say, "they should have done it like that in a movie and not just make a movie of it".  I would watch the "King and I", "The General" or "The Three Musketeers" or some of the other bad movies and I just thought it was ridiculous. They all looked so fake and I'd laugh at them and think it was so bad. Then as I got older, I realized that they were making them to get people to go see the bad movies. I thought that was pretty messed up. I had seen "The Sound of Music" but the thing about it was that it was such a wonderful movie. It had everything. I was thinking of watching it when I heard about the new version. I saw the first version of it and thought it looked very old. Then they made a new version that looked much better. But the original version was so good. So that was the first time I ever heard about "The Phantom of the Opera". So I just saw it at the movies. When I saw it, it blew my mind. I don't know why I loved it. I guess I liked the idea of the villain that was so evil that he had been given all the money he wanted and he was so angry at the whole world because he couldn't have what he wanted. I mean, the whole thing

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********  I remember seeing this movie when I was 12. I loved the movie and thought the actors did a great job. But I must say that it was not as good as the poster says. The acting is very bad. There are no lines that you would think would be good. Also there are some very bad lines in this movie that I would not say.  One of the reasons I liked the movie was because the characters were not like normal people. They were really messed up. The people they were trying to save were not normal people either. The movie ends up being very sad. I was not happy with it at all.  a lot of time is wasted and the ending was very unsatisfying. I feel like they should have made a different ending, but they had to keep it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not the worst movie ever, but it is a pretty mediocre movie.  For the most part, the movie is pretty good, but the acting is terrible.    It's so bad that I was thinking it was a real amateur movie. The characters are completely unlikable.  In fact, the acting in the movie can be compared to an amateur in front of a camera.  In the end, it is just not worth watching.  It is just a terrible movie. I guess it's only a matter of time until the new Star Wars movie comes out, and it's pretty unlikely that the movie will be as good as the first one.  But if you liked this movie, I would recommend checking out Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, it was really good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: , it's a movie that's not that bad. , there's no big action or anything,  but the movie doesn't have any bad parts either,  and there's nothing to complain about.  It's a good comedy and you can't go wrong watching it.   The movie is directed by the famous David Lynch, the guy who made "Lost Highway" and "Eraserhead" and the one who made the films with his wife,    Linda.   The story starts with   a man named   George,  who decides to buy a new car.  He goes to a dealer and the dealer,  (not really his real name),   tells him about his  car,  which is called   "       "  ."   The dealer wants him to   pay $2,300.00 dollars for the car and   (who knows the real story)   does.  George is surprised that the price is so cheap but   the dealer   says he only asks that because the car is a   real piece of art.  The next morning, George is driving his new   car and it turns out that it's   not so real after all.  I mean, it   isn't really an old car, but it's not like   it hasn't been around long.  It   has a weird engine noise,  and  it's just not the same as the other   cars.  A woman named   Sharon   drives a  car similar to George's,  but she doesn't like the way   she feels.  She wants   to get rid of the car, and George decides to help her. The next day, George and Sharon drive   from Los Angeles to California.  Then, they drive to New York.  They   start a business  and make it into a business.  Sharon then   finds out that George is the one that gave her the  car. Then, Sharon   is    able to get back her car.   George tells Sharon that they   will be back in Los Angeles the next day.   Sharon tells him that she wants to keep the car. George decides that it   isn't right,
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________  The last time I saw this film, I thought the movie was the worst thing I'd ever seen.  _____________________________________________   This is the worst film I've ever seen:  I would give this movie a B, but it is too bad, because it is a movie that should never be seen.   I'll try to explain what I hated about this film:  to make a long story short, this movie is very badly written and badly acted, and I really don't think it's funny at all. The movie is set in a world that is a little bit like Star Wars, but with an evil wizard and his minions, who are just a bunch of idiots who do everything they can to hurt the wizard and steal his magical book. It's really a story that is made up of many stupid things and most of them are not funny at ALL.   in the end, it's not a bad film, but I think it should never have been made in the first place, because I have to admit, it is not funny and it really sucks.   the only thing I like about it is the ending, and that's because the movie ends with a really great song, but in the movie, it isn't that great.   and now, the movie.   a long time ago, the wizard was looking for a book that would make him stronger, and he found it in a cave in a little town in the middle of the forest. the book was called "The Book of Secrets", and the wizard used the book to make himself a super wizard. the wizard then goes to the town, steals the book and uses the book on all the people who read the book. but when the wizard got back to the cave, he noticed that the book had disappeared, and when he searched the cave for it, the book turned out to be a little girl, who was looking at the wizard. she said that the wizard has the secret of the cave and he can't use it because he would kill the little girl if he found out where it is. but the little wizard asked the wizard to let her stay with him for a day. when the day passed by, she got sick and the little witch told her that the little magician wanted to take the book with him and he would be gone in a few days. and so she decided to wait until he comes back. and when the little man came, he said that he

I found it hard to watch the final part but I'm glad it's over. The acting is fantastic. The music is good.

It was great casting and it really made me realize how much of an impact he's going to have on the future of the horror genre. The second thing that impressed me is the cinematography of David Fincher. The first half of the movie was great but the last half was very effective and atmospheric. And the last thing I want to say about this movie, which is a huge spoiler, is that the ending was fantastic and it made me really believe that this was a movie that was going to be very well remembered.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________   "There's a reason we never saw that movie again. It is an absolute disgrace. It's the worst movie ever made. It will haunt me for the rest of my life."  (Kirk Douglas, director)   * * * *   The worst film ever made is based on a true story. On November 5, 1933, a German immigrant named Max Schmeling shot a Jewish man named Ernst Rüdiger in a bar in Hollywood. After his trial in court, he was sentenced to death by hanging. His last words were: "That's enough. I don't want to be shot." The man who shot him was a former policeman named Ernst Zündel. The film, Schmels Lied, tells the story of Schmelling and his friends. He was a man who hated Jews and had been drinking heavily before the shooting. Zünden was a Nazi sympathizer who saw the murder as a way to make the Germans feel good about themselves. He and his men set up the murder scene and made Schmeled, who was already drunk, stand in a pool of his own blood. Zundel was arrested and tried for murder. The trial took place in Los Angeles, where the judge decided that Zünder would not be hanged. He chose to execute him by shooting him through the head. The first time he fired the fatal shot, Schindler was in the bathroom. Zunel, his deputy, and one of his henchmen were already waiting for him in the hall. Schindlern, still wearing the uniform of a policeman, tried to flee but was stopped by the men. He pleaded for mercy and was shot in the back of the head by a revolver that he held in his hand. The last time Schindel was seen alive was in a hospital, dead. In addition to his other crimes, he also confessed to the murder of Ernst Rundiger.   In the years following his murder, Ernst Zunle was accused of several murders and escaped from prison. He eventually died in 1939. Schmuel's murder became known as the "Hollywood murder". The movie was shown on the big screen in 1938. A play and film were also made about it. It was then that a film director by the name of George Stevens had an idea. He made a movie that was based on the real events. He cast a Jew as Ernst Z

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _________ ________ ___________  A very boring movie. The movie was set in a castle which was haunted by a demon. When the demon comes he starts to eat the princess. A girl tries to escape but she gets caught. A man, named "Johannes", gets caught too. The demon goes to the girl and she dies. The guy runs out of the castle and runs into a forest. In the forest he is attacked by a wild boar. The boar eats his arm. The man then fights the boar and kills him. The wild boars runs off into the forest and the guy runs back to the castle. The princess is now dead and the man finds her body. The girl, who is now called "Princess Anabelle", is now a zombie.  If you want to see a movie with lots of sex and nudity then this is the movie for you. This is not a good movie for children. This movie was made in 1968 so it is not very good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Do you remember that movie that always bothered you that was too violent for your taste? I don't think it was for me at all, but then again I didn't know about the violence then either, and I was a little boy in the 90s. _______________ I think the movie was based on a real event, but I'm not sure. It was about a kid who is trying to kill his friends, and then has a knife in his hand. The girl he is trying and trying to save gets stabbed in the neck. She dies in the hospital. And it's all because he is afraid of her. The boy's parents take the knife from him and put it on the table, and he stabs them. ______________________ I thought this movie was pretty cool, but it really didn't have that many good parts. The plot is pretty bad, it's just really lame. The ending, while not a bad one, it did get a little sad and a little stupid. _______ I remember this movie, but in a way that wasn't too fond of it. The violence was very bad, and it was not very funny at all. The story was about two guys who are in a rock-and-roll band and one day their singer is killed. It's about them trying to find a way to stop the murder and also to find out who did it. It seemed to be very similar to the movie "Raging Bull". The movie really sucked me in with the bad acting and the cheesy music. The girls that were in the movie were pretty hot. ___________________________ I thought the movie wasn't very good.

The acting is so bad that I was expecting a bad film from a major studio. The cinematography is terrible and the cinematography alone makes this film worthless. The soundtrack is atrocious and the acting is terrible. A film like this should be called "the worst movie ever made". I hate it when people like this get a movie made that they can put on their DVD shelf. I don't want to see this movie again and I hope they don't make a sequel. A waste of money, bad acting and bad acting that makes you hate this movie more and more each time you see it.

The actors are terrible and they look terrible.   I can't imagine why this movie was made.  There are no good villains, no bad villains, and no good characters.  The main character is an idiot, the girl is a loser, and both of the main characters are boring.  I'm not even sure if there are any other characters. This movie has so many problems that I'm amazed that anyone made it.  This is a movie for people who hate action and just want to see some stupid comedy.  If you don't have a problem with that, then watch it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie is so bad. I don't even know what to say. The whole thing is terrible. The first 30 minutes are just a bunch of stupid people doing stupid things. They have this weird dream where they are at some sort of amusement park, but they are chased by a bunch kids with giant metal helmets. The helmet-kids start to attack and scare everyone. Then the kids start to get really dangerous. One of the kids shoots a giant bullet, which goes straight through a guy's chest and kills him instantly. The kid in the metal helmet tries to say that he was trying to stop them, but he can't even do that. They go back to the amusement park and a kid who was killed by the bullet wakes up, and then he tries to shoot them. But the guy in the helmet turns out to be the kid who shot him, so he shoots him too. Then one of the people in the amusement arcade gets shot in the face. He wakes up and tells the others to stay inside. Then a girl in the arcade gets hit in the head by a guy with a knife. The knife cuts through her head, and the guy says, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Don't blame yourself. I was trying not to hurt you, but I could not resist." Then a guy in a black cape gets shot right in the chest. The bullet goes straight into his chest, and it kills him. He then wakes up in the hospital. One girl wakes up from a coma, and she says, with a sick smile, "They had to make this movie to scare the kids away." Then the movie is over. _________ This movie has nothing going for it. There are some cool, fun scenes, but the rest is just stupid. The only thing this movie has going for this is the fact that it has a cool ending. _________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ It is a bit long, but if you like movies that take a while, this movie will have you hooked for hours. The movie is all about two brothers, one a hero, the other a villain. The first brother wants to find out who killed his parents. The second brother is a criminal. The two brothers set out to solve the crime. However, there is more to the story than meets the eye. The story has a bit of a plot, but that is not what keeps you interested. It is all the twists and turns and the great acting. This movie is not for everyone, but it is worth the watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. I know, I know...but I don't think I've ever been so offended by a film as I was by this one. The movie begins with a montage of all of the horrible things that have happened to the characters, then suddenly the movie starts to become something it's not. The story begins with three little girls, and a father and his son, and soon, it takes on a life of its own. It becomes a story of how these children cope with their loss, how they come to understand that they are not alone in their suffering, and how they learn to live with this loss, to move forward, to fight against their sadness, to live their lives as they wish. This is a story that was never meant to be told. The author (who was an author herself) felt that this story was too sad, too realistic, and too personal. But this movie, in its entirety, is an incredible story, that does not attempt to hide the tragedy of what happened, and is a beautiful movie in its own right. It is an amazing movie that is worth watching, even for the people who think that they know what a movie is supposed to be.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Why would you give this movie a chance? If it was any good, it would have been a comedy. There's nothing funny about this movie. It is one of those movies that you see and you know immediately it is going to be a bad one. The dialogue is so poorly written, the acting is so bad, the movie is just a complete mess. The plot is so badly conceived and executed. The only reason the movie even exists is to have a character that nobody likes on screen. You don't get to know much about him, other than he is a loser, and that he gets in a car accident and then goes insane. This is a very unoriginal idea that isn't even worth trying to make good. It doesn't even make sense that this guy is going crazy because he got in a accident and he got out of it. I know that people do get in car accidents, but this guy never even gets a scratch! This guy is not going crazy, he's just a loser who is going nuts because he's so stupid he didn't know what to do. The movie is so unoriginal that I don't even understand how anyone thought this was a good idea to try to make a movie out of. The whole movie is made out of cliches. It's just so bad that it's hard to believe that this movie even existed. It was such a waste of a script and an expensive movie to make. If you want to see some bad movie that you don't want to watch, check out the stupid "Gremlins" remake. If it is any good at all, I hope you enjoy it!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Share:     Share:  By Eileen O'Leary  The latest installment of the "Hunger Games" series is already proving to be one of the biggest box office flops of the year. And while the movie is no stranger to critics, many have slammed its poor production values and an all-too-easy, predictable narrative. But for some, it is also a film they simply can't ignore.  "It's a movie about a bunch of people whose only reason for living is to have children," says David K. Bradley, the senior editor at the Huffington Post who has written about "Hunting Games" for more than a decade. "It's very much a message movie, in a way. You see that message repeated over and over and it doesn't have a lot of humor in it. I find it pretty depressing."  Bradley points out that it is an important film that raises important issues. He says the film is not just about a girl who lives to fight in the Games. It's about the idea that all the people who make up the world, no matter how strong or brave or rich, cannot escape their destiny to become mothers and fathers.  and that "Hunning Games" is also about the social pressure that can make people feel like they are unable to find meaning in their lives. .  of "Huning Games," a film by Suzanne Collins, who wrote the book for the film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________  A film about a woman (Amy Adams) who can't live a normal life. Her daughter has died, and she's a widow. And her job is to live her life by being a single mom. And then she meets the man who has been a stranger all her life. So she lives a normal, happy life and then she has a bad day. And she goes to a movie theater to see a film with her friends. She sees this guy who has done nothing to her except give her life a little push and she doesn't like it. But he is charming, and it's all love. And they go on this wonderful movie, and they make it, and I think it's just an amazing movie. But then the movie is over and the guy leaves her at home and she starts crying. And I think she is going to get up and leave, but then she finds out he is not going to be there. He is going back to work and she has to go back to her normal life, and that's what I thought was sad. Because I know that for her it's not normal. She's just a woman who can do whatever she wants. She is happy and she loves her family. And yet it's very sad.  Sign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news! Sign up for our Email Newsletters here.

But the characters are just very very stupid and pretentive, and all of them are the main characters. They're all just very annoying. And all of the people that are talking in this film are just really really annoying. The only reason this movie has any sort of good comedy is because of the main character, and that's the director's idea of a joke. I think the only reason why this movie is funny is because the actors are playing these very silly roles. There's one guy who is just so funny, and he's the only one that's actually funny. So the other people in this comedy are just kind of funny, but they're just so pretentious. They have to do these ridiculous roles just so that the audience will laugh, but then they're supposed to be the main comedic characters. I really think that the director was trying to make this movie as funny as possible, but he just didn't know what he was doing. I can't even imagine that any of these people had the ability to make any of the roles they're in as funny. They are just so silly. If you liked the movie, then you should really watch the sequel!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. _________. _______. ____. _____. ___________________. _____.___....___.. ____ _____________.  It is not so much the movie that's bad. It is that the way the director tried to make a very good movie into something so much worse than the original is unforgivable. A good movie should be fun to watch, a good movie makes you want to go out and see it again and again. This movie is just too much. This is not a movie you can sit down and enjoy for a good hour. The movie is like a big fat brick in the wall. You can see a movie that is bad, but this one is just bad. I can't even tell you how many times I had to force myself to finish watching this movie because I kept thinking that I should have stopped at the beginning. I was too much of a masochist. It was too hard for me to go through this movie. I had a hard time even going to the theater. The audience was not even happy. I'm sorry, but the audience at the movies should be happy. This was a movie for the people who are too lazy to go to the movies, and it was just too hard to watch. This doesn't even deserve a 4/10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ The worst movie I've ever seen. __________  I've seen the film several times over the years and always found it interesting, but never thought it was bad. In the late 80's, there were some bad, but interesting movies. This one is certainly not one of them. It is a complete and total disappointment. I have never seen anything like it in my life. This movie has no story and no plot. It has no action, no suspense, no tension, no drama, and no excitement. It's a mess. The special effects are terrible, and the acting is just so-so. I can't believe it's been 30 years since this was released. It will forever be one of my all-time favorites. It should never be seen again. It truly is a disaster. It was never meant to be seen on the big screen, and yet, that's what it became.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _________ _______________ _____________ ____________ ______________ ___________ _________. This is a bad film. It has a lot of problems. One of them is the script. It is not very original. You can tell that this script is taken from the movie "I don't want to go" (which I have seen). You can also tell that the writer of this movie (Sally Kellerman) is not that good at writing. I can't say this is a good movie because it is not a good film.  It is a movie that tries to be all things to all people. It tries to have action, drama, adventure and romance. It attempts to have great songs and it even attempts to be funny. All in all it is a mess. , in a film called, in which the main characters are played by Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer, as well as by Michael Rooker. The film begins with a couple of days in the life of these two women. One day the woman (Sarandon) is on vacation and finds herself alone in the house of her friend, (PfeiffER). The other woman (PFEIFFER) is also alone in her room. This is when things start to get strange. It turns out that the woman has been having an affair with her husband, and she has a surprise for him. This surprises her husband and he asks her to get out of there. As soon as she leaves her friend calls her back, and the woman is told that her husband has just died. Now it's time for the woman to do what she has always done in her life. She has to go to the cemetery to find her husband. The movie has a few strange things going on. The acting is bad, the story is a terrible mess and the dialogue is so stupid that it is hard to even understand. I would have to say that it does not belong in the genre of horror movies. I think that this is not an original movie. The story and the acting is not good, and they tried to add a good story to a movie. Unfortunately this movie has nothing going for it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********  "It's not what you think." This is the most common phrase that I've heard in a film review. A good movie is usually better than you think, but that doesn't make it a good movie. *************  What is "It's Not What You Think?" **********  In the book of Proverbs, the "wise" man advises, "Be not wise in what you ask for, or you'll get it." The same goes for movies. *****************  The reason for the "it's not" in the title is that it's not like the movie itself is bad. It's just a movie. It doesn't mean that it isn't a good film. It means that it was not as good as it could have been. It could have used a bit more time and thought. The ending is unsatisfactory. ************  Conclusion: **************  It's Not what You Think is an odd movie. The film is not the main event. The acting is uneven. There are several flaws. But the movie is a fun ride, with plenty of jokes and a few surprises. It is definitely worth a look. ______________
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  (5/10)   The story is pretty good, it's not the best, but I enjoyed it. The story is very much based on a true story and it is about a woman and her daughter. It takes a very long time to get there. It is very good to see a good story. I think it would be more good if they showed the girl in the movie when she was 5, or 6 years old. The girl has a hard time in school and she is very smart. It was hard to see her in the movies. It's also a shame they didn't put the girl and her father in a better relationship. I don't think the father was very good in the marriage and the girl was very unhappy with him. I also didn't understand why they didn`t show the girl as a little girl in her underwear. The movie has lots of sex scenes. They are not very good. It could be better, but there were good scenes with the father and his daughter. The scenes with other people are very good as well.   I enjoyed the movie, but it was a bit hard to watch it. It made me think a bit about a relationship.   the only thing that bothered me is that the guy that killed the woman was not put in jail. I thought they should have put him in jail, and then he would have been able to see his daughter for a few more years.

If I had one complaint, it would be that the story didn't really go anywhere. We did get to see a little of what happened, but nothing really happened. I think that is why I liked the movie. The only way I could see it going a different way would have been if they were going to show a couple more scenes and if we were going get to know more characters. I do not think that would have worked.

I don't know what they were supposed to do in this movie. They didn't even do anything. I guess they couldn't translate anything. This movie was really bad. It is just a bunch of Chinese actors acting. I hope they sue the Chinese producer for this movie because it was so terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I saw this at a screening in a theater in my home town, and I was not impressed. The film is nothing more than a long-winded and confusing love story between a young man and his girlfriend that never gets to the point of romance."   -Tina St. Marie, New York Post   "It's a love story that doesn't really work. There's some good acting, some good scenes, some great music, and some nice effects and effects work. But the story doesn't work and the acting just gets in the way. You can see why people like it. But it's just not worth the time. I was very disappointed." -Dan Smith, USA Today   "[A]n impressive and thought-provoking film, which I think is better for its lack of a strong point of view.

We both thought it was really funny, but my mom was a little disappointed when she didn't see the ending. I think my mom saw something different in it than me. My mom doesn't get a lot of funny movies. She was very funny during the whole movie. It was a bit sad. I felt sorry for the poor guy. I thought it would be better if he had not gotten involved with a woman. I feel it was a bad idea to have him involved with her. She kept trying to get him to do it. Then she did it. It wasn't very funny. She probably just wanted to make a good movie. She said she wasn't looking for a husband. She just wanted a guy that would keep her happy. She's probably not going to get a husband with this movie. I don't think he's really that good looking.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Do not watch it if you are not a fan of horror. I'm not sure why I didn't see this before. The story is really simple: a couple of days after a brutal murder, a mysterious woman appears before a group of young men. The young men are a little more scared than the rest, because they are the only ones in the area with supernatural powers. And so, the girl appears and says "I am the witch of the forest" and she starts to transform them. Then she goes to the house and takes a shower. And a second later, the house is destroyed. But before she can leave, the witch is chasing her. She manages to escape with the help of a strange boy and goes to a house where the man was living. But it is not the man who is there, but another girl who was a child before the murder. The girl tells the boy that the house was destroyed by the witch, but that it was a dream, and that the real house will be built in the morning. She then takes the boy back to the witch's place and starts to tell her a story about how she killed her parents and how she had been locked in the house. But, the boy doesn't believe her, and he leaves the house to go to sleep. When the girl wakes him up, she starts saying "I can't stay here anymore, I have to find a way out of the house" and the boy starts to leave. And when the girl is almost out of sight, the man returns. He is afraid, but he says that the girl will not be able to find her way out and will have to stay here. The man gives the girl a map of the town and tells her that they will go to the river to cross the bridge and then they will see the house, which is across the river. The witch appears and is about to catch the boy when the man tells her "It is the house of the man you killed. Go away!" But the girl doesn't listen, and runs away. The next morning, the two men wake up and go to a strange house which is also across the bridge. The first one looks inside and is amazed at the amount of gold and jewels that they find. The second one says "Who the hell is this? And where is the girl?" The woman answers that the boy who is gone has been kidnapped by the witches and that they are going to destroy the world, so

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a boring and slow film, with a dull script, mediocre acting, and a generic setting. The plot is simple and has nothing to do with anything else in the movie, but it is one of the more popular movies of the decade.  You can get this movie for $1.00, and I wouldn't recommend it.  The main character of the movie is a man named John Davenport, a lawyer who, for some reason, decides to move to Los Angeles in order to work for his uncle.  He arrives in LA and immediately starts seeing women, but after a while, he is driven crazy by the women, and decides to commit suicide.  This is one hell of a movie, and it has a lot of good jokes and good acting.  The film is pretty much just an excuse for the main character to talk to women.  It's a shame because the movie has some interesting ideas.  I would've loved to see the movie a few years later, when it was a little more interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. __________. _________________... ____..,,,. _____. _____. __________________________.,., __. _______.. __.. _______...__. __ _______ __. |__. |__|. ______.. ______.. | | |. _____________________________________________________________________________| In all seriousness, I think this film is about as bad as it gets. There are no redeeming qualities to be found here, only the worst. The film is really just an excuse for a bunch of guys to have a good time, as it takes a lot of time for them to really get into it. If there was one thing I really liked about the film, it was the fact that it showed us a side of the military that most people never get to see. It shows that there is more to the military than what is seen on TV, and it makes us care about those who are in harm's way. I just hope this film doesn't inspire anyone to join up or try to go through a similar process of training. It's just a bunch guys trying to get laid, but I don't see what all the fuss is about. They do have a lot to talk about though, and a few of them do show some promise. It might just be me though, but when it comes to the action, the action is terrible. It really is almost like a poorly choreographed porno. They are pretty much just sitting there shooting at each other, and sometimes, the camera can't help but show us the back of one of them as he has a quickie. The only time they actually have to do anything is when they get into their vehicles and they are chased by other soldiers. The last time we actually see a soldier get hurt was when one of the guys gets shot in the arm and the other guy shoots the man that shot him. This film really is just about a bunch boys trying to hit on a chick. In the end, the movie is a complete mess and not worth a second of your time. If you are looking for something fun to watch, this is probably not the film for you. If, on the other hand, you are into action films, then by all means, give it a try. Otherwise, I would just recommend you skip this film. I'd be lying if I said I enjoyed it, but it really isn't worth the time
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ In order to be a professional actress, it takes a lot of hard work, dedication, and talent. And that's exactly what the woman in the film "Bitch" has in spades. The story revolves around a woman who was once a big star in Hollywood and went on to make her way to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting. But this all came to an abrupt end when she found out that her husband was cheating on her and went insane. She went on a murderous rampage and began destroying the lives of everyone she came across, including her husband. The film follows the woman as she goes from acting to being a crazy killer who kills her victims. The movie itself is nothing special but the movie is just a really bad movie, full of pointless gore and a bad script that tries to be too smart. The acting is terrible and it is obvious that the director, George S. Patton, did not do his homework as he hired a bunch of actors that do not even look like real people. The script was pretty funny at times but I felt like there was so much pointless gore going on in this movie that I really could not help but hate it. Overall, "Bitches" is a bad film and you should not waste your time with it.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. That's the only thing you can really say about this film. I guess that's not very negative, considering it's about a bunch of misfits trying to save the world. It's a pretty decent film, with some very good action and some really bad acting. The best character, in my opinion, is the guy who's played by the late James Coburn. The rest are all pretty bad. The two female leads are not as good as the male ones. The only thing that made me laugh out loud was the scene where they're trying to rescue the girl who was abducted by aliens. She doesn't want to get rescued. I had to turn it off at that point. I didn't know if it was a good idea or not, but it's funny as hell. It was a shame she didn't have a better character. But at least the film didn't waste any time getting to the alien invasion. The alien was played by a real man, and it was hilarious. The one scene I didn?t like was when the alien was trying to steal the power generator. I just don't like when aliens steal power. It takes away from the story, but not enough to ruin it. The movie has great special effects. There was a huge explosion and a very cool space ship. I also liked the scene when the aliens invaded Earth. It has a very good idea, and I think it could be very interesting to see what the human race would do in the face of such a huge threat. I don't know what the sequel will be about, but I think the movie would be better if it were about this threat. It seems that this movie was made in such a hurry that they didn't do enough research. I think this movie could have been much better.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ is a great example. It's an entertaining story of a man with a high-powered job that he enjoys and an annoying girlfriend who is obsessed with him. Unfortunately, his girlfriend doesn't like his job, and in order to make her more tolerable, he decides to sell off his company, which results in a massive and devastating fire. After he and his girlfriend get out of the fire, they find that their company has been completely rebuilt. They then discover that their new company's employees are all clones of them. After realizing this, they begin to realize that there may be something seriously wrong with this world. The movie does a great job of showing that there is a way to fix this world, but it isn't easy. The way the movie deals with the cloning problem is pretty ingenious. There are clones of almost every major character in the movie. However, they aren't the same people. Some clones have an accent and some have a different look. Some have very different personalities from one another. The clones are always in the same place in the story, and the clones are never the same person. This means that the movie doesn't have to focus on the clones in the most important scenes. In fact, it can even have scenes about the clones that the audience isn't necessarily supposed to know about. It can even use clones in more subtle ways, such as having a clone of a girl talking about her relationship with her boyfriend, but still showing that she's in love with her guy. _____________ isn't the only movie to deal with cloning. __________________ is another movie about a guy who goes to see a clone play. The cloning is more subtle in this movie, as there are actually multiple clones in this story. However they are all very different from one-another, and it's hard to know if they are actually clones or not. _________________________ is another example of how to deal a cloning problem. The movies follows a young man who has a great career in his future. However his girlfriend has a hard time accepting him because of his lifestyle. The problem is that he has a cloning job. Unfortunately it turns out that the clone has a very low-level job and is more of a grunt. However because of this, he can easily make money by cloning people and selling them to a factory that makes clones for the higher-level jobs. The film deals with this problem in a way that is completely different from the movie _______________.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Wings" is a very entertaining movie, which has a great concept and an exciting plot. Unfortunately, the film gets off to a very bad start. The first half of the movie is just a long intro to introduce the main characters, but there are a few scenes which should have been cut out, such as the one where the woman is told that the other woman is married. After that, we see the main character in action. He fights a few henchmen and the one who tells him to kill the henchman is played by the one playing the lead, who is obviously too old. This could have been better than it was, as the hencheman is a decent villain, and the action is decent. The movie then goes on a long stretch where it is just like all the other movies in the series. The main characters do not get anything done. Then it cuts to the movie's climax and it becomes a little boring. The ending was disappointing as well, as it did not give any kind of closure to the story, but instead just leaves it. This would be a great movie to watch with a group of friends, as there is a lot of action and the characters are fun to watch. However, I would not recommend this to anyone who does not like action.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ I was hoping for a good movie, and this is what I got. The plot is a total disaster. There is no plot. This is not a movie about the military. This movie is a disaster. It is about two brothers, who are from a village in the woods. They are good at making friends and getting people to trust them. But in the end, they are totally useless and stupid. The story is the stupidest thing ever written. It makes no sense. I don't know how the movie got made, but they should have cast a black man to play the part of the brothers. It was like they wanted a white guy to play a black guy. The guy who plays the brother, was no better than a black actor. The movie was so stupid, that I am not sure if the movie will ever be shown on the big screen. This film is nothing more than an exercise in stupidity and black stereotypes. It really was a shame that it was made and released. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

There was so little plot and nothing exciting happened in the movie. The actors did not have much to do and they did not do anything to help the plot. The movie was very confusing to me and very disappointing. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. ***** I think the best way to describe this movie is that it was an action movie that was made in the 1960s with no special effects or anything else. It is just a simple action movie. There is no story, no characters and no plot. There are only gunfights, explosions and some people falling down. It was very cheap to make and very boring. I have to say that I was very disappointed with this movie and that is why I give it a zero. ****** I give this movie a 3 out of 5.

It was like a book for me, which I am always looking for in a movie. It made me want to find out the story behind this movie, the mystery behind this girl, and how she was the one that made all the bad people leave. I loved it.  What I really liked about this movie was that it was more of a book. There were many scenes that just didn't seem to make sense in the movie. The ending felt a little abrupt. This movie was written so well that you don't feel like you're reading a book anymore. I just loved this movie.  to make this movie more exciting, I would have loved to have seen a little more of her, but I also really liked the ending of the movie because she finally gets to do something.  a lot of the people in the world were trying to get the attention of this girl and it shows how she makes them feel. I loved this story and I hope that someone out there likes it.

You don't even have to use the power-up or you can use the other power-ups.  of course you can get a good score with the first power-uup. Also, it's easy to get a 100, and it's impossible to get 1,000, but if you want a good game I recommend the other one, it has a better score.  to get the most points you need to do as many tricks as you can, so it's really hard, but I really liked this game, and the first one was the best.   -H.K. Send to buddy | Posted on 5/16/2003 2:24:24 AM  the first and second ones were better, and even the third one is good. , I don't know, I guess it's better for a game that you can only use one power-UP at a time.  the only one that can be useful is the 1,001, so I guess if you are looking for a good one to get you can go for that one.  for the second one you can play the first two or the third ones and get some more points. it's a shame that this one is so difficult.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  "Dirty Harry" (1939)  (The story of a woman's struggle against a ruthless and powerful crime boss; it is the first time that Harry S. Truman plays the lead role. The film has some of the most brutal and brutal sequences that ever appeared in a motion picture. A gangster murders his wife, then the wife's mother. She kills him. She takes her own life. This is just one example of many scenes that are so horrific and graphic that the audience was screaming for the lights to go on. The violence was so intense that the director, Alfred Hitchcock, had to use a number of different camera angles to tell the story.)  The film was so violent that it made the then-unknown actor Robert Mitchum cry during a rehearsal. The only problem is that he had to cry because he knew he was about to be killed on the screen. Mitchum later said that he "had a fear of death", which is probably why he decided to stay in the film for so long. The reason that Mitchum stayed in the movie for so many takes is that, at the time, the film was considered to be too violent for young viewers. He said that the only reason he stayed was because he wanted to make a film that was "in the tradition of silent films". The film was finally released in America in 1940, but Hitchcock was so worried about the film being shown in America that he changed the ending. The ending was changed to show Harry S Truman as a hero instead of a villain, but that didn't stop it from being banned from showing in American movie theatres. It has been banned ever since.  Although it has been over 80 years since the film came out, audiences are still screaming for a remake of this masterpiece. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** It's a horrible movie. The story line is the worst thing ever. It doesn't have any suspense or suspense to it. The movie was just bad and the plot was dumb. There were no surprises or plot twists that made it different from anything else. It just ended on a cliffhanger and then left you hanging there. I hate it. I don't even care what happens. I can't even watch it now because I was hoping it would be good and it's so awful. It has nothing to do with my life or any of my problems. It makes me feel bad about myself because I wasted my time on it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this is an unprofessional, stupid, terrible movie, which I found completely uninteresting.  I didn't care if it was bad or not, I had no interest in watching it.    I'm not sure if I was a little disappointed by this movie because of the title or not.  I don't think that it was supposed to be about a couple or something.  If it was, I didn't really care.  Maybe it was for a comedy?  This movie is a terrible movie that I never will watch again.  There are too many bad jokes and I can't understand why they did it. This movie had too many problems.  The bad jokes are very repetitive and unoriginal.  In the beginning of the movie, I'm sure the director was trying to make this movie funny.  But, I think that he failed and he was not good at what he did.  It's also very difficult to understand what is the point of this movie.  Some scenes were good but others are just bad.  Also, the acting is terrible.  Most of the actors are just too annoying and boring.  Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I've been watching the worst movies ever since I was a little kid. I love horror movies but they always seem to be so over the top and over the Top that they're no longer scary. This movie was the first one I had heard of and I was expecting a horror movie about a kid who can't stop talking about a ghost but I didn't expect a movie that was as bad as it was.   The movie is about a young girl who is getting ready to start high school. She has a crush on her boyfriend's friend but she's also afraid of what he's going to say to her when he comes home. She's convinced that he's talking about something bad that has happened to her. When she goes to the store, she gets a call from her boyfriend saying that he has found something in her room. She gets a little freaked out but then decides to keep going to school. The story is pretty good but the acting is terrible. The movie just seems to take itself way too seriously.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know about you, but I was looking forward to watching this movie. It was a good film. It had some good acting and a few funny moments.   The plot was okay. It seemed to be on a mission to show us what it would be like to live under a dictatorship, but that wasn't it's real purpose. The main character, a man named Burt (a man who looks like Tom Cruise) is being blackmailed by a guy who claims to be a spy. Burt is being pressured to get into the spy ring. The plot is good, and the story itself is very good. But there was something very weird about it. The story was told in the form of a book called "The World of Burt". The book is about how Burt's life was going to change when he moved from his home town to the city. He was to have a new job, a new apartment, a better car and new friends. His wife, Laura, was to leave him. Busey's character was supposed to be his replacement wife. The movie was made for Burt to live the life of a spy, but Burt didn't do it very well. The characters seemed to change and Burt was no longer a man who had a clear vision. He had a lot of emotional problems. He began to believe that his friend was actually a spy who had taken him under his wing. The whole movie seemed to revolve around this one character. Basey's role was so small, I couldn't even see his face. Boseman is good as the spy. The action scenes were good. They were done with style. The way Burt moves was great. It's also funny when Burt tells his boss that he wants to meet his girlfriend. The only problem with the movie was that it didn't make any sense. It made no sense as to why Burt would want to move. It also made no logical sense as how a man like Burt could live under this dictatorship. The ending of the movie felt like a slap in the face. It came out too fast and there was nothing that made me feel anything. The last ten minutes were just a joke. Buses are a thing of the past. I don't like the movie. I didn't even like the first ten minutes. It didn't have any redeeming features. I would only recommend this movie if you really want to see

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ I'm not going to lie, this movie was not what I expected. The idea of a movie about an insane person who is crazy and just a big dumbass, who has to deal with his own crazy family and their crazy ways, and who goes to therapy, but it seems that he has been mentally handicapped since birth. I found it very odd that this movie took a very dark subject, and made it into a comedy. There are some very funny moments in this movie, but I was never able to get into the story. I was actually afraid that it was a cheap way to make a movie that was just a bunch of people who would do anything to get a laugh. But it was not. This movie is actually very well acted and the performances are really good. The performances are actually very good and there are some really good acting performances in this film. The only reason why I didn't like this movie is that I found the writing to be very cheesy. I actually found myself laughing at some of the jokes, but then I found myself getting very depressed after the movie was over. There is a scene in this show where a character is being interviewed, and the interviewer is asking him what his name is. The character replies "David. David Bowie". The interviewer asks him what that means. David replies "It's a very strange name. It's very Bowie". Then he asks him who he is going to play in a movie. He replies "I'm going to be in the movie. I'll be playing a role. It will be a very funny role. And it will be called 'The Man Who Fell To Earth'". I found this scene very strange, and I think that the writer, who was not very good at writing, put a lot of thought into the line "I'll be in a big, goofy, stupid movie about a man who falls from the sky. The man who fell to earth, he'll be an astronaut". ______________________________________________________________________ (10/10) I just can't say enough about this movie. This is a must see movie for any fan of David Bowie, and his music. The movie itself was good, but the movie that this film is based on was very good. I love the character of David. The actor who played David is a very good actor. The acting was very well done. I thought that this is a good movie, and one that anyone who loves David Bowie would enjoy. This film
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ (That movie was so-so, and the worst part of it is that I hate the actors, I hate that they made me watch this movie) The film has two scenes in it, and one of them is a lot better than the other, but neither is good enough to make the film worth watching. The first one is a sequence from the movie 'The Day After Tomorrow' where the earth is saved and the aliens get the glory. But then a lot of stuff happens which makes the movie look like a rip-off of 'War of the Worlds'. This scene, which is more like a sequence in 'The Fly' than in '2001', has some great shots of the moon and the earth. The problem is that this scene is totally out of place in the movie. It's like the movie was trying to put it in but could not, and decided to just throw it in there to make a cheap movie. This scene is just a horrible mess of bad actors trying to make some kind of good movie. The movie ends with a great sequence from 'The Third Man' in which the alien queen is trying to escape from a spaceship, but it is very badly done, and makes the alien seem less scary. The ending of the movie makes the aliens look more like the villains of a bad 'Star Wars' movie than like a cool space-faring alien race. The worst thing about this movie is that the actors who played the aliens are awful. The best thing about the movie is the ending. I would not recommend watching this movie unless you want to see some of the worst films ever made. The reason that I gave it a 3 is because there is a scene in the beginning of the film, where the alien princess is running around, and it is so bad that it makes me think that the movie could have been made much better, but they just had to throw in a scene like this. I think this movie would have been a lot more fun if it had not been so cheesy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************* This movie was so bad it had to be made into a documentary about how terrible movies are. There is a whole scene in this movie that was so ridiculous and stupid that I thought the movie was made by a 5th grader. The movie was supposed to be about a "dolphin researcher" who had one of these whales as a pet. But it was a dolphin that was killed by a killer whale. He was supposed in the movie to have written a book on this dolphin. The story about the movie is that they got permission to go to the ocean to film the killer whale killing the dolphin. They got on a boat and were going to get off the boat when they saw the killer whales coming. They jumped into the water, and that's when the movie ends. But I can't watch a movie like that ever again. *****

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. Please stop making movies like this.  The movie starts out with a nice action scene and a cool music track. I thought it was really cool that it was filmed in a desert. I was really impressed with the movie's visuals and the direction. I felt like the camera was very good and I really liked the characters and their roles. The main character of the movie, the boy (played by a very talented young actor), is really good. He is a good student who is a great athlete and an amazing artist. He loves his family, friends, art and his dog, Zora. He wants to become a great painter and his family thinks he will be too crazy to make that goal. One day he is asked by a girl to make her a painting and he becomes addicted to painting. One night he goes to a beach and sees a mysterious object, the object seems to be a woman. This woman tells him to come back to the beach at midnight and that he will get what he wants. At midnight, the girl disappears. The next day he has a dream where he sees a woman in the same place and in the exact same dress. That night he gets drunk and goes to his friend's house to sleep. When he wakes up he discovers the girl in his bed and they kiss. Then he has another dream and this time he has sex with the girl. He wakes up the next day and the girl is gone. The boy is really scared and is really upset that he couldn't have the girl, but it is too late, the woman has taken him away. The woman has now given him a key to the apartment and he is free to go. He goes to the subway and finds the key on the wall. He enters the apartment. He notices that it has a woman's face. The door is unlocked and the woman comes out of the bathroom. She is wearing the same dress and her name is Zora, she looks really cute and innocent. She says that she loves him and that she can't leave him. She goes to sleep and the boy has a nightmare that the woman is trying to kill him and he doesn't want her to. He runs away but she is waiting for him in the parking lot. She hits him and knocks him down. She makes him walk to the train station and he can't find his keys. He calls his friends and they come to help him find the keys but they have to follow him through

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________  The film starts with a beautiful sunset and a small village on a small lake. A boy named Nick (played by Liam Neeson) is walking home when he is attacked by a wolf. Nick manages to fend off the wolf, but is nearly eaten. Nick and his parents get him to a small cabin in the woods where he is left alone with the wolf. After several hours of running from the wolf and eating some wild berries, the wolf finally goes away. Nick goes back to his home to eat some berries and find his parents. Nick's mother, a teacher, thinks Nick has been acting strange. His father, an engineer, thinks he is just sick. It takes a while to figure out that Nick is actually possessed by the wolf's spirit. The next day, Nick comes home to find his mother's head missing and the cabin has been burned down. He has gone insane. In the cabin, the father's computer is found and his body thrown into a fire. The ghost of Nick's father appears to him and tells him that the wolf is coming back. The father tells Nick that his daughter, Olivia, is in danger. They both believe that the father is a traitor and will kill Olivia. Nick decides that he has to go to the mother's cabin and save her. After running through the woods for several hours, the pair reaches the cabin. They find that Olivia has been murdered and there is a dead woman in the fireplace. A dead cat and a dead bird are found in the cabin as well. Nick grabs the dead cat from the fireplace and they both run outside. The mother, who is also a vampire, follows Nick outside and they run through the forest for a while. They finally find the father and they tell him about the wolf coming back and he believes that Nick killed Olivia. Olivia and the father have a conversation and Olivia reveals that she has been a vampire for many years. Nick agrees to help her kill the wolf in exchange for killing the father. Nick tells the father that the vampire will feed off his life force until he dies. The two fight, but Nick is still too weak to stand up to the father, and he eventually succumbs to his injuries. Olivia kills the father in a fit of rage and the mother gives Nick her blood. The vampire then takes Nick's soul and eats him, becoming his new host. The movie ends with a scene of the father watching Nick's corpse on a tree stump. The film also
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it's not a great movie by any means, but it's not the absolute worst movie I've seen in my life either.  In fact, there were a few things about it that were really fun.  "It's about an ex-convict who takes the name of a dead man, and when he tries to pick up a woman on the street he has a change of heart.   I thought this was a pretty solid idea, and even the plot was pretty good.  I just didn't get the humor in this movie.  Even though this movie had a good idea, I just wasn't feeling it.  The plot is pretty good, but the acting just didn 't work." My review of this movie is going to be pretty negative, because I didn't enjoy it. I know, that's not really fair, because it was a decent movie, but I just can't say that I did.  This movie has a lot of good points, but one of the things that I don't like about it is that the characters are really flat.  They don't really have any personalities, and you don't know who they are.  When I first watched this movie I was really disappointed, but after watching it a few times I realized that the writing wasn't the worst thing about it. In fact, the writing in this film was a lot better than what you would normally expect.  In this movie you don 't really get the sense that the guy was a terrible person.  He was just kind of a loner and really had no friends, so the writing was a bit of a mixed bag.  There was no real comedy in this flick.  It's just an ordinary guy who has no friends.  You get a bit more of a sense of who this guy is, but that's about it, because there wasn't much in the way of characters that you cared about.  Overall, this was not a bad flick, but at least give it a shot if you don' t know a lot about the character.  Just don't expect too much out of it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie was so horrible and stupid, it makes me angry. I know this is supposed to be a parody of the whole movie industry and Hollywood in general. But it was not funny at all. I did not like the movie at all, and I know I will never watch it again. It made me feel like I was watching some stupid, low budget movie. It had a bad script, and terrible acting. It was not a good parody at all! I do not know if this movie was just made by a low budget producer, or if they made it just for the sake of it, but I am sorry Hollywood, you made a mistake, this movie did not deserve to be made. I wish I could give it zero stars, but then I would not be able to say this was a parody, but just a terrible movie. I am going to give it a negative score, but only because I would have liked it a lot better if I had known the movie was made by low budget producers. This movie is bad and does not deserve any of the praise it is getting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________   I was hoping for something that would show that the original film is not entirely bad. It's just a remake. I don't have much of a problem with a remake as long as it doesn't rip off from a great movie. This is just a poorly made remake of a bad film. I didn't really care for the cast in this one, and I didn' like the music either.   As far as the movie itself goes, it's not very good. I really thought that it was a good idea to get the original director back on the project to do something new with the characters. I just thought that the script was terrible and that it needed a lot of work. I wasn't sure if I was going to like the movie, but I guess I was wrong.   for the rest of you who are going to watch this, don't bother. It won't make you want to see it again.

If you like fast paced action films, you will enjoy this movie. If not, you should not waste your time on this. The ending was a little disappointing too. "
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________ I had the pleasure of watching this movie with my sister. We had been told to watch it after dinner, and she loved it. It was a very well-made movie, and the ending was very touching. I would have preferred the ending be a little more different. It just felt like the guy was going home after his job. It didn't seem like he was ever going to get over the whole thing. The guy was very good-looking, and his story was pretty cool. It is interesting how his story seemed to end when he got his paycheck. That was not my favorite part. I think it would have been more interesting if he had been able to finish the job. I am very disappointed with this movie. It made me feel so sorry for the guy, and I don't know what I would do if I was in his situation. I was just disappointed that he didn't get his money. I will not watch this movie again.  Helpful The movie had some good parts, and there were some parts that I enjoyed. However, I felt that the movie was poorly made, with bad acting and bad acting by the actors. It felt like they wanted the movie to be a comedy, but it just wasn't. It also felt like it didn't have any plot, and was just a series of scenes. It seemed like there were too many scenes and the movie didn't make any sense. - July 26, 2008Hmmm, what do I think?

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. This movie is a total disappointment. It is just so bad, that you can't even enjoy it. It really just seems like a movie that was made by a bunch of drunk people who are trying to get a laugh. The story is just ridiculous. A bunch of kids go on an adventure to save a princess from a castle. The princess is very special, and she doesn't like being taken away. One of the kids falls in love with her, and wants to marry her. The kid who falls in the love with the princess gets caught up in a battle with the evil king, and has to fight and defeat him. After he is victorious, he marries the princess, and they go back home to live happily ever after. Well, that is, except for the problem is that the princess has been taken to a castle that is run by a man named Count von Count. He has a very dark and twisted mind, and he thinks that he is doing the right thing. He takes the princess to his castle, and puts her in a room that is filled with deadly poison. The girl falls asleep, and then a horrible thing happens. The Count has her take a bath with the poison, and after she does, she wakes up to find herself in a terrible and dark place. She thinks that she is going to die, but is rescued by the prince, who helps her out of the poison and gets her back home. Well guess what? The princess falls asleep again. She is rescued once again by the Prince, and the two get married, and are living happily ever-after. The movie does have a good story, and is a very good adventure, but the story has been twisted by the writer/director. The guy is just a huge moron. This is a great movie, but it has just about everything wrong with it. I don't know what happened to the writer or director, but this was a horrible movie. It was just a complete waste of my time.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ I just saw this movie and for a start, it was not a good movie. I think the producers should have tried to make a more interesting movie instead of a movie that was so boring. I thought the acting was horrible and the acting crew didn't know what they were doing. They were so excited to do the scene, they had no clue how to do it. It was also funny because they didn't have a script for the movie. They had just written a script and they just thought the director would be good because he is an actor. So they did a great job but it was a horrible movie. It would have been better if they had used actors with more talent.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!Don't listen to people who don't know anything about movies. There are some great movies out there, but there are also some bad movies. And even if you hate a movie, it's not like it can't be a good movie if you watch it with the right intentions. That is what I did. I didn't hate it. I thought it was pretty good. And it's about a man who wants to live forever, so he decides to live as long as he can, by getting as much of the best medical science and technology that money can buy. But he gets caught and can't get away. He tries to stay alive for as long possible, until his time runs out. He gets caught in a new war. And then I started thinking about other movies that I've watched that are about people trying to stay, or trying to avoid, certain death. In other words, it reminded me a lot of "Fight Club" (if you haven't seen it, it is a pretty good movie) and "The Terminator". There are a lot more similarities than I thought. But then I remembered that this is a movie made in the nineties. The film makers were probably just inspired by some other movie that was about people living longer by taking care of themselves, or by going into a coma. That's how I see it. But if that's the case, what else do you think is inspired by other movies? I don't mean the kind of movies where people are just trying to get by. I mean, there are movies where the main character is trying to go on living, even though the odds are stacked against him. Or the movies where you're trying to find the one person who can cure you. Or even a movie about people who want to get away from the life that they've lived. Like "Apollo 13". In that movie, the astronauts try to get to the moon. But they find out that there are some dangerous things out there. And some people are going to try to stop them. And this movie has a similar feeling. The whole movie was inspired by "Apocalypse Now" (for some reason, I don 't like that movie as much as I did when I was younger). But that movie is about a soldier who tries to survive, even after he's been out of the war for a while. This movie is like "Apocaylpse Now". But instead of a military guy, it's

This guy is the worst of all villains in this movie! He is always trying kill the heroes, and when he doesn't, he does nothing but get the heroes killed, but this is the best part!!!!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************* (4) It is a movie that I enjoyed watching, I even had fun with it, but that doesn't mean it is a good movie, or a great movie. I found the script very confusing and a lot of scenes that were supposed to be fun to watch just became tedious. The movie's humor is not funny at all, and the movie's acting was not funny. The actors did not do anything interesting. The only thing that made this movie interesting was the music, and that was the only thing I liked about this movie. The music was really good, and it was a lot more energetic than in the actual movie. This movie was just really boring. I was not even able to get into it. I think this movie should have been made a long time ago. I did enjoy the movie and I did like the actors in it. But, it was just a waste of my time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  It's not that I'm a big fan of this movie. I mean, I know it's not a very good movie, but I can't say that it's a bad one.   It just feels so out of place and not in the same vein as the other movies that are being released right now. And I'm not talking about the fact that it was made in 1982 and is from a time before the Internet was around and the days of being able to watch a movie on home video. I'm talking about that this movie is so much more than it's title and what you're shown.   with a good movie like this, you get a nice story with good acting and a good soundtrack. With a bad, or a really poor movie like The Evil Dead, it's nothing but a gimmick and a bunch of people saying "It was a good idea in the 80s." I'm sure there were plenty of other things out there that were made before, but this movie seems to be the one that stands out the most.  Last edited by miketan; 08-23-2007 at 09:45 PM.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ I was very intrigued by the plot. The characters seemed to be likeable and they seemed to have a good time together. But I was let down by the acting, which was so bad that I would have to consider whether the actors were "playing" the characters or if they were really actors. I'm not saying they should be put in the same category, but it was very odd that all of them acted like they were in a "real" movie or on a real set, and that they were pretending to be actors. It was very obvious to me that they weren't really acting at all. They just made the character seem real and interesting. This is one of the more realistic, if not the most realistic, movies that I've seen. There were a few bad lines, but I don't think any of the actors should be fired. Some of them even had a funny line, which is a good sign. I hope they all go into acting school to improve their acting. This was just a bad performance that I couldn't stand. I was also disappointed that they made the bad guys look like they had a nice family. If you think you're a tough guy, it shows in your character. I also wish they would have used a more "modern" sound for the "modern movie" part of the film. There was a cheesy song that played in the background of the movie. That's not good when the film's a parody.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Bdw2 from A good satire on "real life" I enjoyed the movie a lot. I didn't think the acting was so great that it made the movie "real". The movie was made in 1982, so it had a very specific plot. I have to say that I thought the movie was very funny and I enjoyed it. I think that it was a good satire of "real world" situations. I felt that it could have used more music, but the music wasn't bad. I liked the music in the movie as well. I thought it would have been better to have more of a modern soundtrack, but if they had gone with a more modern score, I think it would of been better. I would recommend this movie for anyone who likes a good comedy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________   I was in a really good mood for this movie, because I had been looking forward to this movie for quite some time. The trailer was pretty bad and the plot sounded like a movie I'd read. This movie was a very simple premise: A girl who has been hit by a truck is found by a girl in the woods, who takes her in and feeds her and takes care of her. The two become friends. The plot is that the girl who finds the girl in a tree is the one that wants to be friends with her and the girl that is in the forest is the girl the girl has fallen in love with.   It's not a bad premise but it's the execution that's lacking. The film tries to be funny but ends up being really depressing and feels forced. The story was not original at all, there was nothing new about the story. There was not even a plot twist at the end, and the ending was pretty depressing.   in all, this movie is a waste of time. It would have been better if the two friends were a couple, and not friends at all.   of course, this is the worst movie of the year, but the only reason it's so bad is because the other two films are much better.

The acting was terrible, the acting was poor, the story was terrible...I mean, who wants to see a movie where the villain has to have a sex change operation to get married and it is all because of the evil old man in charge? I could not stand watching it at all... I wish they never made another one of those... I can't believe how they made this movie...I feel so bad for the actress who had to play that character. And I hate how they wasted a great movie on a plot that was too stupid to be believable... I don't understand how a man with a small penis could have a big sex change and be able to marry a woman with a big penis. I don?t know why they went with that story... It was such a waste of a great film. I feel so stupid for watching it... I have seen worse movies. I have also seen worse actors in them... I was not even impressed with the acting. I hate all the actors who were in this movie! The only good thing was the song in the end... I hated it. It was not that good...I hate the song.... The song made me feel so horrible for watching this movie. I was so annoyed. It made me laugh every time I heard it... The only thing that made me think this movie was good was the ending song... I just wish they would have never made this.

I am not a fan of this movie. I do not understand why this movie was made. There was nothing good about it. This movie is horrible and this was made for $2.00. It is completely ridiculous. The movie makes me laugh and make me cry. It's just so bad. It has so much stupid stuff in it. It doesn't make any sense. It makes me want to puke. I was laughing and crying at the same time. I have never laughed so hard at a movie before and I never will again. This is the only bad movie I've ever seen and I will not watch any more. This was made to make money. It was made by someone who wanted a quick buck. The best part of the movie was the ending. The only thing I can say about this movie would be, that it's funny and a very funny movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you hate this movie then you don't like horror movies in general.  This movie is so bad I don't even think I'll see it again.    It has a lot of problems.  First of all the movie is written by a former horror writer that made a movie called The Descent.  He's obviously trying to make a horror movie that would appeal to horror fans.  The main problem is that it doesn't take place in a creepy abandoned building with a lot to hide behind, it's a movie set in the present day and has a young girl who is trying to avoid getting into a car accident by going to the movie theater.  Even with all that you should still watch this movie because it's so good.  I'm not saying that it's good because it has great actors but it's definitely good because of the movie itself.  And of course it's not the first time this movie has been released.  It's only been out for one week and it's already become a cult classic.  This movie has a great ending that you won't see in any other horror movie.  For more horror movies check out our site: www.highthehorror.com

This movie was a great idea but the execution is so bad that it makes it so much worse. The zombies were never really in control of the story. They would have a lot more to do in the movie if the actors had been better. There is nothing in the original that is really original and it was obvious that someone had already seen it before. There are many scenes in this movie that I would have loved to see the actors perform in a real movie, especially the scenes involving the dog. This is just a horrible movie and I was never a fan of it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  "This is not a bad film. It's just one of those bad movies. If you like the first one, and are looking for a good time, then look no further. If it's your first time, you might have a hard time. But it's worth a shot."  I will not be seeing "The Mummy" again. I watched it on a Tuesday night at 10 PM. It was soooooo over the top and unbelievable that I almost laughed out loud. The "Mummy" is one of the biggest movies ever to hit the big screen. The movie is about a tomb raider, and it looks like a typical "horror" film. There is no blood and gore, and the movie is set in Egypt. The only thing that stood out to me was that I had no idea who this guy was, and I had to google his name. When he was chasing the "Mulan" and he was going to kill her, I was wondering why he was even chasing her. When I looked at the movie poster, I noticed that he was named "Jack" and it was not a common name. Also, the director was not very good. The acting was horrible. The actors never looked like they were in the same room, and their mouths were always hanging open. The one actress who looked really good was a woman named Lola. She was a pretty good actress. The rest of the acting was just as bad as the actors. This movie was just sooooooo over the line. The guy is so over the roof. And he is not only killing people, he is torturing them and he is getting his revenge by trying to kill the "mother" of the woman. It took me about 10 minutes to watch the whole movie, but after that time, I had not watched another movie like it. This is one that you should watch only if you want to see a bad ass "horrors" movie, because this is a pretty great movie. If the director had made a good movie, he would have been in the business of making movies for a long time. I wish I had read the reviews before I decided to go see this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ ___________ The film is basically a re-creation of a bad episode of a series that never made it to the screen. There's a bunch of guys on the road and they are in an accident that leaves one of them paralyzed. This guy (a bit too handsome to be a guy who was paralyzed) decides to get revenge by taking revenge on his enemies. This is a really bad movie. It was shot in the style of the TV series but it really has no plot. The acting is bad. It's like the people that were in the show didn't have any real talent. I just think it's an excuse to play with the idea of a guy with a limp trying to get even with people who did him wrong.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The main problem with this movie is that it's a big fat load of bullshit.  The actors are all in a hurry to get into the swing of things and not a single one has a clear grasp of their character.   If this were a film by a Hollywood star who were to star in it, it would be a decent, entertaining film.  The problem is that this is a poorly made movie.  I've seen better.  This is a film which is clearly made by people who have not spent the money to make a film. The characters are all stereotypical and they don't even seem to know how to act.  It's a film where people just try to do as much as they can.  If they want a laugh, they just try and have a laugh.  They don't seem to have a clue as to how to tell a story.  There are a lot of funny things in this film, but it's not funny when you watch it.  My friend said it was funny at first, but when she watched it again, she said that it was all over the place.  In the end, this film is just a piece of shit.  Even if you're a fan of this film and are expecting a laugh from it, this will not do it for you.  So for this film to be rated with an "R" means that it sucks.  You should just not watch this film.

But I also don't know a thing about this movie, so I'm just going to guess that it's a bit of a mess.

It was just a very well-made movie that was lucky to have James Gunn involved. But he was the director, and that makes a difference. If a director is not involved, the movie doesn't feel very good. It feels like a bunch of people had a lot of time and money to make a movie, but the result was so bad that it didn't matter what they spent. But Gunn is a director and he is not making a movie that anyone would enjoy. I mean, there's a scene where he's making a robot dance that is so awful and terrible that I have to imagine it was just made to mess with us. That doesn't make it a good film. There is some interesting action, and some interesting character development, but there's no reason for us to watch it. The script is just so bad. The dialogue is so bad, and the acting is so terrible that it doesn't matter. It's a terrible movie. And I don"t blame James Gunn, because I don' think the script is that bad. It is so full of clichéd dialogue and bad jokes and bad ideas that it makes me feel that James Gunn has no respect for the material. The acting is bad, the acting doesn't really matter, but that doesn't stop me from laughing. There are a couple of decent scenes in the film, but then we have the other half of the movie. There isn't any plot, so the entire movie is just a bunch more bad jokes. There just isn't much to this movie. I feel like James Gunn was so worried about how this movie was going to turn out that he completely fucked it up. He should have been making a sci-fi movie instead of a movie about bad movies. I guess I just think that James and his directorial team were too busy making bad jokes to think of what the movie should have looked like. But it's the worst kind of movie. The writing is so dumb that it could be the worst movie ever made. But this is
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________ _____________________________________________ I'll start by saying I don't like the film. The acting, the dialogue, the pacing, the plot. The story just doesn't seem to be well written. I mean, it sounds like it was written by a 14 year old. This is the first film I've ever seen where the story isn't in the script. This film is about a guy who was the best basketball player in the state and his journey of coming to terms with that fact. When he becomes a father he is just a normal guy. He is not in his best frame of mind and the fact that he is a great basketball player, his father is an alcoholic and a prostitute and they are all living together just makes him look bad. When the two of them break up and move out, his life just goes downhill from there. When I say "downhill" I mean that the movie has a very slow pace. The editing is horrible and there is a scene where he is trying to get his car and then gets lost in the woods and there are a lot of scenes where he just stands there with his mouth open and the camera moves away from him. I don the movie is just terrible. The main reason that I gave this movie a 2 is that I don`t think it is a very good movie. I'm glad that it is only for children and I would recommend this movie to those who want to see a movie about a father trying to come to terms about his father`s actions. I give this movie an average score of 2 out of 5.Read full review
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ ______________________________ It was a great idea to make a movie about a group of people who are trapped in a small house by a mysterious killer. But they did not have the time or the resources to create a convincing setting. The movie is filled with awkward scenes and is just not as creepy as it could have been. It is a little disturbing, but that is a small price to pay for such a good idea.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________   Plot:   A man named Bill comes to a small town to attend a college reunion and, as usual, he finds himself in a little trouble. This time he is caught in a game of cat and mouse with two girls who are looking for him. The trouble doesn't end there, though, because the two girls end up trying to kill Bill and it is up to a policeman to stop them. I thought it was a little silly, but at the same time it was entertaining enough. There is a little romance at the beginning of the movie and it works, but that was about it. It was a nice movie to watch and, of course, it was full of good laughs.   Characters:  :     - Bill   Bill was the star of the film and I enjoyed him a lot. He had a great personality and I thought he was very funny. He was so charming that you didn't want to see him get in trouble. He always had a good attitude and always looked great in a suit.   I loved him and thought he could have been a great movie star if he hadn't become such a big star in the early 80s.   is a nice little movie and I would recommend it to anyone. I don't know if I will ever see the movie again, but it was good.   the movie also features the song "My Girl" and it's one of my favorite songs.   with the movie I also bought the soundtrack.   (I recommend the album to anyone who likes good music.)

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________ (The movie itself is not a bad film) The first time I watched it, it was in a movie theatre, so I was expecting a mediocre film, and what I got was one of the worst films I've seen. I was not expecting a story, it's just a bunch of characters in a hotel room with no connection to each other. The only one who had any motivation was the wife, but that's it. I never understood why she kept saying "why?" when her husband left her, and why she thought it would be good to take the kid on the day she was supposed to give birth. The movie was made for her daughter and her husband. That was all there was. I guess you could say it was a piece of theatre, but it's really not good theatre. The acting was so bad, and the dialogue was so stupid. It was so hard to follow what was happening. The story is just an excuse for the actors to say a bunch and have a bunch to say. The ending was so silly, I just could not believe they'd put it there. If you want a cheap film, this is for you. If, like me, you like a good story and a good film, watch it and leave it at that. - June 8, 2013Don't be fooled by the cover

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've watched this movie a few times and it still makes me laugh. The story is about a girl named Nita and a boy named Kiyoshi who are friends. The only problem is that Kiyoshis parents and Nita's parents are not exactly on the best terms. The reason is that Nita had a miscarriage and the baby died in the womb. This makes Nita extremely depressed. She decides to move out of her parents house, where Kiyos parents live, to go live with Kiyeshis parents. When she gets there she finds that he and his parents are really not so great parents, and they are constantly arguing and fighting. Nita also discovers that she is pregnant. The film also has some nice music, but it is really not very important in the story. The acting was also really good and it kept me interested. There are some scenes that are very funny but that does not mean they are all funny. I would recommend this movie to everyone, and even if you do not like it, it is worth watching just to see how the characters would behave when they are really in a bad mood.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ __________ _______________ _________  "When we left the theater, I couldn't stop thinking about it. The acting was terrible and the script was a disaster. We had already seen the film in a preview a few days before the film. The previews were given in the theaters during the opening day, which was the most depressing part of the movie. I just can't understand why they chose this movie to show on opening day."  – Jeff  This is a very bad film. It's a bad film in the sense that it is not a very good film. I have seen better films, and it is very disappointing to see such a terrible movie like this. In the film, the lead character is a girl who is being stalked by a group of men who have been looking for her for a long time. The film takes place in the year 1980. The main character has been seen at a party before, and the main character is on a date with a man. She decides to go on a second date and the man and his friends do not like the fact that the girl is going on a third date with the guy who is her boyfriend. When they find out that the main guy's brother, a friend of his, has a gun and that the guy is a killer, they get ready to kill the main dude. The movie ends when the main girl is killed and the guy, who is a guy, gets away. The next day, the guy shows up at her house and kills her in front of her boyfriend and her friends. The boyfriend and friends are all horrified and want to get away from him. They do and are trying to find a way to get the police to catch the guy. This is not the main focus of the film though, as the movie jumps back and forth from a girl to a guy and back to the girl, showing different aspects of her life. I thought this was really bad, but when the movie ends it really shows a very slow burn, but the ending did make it very good. The whole movie was bad. It was like a bad dream that you have when you wake up. The story and the acting are bad, and this is why I did not enjoy the film at all. I think the main problem of the whole movie is that they decided to make a horror movie with a girl that was not really a horror film at least in my opinion. The entire movie was just a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! You really are going to have to excuse the film if it was poorly made. The story was terrible, the acting was so-so and the direction was atrocious. The worst part about the movie was the fact that it was directed by the director of 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure' which is one of my all time favorite movies. I thought the movie would be great with the addition of Michael Caine. The movie is about a boy who comes home one day from school and sees a strange looking monster in the hallway. He decides to play a game with his friends and get his friends to see if they can help him out. The monsters only one weakness is its' tail which makes it very easy for them to be caught. The boys go into a room and try to put the tail into a bucket. The creature then comes up and grabs the boys head and turns it upside down. The tail becomes stuck and the boys try to free it but it won't come out. Then a horrible thing happens, one of the boys loses a tooth. The monster comes up behind him and slashes him in the back of the head. The boy has no chance to scream for help because the monster is right there. He runs away and his friends see him being attacked and run to his aid. Then the monster turns the boy over and takes a bite out of his leg. The last thing that he sees is his mother coming at him with a knife to kill him. After that he dies. The rest of the film was a flashback of what the boys went through in the first movie. The ending of the movie made no sense. I understand that it is meant to show the boys past and all, but it was still a really lame ending. I'm not sure how the filmmakers thought that they could add that last little bit of humor into it. The one thing that was good about the film is that the monsters were very scary and a bit more realistic. I think that the monster in 'Pawnee Monsters' could have been made into a great horror movie if it were made in the right way. The other thing that I really liked about this movie was that they used the original theme song by The Monkees, 'If You Don't Think I'm Going Nowhere, I'll Show You'. I also like the song when it plays on the jukebox.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! The whole movie is like a dream and a nightmare for me. I was so scared at the beginning but I have to say the movie was not that bad, it had good performances and the special effects are great. I love the idea of a vampire movie and the vampire look is good. But when you see it, you don't believe that is actually happening. The ending was really bad. It is a dream you have. You are watching a movie and you don`t want to wake up. It was a nightmare and I am still not over it.   There are better vampire movies out there and you can find better vampires in real life. The idea of vampire is great, but the movies are all different. The movie was like a movie you can watch when you are alone.   and my rating: 3 out of 10, I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

It is not a bad picture, but the fact that it takes the most boring, boring, most idiotic plot from the original film and twists it into something so ridiculous and stupid that it makes you cringe and wish it wasn't a movie. The characters are all bland and have no personality. The story is all about the main character. And the story is so stupid that you can't help but laugh every time it happens. You just can't believe this could be a good movie. I was laughing hysterically at the movie the whole time. It makes me wonder how much money this guy put into making this movie. He must have made a fortune.   I gave it a 4 star review because I thought it was at least a decent movie. But the fact is that it was just a bad remake of a bad original. The movie itself was pretty bad, but that wasn't why I gave it only a 4. If you really like the original, then this is a decent enough movie. If not, then you probably shouldn't waste your time watching it.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________ 1-2 stars. The movie is good but not great. If you're a fan of the book then it will be fun. If not, it's not as good as the book. It's a very simple story with a lot of twists and turns. The action sequences are very well done and there's no doubt the movie is more of the same. I guess this is a sequel but it isn't a sequel to the book but rather a film that expands on the ideas of the first book. The book is about a young woman named Sam. She is a child soldier and a mother of three. When her husband dies, she's taken in by an old family friend who is the son of a high ranking official in a secret government organization. Sam doesn't trust him and runs away. She goes to London to try to find her daughter and find her son, who is missing. Sam goes to a secret British military base, where she meets a boy named Tom. Sam finds out that Tom has been there all along and is a member of the secret military organization. In London, Sam is introduced to Tom's brother, who's a member as well. Tom's father is a very powerful person and has secrets that are far greater than just war. The military and secret government is involved in the war. Sam gets involved in a battle between the British military and the secret government. I really enjoyed the movie. It was well done. I did have to stop to admire the special effects. It really was quite amazing. The special effects were good. The fighting was great. The characters are all well done but the story isn't the best in the world.

I mean, the premise of this movie was so awesome, and the casting is great, but this movie is just so poorly made and made by a bad director. The acting is terrible.

And the directing, the acting, the writing, the editing - all of it was horrible. It was so bad that it just made me want to put it down and go sit in the dark and watch something else. And for me to do that, I have to say I would rather watch the entire series of Star Wars movies than this movie. I would not watch this movie to pass the time, I would watch it to hate it. This movie is absolutely horrible. I give it a 1 star rating.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ I was completely disappointed by this movie. I watched it a week before it came out and was so looking forward to it. I love to see new movies and this is a great one. The opening scene was a nice surprise. The story of a man and his son who were trying to make it in the business is interesting. The movie did not make me think that it was a good movie. It just made me think it was something I did not want to see. The plot was not a good plot. The characters were not very interesting. It was just a slow plot. I thought the whole movie was so dull. I was really sad when I saw the last 10 minutes of the movie. The ending of the film was very sad. I can't see a way to explain what happened in the last scene. I have never seen a movie that I hate as much as I hate this movie and I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the opening scene. But if you like a slow slow plot and a happy ending then this movie is for you. I give this movie a 1/10.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not bad.  But it's not really good either.  It's a good story, and I can understand why it's a big hit in Japan.  It's about a man who gets involved in the sex trade and decides to stop.  But then he decides to have sex with a lot of women, and it's an action movie.  And the action is pretty much nonstop for most of it.  In the end, he ends up killing one of the prostitutes (that he didn't have sex in) and gets sent to jail.   But I'll leave that for you to decide.  So this is a pretty typical sexploitation movie.    But there are a lot more interesting parts to it than that.  I'll be honest, there were times that I had to force myself to look away because I just couldn't get myself to sit through the whole movie.      I'm sure that it was supposed to be a funny movie, but it never really made me laugh.  One of the reasons that I have enjoyed this movie is that it had a great soundtrack, and that's where the story really shines.  There are some very good songs in the movie, and they all add a lot to the film.  If you like music in your movies, then you should definitely check this movie out.  This movie is pretty fun to watch.  My favorite parts are when the bad guy, Yui, comes in to try to get rid of the "giant" prostitute, who is the size of a small house.  When she gets too big for him to have an easy time, he finally ends up having sex with her.  As they have sex, she says that she's really happy to see him again, and he tells her that he's sorry that she didn't die in that house.   This movie wasn't really well-made, and there are parts of it that are pretty bad. But if you're interested in a Japanese sexplositation movie, then this movie should definitely be on your list.      There's also some pretty graphic scenes in this movie.

The writing is terrible.  2. The acting is terrible 2.    There are scenes in this movie that make no sense.  3.  The story is a rip off of the original Star Wars. 4.  I do not care what this movie was trying to accomplish. 5.  This movie is the biggest "Star Wars" rip off since the movie "Dune". 6.  There are scenes that are just too ridiculous.  7.  It is almost impossible to see this movie in theaters, and I would rather see a video version.  8.  In my opinion, this movie is just a waste of money.  9.  All the special effects are lame. 10.  If you want to see a Star Wars rip off movie that you have to pay to see, go watch "The Empire Strikes Back".  I can't recommend this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  The "The Shining" is a perfect horror film that can be easily watched by anyone. I don't think it is one of the greatest films ever made, but it is a very enjoyable one. The actors and actresses play it very well and make the story so real. It's very hard to believe that this is actually the real life of Jack Torrance. This is one hell of a movie to watch, but is not for the faint of heart.  If you're looking for a great horror film, this is definitely the movie for you. The movie is very well made, and the actors really give the roles a real feeling. It also has one of my favorite lines of all time in the movie: "Jack, it's your turn."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible movie and I'm not going to bother to go into details about why, but if you want to go in depth about why this is such a bad film then go read this review. This is a movie where there is one great scene but it's so small and inconsequential that it becomes completely insignificant. The main character, a man named Chris, has a terrible night. He has a bad dream where his girlfriend, Michelle, is kidnapped and he has to go rescue her. Michelle tells Chris that she is in a small town and that she will be back soon. He runs into a man called Bob who is a police officer and asks him to help him find Michelle. Bob thinks that he is Chris's friend and agrees to help, and as they leave Michelle is kidnapped. Chris and Bob head to a small area where there are some caves and Chris is attacked by a man. He is saved by Bob who tells him that he knows where Michelle is. Chris heads off to the town where Michelle lives but then he hears a scream coming from the other side of a house. Chris then finds Michelle in a cage and is then attacked by Bob. Michelle is in the cage and she is being kept in a room and is only allowed to have one hour a day to read and eat. Chris decides to help Michelle escape. He takes a hammer to the cage to break it and Michelle is able to get away. She runs into Bob and they get to the police station. Michelle escapes by hiding in a suitcase and the police believe Chris has kidnapped her. Bob gets arrested and Michelle finds Chris and gives him her suitcase. They are then able to go home. Chris is very depressed and starts drinking. Michelle gives Chris a bottle of vodka and they have a drink together. Michelle says that she loves Chris and wants to spend the rest of her life with him. Chris and Michelle are happy for a few days until Michelle falls down and dies. Chris has a horrible feeling and decides to go back home. This movie is a very bad one and should be avoided. If you are looking for a good movie, then this isn't the movie for you. If there was any redeeming features to this movie it would be the fact that it has some great moments in it. However it is still a bad one. This movie was a waste of time and should not be watched.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never understood why people didn't like this movie. There was nothing new about it, and I'm a big fan of the first two. I don't know how it ended up getting a 3 star rating, because it didn't feel like a 3. If you like the first one, and the second one, then this is definitely a worthy pick up. The story was great and it didn`t take itself too seriously. I`m not going to go into detail, but this was a good movie to watch on a lazy weekend. I didn`d love the ending of the movie, but it had a decent payoff at the end. Overall, I would give this a 4/5, if it weren't for the ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ This movie was an amazing disappointment. I am a huge fan of the movie and was hoping that it would be a solid movie but it was far from that. The movie was very bad. The main character (James) is a bit of a wimp who is very sensitive. It was really hard for me to watch this movie. The actor who plays James was terrible. It didn't help that the actor that played the part was awful. The story line was very stupid and was a waste of money. It is hard to believe that a movie like this made a million dollars. This movie would have been better if it was called "Piece of Shit" or something like that. This was a horrible movie and I am sorry I had to watch it.  Did you like this review? Sign in to vote.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________ (5) A.M.C. (1976) This is one of the most underrated comedies ever made. It was a low budget comedy with the great Jim Carrey and Peter Sellers playing the roles of a married couple who just got back together after a few years of separation. This film was one of Carrey's first starring roles in a film and also one of Sellers' best. The movie follows them through a day in their lives. Carrey plays the "normal" married man who has trouble making friends and is frustrated by his lack of success. Sellers plays the man who doesn't want to leave his wife and son. The film was shot in one take. The dialogue between Carrey, Sellers and the other actors was delivered in a funny way, making the movie very entertaining. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ (2) Good Morning, Vietnam (1965) The story of a man named Mike (Henry Winkler) who finds a photo of his sister, who was killed in Vietnam in 1968, he keeps it in a box. One day, the war breaks out and Mike and his wife, Karen (Anjelica Huston), are sent to the countryside to pick up some food for their children. The two are forced to leave Mike and Karen behind in a dangerous part of the countryside and must find their way to the nearest town, where they must find a way back. ______________________________  Did you know? This film is about two men who have been separated by the war, who are forced together by circumstance.  _______________________________________________________________________________________  3) The Longest Yard (1977) The film follows a man (Richard Gere) who loses his daughter and wife to cancer and his relationship with his daughter's new boyfriend (Richard Boone). The movie deals with his relationship to his daughter, his wife's new lover, and his love for his son. .   ...  4) The Godfather Part III (1974) This movie is a great one. The main characters of the film are Vito Corleone (Al Pacino), Don Vito (Robert De Niro), Michael CorleONE (Alonzo King), and Michael CorLEONE (Dennis Hopper). They are all part of a mafia family that controls a vast territory in the south. They have been fighting each other for many years and finally Vito wins.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I'm very disappointed in this movie. I've seen this movie twice and have been to both shows. The first time was a sold out, huge show. The second show was much smaller and more intimate. Both times I had to leave after about 30 minutes because I was not able to keep my eyes open. The plot is so bad, the acting is so terrible, and the cinematography is so awful that I can't even watch it. I feel like I've been beaten up and thrown in the back of a van and left there for two weeks. The acting is all over the place and so is the story. I wish they hadn't hired actors to play the parts. They should have done it all in the movie. The movie is very un-professional and it makes me angry that they let this happen to a movie that was so great. The director, a guy named John Kander, does not have the acting chops to even make this movie believable. I hope he and his director of photography, a man named Steven Raskin, get sued by the cast and crew. This is not the way to start a new career. This should have been a film festival film.

He can't stand the sight of people so he hides in his room. We hear the sound of the shower running, and the doorbell. We don't hear the door open. If you can get past this scene and see that Will is a good guy, the rest of the film is decent. We have some action sequences, but they are pretty tame. Will and Sam are trying to escape a kidnapper who is hunting them, but he is a little too powerful. They manage to get away, and Will is forced to confront his old friend. I think that the main problem with this movie is that Will has no motivation. He has no desire to help Sam, and is too selfish to put his life on hold to help a friend. Sam is a victim, and that's a hard thing to watch. There's some good humor in the film, but it is not enough. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has seen a bad Tom Clancy movie, and wants to see something more.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* this movie sucks. i don't know how a movie like this could get made, but they just don't have any heart at all. they just take the most cheesy, shitty, boring, and stupid premise and they make it worse. i just hope the producers got what they paid for. the movie starts out with a group of friends in their late teens, they get invited to a party and there are all these hot older women. they go and are totally naked, then one of them gets raped and then a bunch of other guys start to take turns raping her. then the party turns into a "honeymoon" and the girls have to watch them rape and beat each other. then all of the guys get drunk and go back to their rooms and start to do the same thing again. then at the end, all the guys have sex with the same girl and she doesn't want to have sex. then a guy who is also a cop shows up and takes all of them away. he also tells them to tell him everything that happened, if he wants. he just wants them to get in trouble for something so he can get them off the hook. so then they all have sex again, and when they are done, the girl who got raped says, "you guys really did a number on me". this movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities. the sex is terrible, the violence is awful, the premise is lame, and the characters are so stupid. this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i'm going to give it a D+ because i don' t know what else to give this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ The plot is a complete mess. In a nutshell: a female doctor is sent on a mission to locate a cure for the plague. Along the way, she falls in love with a young man. He falls in with a noblewoman. They are both saved from the plague by a band of survivors. The story is not very interesting or well thought out. The characters are the worst. The only one who has any depth is the main female character, and even she has no depth. The main male character is a loser. He has no motivation, and is a total dork. I had a hard time following this movie. The acting is so bad that it makes you wonder how they could possibly get paid for this. I don't know how the script was so bad. The movie could have been so much better.  I loved the original version of this movie, but it seems like a movie that was filmed for $10,000. The remake, which is what it is, has no reason to exist. If you're going to remake a movie, at least do it right.  the movie starts off with a doctor in a wheelchair, trying to locate the cure for a deadly disease. She finds a cure by going to the home of a nobleman who has been cured of the plague, but she is not the only one searching for the cure. A band of men, led by a noble woman, are searching for a cure, and the woman is captured by the man who is in love (he is an idiot, by the way) and he must go and rescue her. The problem with the movie is the plot. There are no characters. There is a man who just happens to be in love. He is a dork, and not much else. The plot itself is terrible. There isn't any reason to be on this journey. I really wanted to see a film where a man gets rescued and is reunited with his loved one. "The cure to the plague has been located. But, before the men of the city can set out on their journey, a terrible disease ravages the land. A man and a woman are saved from death by a group of men led by an honorable noblewoman."  The movie ends with the hero and his female companion getting captured by bandits, and it is a terrible ending. The music is terrible, the acting is terrible (they try to get a "dramatic" ending, but

It's a piece of shit, full of stupid shit and a very bad acting performance. I'm not even going to try and talk about the stupid shit because it is so bad it doesn't even matter.

The first fight is so slow, the second fight is almost as slow and stupid as the first fight. The final fight is completely useless and it only makes it worse. The story is so dumb, it is a train wreck. I don't even want to say anything about the special effects because they are so bad. They're so bad that I'm almost sure it's CGI. They are so poor and unprofessional. You're looking at an action scene in a movie that is supposed to be a action movie and it's really bad. I could not even believe it when I first saw it. It was so bad I almost threw up. The acting is so terrible. The characters are so stupid and stupid that it really didn't matter if they were supposed to fight or not. The special effects are so terrible that it makes the film so much worse. I cannot even begin to describe how bad this film is. I really can't recommend this movie. There are so many bad reviews of this movie that I don´t want to get into it. I just hope no one takes this movie seriously and that it never sees the light of day. Just look at it. This movie sucks.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________   My wife bought this for me because she wanted to go out with a movie. I think she was trying to show me how to be a man.   We got there at 9pm. The only thing that made me laugh was the guy on the subway. He looked like a bum. He didn't look like a hero either. I had to walk in a circle with him while he was trying out the whole thing with a mirror and his friend. He just wanted to see his reflection. He couldn't even make it look real.  , The guy was wearing a red shirt and a brown fedora and a baseball cap. His hair was a dark brown, his face looked old and his eyes looked like they were in pain.   (hide spoiler)] [The guy was in a hurry. He was going to buy some crack. (hide Spoiler) (view spoiler) The guys friend was wearing an old fashioned red sweater with a blue shirt. He had a bald head and was very thin. He talked like a preacher. The friend had his arm around the guy's neck. He gave the guy his money. He went to the other end of the subway and bought a joint from a guy in a suit. Then he had a joint with a guy on a scooter. I felt so sick. I mean, how could someone do this to a poor man? (hide spoilers)   The guy asked the guy with the scooter if he wanted to do it. He said he wanted the joint and to go to the back of the train. So they went. I don't know if they were going to get off on a level platform or what. It's hard to describe. There was a platform that went to both ends of the tracks.   "Let's get off the platform and then I'll give you the joint."   "You sure?"   They got off the train and were going up on a ledge. The guy on his scooter had a small, small-frame black scooter, like a child's. It was really slow. It wasn't even going to go fast. But this guy went on a little higher platform than the guy in the scoot. I'm sure they had the joint already. The little guy went over the ledge, got off his scoot, and threw it to the guy holding the little guy. The small guy took the joint from the guy and started smoking it. The sc

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!,!!!.!!! This movie is just a bad job of a script, and a horrible movie. This is a story about a man who is trapped in a train car, and he tries to get out of there as fast as he can. The train is going at high speed, and at the very end of the film, the train car crashes. This film is full of ridiculous, stupid, and just stupid scenes that you just can't take seriously. The acting is atrocious and you have to wonder if they even got anyone in the film to do this movie. I just couldn't believe that a film like this could be made. I hope that some of these people get the message of this movie and don't make another one. I would just advise that people don't see this movie, because this film is absolutely ridiculous.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ (What do you think? I've never seen a movie so bad I wanted to rip the director's head off. The movie's called __________ and the title is wrong. It should have been called _____ ________.) I'll have to watch this one a couple of times to really appreciate the greatness of the screenplay, and the acting of the actors. The story is so bad that I was completely surprised when the ending came. I guess they are trying to show how bad the bad things in life are. But I'm sure they meant to show the good things. I think they are making a mistake, because the movie has all the right ingredients to make a great movie. (But no actors! I'll never see a movie with actors who act like people!) The ending just doesn't make sense. What was the point of all that? It's like the writer just wanted to make the movie's ending make sense, but couldn't find a way. I'll wait until the movie is released in the theaters, because it should be a great one. It is very hard to make me laugh, because there is so much stupidity. It's so bad. But, I guess it is necessary. The film is made by some idiot. (I guess he should have named it _________ _____.) The movie has some good ideas. (Like the fact that every time you're in a car with someone you should always say "Hey!" to them and "How are you?".) But the movie doesn't know how to tell a good story. It doesn't do any of the right things. But this movie is made for bad people. (So it has to be a bad thing!) I will watch this movie again. But if the writers want to make it into a big hit, they should change the name of the movie and change the ending to make this movie great.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ ____________ _______________  My boyfriend and I went to this place because it was a great deal and it looked like a nice place. It was just us and some kids and our families. We were seated and had a great time. The food was good but they didn't have any beer. The manager said she was out of beer and that they didn�t have any of her kind. We had to ask for some. She didn't want to make an exception because we were just some kids. We told her that we really enjoyed the food. She said she didn't know the kids were so young. We asked again and she said no we couldn't make an exceptions. It seems like she was more concerned about her own profits and whatnot. I wouldn't go back.  I've been to a lot of fast food joints, but this place is soooo good, the meat is cooked to perfection and the fries are cooked perfectly. We get a double combo and get the bacon and cheese. The bacon is juicy and the cheese is soft and tasty. The sides are great too. The onion rings and coleslaw are great and the chicken is flavorful and good too. I can't wait to go back to try more items. I'll definitely be back.

I have never seen a movie this bad. ____________________________________- The whole time the film is showing what a great guy Logan was. He is trying to do what he can to help his people but it isn't working out. Then he comes across this guy that has a pretty strong personality and they start to get along. The problem is that this guy is a very hard ass and he is just too much for him. He goes to the war and he starts fighting and he loses. He tries to keep his head down but then he starts to have nightmares about it. Then his brother dies. Logan tries to do something to help him but his father won't listen. He kills Logan's father and that's when Logan starts to really hate the whole thing. He wants to make sure that he gets his vengeance and he tries to get to the end of the war but that isn't going to happen. The last third of the movie is completely boring. The acting is atrocious. It is just terrible. It doesn't make any sense at all. This movie should not have been made. It should have never been made and they could have made a good movie about it instead. I just wish that it had not been made at all because it is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. I don´t even know what I am going to do with myself after watching it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I would never have thought of it, but the director, Peter Jackson, is known for his great, over-the-top special effects, and for this movie, he has produced something truly incredible, with the most over-blown special effects of any movie I've seen. The effects are amazing. The pyrotechnics and the way the film is filmed, even when it is dark, is truly awe-inspiring. The way the pyrotecnics, when lit, make the walls and the floor around them glow is truly wonderful. The special effects are truly spectacular, and you are left with no doubt that it is the real deal. The characters are truly amazing, and the acting is great. But the special effects make this film truly great. And when you are watching the pyro-effects, you are not really watching a movie. You are watching God himself, who was in this film and who created this film. The film is about the last days of Jesus, when he was dying on the cross. He is a man who was loved and loved, and he was executed for the sins of all men. In this movie we learn that Jesus had to die. He was a man with a plan. He had a way out. He didn't have to die on the spot. He wanted to be executed. He knew that he had a plan, a way of life. He would go to Jerusalem, and from there he would preach the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The movie has a very powerful message, and it is a great way to start a film about Jesus. The only negative about this film is the story, and that is not the director's fault. If you are looking for a good movie about Jesus, this is the one. If, however, you don't like to see the story told in a realistic way, and if you are a little skeptical about the special effect, you should not see this film, but you can certainly enjoy it. But if you love God and the gospel, you will enjoy this movie as much as I did. I give this film a 8 out of 10. If there is anything that I have learned in life, it is that the Bible is the word of God, and every book that God has given us is the Word of God. The Bible is God's book, and God's words are true. He spoke to us through the Holy Spirit and the Bible tells us the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     As with any good horror film, the tension is palpable. The tension is created by the camera's ability to keep the audience on the edge of their seats while the audience members themselves feel like they're trapped in a horror film. This tension can be felt from the very beginning when we see a young girl running through the woods. She has a backpack full of toys and is hiding under a bush while she is stalked by a man with a shotgun. This scene is shot from the perspective of a man who can only hear the girl's screams and see her running. It's a scary moment to see a child running through a dark forest while a man is holding a gun and ready to kill. As the man approaches, the girl turns to run away from him, but the man doesn't let up. Instead, he follows her and begins to chase her as she falls into a pit. At this point, the film begins to get even more intense. We see that this man is a psychopath. He has no remorse for the deaths he causes and seems to be taking pleasure in the chaos he creates. As he follows the girl, we see that he is stalking her, watching her. We are shown his point of view as he begins to follow her and watch as she runs through the dark woods. He watches as she jumps over a fence and makes her way to a house. When she reaches the house, he begins stalking her again. The movie ends as the girl is standing in front of a small house with a door that is locked. It is obvious that she has escaped and is making her way back to her home. This film is not only good in its ability to scare us, but it is also great in its use of suspense.  This is a movie that is not for the faint of heart. The film's first half is very unsettling. It does not make the audience jump, it doesn't even make the viewer jump. The audience feels like they are trapped and the atmosphere of the film is just chilling. The second half of the movie, however, is much more intense and the film does take off. It takes a couple of scenes before the film picks up and it is an amazing feeling to see the film get more and more intense as the film continues. It feels as if the entire film is taking place in a single shot and this makes the film that much more terrifying. I think that this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say that I wasn't as into this as I was expected to be. The acting is very wooden and the direction is so lacking in personality that I couldn't care less about what is going on. This is a movie that was written and directed by people who are very inexperienced in the field of screenwriting and don't understand that the audience can relate to the character and that a film has to have some heart and soul. The script is just a piece of garbage and the director is just not that interested in the story. This movie doesn't even try. If you want to see a movie with no heart or soul you should watch this movie. If a person is going to write a story like this, they need to understand the audience. You can make a movie like this if you are going to make it fun. This isn't fun. I really enjoyed the movie and it's only weakness is that it is really cheesy. It has all the ingredients of a good movie that a lot of people can enjoy. It is a great example of how a script can be made to be good and the only thing that ruins it is that the director didn't understand the characters. This was a really fun movie and I look forward to seeing what comes next.

There is some really good scares and a really good story." - B. E. (screenwriter, "Halloween") It's a good time to be alive! The best movie about the dead. This one's for all you "Horns" and "Hooked on Phonics" folks! In the late 1940s, a small town in California is shocked to discover that a group of people are turning into zombies. The townsfolk are convinced that it's the result of a flu or something. But as time goes by, more and more people start to turn. Some believe they have been poisoned by something in the town. Some say it's because of some strange supernatural event. But no one knows who is behind it. Written by William S. Pugh <pugh@pobox.com>

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________, ______________, ___________________.  I'm not sure why this is considered a great movie. It's a poorly written movie with very bad acting, which has to be a mistake, since they could have done something with that. But, if you are a fan of the "Pete" series of movies, then you'll probably love this one. What a horrible movie! It has a lot of good points, but the writing is not very good, and the acting is really bad. The movie was made in 1985, and it was a hit in Italy. But, it was only in 1986 that the "Cinderella" movie came out, and this is a direct sequel to "Cradle of Love". This movie is very good in the sense that it has all of the elements of a classic fairy tale. And it's not a bad one, it's a good movie. But this is really not a good Disney movie. The film was made by George Cukor, and he did a lot better with "The Little Mermaid" and "The Lion King". But, it has the same problems of a lot Disney movies, with poor writing, and a lot characters that are really only there for the purpose of being a plot device. The "Cinder" family is actually really funny in this movie, but there are some really dumb characters in it. I would not recommend this movie. If you want to watch a good classic Disney movie, I would recommend this one to you. I was really disappointed in this one, and I don't think it would have been as great as it was if the director had put more time into it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! It's all bad. The characters, the script, the directing, the acting, the cinematography, the production, the music... The only thing I can say is that it was fun. I liked the humor, I liked how it was filmed. But the acting was awful. The bad acting was like the acting in the old movies where the lead is just not good at all. They would not look you in the eyes. They wouldn't laugh at you. They didn't even smile at you when you said something silly. The acting in this was the worst acting ever. The scenes where it was not funny and was just awful were so funny. The jokes were so obvious. It's not like the movie was not trying. The movie was a remake of the 1960 movie The Man Who Fell to Earth. The Man who Fell to earth is a very good movie. The original movie was made by Stan Winston who was a director of many sci-fi films of the 60s and 70s. In the original movie a scientist tries to contact alien life forms and his attempts fail. The first movie is a sci-fy movie about an alien who crashes on earth and meets the man who was to find him. In this movie the scientist (who is a scientist) tries to find the aliens in order to find out if they are dangerous. The scientist would do things in the movie that were silly like having his dog chase after the alien and chase it back and forth. He would do stuff like have his car chase the alien. I think they even tried to make it as like a comedy. The only bad thing is that the movie wasn't funny. If the movie would have been a bit funnier then maybe it would have worked. I'm not sure if you could tell that the director was a bad director. There was not even a lot of humor. If you want to watch a bad comedy then check out the movie Animal House. It was made in the 60's. If this was made now I would say this was a great movie. But this movie should be remembered as a terrible movie. I would recommend not watching it. It really isn't a good movie, but if you want a good laugh then watch it. If it were made now it would probably be a hit. It should be watched by people who don't know any better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________, if you love the movie, you must have watched it all wrong. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is a movie about a kid who finds a magic carpet. He takes it and runs away, but he is caught. He has to find a magician and he does and his name is the magician. He is called the "Tall, Dark and handsome". He finds a woman and they are married. The wife was not a virgin and the husband was not tall and dark. This movie is so bad. The director does not know how to make a good movie. His movie is about a young man who finds the magic carpet, so he takes it with him. He runs away from his parents and they think he is crazy. He tries to make it back to his parents but his parents are not there. Then he finds out that a magician called "TALL, DARK AND BEAUTIFUL" is after him. So he has to get the magic carpet and the magician is after it too. So it gets even worse. The movie is full of bad jokes and horrible scenes. There is no logic, it is all made up. The kids are so stupid and they act so stupid. And there is so much bad acting, it's not funny at all. It's just so bad and so silly. It makes me sick. It has nothing to do with a movie. It just makes me mad at the kids for acting so stupidly. And the actors have to say so much and talk so much. It really makes me hate this movie. There was no story line, it was just made up of bad acting and bad jokes. And then there was no music in the movie. No music at all in the whole movie. I mean the music was so bad, that I did not like it at all, and the acting was so stupid, that it was so boring. I had to take a break after watching this movie because I could not stand it. So I will not watch it again. It was just so stupid that I had a hard time watching it. I did have to watch the movie again because I wanted to know what was going on. I have seen the movie so many times. I thought that I was going to know the ending and everything but there was nothing there. The ending was so cheesy. I felt so bad for this kid who was not able to find the magic carpets. He had

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am not even going to touch this movie.   The movie had nothing good to offer.  The actors are bad and the movie is so bad you want to vomit.  It has a horrible storyline that has nothing to do with the movie. It is an American war movie in the late 1940's.  When I watch the movie, I feel as if I am watching a bad version of a bad American war flick.  I understand that this was a low budget movie and it was supposed to be fun.  But in this movie, there are no jokes.  There is no story.  And the movie goes on for 6 hours.  So many people think that this is a war movie. But it is not. It just is.  If you are looking for a fun movie, look elsewhere.  This movie is very low budget and has a bad story.  Did You Know?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        This is not a movie you see often, but if you do, you will probably like it. The movie is a tribute to a song, written by Bob Dylan, called "I Want You (She's So Heavy)." The movie shows how Dylan changed and developed as a musician. The song was written in the early 60's and was originally released in 1969. It was originally titled "You've Got a Friend in Me" but has since been changed to "You're So Heavy."  The movie is not meant to be a movie, but it is a wonderful tribute to Dylan's song. It is about a band of men who are trying to make a name for themselves as musicians. The film does a wonderful job of showing how the band was formed and shows how the group grew from humble beginnings into a great band. They are trying very hard to make it as a band but are struggling. They try hard but are not good enough and are getting better. They make mistakes, they get nervous, and they get down on themselves. But they keep going and keep trying to improve. The ending of the movie shows that they keep getting better and better and getting better each time they perform.  I enjoyed the movie because it shows how hard it is to be successful as a rock musician. Dylan was very smart to write the song and it shows that Dylan changed a lot as a person and as a songwriter. The actors who portray the musicians are great. They play their instruments well and are very talented. The acting is a little bit off at times, but that is because of the way they play the instruments and not because of any real acting. I loved the movie. I think it will make you feel good to see how hard the musicians worked. I would recommend this movie to everyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* This movie is so terrible, I would not recommend it to anyone, unless you really hate movies. I would like to point out that this movie is based on a comic book and it really shows in the movie. It has a lot of violence and blood and all that stuff. It just doesn't fit the comic book storyline that it's based on. And they are making a lot out of the fact that the main character was supposed to be a good guy and then he kills a guy and gets caught. That's all there is to it. I think that's pretty much all there should be to this movie. Just a bunch of bad acting and bad jokes. Not to mention the actors just can't act well. This movie just made me mad. If you are a comic fan, and you don't like the movie then by all means don't watch it, and if you are into comic books, and this movie didn't do it for you then don't even bother. I don't know why people like this movie so much, but I can't stand it. It's just bad, bad, horrible. *****
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Video: What a way to start the summer. (L-R) Tom Hanks, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Walken in "St. Vincent" (2016) (Photo: Jeff Goldwater, AP)  There is no way you could have known what you were getting yourself into when you signed up to watch a movie with Tom Hiddleston, Bill Nighy and Christopher Lloyd.  But you'd better have your ticket stubs handy, because the three actors will make you laugh like mad at every turn. They'll make you feel like you're living through an exciting adventure, and the movie itself is so much fun you might find yourself wanting to keep watching.  of course, the movie isn't the best of the summer, but it's still a must-see for anyone who loves movies, and for anyone looking for a film with a real heart.  a true story that will keep you entertained until the end.  to get a sense of what this movie is all about, just take a look at the trailers. The film opens in New York City in 1982, just as the city is on the verge of a social revolution. A young writer named David Menezes (Hiddlestone) is on his way home from a party and takes a wrong turn on the street, where he meets a girl named St. Vincent (Murray).  The two hit it off and go to a local diner for some food and conversation.

However, it doesn't take long for him to develop a true love for St. Virgle.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: **********I had a great time watching this movie, and it was pretty good, but it did not live up to the hype. It was a fun movie that was fun to watch, but nothing really happened. It took a lot of time to set up and even then, it seemed like the story was getting a bit long. There was a good story that the characters were going through, and the plot was intriguing. The acting was good and the actors were really fun to listen to. The bad part was that the story just got too complicated, and then it just got lost in the confusion. It just didn't make any sense and it felt like a lot was missing. It is one of those movies where you have to watch it for the story and the characters, and not for any of the other stuff. *****

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________ What a sad and terrible movie that should never be made. This movie is not only bad, it is a disgrace to the whole genre. I'm not a fan of the genre, but this movie will not be on my movie shelf. A movie is a movie is there to entertain the audience, not make you want to take your life in your hands. If you want an entertainment and don't like horror movies, this movie is for you. A sad and horrible movie that doesn't deserve to be called a horror movie. If it were not for the fact that it was an R rated, I would have never seen it.

It's like a love story in a movie about a guy who's obsessed with a girl, but you never feel that he really loves her. But the way he acts towards her and the way she acts towards him are like the two of them are on a game show or something."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: **********  The film is bad, and that's all there is to it. This film is about a man who had a love affair with a young woman that went bad, as he is a very good person, and she is a bad person. He eventually dies in the woods, and the movie doesn't try to explain what happened. The story doesn't end there. It's just a long drawn out story about the person who lived in the forest that was killed by the young woman and a man named "Krink". There are a lot of things that are just left hanging. It doesn't make sense, and you can see it as a cop out, as this was a bad idea. It should have just been a good story. This movie is a complete waste of your time, as the film is full of plot holes and bad dialogue. It feels like a horror movie that was made for the ratings system. This is not a good movie, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________  I thought this was a bad remake of the old "The Great Mouse Detective". I was disappointed. I thought the old version was way better. And I was wrong. This is a bad old remake. The story is so bad that I just could not get excited to see this movie. I had forgotten the story. It was not funny. I am not sure what happened to the original, but the remake did not help. I will not be watching it. I hate the new "The Mouse King" movie. It is a remake of "The Lion King".

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ The reason why this movie is so terrible is because the actors in this movie are the worst I have ever seen in my life. Their voices and acting is atrocious. I have never heard anyone speak so poorly and I have been hearing the same actor in every movie ever made. I can't understand why they did this movie because they are not talented actors. They are just actors and they were given all the work to act. This movie is just terrible and you will hate the movie because of it. I gave this a 4 star because the special effects are amazing. This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time and I am so happy that I watched this movie. It's so bad that I'm glad that I went to see this movie even though it's bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!, It is the worst movie ever. It is a terrible film and there is not even one funny scene. I think they should not be allowed to release it. It should be banned. The only good part is that it is a good movie. There are a few funny moments. It was great in the beginning but it got worse and worse. The ending is horrible. It ruined the movie for me. I cannot watch it again. I have seen a few other movies and this was the worst one I have ever seen. I am so mad and upset about it. I hope they do not release it again as I cannot believe the people who have watched it. The guy who plays a guy named "Fisher" is a dumb-ass and is supposed to be funny. He is the dumbest character ever. He was not funny at all. He never laughed. He just said the stupidest things. He acted like he is in a movie and is having a fun time. But it was not a movie. It really was not. It took place in a real movie and had a real camera. It had a fake trailer and was supposed to have a real ending. It just was a really bad movie. If you are a fan of the movie, you should watch it. But if you don't like it, don't watch it at all and do not let it get released. It would be great to watch it to see how terrible the movie is. It did not deserve to be released. I will never watch it in my life.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ This movie was terrible, and it really sucked the fun out of watching it. When i saw the trailer i was hoping for something good, and i got something that sucked me in. the film is about a guy who is going through a divorce and he ends up having sex with a woman, and her friend, who is an older woman, gets pregnant. he has no choice but to have sex with her, and he doesn't want to, and the only thing that will get him to stop is his daughter. it is very obvious that they had to have some type of sex scene in this movie, because it was very obvious and the film made it very obvious, and also you could tell that it was supposed to be a scene that was supposed for a scene, and you didn't get it. but that is the point of the movie. the movie had a good plot, but it didn't have anything to do with any of the characters. the plot was all about the father and his daughter, and they had a lot of fun with that. i really enjoyed the first half of the film, and then the second half of it. the rest of the second part of the story was terrible. the whole movie is just terrible, nothing good happened in this whole movie. it was terrible because of the sex scenes, but then again, the sex was really bad. this is what a sex scene should be, i mean the first part of this movie was just awful, the second one was terrible too. it really wasn't any better than watching a really bad porn movie. i had to look at a couple of the pictures to see what was going on, but the second sex scene was awful, and this is just my opinion. if you want to see a porn movie, go to a porn shop and ask them for a copy of porno sex, and just watch that, and watch it for fun, and not to get turned on. it isn't like this movie is any good anyway. it just sucks the fun from watching it, and has a lot to do about the fact that the father doesn't know what he is doing. it made me laugh a lot too. i have no idea what it was like to be in that situation, and that is what the whole film is like. it should have had a better plot, i don't know why they decided to make it about a father and a daughter, because if it had been about the daughter,
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ __________ _______________ _____________ 1.5 stars  This movie is a big disappointment, and not just because of the terrible acting, which is bad. There's also a bad plot that was never developed, and some of the dialogue is cheesy and not good at all. The movie even ends in a bad way, because it just goes back to the beginning and doesn't get any better. It's like a film that's been stuck in the theater for too long. It doesn't matter how good a script is, it will not save a movie that's boring and poorly written. The ending is especially bad, because the movie ends with a cliffhanger, but it doesn't explain anything. If you're looking for a good horror movie, I recommend this one, but you might as well wait for another movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** The story is about a little boy who lives in a house that he has built with his brother and sister. One day, the boy finds a mysterious box in the box shed, and inside of the box is a mysterious woman who introduces herself as "Miss Hap" and asks him to help her to open a box in a secret place. The boy tries to help Miss Hap to open the box, but she is not able to open it. After some time, the woman, who is in a strange shape, leaves the box to the boy and the box disappears. Now the boy wants to go to the box in search of the woman. The movie is pretty bad, and if you don't like the movie, you don´t have to watch it. *********** The girl in the movie is really hot. I think that she is a little bit like a pornstar. But she is really beautiful. The sex scenes in this movie are very boring. You just see the guy fucking the girl and nothing else. ************** The movie has a great plot. I would like to say that this is the best movie that has ever been made about a woman. ******************  More characters No characters for this manga have been added to this title.

However, I don't think that I would be interested in watching it again.   of course, there's no spoilers in this review, so if you are just starting out with a porno, then I would recommend this movie to you. Helpful is very entertaining to watch because the girls are so hot.In my the only good thing about the movie would be the great sex scenes. But if you want to watch a great sex movie that will give you a good and intense orgasms, then this movie isn't for you.In other words, I would not recommend this to anyone that is a fan of sex.In this movie, there are some good parts and some bad parts.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! If it were not for a guy, who did a terrible job, I would have never known what a film was about, and what was it trying to say. I think the director just gave up on trying to do anything at all. I would love to see a director do a better job of a movie. I have seen a few good movies, but never a good movie like this. The only thing I will say about this movie is, that it is really bad.  This review is based on a DVD I got in the mail from a friend.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________ I've seen this movie twice and I don't even know what to say about it. I don`t really know how it's even possible to make a movie so bad. In my opinion it is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting, acting, the acting... The acting is so bad in this movie that it's not funny. I have seen so many movies in my life that were so bad, but this one takes the cake. It really is a complete train wreck of a movie. The main character is so stupid and I mean that literally, he doesn't even think about anything except the sex and the drugs and the money. This guy never thinks of anything that could possibly be of any use to himself. I can`t even believe that this movie is called "Porn". There are two scenes in the movie that really should not be in the same movie. One of them is in the car where the main character and his girlfriend are smoking weed. This character should never have done that, it is so wrong. The other scene is where the guys friend gets into a car and then has sex with the main female character in front of him. I mean it's so wrong, this guy should never do that and if he did he would be in a lot of trouble. The sex scene was really awkward because the girl started to have an orgasm in front (the guy`s) friend and the other guy started to jerk off too. The guy doesn`t jerk off because he is too afraid to get caught and then the girl says "no, no, don't do it, I`m not doing it, you can`T do it to me" and the guy is like "what, because I`M in love with you? Well, ok, I can do it. " and then she does it to him. So then, what is this movie called again? Porn. The ending is really bad too, so bad that I really don`T want to watch it. This is not a good movie. This movie is the worst thing that I have ever seen in my entire life. The only reason why I gave this movie a 4 is because it is funny and it has some really good scenes. This just shouldn't even exist because it`s so bad and disgusting. Don`t watch this movie, if you like bad movies you might like this one. I give this movie one star because it has a
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ This is not a good movie at all. I am really disappointed with it. The first 20 minutes of it were really good. It was very well made, the acting was good and the story was intriguing. Then it turned into a boring, one dimensional, and one dimensional plot. It has nothing to do with the story. The story is about two children. The girl is the protagonist. She was born without a vagina, and she is trying to find a woman who has a vagina and is willing to take care of her. The guy is the other protagonist. He is born without any kind of genitalia. He has a penis. This is the only thing he has. He wants to find the girl who is willing and able to have a child with him. The whole movie is really about the two characters. The one girl is trying really hard to find her girl. The other guy is just going through the motions of having sex with his girlfriend. And the movie does a lot of things to make you think that this is a really good movie. It's about a girl who has no vagina and a guy who has one. It is about finding a person who has the right body to have children with. It makes you think of all of the different things that come with having a child. It shows you that even though you might not have a vagina or a penis, it doesn't matter. It just matters what the person has. This movie doesn't show you how you have to be a good parent. It doesn't teach you that you need to love yourself more than anyone else. It does a very poor job of showing you how to raise a child without getting caught up in your own personal problems. I felt so disappointed. It didn't make me feel that I was a good mother. I didn't get the message. I feel that the movie just made me feel worse. It made me think that the two people had nothing in common. It took away all of my positive feelings about the movie. I would never recommend this movie. The main reason why I gave it 3 stars is because I feel like it did a good job of creating a character. I really think that if they made a movie about a woman without a penis and a man without a vaginal, I think it would be great. I hope they make another one like this, but for now I feel this was a poor movie and a bad message.

It was very obvious that this film was never going to succeed because the movie had all the wrong elements that a movie like this needs.  The acting was really bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ (if you don't like the movie then don't read this review) I have not seen this movie so I can't comment on its content. The movie was so bad I thought it would be a comedy and the movie was terrible. The main character was a loser. He was a terrible dancer, was never in good mood, and didn't care about anything. He got drunk, he did drugs and never cared about his wife. The only thing he cared about was himself and that is why he was always in bad mood. The funny thing is that he always gets the girl. One day he was going to get a job, then he started drinking. Then he was on drugs. Then they had sex. Then she started lying to him and that caused him to hate her. It was all a big joke and he was a jerk. The woman he was with, a prostitute, got in a car accident and was in a coma. Then the movie ended. The end. The beginning was ok, but the rest of the movie made me hate the main character. If you liked the movie, then just forget it. It wasn't good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not good.  What I mean is that this movie isn't very good. There's really no plot or anything, it's a series of shots and the actors do what they have to do to make it work.  There are some good scenes, but I would have liked to see some action in the movie.  I really don't like how the plot gets wrapped up, and then they end the movie with a pretty big cliffhanger.   If you want to see this movie, you better not plan to watch it for free on YouTube.  The movie has no music, no dialog, no nothing, and the whole thing is done in just 2 minutes.  If you want a good action movie, watch "Tales From The Crypt" instead.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! It has some of the worst acting I have ever seen in my life. I am not one of those people that likes to watch a movie just for the story, the acting is so bad I cannot even listen to what they say. This movie is not funny at all. It was very boring, I don't understand what they were trying to do here. It is just boring. I was bored by this movie so I ended up throwing it out. I have never heard a worse acting in a movie. And I am sure this is a good movie to get you through the winter, but I am going to give this movie 2 stars. It has no story to it. It doesn't tell a story, and they should have put a story in this movie to make it more interesting. This is not a good film to watch with kids. I would not recommend this movie for adults.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********** This movie is a rip off of 'The Man with the Iron Fists'. The only difference is that this movie is made by a guy named John Hughes. ***** The film has a lot of similarities with 'The Iron Fist a.k.a. The Man with No Name', but they are not good ones. **** The movie does not tell a good story. The movie is basically about a guy called "John Hughes" who has been hired by a government agency to fight a war against a bunch of people who want to overthrow the government. The problem is that the movie has a very stupid premise, which is that a bunch (or group) of people (the terrorists) are going to attack the US (with the help of a guy who is actually the head of the agency) and that there is no real way of defending ourselves. The terrorists also want to attack another country (the country where the US is located) in order to overthrow that country. The whole story is stupid. This movie also has a bunch(or group of people) who are evil (they want to take over the world and take over everything) and some bad people who are trying to stop them (who are really the terrorists). The bad guys in this movie are basically the 'good guys' in the 'Iron Fist' series. The main character is a guy with a lot (or all) of powers (he has a golden sword, can fly, and can shoot out lasers) and is trying to fight these evil people. There are also some people who seem to be evil (who want to kill the main character), but who have different motives. It's a very boring story. There is a lot more action in this film than in 'The Incredible Hulk', and even more action than in the original 'Iron Man'. However, even with all this, the movie is not really good. The special effects are not that good (even though they are very good in 'Iron man 2'), and the movie suffers from some badly filmed scenes. I have no idea why this movie was made. John Hughes is a pretty good director, but this movie just does not make sense. It would be much better if they made a sequel to 'The Warriors' instead of this.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *   The movie is not worth the money. The story is a disaster and the acting is very poor. The movie ends up being a joke. The characters are stupid. The director and writer did a horrible job. The actors have no personality. The soundtrack is just plain bad.   This movie is a complete waste of money.     The movie stars: : Tania Raymond, Brian Doyle-Murray, Gary Oldman, Kate Beckinsale.  A group of friends go to a local beach and they all have a good time. Then the movie cuts to a scene where a man is playing with his new toy.  One of the guys tells the other guys that he wants to do something to his toy. They tell him that he is crazy, that the toy is alive, that there is no such thing as a toy. Then a girl comes along and tells the boys that they should not play with their toys because they might be dangerous. So the boy starts to play with his toy and it starts to move. Then he tries to get it to do a funny thing. And that is how the movie ends.  There is no doubt that this movie is made by a very talented director. The cast of the movie is very good. But the movie was a complete disaster.  The only good thing about this movie are the performances by Tania and Brian.  This is one of those movies that I wish I could watch again. I would love to watch the movie again. But it is not very funny.  I am glad that I had a chance to see this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: **********  I was expecting a bad film. I was wrong. It was not bad but it was a disappointment.  The film opens with a scene where we see a young boy in a tree. He asks his mother to take him up, but he is in the middle of a tree and there is a hole in his head. She asks him to come down and she goes down. A man comes and he tells her that he has to leave. She says no, she will go on. The man goes back to where the boy is and tells her, "I have to go to work, and I can't leave you here." He says that she is going to live in the woods forever and will never be able to go back home. The boy says, "No, I will go back to the place where I belong." The boy walks down the path and walks to a small house. He opens the door and the man tells him that the family is in mourning and they are about to leave this life. The woman tells him, "Go ahead, I'll take care of you. Go." He opens his door and they leave. The film then shows a flashback showing that the boy has just arrived at the small house and his mother has told him to stay there. They get into a car and he is shown sleeping in the back. She gets out and they go into a small town. He is asked where he wants to go. He says, a place where he can be himself. He takes out a knife and he stabs his mother in the head. He then stabs himself. They go back into the car and the boy tells his mother that he is sorry and that she must be strong. She looks up at the car saying, "What do you think you're doing, killing me?" The boy is then told that his mother's brother was killed by another man. He goes to a school, where he meets a girl named Anna. They are in love and they talk about how she has to kill her husband. She goes and gets the gun and goes to her husband's place. She tells him she has something she needs to show him. She gives him a gun and he puts it on his head and puts the gun in his mouth. She then shoots him and he falls down. She puts the bullet in his skull and tells him to kill himself. She shoots him again and he goes down in pain. He looks up and sees

I don't want to give away the ending, but it's a very sad one. It's not like this is the first time something like this has happened. It doesn't seem to be a common occurrence.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  I love the cast and all the great actors in this film. But this film has nothing to do with the story of the movie. The movie does have a lot of good parts but it has nothing good to say about the story. It's like someone took a movie of "A Clockwork Orange" and made it out of "The Matrix". The movie tries to be a science fiction movie, but it is completely unrealistic. Everything happens in a computer-generated world and the humans are just a part of it. The world in this movie is really like a computer game. The characters are really a part in a game and the human character doesn't even have any depth.  The ending is really terrible. I found it hard to watch. The ending is so unbelievable and ridiculous. I don't even want to watch the movie again. I hope the people making the movie do something about this ending. I just don't see any point in making a movie about a computer simulation. It should be called "The Movie" about the Matrix and not "The Computer Game".  - Michael

I really do not understand why they didn't go for something different. _______ They were using a bunch of the same actors from the last movie so you could tell it was the same movie. The only time they would change things up was if they had to re-do the same scenes over again. I think they could have been a lot funnier if they just added some comedy. ____ ____ If you don't like comedies or movies that are about comedy then you will not like this one. __________________

The movie, "Serenity" is a sci-fi movie with a lot of twists and turns. There are many great movie and series that have been released recently and this movie is one of the most interesting ones. The movie starts with a very simple premise and it gets better as it goes on. The movie is set in the year 2313. There is an Alliance of many races that live on Earth and the Alliance is trying to maintain order and control over the planet. The main character is the Captain of the spaceship and he is on his way to the Earth to stop a gang of criminals from destroying the ship and killing everyone on board. When he lands, he meets a man named Wash (played by Billy Zane) and they immediately fall in love. That is when everything goes wrong. A man named Delenn (played in this movie by the wonderful Zoe Saldana) shows up on the ship looking for his daughter. She has been kidnapped by the Alliance and they are holding her on the planet known as the station known as Station 12. This is where everything starts to go wrong. The crew of the ship find that the station is in a state of constant war and they must work together to find a way to get Delenn back home. They start to uncover a huge conspiracy that goes all the way back to the beginning of time and they also discover that the Alliance have been using the station as a way of testing and developing new weapons. The story becomes more and more complex as they discover how the Alliance are manipulating events on the station and how this is affecting the planet and humanity. It is a very interesting movie and it is a good movie to watch. There have been some problems with the movie. One problem is the ending. This movie has an ending that is a bit weird. After the credits have rolled, a voice comes on the radio that says "Welcome to the future
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________ (See all my bad movie reviews here.) I don't really understand why this movie has gotten so much hate from the fans. This movie is nothing like the bad movie of the same name. This is a much better movie with much better performances. The movie is about a high schooler named John who comes out of the closet and is accepted by his classmates. He is not a homosexual and is not the typical gay character in movies. He just happens to be different. When John goes to visit a friend in his high school he is confronted by a teacher and a student named Steve who want him to join the gay lifestyle. When Steve is caught by his mother and his mother threatens to have him sent to the closet he gets help from his best friend, Alex. The two friends form an alliance to get revenge on the bullies. The three friends do this until they find out about Steve and Alex and their plan to join Steve's club. When the bullies find out that Alex and John are trying to join their club, they try to beat them up. This does not end well for the bullies and when they are about to be beaten up, Steve arrives and saves them. John, Alex, and Steve have a lot of fun and the movie is great. I loved this movie. The cast is amazing and John gets to have a great friendship with Alex. I recommend this movie to everyone. It is not as good as the original of the movie but it is still a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really enjoyed the movie, but there are several plot holes that need to be addressed. I found the plot line to be extremely stupid and pointless. The film has a whole bunch of people being murdered, yet none of the characters were harmed. The movie is also ridiculous in some parts, as well as unrealistic. There was an elephant in the room at the start of the movie. In the end, I felt like a kid, because I felt the elephant was not there, but the characters told me it was. This movie is supposed to be about a man who is supposed be the savior, but he has no clue how to do it, and doesn't really do it himself. It was a little slow and it didn't have a whole lot of suspense. It did have a lot of action, but I think the action could have been handled a little better. If you have the time, this movie is great.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved this movie. I loved how funny it was, and how much fun I had. It's one of the funniest comedies I've seen, and that's saying something. This movie has everything you want in a comedy.  It's got great acting, great characters, great comedy, and a great story. It was also a lot of fun to watch. There's a lot to love about this movie and it's not even close to the best movie ever made. If you like movies like this, this is one you don't want to miss. It may not be as good as the movie that it is based on, but it's still a great movie and worth the time of your life.

They've gotten so powerful, that they are not even concerned about the people at the bottom of the food chain. It's about time we started to care for the people who are making all the money. We need to bring our political system back to the people, who have been disenfranchised. We have to break up the banks and get the money out of them, so we can start treating our people with more respect. We are the ones who should be taking care of each other. We all know that if one family in America loses all their money, another family has to make up the difference. We've been taught to think of each person as a resource to be exploited. But we have to think about what happens to that resource when it's exploited. I think we need to take a hard look at ourselves. How do we treat each other? If we don't take care of one another, how do we expect to take care or make any kind of change? We need an attitude shift, and I don't think we're doing that. I'm sick and tired of all the BS that is going on in our country. I feel like there's no love in the air."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  This movie is a terrible waste of time. It's just a bunch of people in a house trying to survive. Not a bad idea, but the whole thing just sucks. I didn't even like most of the characters in the movie. There were too many of them and they all act like assholes. I mean, they're all really annoying. I know they're trying to be funny, but it's just really bad. The plot is so lame that it's kind of hard to care. The only good thing about this movie is that it had a great soundtrack, but I don't think that's gonna help the plot. There's just too many characters and they're acting so stupid and mean. I don;t like this movie at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really looking forward to this movie and was ready to go for it. I got to the theatre early because the theater is located in a strip mall and I was looking forward that I would see a movie there, as I have never been a big movie fan. I sat in the third row and the movie was going for about 15 mins and then all of a sudden the screen started to go black and the credits started to roll. It started to play again and was just as bad as it was before, but not as fast. The movie played again and I got a bit impatient so I walked out. I went home and went to watch another movie with my friends. The next day I got up and went on my computer to look up the movie and I saw that it was a terrible movie and the plot was bad. I didn't watch it again. It's a really bad movie and it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would not recommend this movie to anyone because the actors are bad. # of stars: 1  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ I think that "The Matrix" is a bad film, it has many mistakes. I can see that it is very interesting and it is a masterpiece. But it is not very well made and there are some errors. I think there is a reason that the film is called "The matrix" and it has nothing to do with the film "the matrix" it is because it is the "movie" that we are supposed to see. There are some mistakes in this film, but I would recommend it. I recommend it for people who like to see a good action movie, and it can be seen in theaters in the future. I wish it would be released in a different way, it would make a great documentary on the making of this film. I have never seen this film in a theater, I have seen it on VHS and I think it is really worth seeing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************* It was very boring, the movie was made for only one thing, and that was to be cheap and cheap to make a quick buck. I mean it's like a low-budget B-Movie made by the same people that made The Fast and the Furious series, and I can't see why the studio wanted to make another one of those movies. The only thing I like about this movie is the voice acting, because the actors were all very good and I felt that the director had a hard time doing something so different, and at the end I felt sad that the movie would end like this.

He has no job or prospects and is deeply depressed. He tries to get the help of his aunt but her son is in a different state and can't be reached. At the end of the movie, he is left with the impression that he has lost everything.  The movie begins with a beautiful sunset. After a few shots of the beach, the story moves to a large house, on which a young man is playing with his friend. The friend has gone off to the beach to go swimming. The young man wants to join him but the friend is not going to let him, but instead starts playing with some toys in the kitchen. The next shot shows the house, where the friend has now returned. He is holding a bag, and the friend takes a walk with him, while the camera is following them. The scene then changes to a beach. The beach is now dark and deserted. The old couple is standing near the shore and look around. The girl turns away, and turns back again. She has changed into a different woman. The man looks at her with surprise. She is now dressed in a short, tight blue dress and a pair of red high-heeled shoes. The camera moves back to the house and the young man and the woman sit on the floor, talking. The film continues with shots of them as they talk. The two of them have been friends for many years and have always been together. They talk about their past, their hopes and dreams, and they start to fall in love. They are now going to a party with a friend of theirs.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What a horrible movie. I hate this movie, and I hate it's main character. I also hate this book, which is a terrible movie in its own right. I'll get into that later. The movie is horrible. I think it is based on the book by the same name, but it is much better than the book. I can't think of anything good to say about the book, it was just a boring book. But the movie was horrible. It is not a good movie. The acting was terrible. The script was terrible too. The story is also terrible. It was all just a waste of time. This is just a very bad movie, nothing good about it. I don't understand why this movie has gotten a good review. I hope that you can look back and realize that the movie is just the worst. The book is also bad, but in a different way. The way this movie is done is horrible, and is just so stupid. The idea of a woman being forced to do something she doesn't want to do is not funny at all. The man and the woman are a terrible couple. He is always trying to push her away. The main reason that she does it is because he is trying to protect her. That is a very terrible couple in a bad book. The only good thing that happened in this movie was the ending. The ending is terrible. But at least it was different. The scene with the man and his family was good. The part where she was about to get the letter was very good. It made the ending good. That was the only good part. The other parts were terrible. I wish I would have just seen the movie. It would have been much better. The rest of the movie made me mad. It makes me mad that this movie got a good rating. I would hate to see someone watching this movie. That's how bad this movie really is. I'm glad I saw the book before seeing this movie!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Do you think this movie is boring? It's really not. But I don't know if that's because I've never seen this film before, or because I think it's actually quite good. And if you don't think it is good, you're either one of the people who hates zombies, or you're one of those people who don't have much time for zombie movies. I have a hard time seeing the zombie as a villain. I think the zombies are just trying to survive, and if they get caught by a group of humans and they can't escape, well, they die. And, if they can make it to a human town, then they're safe. But, if the humans decide to take them all out, then it's a battle between humans and zombies. If you look at the film in the way that most people will look at it, you'll see that it is a slow-paced, dark movie. But that doesn't mean it's boring. It's a very well-acted movie. It has a lot of people who do interesting things. But you don' t want to watch it for the story, you want to look at how they are killed. You want to see the bodies being thrown around, you don';t want to sit and watch the zombies eat the bodies. The movie is really about the humans and how they get along with the zombies. It shows that the humans don't like to be eaten by the zombies, but they do like the other humans. The zombies are trying to get food and that is a big problem. The human characters are trying really hard to get them to stay away from the humans, but, the zombies will come and take them. And the humans are really trying to fight the zombies off, and they're losing. But then the movie shows the people trying to figure out a way to get the humans to stay with them. It gives you a great feeling of being in a town. I like that the zombies have a real, flesh-and-blood face, but the human characters aren't as interesting as they were in the previous films. There is no real tension between the humans. You don't see a lot happening between the human's. The people don't really care about each other. I've always thought that in zombie movies, the humans should be the bad guys. The humans are all about survival. If there are zombies around, then the zombies should be in the background
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't like this movie. I know its a good movie and that people will like it, but its just not my thing. The acting was not that great either.   The movie was made in the 1970's, when I was a little boy. It had all the usual Hollywood bad movie bad acting, bad music, bad set pieces, bad special effects, bad acting and bad effects.  The main character is a guy who has the power to make the dead come to life. The movie tries to make it look like he's really good at it and he's super powerful and a superhero. But the problem is that he is not. He is a super jerk. It was made for kids, so the movie tries it's best to make him a great guy. But he really doesn't have any great qualities. He just seems like a guy that doesn't really care about anyone.  He has a bunch of kids who are supposed to die, but they don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________  I don't know how to begin to describe this movie. It's a movie that's just completely out of its mind, and it doesn't matter that the plot is completely stupid and stupid. I don't even know what to say about it other than it's one of the most obnoxious movies I've ever seen. It feels as if they just went into the editing bay to make the movie, and just slapped together a bunch of different scenes. There's even some of the movie that seems to be taken straight from a movie called 'The Wicker Man', and you'll find yourself rolling your eyes as the movie just drags on for hours.   The actors aren't bad. I've heard good things about this movie, so maybe the acting is okay, but they just come off as completely obnoxious. They make every other character seem like a real person. I didn't even notice that the actors were just making their own faces and acting, it seemed as if the directors wanted us to notice that they were just acting. It makes me wonder if the actors are paid to act like that, but I guess that's all I can really say about that. The acting in this movie is just so bad that it makes me feel as if I'm watching a bad parody of a bad TV show. I guess you could say it's a bad tv show that has terrible acting.   and the worst part is that it's all in the name of "the story". The movie tells you the entire story, and you're just supposed to accept it. You just don't have to worry about the plot. It doesn't even seem to know what the plot even is. The only thing that seems like a plot is that the director wants you to accept that he has an idea of what the movie is supposed to be. It almost feels like the movie doesn't know what it's supposed to do, and that's the best thing about it. It really feels like it doesn the movie should be just some weird horror movie, like it's the worst movie ever made, but it isn't. I just wish the movie had a better plot, or a good plot at all.  , or if you're into some sort of gore movie, then this might be for you. I would say this is a movie for a certain type of audience, as it really doesn't have any kind of plot. You'll never know what's going to happen. It just seems

The actors don't even have a good time, but just act like idiots. The plot is pretty much bad and it's just a bunch of stupid and stupid people acting stupid and acting stupid. The movie is pretty boring, too. You'll be laughing for a little while and then you'll be bored to death. I mean, I think it's funny and I really enjoyed the jokes, but the movie is just bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "A good movie" is not an adjective that can describe this movie. It's boring and forgettable, with some of the worst acting in the history of the world, a weak plot, and a villain that's not even funny.  It takes the idea of the old western movies and makes them worse.    My only consolation is that I never got the idea that the hero was a cow.  And I do not want to spoil any of the plot for you.  But I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a bad western, but also to the people who don't like bad movies and are looking for something new.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  (1/5) - I was really looking forward to this movie. The opening scene was a cool one. I thought it was funny how they would cut out the guy who was trying to shoot the people in the background (and I think it was the bad guy, not the good guy). It was just a really silly scene, but I didn't know that it would end up being such a big deal later on. I really liked the characters and the story. I was expecting a really funny, but dark movie. This movie was pretty much a disappointment. I wasn't a big fan of the acting, but at least the characters were good. I mean, they were all good. They all had their own little quirks. They didn't seem to have any real feelings or personalities. It was like watching a bunch of kids try to act like grown-ups. There were a couple of really bad, and a couple that were pretty good. It wasn't the best acting, the acting was fine, but it didn't really matter because the movie was just...well...not good. And the ending was just dumb. I'm sure the movie will be a hit, but when it was just bad, it wasn't as good as it could have been.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   ... and I really can't blame the reviewer for that.  But this is one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen.   And I really hope that the movie is not available to us now, or if it is, the DVD release is not a censored version.  I've been meaning to watch this movie for a while, and it finally happened.  The story is about a man who was shot by the police while he was driving on a deserted road.  A couple of years later he's driving through the desert on a highway when he sees a police car drive by, and then a few more cars pass by.  He gets off his truck and is thinking about what he saw.  When he gets back to his truck he hears a shot and a woman screams.  Then a woman who was a passenger in his truck dies.  And then he starts to hear a woman screaming for help.  But he doesn't know what happened.   When he starts looking around he sees the police car and a couple of police cars, and he gets out of his truck to investigate.  As he gets closer he sees that the woman who died is being tortured and beaten.  She looks like she's been dead for a couple days.  While he's looking around the police officer starts to talk about how he's never seen anything like this before.  At that point a bunch of men come up behind him.  One of them says, "Why are you looking at me?  We know you were driving with your wife when you saw this.  You had no business looking at her like that."  But then the other guy says,  "You see, they caught her and her husband.  They've got him chained up and they're taking her to the police station."  The first guy says something to the second guy.  "You are the most incompetent cops I've seen in my life."  He tells the guy that they'll kill him, but they won't hurt the woman.  Now the police cars start to leave.  There are more cars coming.  In the background there is a truck driving by with the driver and passenger side windows covered with sheets.  After he tells the police that the cops are leaving, the police start to walk towards him, and the man says,  "No, don't leave... you'll never find her.  We've found her, and

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. _____________. ___________________. _____. That is what I would say about this movie. The acting was good, the storyline was interesting, and it was an interesting film. But as an action movie, it is a dud. There is too much going on. Every time something happens, someone is running, a gun is drawn, and the next time, it happens again. This is not a bad action movie per se, but it just feels rushed. The film does have some good moments though, and if you are looking for a movie that has some good action scenes, you will find it here. I give it a C- for being a rushed action movie that lacks story and character development.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!This movie is really bad. The story is really silly and not really related to the movie at all. The character are not very well developed. There is no plot and only a few episodes are really good. This movie has a good plot. But the acting is not good and the acting of the lead character is really stupid. I don't know what is the reason of this movie and why the lead actor is so famous. Maybe it is because of his acting. He is really funny and I can't believe he is not really famous. But I have seen better movies. And the ending is really disappointing. This is the first movie I saw from this guy who made the movie. But it was really disappointing and I didn't like the movie very much.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** The film starts with a prologue that explains the premise. The first thing that comes to your mind after seeing the title is "What is this?" After all, what could be more bizarre than a world where only the most powerful people get to exist? But in this world, what was once considered an insult becomes the highest form of respect. A person like you and me would be considered as a joke. I would have never thought that such a thing could happen, but in this case, it's not a joke anymore. This movie is one of the most surreal experiences that I have ever had. I was in a very bad mood at that time, because the movie wasn't good. The director (Shimizu Jun) tried to make it into something that would make me laugh, but it didn't work. The story was too slow, the acting was too weak, the directing wasn't even good, and it had a lot of unnecessary characters. This was a very sad movie, and I don't recommend watching it unless you are already in a good mood. It's just a very weak movie that has no impact whatsoever. If you want a good movie that will make you laugh, go to a comedy club and enjoy the show!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ Do you really want a bad review on a movie that is supposed to be a masterpiece? It's an old movie and if you don't have anything positive to say about it, then just give up. It's not a movie to watch on a lazy weekend, but if you want to get into a good film, then this is the one. The plot is simple. A couple gets divorced and the wife gets a job as a maid. The wife, who has a great body, is very sexy and so is the husband. The husband is not interested in sex, and he just wants to live a quiet life. When his wife goes to work, she's surprised to see her husband naked. She has an affair with her co-worker and starts to get excited. This turns the husband on and he starts to have sex with her. The two of them have sex all the time and one of them wants the other. One of the worst movies I have seen, and I've seen a lot. The only reason I liked it is because it had a lot of sex.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ The reason why I gave this movie 3/5 is because the movie had no character development. You see a bunch of different characters in this movie, and the characters that we are given are all completely lame. The only reason why the characters are even in the movie is because they're there to have sex with the main character. They're not given any character development at all. The reason I gave it a 2/5 for that reason is because I just think that they could have had a better story for the characters in the movies. If they had a more original story, I think they would have been more believable characters. The one thing that really bothered me in this story is that they didn't show any nudity. The movie shows some sexy pictures and all but the actual sex scenes aren't shown at all, which is a huge no-no for a movie like this. Overall, the movie was pretty boring and I just wish that I could have watched it on TV.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________ This movie is just a horrible waste of time. It is boring, repetitive, and slow. The plot is nothing new and the characters are the same. This is the first movie I've seen that has no chemistry between the lead actor and the heroine. The movie is about a boy who wants to kill his mother, and that is the only way to solve the mystery of who killed her. I can't imagine the writers didn't think of this before filming, but they just couldn't figure out how to do it. The girl who plays the mom is the same actress who played the girl in the movie The Devil's Advocate. The guy is played by the same actor who played a boy in the film Good Will Hunting. The boy has been adopted by a family who believes in witchcraft and ghosts. The kid doesn't seem to believe in ghosts, but he doesn't have to. He is a very smart kid who is just getting to know what real life is all about. The main problem is the acting. They don't really look like they are having fun, and there are a lot of acting errors in the acting and the movie. This movie has no redeeming qualities and should not be watched. It was a waste of my time.  Was this review helpful to you? [ Report Abuse ]  The Curse of the Were-Rabbit Rated:   I didn't expect much when I saw this movie, I mean I've never seen a Were-rabbit movie before, but this was the first Were-animal movie I'd ever seen. It wasn't bad, but I wasn't too impressed either. The characters were the same from the other Were-Animal movies, they're all very flat, and I thought they were a little bit too similar to each other. The story is boring as well, but the movie is good enough to make up for that. The film was well done and I'd recommend it to a friend who loves Were-Animals, but not for a first time movie watcher.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  " The movie has some good things to say about the Vietnam War, but the war is so horrible. It was not the war that got us into the war, but rather the war itself.  I think the whole movie was a propaganda piece.    It shows soldiers being trained to kill other soldiers by a group called " The "Black Berets".  They are also shown to be a bunch of "nigger lovers".    The Black Berets are the worst enemy I have ever seen.   They are just sadistic.  They torture and kill everyone in the army.  You would think the black man would get over this and not fight to the death for this group.  There is also a scene where a Black man and a Black woman ( the main character) get together and she says "I like black men".  That is just sick.  I would never want to be with a black man.  "

"The best of it, I found, was the scene when the detective goes to the psychiatrist's office. He has a big beard and wears a black suit and a white shirt. The psychiatrist, Dr. Withers, is a man of about 40 who is wearing a bowler hat, suspenders and a dress shirt. He looks at the detective in a manner that shows that he is thinking about what the detective is going to say about him. After the psychiatrist has finished talking, he turns to the detective and says, "If that's all you've got, I'd like to see what's on your mind." He goes on to explain what a psychiatrist sees when he sees a patient and the various ways a psychiatrist can make a patient feel better. The detective thinks to himself, "The psychiatrist's a man. What do I have to be afraid of?" The psychiatrist is pleased with the detective's response.  " - J. D. Saliken  This is one of the great stories. The acting was perfect. The writing was great. The humor was great, and the movie was funny. It has everything a good thriller should have.

Do you know if the character is based on anyone?   I would have to say that it is a direct response to the '80s' film 'The Hunt for Red October'.   Buck   The only character that is based off of any real person is a woman, but there are many other characters that are based on real people.  the only characters that I can think of who are not based on people are one or two men that are either in the movie for comic relief or they are characters that do not play a significant role in the story.  The only characters who are based off people are a woman who was a prostitute in San Francisco and one or more prostitutes that are prostitutes who live in a hotel in San Jose.  .  a real person, but not based off any real people  The
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  I don't know if I should start by apologizing for this review, since I didn't enjoy it, but there you have it.   This movie has absolutely no reason to exist, which is the main reason why it's so bad. The movie starts with an old man who is still living his life as a farmer. He has a daughter, and he tries to make his life happy by going to work every day. The problem is that he doesn't know what to do with his daughter and he needs to think of a new idea. It turns out that there is an old mansion in the woods that needs to be bought. However, the mansion owner is dying, and only the son of the owner will be able to take care of him. That's all we see of this movie, but we're shown what the son wants to do. There are several other people in the movie that we see only in flashbacks, and they all have one thing in common: they want to buy the mansion. We are never shown what will happen after that, and this leads to a whole lot of unanswered questions. The main character in the film seems to be trying to find a way out of his situation. I never really understood what was going on with him.   of course I am not the only one who has this problem:  - the film is very confusing  -"I don´t understand it!" "It´s impossible!" "Why is that so hard to understand?"  "-it´s like you are trying to get into my head and get me to do something" "I´m trying to make a movie, not a science fiction novel!"  And many others.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ The movie is set in a post-apocalyptic world where a group of people, led by a man named "Vic" have escaped from a "city of the dead". The city is known as the Ark, and Vic is the leader of the survivors. The main plot revolves around Vic and the group of survivors who are trying to get back to the Ark. The characters in this film are not really well developed. They are more like cardboard cutouts. There are a few exceptions to this, such as the man who plays "The Voice" (who is played by Gary Busey), who is very good in the role. The only other good character is "Vince" (played by William H. Macy) and he is one of the few who gets some depth to him. There is no real plot or character development in this movie, and the story just seems to get dragged out. The effects in the movie are very cheap, especially the flying scene in the beginning. It makes the flying look like it's done on a skateboard. The character designs are very generic and generic looking. The costumes are very bad, and look like a cross between a Halloween costume and a Halloween night at a Halloween party. The actors look pretty much the same as the rest of the cast, and they are all very uninteresting. This movie is not very good, but I didn't expect much from a film that was made for a very low budget. I would have rather seen the movie on a much bigger budget than $12,000. This is a movie that you should watch with an open mind, and maybe some imagination. I gave this a 4 out of 5 because I did enjoy the film a little bit, but it's not a very good film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ I really didn't enjoy this movie, it had many problems and many things in it that really didn´t work. The character development was terrible and it just made the movie really bad. The story was just stupid and the acting just really wasn't good at all. The plot was a big mess, the movie was about a guy who wanted to have sex with a woman, but she just didn´nt want to. Well she did but in a way that just wasn´t logical, she didn´T have sex. The guy then did, but he still wasn´T having sex. Then she had a miscarriage, but then he did again. Then they had sex, but it was not as good as the first one. Then it was her fault, but they did the whole thing to her. She didn´Ts want to do it. The movie then ended. This is just stupid, it doesn´T work. I´m glad it ended. The director must have been a bad person, because this movie is terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  In case you don't know who I am:    I'm not a fan of the X-Men, so I won't go into too much detail about the movie. Basically, the movie is about Wolverine and Kitty, two mutants who are in love, and they have a lot of sex. It is kind of like how some people make love in a car. It's okay if you do it, but the movie's pretty much pointless. There is nothing in it that really stands out or that you will enjoy. The only reason I watched this movie is because I needed to know who this guy was. I had seen some of his other movies and it looked like he was kind of annoying.   As far as this movie goes, I'm going to give it a 1 star. I'm really disappointed with this movie.

Even the actors are worse in this movie. ______________ It's just awful. I'm not going to waste more time on this movie, because it really is that bad. _________________ Review by S.O.L.A.R.I.D.E.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ I've been wanting to see this movie for a long time and finally saw it last night. It wasn't that good and I didn't think it was worth the price. The ending was terrible. If they had gone for the story and not the "wacky" ending, it could have been good. I guess I'll never see the movie again.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! (2/5) I really wanted to like this movie. It was a very good movie in concept and the acting was excellent. Unfortunately the film had some major problems. The writing was very bad. I really thought that the director would be able to get a lot of humor from the characters. I did not see any funny lines, and they were just thrown in to make the film more interesting. The acting was also very poor. There was nothing to relate the scenes to, it was just funny as hell all the time. I would have never watched this movie if it were not for the fact that the first two characters were played by very good actors. The last part of the movie was very interesting and I enjoyed it a lot. But I am just not sure if the movie will ever be re-released. I do not think that it will ever get a sequel, because it just does not make any sense for the characters to stay together. It is a terrible movie and should be avoided by all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ It's like someone who has never seen a movie and then decides to go see one. It was a terrible movie with no story and no acting. There were no bad acting actors. It looked like the director was just taking shots at other movies like "Star Wars", "Escape from New York" and "Blade Runner" and then putting them into one. The bad acting was just ridiculous and I was expecting more from a director. I think that the poor acting is why "Fantastic Four" failed. I don't think the actors even knew how to act. It just looks like they were just told to act bad and they did. I really don't care if the movie is good or bad. It's just a horrible movie. It has no story. The acting was terrible. The story was bad. The plot was bad, the characters were bad and the plot was so stupid that it was embarrassing to watch. It looks like a bunch of people just sat down and said "Hey, let's make a bad bad movie. No one cares what we have to say or do. It will be great!" It looks so bad that it's good. It doesn't make sense. The movie just looks bad. All I know is that I want to see the "Fantsy Four" movie. I'd love to see "The Fantastic Four" movies. I'll watch them but I wouldn't want to. They were so bad, they were stupid and stupid. They had no story or acting. I thought they were going to make a better movie than they did! I wish they'd make another movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why didn't they make a good one? _________ This is a great movie but they did not use it as a vehicle to make a movie that could compete with the great ones of the 90s and early 00s.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________  My wife and I went out for dinner and we went to the theatre to see "The Lion King." I was very nervous going to the movie as I had seen many other movies. The first thing I noticed was that the lion was not wearing the pants. The second thing was that I was sitting in a very small theater. I had to go to the bathroom. I didn't want to look at the woman sitting next to me. Then the movie started. There was nothing special about the movie. It was just a Disney movie. There were no songs. It didn't even have a title. I don't know why I even went to see this movie. But I did.  Rating: _________________  It's very hard to get out of bed in the morning. But it's not very hard getting up in the evening. -Dalton Trumbo  I have no words for this movie, it was just awful. And it was written by Michael Heisler. The film starts with a shot of a woman. The camera pans down from the woman's face. She looks very upset and upset. I know this because she has a lot of makeup on her face. It's very clear that she is upset. There is a long, drawn out shot of the woman. And then a shot shows her with her mouth open. The mouth is open so that her teeth are sticking out of it. The lips are not moving, just the teeth. And we see her hand, it's just stuck in her mouth. This shot lasts for like 10 seconds. Then we see the woman back in the background. We can tell she is wearing makeup. We see the man who's playing the villain. He is a very ugly looking man. He has no hair on his head. His skin is covered in makeup. The villain starts to sing a song that I didn the movie sounds very like "Wake Up Little Susie." Then we hear a loud crash. The screen goes black. We are now back at the beginning of the movie with the woman with her makeup. And the woman is now screaming. The woman is crying. And a few minutes later we see a close up of the man in the same pose as in the beginning. And this shot lasts about a minute. And at the end of this close up we hear the woman scream again. .  the movie was called "Lion King" I was so
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! This movie is terrible. The acting is awful. The plot is terrible and very boring. The whole movie is boring. It has nothing to do with anything and does not make any sense at all. The characters are all the same. The only characters who have anything new to them are the villains. The villain in this movie is a horrible person. His name is Mr. R. and he is the worst. He was horrible in the first movie, and he was even worse in this one. He has horrible body odor. He is a coward and he steals stuff and he rapes people. He even goes to a sex store and is sooo gross. He rapes a little girl and she has to go to the hospital and is raped again by him. He also has a very ugly face and a very bad voice. The rest of the people in this film are really stupid. They do not do anything. They are just there to look like people. The one who is funny is a man who has a dog. He does not do much but he looks funny. The girl is the best actress in the film and she is very pretty. She does a lot of acting in this. The main actor in this is a very good actor but he is a poor actor. His character is terrible in this and is a terrible person. He uses bad words and he acts like a bad person. The worst part about this movie was the ending. The ending was horrible. There was a whole sequence of the ending and the end of the movie was horrible because they had to show how bad Mr. H. was and that he had to go out to meet the police because he was so bad. The movie was so boring. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: **********   There are a lot of good movies to be found on this site, and if you have the money, why not take a chance on one of the best?   But this movie is not good.  It's just so bad, it's unbelievable. The acting is terrible, the plot is nonsensical, the dialogue is cringe-worthy and so on and so forth. This movie makes you question your own intelligence. It's just that bad. I just wish that someone would release this film to the public in one form or another, or at least give it a good DVD release.   I really hope that somebody at Warner Bros. realizes that they made a big mistake making this film, and that they'll give it to a decent distributor. The only positive thing that I can say about this film is that the music was pretty good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ Have you ever noticed that when a movie makes a joke about being a man, the woman usually takes offense? That's why, in "Jumping Jack Flash," Jack Flash is always called "Jackie" or "Jack." Why was it such a huge deal that Jack Flash was a man? And, if Jack Flash wasn't a man why did he want to be a man in the first place? Because of the evil witch that is Betty Crocker? And why did she want to have a little witchy witch baby? Why was Betty Croker so obsessed with the little witch? Did Betty Crockers really have a witch baby and give her up for adoption? Was Betty Croke a witch? Was she the real reason why Jackie wanted to be Jack Flash? Was the witch, Betty Croaker, Jack Flash's real mother? Is Betty Crokey the real mother of the real Jack Flash or is the real Jackie the witch? And did the real, evil witch Betty Cropper give birth to Jack Flash to kill him and get revenge for being cast out of her house? I can't wait to see this movie again. It is a real treat to have the whole cast back together again. A great job with a very dark and funny movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********** ********** ******** ******** *** I found this movie to be the absolute worst of all time, from start to finish. The worst thing about this movie is that it has nothing to do with anything. It's a movie that was supposed to be about an alien who has been trapped on Earth for years, but has managed to find a new home with a little boy. When the alien sees the boy he thinks he has a crush on him, but the boy doesn't reciprocate. The alien, as he's called by the boy, has become obsessed with this little boy and is determined to make him his friend. However, the boy has other ideas. This movie is the story of a couple of little kids and an alien. If you don't like bad movies, you should avoid this movie. I really can't think of any redeeming quality for this movie, so if you can't stomach it, you might as well stay away.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I don't even know how to describe this movie. It's an action movie. They show a lot of gun fights and explosions and things like that. There's not much else to say about it. I didn't like it one bit. The only thing I would call good is the special effects. They use lots of explosions, fire, etc. They also have a special effects guy who is supposed to be the most badass in the world. He doesn't really do much in the movie. He's there for a couple of scenes. The whole time he's just standing around doing nothing. Then he suddenly does a bunch of stuff and is all over the place. I guess that's what you get when you hire an action star to be in a movie that's about a group of mercenaries.   I'll give this movie 4 stars because I liked it. It was entertaining. It had a good soundtrack. And the special effect stuff was really cool.   of the people that like: __________________________________________________ ______________________  Alfred Hitchcock is a master of suspense and tension.

(I would give this a 6.5 but the special-effects were a little weak)   A couple of notes: __________________  The action scenes are intense and very suspenseful. The special effects were great. I especially liked the way they used the light of a camera. The effects are good. But the acting is pretty good.  the special and special effects are pretty good, and it was a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********** ************* ********* I was totally expecting this movie to be great. I really did. I love the movies that have the star and the actress from the movies. They are the ones who are famous and the ones with the most fame. I was very excited to see them in a movie together. They have so much chemistry together and they are so different from each other. The movie was great. The plot was great and the actors were great. And they had great chemistry. And I loved the song they sung together. The songs are not great but the music they used was great, and the voice of all the characters was so much different from one another. I liked all of the characters and I loved that they were so different and unique. The actors were so good in the movie and they all got to do so much that I was impressed. I even thought that the movie was a bit too long. The only problem was that the actors didn't talk to each other a lot but I can understand that the reason was because they were not on the same screen as much. But I liked that they didn't have a lot of dialogue together, but they were still able to keep each other interested. I like the plot and I thought that they made it exciting and the music was great too. I loved it and I would recommend it to everyone.

He meets the boy at a train station and they go together to see his uncle who is looking for him. The uncle is a bit weird and his nephew seems very scared.   But they go on together. After a while they get lost and when they reach the house they find it empty. They go back to the train station to find out what happened.   a guy named John (Jasper P. Parker) is a kid who lived with his uncle. One day John gets lost and ends up in a town called "Tumbleweed". He meets a girl named Molly (Kieran Culkin) and she helps him get to Tumbleweed. They end up in Tumblewell where they run into the girl's brother (B.D. Wong). The brother is a big mean man who wants John dead. John and Molly are rescued by a group of kids and are taken to a big farm where John meets the kid who was with him. They start a friendship and John learns a lot about life and death. The movie has a nice dark tone that isn't too obvious.   to be honest the story was a bit too predictable. But I don't think it's a bad thing. It's a good movie for a dark mood and some good acting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ The most depressing film I have ever seen. It's a movie made by people who are not only unprofessional but are also not good at what they do.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ _______________ _________  So I was at a movie with a friend, and we both thought that this movie was terrible. The guy was supposed to be a bad guy and the girl was supposed be a good guy. I thought that the movie was just silly. I know that there was a lot of nudity in it and the guy was making fun of the guy in the car and the whole thing was ridiculous. And then it turns out that this guy and this girl have a very close friendship. The movie had some real good jokes in it. And it made me laugh out loud a lot. But it was just a bad time. I was also really bummed that the girl had to be naked all the time. It was pretty boring.  This is a film about two friends that are just so much in love with each other. And their relationship is tested by the fact that the two are just very different people. They go to a prom and there is this one boy that they both think is so cute. But the girl really wants this boy because she wants him to be her boyfriend. But they don't get along with each another and they start to break up. The story has a lot going for it. It has good comedy, it has a very cute boy, and the two friends are so close and it just makes you feel sorry for them. And there are a lot more funny scenes in the film. It is also about a very funny couple that breaks up. This is one of those films that is very funny. The plot is pretty good. It starts off with some pretty good humor. And the plot twists are really good. And as you go through the film, you really feel like the characters are growing and changing. There are a couple of really funny scenes that really stand out in this film. ,  1.8/5, with an average rating of 1.8 stars out of 5 based on 27 user ratings ( 27 user reviews)

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________________________  I loved this movie. I enjoyed it very much. It's a great action movie. The stunts are so well done. The action sequences are so exciting. There's an incredible villain in this movie, and you're always wondering what he's going to do next. The ending is good. I just wish it had been a little longer. There were a few plot holes in the film. The movie doesn't really make any sense. I was hoping for some explanation for why the guy was able to kill so many people with just a knife. I don't understand why he was able destroy the whole building. I really think there should have been a few more scenes after that where the story is really explained. Overall, this movie is a must watch. If you like action movies, then you should definitely check this out.

Bad." - Chris Rock, on the 2004 remake of the original film.  I'm not sure that this is the best movie of the trilogy, but I'm going to say it's one of the worst.  I have to give this movie a pass for the one thing I liked about it, the original movie, which was that it was fun, with a great cast, and a very cool action scene.  The only other thing that I really enjoyed was the way the character of Sam is handled, and the way he is treated as a real person and not just a one-dimensional villain.  I think this is an excellent addition to the franchise.

This is one of the best science fiction movies to come out of Hollywood in the last few years. The special effects are amazing and the story is quite interesting. It's a fun movie with a good amount of action. The only downside is that it takes quite a while for it to come to an end. Overall, it's an entertaining movie. I'd give it a 4/5 stars.

In fact, it was the first movie I ever watched that was truly worth the hype. I was watching the movie at my friend's house, and we had a little bit of fun with the stunts, and then we sat back and watched the movie. The movie did not disappoint, as it was well-executed and had a great action sequence. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ This movie is about a group of mercenaries in Vietnam. They are a little out of shape and are looking for a chance to get some quick cash. They do not have much luck in finding it, and they have to pay for their sins on a ship that is heading for the United States. ____________________ A good movie to watch in the late 60's and early 70's.

The plot was like nothing I have ever seen in a movie. The best part about this movie was the music. I mean, just look at the song they used to go on in the beginning. It is one of the worst songs ever made. There was nothing good about this film. I will not be going back to this movie. I recommend this to anyone who likes the movies but this time don't go to the theater.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. _________. ____.  5 out of 5 stars Cinéma vérité!  by James B. on 04/09/2015 byon 04/08/2015 I love CinÉma vu! It's one of my favorite films of all time. I would definitely recommend this film to everyone!  Great film!  is  This film has so much heart and character. If you're a fan of films like Cinérma Vérités or Cinétastes it's worth a watch.   The performances are good as well. It's not your usual Hollywood star studded films. The main character in this film is played by an excellent Daniel Day-Lewis. His character is not a typical hero. He doesn't have any superpowers and he doesn't get any hero-bangs. He is a person with problems.   the music is great as well, it's a great movie to listen to in the car on a long road trip.  the ending is pretty epic too.  (not a spoiler)
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  I've been to a couple of conventions recently and the first time I went was for a convention about a month ago. The first day I went, I went to a small room where the attendees are seated and then they take a walk around the convention. They stop and chat for a while and then go back to their tables. It was a lot of fun and everyone was nice to me. However, the second day was the big one and it was the "festival" of the year. It had a lot more attendees than the first day and it looked like it was full of a lot. There were people of all ages, but the biggest groups were the kids who were playing video games. There was a stage with all the actors from the movie, but I don't remember any of the lines. I know there were a lot in the room and a lot for me to remember, so I hope it's okay that I don,t remember most of them. The movie was a long time ago, but still a lot about the events that took place that day. I saw a couple people dressed as the guys from the film and there were people who dressed as zombies. I didn't see any scenes of the movie though. I just remember that the whole day was a bit crazy.  No Was this review helpful to you? Yes  Posted By:
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ (about a good movie) The bad guy doesn't look like the guy who plays him. He has a different haircut, but it is a different color. He also looks to be in his early 20s, maybe in his 30s. The movie was a very fun movie and the actors did a great job. I just wish the movie was not so long. I know I should have just stayed in my seat and not watched it. I was in tears after watching this movie. I didn't get it.

This is just one of those movies that makes you laugh for about 5 minutes and then you realize that what you just watched was stupid. It's like someone took a picture of a girl getting hit in the head with a baseball bat and then they edited it so that she looks like she's having a seizure and it makes you think that the girl is having a bad day. I have never seen a movie like this in my life. This will be the last time I ever watch a stupid movie. I want to watch the movie over and over again. It was just so stupid! This movie would have been better if they made it like a western but with a female lead and a guy who has a gun and fights and then gets killed in the end. This would have made it a better movie.

I was disappointed at first and felt like the movie was so bad that I could not get into it. But I have to say that I loved this movie. I have heard so many horror movies that were bad and I never liked them, but this movie had some great scenes and a great story line. The only thing I didn`t like was the way the ending was handled, I liked how it ended and how it was shown in the movie. Overall I loved it and will be watching it again!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What a joke. What a waste of time. I expected something to come from this movie. It was a waste. I don't think I've ever seen a movie this stupid. It's a complete failure. I'd say I'm not that upset about it because I was able to enjoy it, but that's not the point. It should have never been made. If they can make a movie with a woman in a fishnet bikini doing a strip tease, I'm sure they can find something better to do. - June 5, 2009Funny but not worth a watch

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ಡರೃ  A bad movie is one that doesn't make sense and is so poorly made, it has little to do with the story and is just there to fill the time.   This movie is so bad that even when it's not a bad film it's a bad watch.   the whole movie is about a young boy that goes into the forest with a pack of wolves to find the girl he loves, he runs into some bad guys and the film ends on a cliffhanger.  I guess they were going to use the same premise of the first movie but they couldn't come up with anything better.   a movie is not good if it's made with the best intentions in mind and it is so obvious that this movie is just not made with any of that.  , and the best part of the movie is that the bad guys that he's fighting are just cardboard cut outs that have no personality.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ It was a very bad movie. There are a lot of things wrong with this movie, not the least of which are the characters. I am a very easy going person, I like to laugh and have a good time. I thought this movie would be a lot funnier. The cast was terrible. I will never laugh at a movie again. I don't know why they didn't cast a better actor for the role of the clown. The film was over-rated. There was nothing funny about this movie. I think this movie should be called "It Was All Just a Dream" I don´t know why people like this movie so much. The story was good, but it was poorly told. I was very sad that the movie was so terrible. It was just a dream. It should have been called "He Was All A Dream" It was all just a story. I had to see this movie again in a theater just to make sure I was dreaming.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ The only thing I can say about this movie is it's really bad and a very poor acting movie that was made for the money. The movie was made to be a western and it wasn't. I would have preferred if it was a western with a female lead instead of the only male lead who was a good looking guy but a boring and dumb character. He was a total wimp. This movie was so bad and was such a waste of time and money that I almost lost it. The bad acting and bad plot and the actors in this movie just made it even worse. I had to watch this movie over and over again just to remember what happened in it. It was a waste.  Helpful for the story that the movie was trying to tell. The acting was so horrible in this film that it was hard to believe the movie would have worked at all. I'm not going to say that the actors weren't good but it's hard to understand what they were trying to do. I also don't think it was good to cast a female as the lead. It wasn't a western so the characters would have been the same regardless of who played the part. I thought the actress for this role was horrible. She didn't have a lot of talent but she was the lead and if that's what you are going for you shouldn't have wasted the actors' time with this poor performance. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Jul 19, 2017 11:21 AM by Chris A. on  "Horse Thief" is a documentary about a group of people who stole horses from the U.S. and the Japanese. It was produced by Peter Bogdanovich and released in 1983. In this documentary, we see that these people are mostly young people from the Midwest who are traveling the country and stealing horses from people who don't know the difference between a real horse and a toy. The horse thieves take the horses to a horse show where the thieves sell them to wealthy people who have a lot of money and want to display the animals for their collection. The film is very well made and the crew of the film was a very talented group of individuals.   The film begins with a man who had a horse stolen from him who is shown in the film trying to find it. After some searching, the man finally finds the horse but when he gets home, he finds out that his wife has been cheating on him and she left him the horse that he had been looking for. The man is shown trying to reconcile with his wife but to no avail. He is then shown taking the horse to the U of I to sell it but before he can do so, he is robbed by the horse thieves. The thieves steal his horse and he is forced to buy another horse. He goes back to the thieves and they tell him that he can take it back and take the money back. However, they will be back and steal it from him again if he doesn't give them the horse.  .   the movie does a great job showing the different characters in the movie and what drives them to do what they do. It also shows the problems that people have with people who steal horses. One of the main characters is a guy named Gary who is a horse thief. Gary is shown to be very honest with his fellow horse thieves, which is shown when he tells the thieves that he is going to the police and that they need to get their heads out of their asses and pay him for his stolen horse. Another guy named Jim is another character in the documentary who was a horse stealer who got caught after he took the horse from the owner of a farm who was trying to make a little money. Jim is shown as a very hard worker who doesn't want to be arrested for his crime. He even offers to pay the horse thief for the horse if he is released from jail
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________   There is one part in the movie where the main character, played by Steve Buscemi, tries to run away from his captors. He starts crying, saying, "I am so sorry, I didn't mean to do that." And then he runs out of the room. It was one of those moments in which I thought, "Wow, this guy is a very brave man." Then it's back to being a villain. I've never seen a movie that made me so angry that I wanted to hurt people. In one scene, the protagonist gets chased through the streets and ends up in the subway car. He's in the middle of the car, screaming at people to get off the train, and then suddenly it turns out he is a prisoner of the mob. A mob of men are holding him down and cutting his hair, and they are telling him that they are going to kill him and his wife, and that the cops are going in to get them. Then they take a knife from one of the men and try to cut the man's throat, but the guy is strong and doesn't let them do it. Then a woman tells the man, "Please don't give up your husband." The man tells the woman to get on the train. She gets on and the mob follows. The mob is getting closer to the car and they want to cut her throat. Then another man comes up, grabs the man who is trying to cut his throat, and cuts his throat. A little later, a cop comes up and asks him what he is doing. The man says, "We are just trying to protect you, sir." The cop says, OK, let's see what happens. So the guy who is holding the guy down, takes a knife and cuts the cop's throat. Now the cop is bleeding and dying and the other man tries to pull the guy off. The cop just keeps going and keeps screaming, "You are going out of here, you are going!" The cop gets ahold of the guy and starts beating him with his baton, and at one point, a bunch of cops show up and one of them pulls the guy's shirt over his head and then starts beating the guy with a club. When it's over, the guy screams at the cops to leave him alone and says, you guys, I am a cop. The guy gets up and says he's a cop, too. He just wants to

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I didn't like the movie. It was boring, uneventful, and overacted. I couldn't understand what the movie was trying to say."  Well, there you go.  This was a movie that could have been so much more.    It's not a great movie, but it has it's charm.  But I think it's a little hard to take a film that's so boring and predictable and still find it interesting.  I would say it was pretty good.  It was very well acted and well paced.  For a bad flick, it was very funny.  One of my favorite movies of all time.  A great movie that never gets any credit.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  I love this movie, it's a good movie, but not the best movie of the year.  First of all, I love that it's an American remake of a good British movie, and that it is one of the best films of the season, but that's not enough for me to give it the 4 stars I give it. I love the movie because it's based on a true story and it's the best remake of the film that I've seen. I'm a huge fan of the movie, because I've always been a big fan of movies based on true stories, but I also love movies that have more than just a story. I don't want a movie to just be a story about a good guy and a bad guy, or even a story that just focuses on the two of them, I want a story where there are so many different things going on, it makes it interesting to watch. I also loved the fact that this movie doesn't try to be a romantic movie, instead it gives a good balance of the story and the love story. The story is about a British family, and their daughter and how they deal with their daughter's life growing up. There are a lot of emotions in the movie that I haven't seen in a movie, the best example of this would be the ending of the last scene, it was so unexpected, it took me by surprise, and I think it shows the emotions in this movie. I think that this is why the movie works, because it doesn't focus on one specific emotion or emotion that it tries to make you feel, it focuses on so many emotions and it shows them all so well. The movie also has so many great actors in it, it shows how different the world is from the one that we know. I really loved the way that the movie was shot, it looks beautiful and I love it because I think the movie has the best art direction of the movies of the summer. I also loved how the movie made me feel, because the movie is so emotional that you feel the emotions and the emotions are what makes this movie so good. This movie is definitely not a perfect movie, I think I'm just going to give the movie 4 stars, because of the great acting, the story, and the art direction. *If you don't like movies that are based on stories, or are a fan of British movies, then I would not recommend this movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  "Dunkirk" is the story of how the French Resistance fighters in Dunkirk were forced to flee by the German invaders. It is based on a true story. In June of 1940, as the Nazis were making a huge push into the Atlantic, a small band of Allied soldiers was sent to Dunkirk to help with the evacuation of some 800,000 people. This film was released by the British government to make up for their lack of interest in the war, and they succeeded to some extent. There are plenty of famous and interesting scenes from this movie. One of my favorites is when a British soldier is shot, and it looks so real that you just know that it is the British soldiers who were shooting. The actors and crew all did a great job with the scenes and I would definitely recommend this movie to any movie fan.  …

I really enjoyed the film, it was just a little predictable. The only problem was that the actor playing Will Smith didn't seem to know how to act, so he didn't really look like himself.  In the movie, Smith plays a retired boy scout named Will Smith. His best friend was killed in the Vietnam war and he decided to become a man and become a scoutmaster. He is also the first openly gay scoutmaster in the world.  (He's the first one who ever said "I'm gay".)  Smith, who was a big star in the 70's, went on to become the best selling movie actor of all time. He went on and become the youngest president of the United States and a father. He was a huge success and still is. The movie also features Kevin Costner and Denzel Washington.  of all the gay scouts that I've ever seen, this one seems to be the only one that had a bad performance by the lead. But it's not really his fault. He didn't know how or where to act. .
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  It doesn't take a genius to figure out why the movie is so bad. A very well known Hollywood actress, with a great body, is kidnapped and forced into prostitution. And then, we see the "bad guys". A bunch of criminals, who kidnap a rich guy and force him into prostitution as well. This is just one of the many, many films that I have seen, in which the "hero" and "bad guy" are exactly the same. But then, the bad guy in the movies are just so evil, that the "good guy" gets killed. In this case, it's a woman, who is kidnapped, and forced to get into prostitution by a group of criminals. She is kidnapped by a man, who, for some unknown reason, loves her, and has to keep her in prostitution. But the woman is raped and tortured, and, in the end, is murdered. There is not a single redeeming feature in this film. It is a very cheap exploitation film, and the only thing that saves it from being a total piece of crap is the fact that I know who this actress is, and she is an actress that I like. But, you have to admit, that her body is a lot better than this guy's.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It's a big box office bomb. The story is the same as in the other versions, but I've never seen any version of this movie before."  It's also an interesting question as to why they decided to do a different ending. The film ends with a twist where the bad guy is shown to be the good guy.  If you take away the "it's a good guy after all" twist you'd have the same story.        The movie also has a different score.     The original score was "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" which was performed by a symphony orchestra.    The music from this version was performed on guitar and piano.  It's the same movie, but you get a different soundtrack: The movie opens with a long shot of a bridge in the middle of a river.    A group of people are playing cards in the background.  The bridge is in the foreground with a sailboat in the distance.  At this point, the main character, a man, is walking across the bridge.  He's not the one playing cards, but is instead in love with the woman in the boat.  This scene is interrupted by a ship passing overhead.    The ship appears to be an old ship that's been converted into a floating hotel.  In the distance, a ship with a few people on it passes by.  "It was a pleasure seeing you, Mr. Pritchard."   The man, a woman, and a child are shown sitting in a room at the hotel. The man has a black and white picture of himself on the wall.  While there is no sound, the man tells his companion that he's "the kind of guy who's always looking for the good in people."  The woman is sitting in the corner of the room.  She has a handkerchief over her mouth.  Her head is tilted.  It's hard to make out anything from the scene.  However, in the next scene we can see the man holding a newspaper.  (The man is a detective, but there is a "D" after his name on the newspaper.) The newspaper has the headline "Burglary and Murder" and the date is "November 5th."  This was the first movie that the character of "Pritchard" played in.  Then, the film shows a newsreel of a man

Not Helpful not Helpful not helpful not helpful Not Helpful Not Helpful  Not Helpful (1)  1 of 1 people found the following review helpful:  No, this movie is terrible. The movie has a lot of problems, but they don't detract from the movie itself. The story is poorly written and there is absolutely nothing to the acting. The main problem is that the main character is a complete jerk. He tries to be a friend to a girl, and he really shows his true colors. I'm not even joking. The only time he is a good friend is when he is with the main heroine. His relationship with her is a little better than the girl he wants to get with. The guy has no self esteem, no feelings, no compassion, no love, no loyalty. He is a spoiled little brat. If I were to say that the movie is good, I'd have to say it is good for what it is. I didn't find any other bad things. I did find some things I didn 't like. I don't think I could watch this movie again. I would never want to. I just felt it was a waste of time. I'll give this movie one star, but only because I don' t have anything good to say about it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this movie has the worst plot I've seen in a long time.  I know it was an animated movie, but the characters are so fucking stupid.   There are so many scenes where one of the characters is making a dumb face or mumbling something.

The best part of the movie is the song, "Let it Go"  It will be played in the movie forever.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   The most annoying thing about the film is that it was made by a bunch of morons who were clearly bored and bored well before they started filming. This is not to say the film isn't funny, but that's not what makes this film a disappointment. It's a film made by morons, for morons. The characters are terrible, the dialogue is terrible, and the humor is terrible. The film was supposed to be a parody of the action movie genre. That it wasn't funny doesn't mean it's not good, but it is really hard to enjoy a film like this.   A sequel is rumored to be in the works, and maybe it will be a good one, but this was a waste of a good idea.

(Photo: Marvel/Disney)  On Monday, Disney and Marvel released the full trailer for Avengers: Age of Ultron, the sequel to 2012's Avengers. But even in this trailer, you could tell it's a different movie than the one in theaters next week.  There's a new tone, and the villain, Ultron, is an amalgam of both Captain America and Iron Man, with a few touches from the X-Men characters.  and their friends. , and their friend. And the villain is a more serious version of the Mandarin. -  It's not a bad idea, but the film's execution is a mess. . Ultron's transformation into a robot in this scene is a bit weird. His face is very cartoony, and his hands are completely covered in wires. He's clearly a machine, but he doesn't look human, and he has no emotions. "The Avengers" opens May 1, 2014.  of Avengers: A.I. has been a disappointment. A lot of the movie's charm comes from its cast, who are excellent. The supporting cast has also been good, and some of the action sequences are quite great. But it's the villains, who have been a mixed bag, that make the movie a dud.  "The Marvel Cinematic Universe" is about to get a huge reboot. "Ant-Man" will feature the new Marvel characters, and "Guardians of the Galaxy" will be a Marvel film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________  "He was a very good actor" - Peter O'Toole  The movie: "A Christmas Story" is a movie about a very sweet, loving family and their love for each other. It is based on a true story and is told from the point of view of a child (Timothy Carey). The movie has been a popular holiday movie for many years and was even nominated for five Academy Awards. The story follows the Christmas Story family as they try to make their holiday season a happy one. Tim Carey plays the role of the father of the kids. It also stars Peter O'.Toole, Donald O'Connor and Nancy Walker. It was a great Christmas movie and I think a movie everyone should see at least once in their lives. It has been listed in The 100 best Christmas movies of all time. It really is a Christmas movie you should watch.  Tim Carey is a great actor. He did a wonderful job. Tim and his family really are very sweet. There is so much sadness in this movie and it is heartbreaking. There are no big emotions in this Christmas movie, but it is very sweet and wonderful. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. I have seen it in the theatre and it was so cute.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this movie is awful.  I'm not sure why I ever bothered with this movie.   It was a total bore.  The acting is bad, the cinematography is bad and the story is a complete waste of time.  There are so many bad things about this movie that I could go on and on but I won't because this movie is not even worth my time. A couple years back I saw this movie and I was in awe.  I loved the movie and this movie was great.  This movie was a must see.  So I saw it a couple of times and I always felt it was a waste of my time because the acting was bad and everything was cheesy.  But this movie had a great story line and the acting in this movie were all great. This movie also had a few great scenes and was a great movie to watch.  I don't know if it was because I was watching the movie a lot or what but I got bored after the first few minutes.  Maybe I just didn't have any real emotional connection to the characters or whatever but I just felt like the story line was boring.  Now I was about to start watching the next movie which was the remake of this movie but I had this feeling that this movie just wasn't worth watching.  It didn't really have any interesting characters, the acting wasn't great and the plot line was just so dull.  A movie this bad should never be released because it is such a waste.  If you have watched this movie at least once then you know what I mean. Don't waste your time on this movie because it isn't even worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a story of a family with a sick mother and father. The father suffers from a brain tumor, and the mother has a serious heart problem. It's a sad story. I would have liked to see a mother and a father who cared for each other, but I guess they had to be separated for the story to go on. It would have been better if they would have had a daughter. It was very sad. The movie has a lot of gore, but it was very poorly done. It looked like the director just threw in a bunch of gore without thinking about what the story was about. The gore was in a very limited area and it made the movie seem like a cheap horror movie. If you can't watch gore for no reason, then this movie is not for you. 6.5/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _________ _____________ ___________  This is a great movie. The movie does have a lot of flaws but at the same time, it is a very good movie. For the most part, this movie does follow the book. The acting is great. It is very good acting, the actors did a great job at portraying their characters. It's just that, this is not a very believable story. The plot of the book was a very complicated story that I found to be very hard to follow. I did find that a lot, the movie tried to tell a much simpler story. This is why I give this movie 4 out of 5. It really didn't feel like a book. It was more like a movie that was told in a book format. It does get a 5 from me because it is very entertaining. It just feels very out there, it's not something you would expect to see. It gets a 4 because it was very hard for me to follow the story. I just couldn't do it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________  The Last Days of Disco (1978) - It's hard to believe that in 1978 a movie about a disco dance club and a group of kids who are trapped inside it was considered a classic. It's a classic in the sense that it has a very high level of production value and it's very entertaining. The movie does a fantastic job of capturing the essence of the 1980's and it is one of the few movies in the 80's that I actually like. However, it's a very low budget production and it takes place in a very small place (about a 1/2 mile from where I live). It is a very silly movie, it really goes on a bit too long at times, and it doesn't have a real emotional core to it. It has great set design and great costumes but the special effects are lacking in the worst way. It is not a very funny movie at all and it feels very cheap. The ending was actually very disappointing and I was disappointed that it didn't end on a happier note. I'm still glad I saw it and it remains one of my favorites.

This is a movie that is so boring that I'm angry for the characters. I don't know why they even bothered to make this movie. They should have just made a remake of the first film. I really don't understand why they're so determined to keep it around. And even though I do like this film, it was not worth the $9.99 I paid for it.  3 out of 5 stars  This movie is a little bit slow. I mean, it's about a woman named Cindy who is a lawyer, and it's all about her being a lawyer and her work and the way she deals with her clients and everything. I have a feeling that they had a good idea in the beginning. But then, after a few movies, they decided to slow it down. And after about 30 minutes, the movie becomes a bit slow as well. It was a little frustrating. But the ending was so well written that I really enjoyed it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved this movie. I am an adult film fan and have seen plenty of good ones. This movie was good. However, there were too many scenes of nudity that made it hard to watch and even harder to stomach. Also, there was a scene with a female naked body, but it didn't bother me as much as some other scenes. I thought the sex was hot. The cast was good and the script was very good. The main character was interesting and I thought she was a good role model for girls. Overall, this movie was great!  Would I recommend it? No. I would not recommend it to anyone. It is an adult movie so I guess it has its place.  You may like it, but there are better movies out there.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Loading... By: Chris O'Connor | June 10, 2017 5:16 PM  As much as I'd love to say that "The Last Jedi" is the best Star Wars movie since "The Empire Strikes Back," that's not the case. The film is a fine, but not great, entry in the saga, with the main flaw being the pacing.  If you've seen the original "Star Wars" trilogy, you know that the plot is pretty much always a big question mark. With the exception of the prequels, most of the stories of the saga take place in an alternate universe, where a new evil force called the First Order has come to power.  to fight the First, the rebels must assemble a massive fleet and prepare for a final battle with the First. The rebels send Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), the latter of whom was an ace pilot in the Resistance, to help Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) build the Millennium Falcon. Meanwhile, C-3PO (Alan Tudyk) is still working with Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) to help them build the Death Star. But they're all at odds because the First has the Death Stars, which can destroy entire planets.  a couple of times during the film, the plot feels a little rushed, but the action is still fun. There are a few scenes where we get to see more of the First's side of things, but they are pretty much a one-off. "The Last Republic" has some great action scenes, particularly when Rey and Finn face off against First Order Stormtroopers. But the biggest problems with the film are the lack of stakes, the underdeveloped characters, and the underused supporting characters.  I could not find much to complain about in the film. There's a lot of character development for all of the main characters, but most of that happens in the background, where we're not really paying attention. In fact, the only real character we're interested in is Leia, who is a bit of a loose cannon.  of the best parts of the film is when we see Rey and Luke's relationship develop. Finn is trying to find his place in the galaxy, and he is growing up, becoming a more mature character. We see how the Rebellion has grown since Leia

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* This movie is really bad, the acting is so bad, it really doesn't have anything to do with the story, it was all the acting, the people in the movie, and the bad acting.

I don't care if the actor is in a coma, the person should be in a cast. The movie is bad, but the acting really makes it bad. The guy who plays the cop is a little girl, the guy who is in the police station is a guy, and when the guy in the cop's car talks about going to a store for food, the movie is supposed to be a comedy, but there is no comedy in this movie, no one laughs, everyone is crying and thinking "why am I doing this". The movie has some good jokes, but all the jokes are about bad things. The story, although it is really not bad, is really stupid and the acting makes it worse. Don't watch this movie if you want a funny movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. _________. __________________________________________."   "This movie is a total disaster and I didn't even like it at first. When I first saw this movie I thought it was one of those old "horror" films from the 70's. It wasn't scary at all. The characters were all pretty much the same. I was really confused because the first movie had a killer clown. And then the killer clown came back. Then he killed a little girl. And so on and so forth. It got old. This movie was just boring. I think it was supposed to be a horror movie. But when I first looked at the trailer for this movie, I saw a girl with a clown face. And I thought, "What? What is this movie? It's supposed to have a killer killer clown." So, when I saw the movie, it was kind of disappointing. It was just very, very slow and boring. The only reason I didn''t give it a zero is because I didn"t really like it, and I was afraid to see if it got better. It didn"€™t. I thought the ending was pretty lame. It just showed the clown and the girl crying. They were crying because they were afraid. The movie was so slow and kind of boring. You could see that the director wasn"€˜t trying to make a good movie. I hope he doesn"€®t make another one of these."  , and, I liked, but I'm sorry I didn""t give a zero because I liked it."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen a few movies over the years and never seen one quite like this one. The plot of the movie was amazing, the acting was excellent, and the story was interesting and engaging. I don't know what made it so amazing, maybe it was the amazing production value or the fact that I was watching a movie from the 1960's and 1970's. Either way, this was one of my favorite movies of all time.  The plot is based on the story of the story, and as such it's a bit cliche, but it works. The story centers on a young woman named Carol who is the daughter of a wealthy, wealthy man who has a long history with his ex-wife. He always seemed to have a love/hate relationship with his daughter, so when he finally dies and she takes over the family business, Carol has to step in and do the right thing. In the movie, she does so perfectly and it was an emotional and enjoyable movie to watch. She's a strong, strong woman, but she's also a little bit naive, so she has a bit of a hard time, but ultimately she does the right things for her family. She always does what's best for the company and what's right, and she's always there for her daughter and her son. It's a very strong, powerful and emotionally charged movie.  the acting: ive never seen a movie that was so amazing at portraying an older woman with a strong character. i loved the movie because of all the different ways they portrayed her emotions, she never once seemed to be too over the top, and i think that the acting is something that many people can relate to. the acting in this movie is incredible.  "I was just so taken with her performance, that the story just came naturally to me."  the writing:  The writing in this is great, it's very powerful and a lot of people will relate to it. I think this movie was so important to its time, and it really has a lot to say about the 1960s, it really is a very powerful movie. ive watched other movies with great writing in the past, but i never felt that this movie had such a powerful message. the message is very clear and it's easy to see it. the movie is based off of a true story, but this is still a movie you should watch with an open mind and an open heart. the story
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  I was very excited to see the film 'The Avengers'. I have read all the reviews and the one in this site was the one I was most excited about. I thought I'd go with a negative one instead. The story was very poorly written, it was not a good movie at all. The character of Black Widow was an annoying, shallow character. The Avengers was just a poorly directed and poorly written movie. The villains were all the same. They were the same people in different costumes. The bad guys in the Avengers were just the same as in the first film, the big bad guy in the second was just the big villain in the third, and the third bad guy was just an old man in a big costume. The only characters who are different are the characters in the fourth film. I just couldn't get invested in any of the characters. The special effects were awful. The Hulk was just stupid. The effects were bad and looked fake. They couldn't even make a Hulk with the same powers as in 'The Incredible Hulk'. The costumes were really stupid. They looked like a bunch of clowns in a Halloween costume. I didn't care about any of these characters at all and I'm glad I didn' t. I hate this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ This is a great movie but there are some glaring plot holes. I think the reason why it is not as good as it was originally is because the director was fired for his failure to get the right story. He made a movie where a group of people were trying to find a missing person and they are all lost. There was a girl that they were looking for but it was never brought up and they did not learn that she had been kidnapped. There is also a guy named Nick that has the same name as the girl they were searching for. His name is a common name. This guy and his group are searching for the missing girl. There were some interesting parts to the story like when they found the girl's body that was covered in a sheet and they found her car and found out that her car had been reported stolen. It was also really interesting that she took her keys with her. She took her shoes too. It is all very interesting to watch. However, the rest of the movie is just a lot of boring characters and no real plot. The only reason that it is worth watching is because of the characters. They were all very well done. They all have their own personalities and it was very interesting. However you cannot trust any of the people that they find. This is the only reason why this movie is not really that great.

The soundtrack was so loud it almost hurt my ears. This movie was so bad that I almost forgot about the plot. There is no way this movie will ever get a theatrical release."
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  The good: -The music. It's not great, but the music does help set the mood and the film does an excellent job of that. -The special effects were done well and make this film worth watching. -Ralph Macchio was awesome. -Kramer. The first time I saw him, I was absolutely hooked. The second time I watched him, it was because I thought the actor was better than the character. The third time I have seen him, and I can honestly say he's the most charismatic character in the film. He was fun and quirky, and he never felt forced into a situation he wasn't comfortable in. The fourth time, he was in the same place and had the same situation as the first time. -Jerry. I've heard a lot of good things about Jerry. I didn't have a good feeling about him until I watched the movie. He's funny and his dialogue is great. He also seems like he was born to be a movie star. -Maggie. She's an amazing actress. She made this character believable. She was very funny, but she also had the potential to be incredibly dramatic. She did a great job of making the character interesting, even if it was sometimes a little too intense. -Cheryl Strayed. She has a way of making a scene hilarious without ever seeming too dramatic. The scene where she talks to Jerry about the car and how she is trying to keep it is one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen. -All of the main characters are believable. The movie was a little slow in some places, but overall, it had a lot more action than most films of this type. -I really liked the ending. The last scene with Jerry was really well done. The ending is just perfect and is a very happy ending. -Don't skip the ending credits. They are just that good. -A lot of people say this movie is about a young man's sexual awakening. This isn't true. The story is more of a coming of age story. The main character was really the only character I actually liked. -If you like this movie, you'll probably like the next one a little bit more. -This movie really didn't need to be in 3D. It works just fine without it.

" I'm not sure why this movie exists. This movie is basically a remake of the 1982 movie, and it does a good job in copying the look of the original movie. I guess the problem is that the script is totally original. It has a lot of problems. The characters are not interesting. The plot is totally incomprehensible. The actors are not funny. The special effects are just terrible. The only thing good about this movie is that it has a good sound track. However, the movie is just too bad. I think this movie should be in a museum. If you like sci-fi movies and you like watching people get killed, this movie will not disappoint you. This is the most boring movie I've seen in a long time. You don't need to watch this movie.

It feels more like the end of a movie."I'm sorry but the movie was so terrible that it made me want to laugh hysterically when the guys were fighting with each other. The movie is so bad that I was surprised that the movie makers didn't try to make the movie more interesting. When they were fighting each other, I couldn't even make out the words the guy was saying. I was just trying to make out what he was saying but it didn't even matter. Then the movie ended and I was shocked that the guys still weren't dead. What the hell is going on?The movie has so many bad things about it that I had to leave it at "A bad movie". I would recommend this movie to people that like violent movies that are made by a bunch of people with no talent.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________ _________ ____________ The Worst Movie Ever. I'm so pissed off and I can't even believe it. It was an okay movie that was so stupid that I had to leave in the first 30 minutes. I mean the director was just an idiot and they did everything wrong. It had an awesome story but the story doesn't make it good. The movie was so slow and boring. There was nothing going on. And it was so bad that they made a sequel but that doesn't fix it. I've seen this movie so many times and I've never gotten a good laugh. It's just a boring movie that should have never been made. I can just see this movie now and I don't like it. What a waste of time and money. I had high hopes for this but it was a waste. I hope they never make a movie like this again. It made me hate horror movies and it was just so stupid. If I see this again I'm gonna throw it out the window. I really wish they never made this movie.  Rated 5 out of 5 by kyley from Great movie I thought the first one was terrible. I bought this one just to see the sequel. It is actually a better movie. The story is good. There is a great character and they bring back the original movie stars. I liked the characters in this one a lot better. They are a lot smarter and funnier. The acting is good too. The only thing I don the movie wrong was the movie had a lot of scenes where nothing happened. It wasn't like in the movies. They just showed what happened and nothing happened afterwards. I don'st like that in movies. I wish the movie would have made more of it. Overall this was a good movie. I recommend it.  and I really don't recommend this movie at all. I have been waiting for this movie to come out for so long and it just ruined it. The reason I gave this a 4 is because of the movie. It just was not funny at all and I was really looking forward to this movie and it ruined it for me. I would only recommend this to people who are very serious about horror and want to see some great movies that aren't in the horror genre.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  In a movie of this kind, the hero has to find a way to defeat an enemy. If the hero does not know the enemy, how can he fight it? And how can we, who know the foe, help the hero to defeat it?   In the film "The Black Stallion", the hero must help his wife who is in a serious accident. In the movie "War Games", the man has to help a man, a man who is not his friend. In both the movies, the man and the woman fall in love with each other and are willing to sacrifice themselves for each other. And then the hero is forced to make a choice: to let the man die or to kill the man, to save the woman or to live the life of the woman.  - Michael Connelly, New York Times   My opinion:   I am in favor of films about women who are in a relationship with a man. I have no problem with men who are willing and ready to commit to a relationship, and I do not have a problem with a woman who loves a man and who wants to be in a healthy relationship. I feel the romance between the hero and his wife is what drives the movie and what makes it special.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      There's a lot to be said for a movie like this. There's the story. The story is so simple and straight forward. The main character, Jamey Sheridan (played by the talented, well known, and very nice Mark Rylance) has just gotten out of jail for a crime he didn't commit. He has a wife and a little girl who loves him very much. They have a lot of trouble getting along but there's a bright spot in the situation. The movie begins with a brief flashback to the man's childhood. It seems that his father was a very abusive man and the movie is dedicated to showing the consequences of that kind of upbringing. The woman, his wife, is a woman who has had a very difficult life. She's had to struggle with her own problems. She has two kids and a great husband and family. The man is a man with a lot going for him. He is a very capable man. His life is great and he has his dreams and goals. There are other men around him who don't have as much luck as he does. There is also a lot in the story that seems to be going on in the background. This movie is very much about family. It's not really about one man and his wife. The father is just one man who is struggling to be a good father and husband. It was very important to the story to show the father struggling to help his wife and the wife struggling to stay happy and healthy. The wife also has a lot on her mind. She is not content with her life and she is looking for a change. Jame can't handle the idea of moving and has to think of a way to help this woman out. He also has to help himself. He's been trying for so long to get out of prison and it's about to be too late. This is the story of the man and a very good woman who are trying to find their way out of a tough situation. I give this a 9/10. It wasn't a masterpiece. It had its problems but it was a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie was awful! I went in with high hopes but was so disappointed that this was so bad. I have to admit that the movie did make me laugh. However, the story is so stupid and is just too bad to watch. I hope that the producer of this film gets a job. The ending was so lame that I wanted to quit watching it. I was just laughing when they were at the hotel. The only good thing that I can say about this movie is that it was in black and white. I guess it's okay to have a bad idea and just go with it. The music is not very good. I can't believe that they used a musical number as the last scene. I would have liked to see more of the movie. I thought that I was watching something good and then the producers ruined it by not thinking of a good ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  A review of this film should not be taken as an assessment of the quality of the film itself, rather it should be seen as a comment on the film industry's attitude towards women. I don't know whether this film was intended as a satire or not, but it is nonetheless a very offensive film. It has everything: violence, rape, murder, torture and a very bad ending. There is also a scene where a woman is raped by a dog. The dog is a pet of the husband of one of the main characters. The wife then attempts to kill the dog, which then kills the husband. The movie then cuts to a scene in a church where a nun is performing mass. At this point in the movie, the nun is being raped by the dog. As a woman, you are forced to watch this movie with a sickening sick feeling. It's as if the makers of this movie don't even know how disgusting and wrong their actions are. There are other scenes that are equally as disgusting. One scene shows a woman with her arm chopped off. Another scene shows two people getting tortured. In the end, it turns out that the dog has killed the husband, so the wife decides to kill her dog. This leads to a horrific and sickening conclusion. One can only imagine the reaction that this movie would receive if it were made by a male director. I've heard that the man who wrote the screenplay is the son of a famous director who was the victim of an abusive wife. I guess it's safe to say that the only thing this film has in common with the real life incidents is that both films involve a man who has abused his wife. The only way that this film is "sarcastic" is in the way the filmmakers use the female characters. They are either completely passive, or they are passive victims. The film is a real horror, because it has all the elements that you would expect in a horror film. You can see the horror in the dog and the murder of the wife. You get the terror in the torture and the rape. You feel the disgust of the scene of the nun. And then, at the end of the movie you see the same ending as a real one, which was used in the film The Silence of the Lambs. I do not believe that the film's director was intending for this film to be a parody. I think he was trying to make a comment, but the comment

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ Have you ever heard of the old saying, "The best thing that ever happened to me was being shot at by a rifle"? I have heard it from people all my life, but I have never had the opportunity to experience it for myself. It happened to my friend and I in a movie theater in Washington, D.C. In fact, it happened to us twice in one movie. The first time it happened was when we were about fifteen. My friend and myself were watching "The Wizard of Oz" in the dark. When the movie began to play we looked over and saw a man sitting right in front of us, shooting at a rifle in the theater. We stood there in total disbelief. We didn't know what to do. We could only watch as the man aimed the gun at the screen, and pulled the trigger. We sat there in absolute awe, stunned by what we had just witnessed. The second time it took place was in a different movie theater at a different time. This time my friend, myself, and another guy were sitting in the same row as the guy shooting the rifle. This guy was standing at a side table in the movie theater and just stared at the film. We watched the movie and the movie kept playing for about three minutes before the man pulled the triggers on both rifles. The two rounds that hit him just barely missed his head and he didn't even flinch. I've never seen a man react so much in one second as this guy did. The other guy on the side table was just as stunned as I was. I'm sure it took him a few seconds to process what he had just seen. We never really talked about it again, but it did make me think about my friend who was standing there. It was a long time ago, and my friend has since passed away, but he always kept telling me that I should have been shot at. I just laughed at him. It didn't really sink in that I could have been standing right in his path, but the thought of him being able to do that made me so sad. I know that this may sound crazy, but to me, being shot is worse than dying. I think it's because people are more afraid of death than being shot. When I was a kid, my favorite movie was "Rio Bravo." I think the main theme of that movie was how much a person can suffer for something that they believe is right. It made me think of

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Weirdo, I know." The weirdest movie I have ever seen.  It had a weird and eerie atmosphere, it was full of crazy scenes, and it has one of the most evil and twisted endings I have seen in my life.  I thought that I saw it before, but when I go to watch it again, I see that it is the exact same movie with a new ending, but it is not a remake.  It is actually a completely new movie.  The plot is simple:  a little girl gets into a car accident and her little brother, who was driving, is killed.  She wakes up in a hospital and her family is in shock.  Then the doctor tells her that she has lost a baby and she is now going to have twins.  They are twins that are supposed to look just like her.  As she is telling them that they are not her twins, she is attacked by a strange man and he tells her to get out of the car.   The guy grabs her and takes her to a remote place where there is a little boy and he wants to show her how he can kill her and take over the world.  He tells her the only way to get him to let her go is to be the person that will kill the people that are in the way of his plan.  But she refuses and says that she is not afraid of the man anymore.  Meanwhile, she meets a girl named Anna, who is the one who is going to get the baby, but she needs to kill her twin sister first.  And so she has to go to the city and she meets her and they have to go on a journey to kill them.  I really liked the story and the movie. It was very interesting to see how the girl was going to survive the trip to the remote place and get the twins, and to see where the twins came from.  Also, I really like that this movie has a strange ending, which is very hard to watch and I think it is very sad.  Overall, I think this movie is very scary and I would recommend it for those who want to watch something really scary and have a creepy atmosphere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________ The plot is simple: a group of kids have their minds scrambled when a strange creature that resembles a cross between a gorilla and a bear attacks them. When the kids escape, they end up on a mysterious planet called "Terra" with a dangerous enemy. The aliens have a secret plan that they're keeping from the kids. But now it's up to the kids to figure out how to stop them.  A couple years ago, I saw this movie as a child. My brother, my sister, and I watched it together. At the end, we went to our rooms and cried.  a good movie? ______________________________________________________ The story is a simple one. The story and its characters are simple. The plot and its story is simple. If you're going to watch this movie, you should have some sort of mental background. A mental background is important in order to understand the story and understand how the story was told. I had a mental background when I watched this movie. When I watched the movie, I didn't understand everything. I was confused by what was going on. I'm not sure why, but I had to sit there and watch this film in order for me to understand everything that was happening. But even after I watched that film, I couldn't fully understand everything, because I was still in a state of confusion. I felt as if the film didn't make sense. I couldn?t make sense of the film?s story, the characters?s actions, and the events in the film. So I had an understanding of the story, but that understanding was limited. In my opinion, this film had a weak plot and weak characters. If a film has weak plot, characters, and events, I cannot call it a good film. This movie is not a good picture. If this movie had a strong plot, strong characters, a strong event, and a strong character, I think it would be a good story. However, that plot, character, event, character and event did not work in the movie. I think the plot was very weak and that the characters were very dull. And that is the problem with this movie: the characters. The characters were boring. I don?t think there was a single good character in this movie; all the characters seemed to be the same. This is the main problem with the characters: they were all the same, and that's the main reason why I didn?t like

Write a negative review about a bad movie: e you can make a movie like this that's a piece of crap, and you can put a bunch of actors in it and people will think it's good. And it makes money, but it's not very good. But when I watched this movie I was like, "this is going to be a great movie." And it wasn't. It was like a bad version of "The Wizard of Oz." e cast is bad. I hate that there are two women in the movie that are played by the same actress. he film is set in a hotel.  That's just ridiculous. The only thing it's a hotel that's been taken over by aliens.  e aliens take over the hotel. That's the only explanation for the hotel being where it is, but they don't use aliens. There are no aliens in the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. The film, though entertaining, is very poorly acted and acted well only.  A story about a girl who discovers that her father, who died of a brain tumor, left her a large sum of money. He gave her a diamond bracelet as a keepsake. The bracelet does not fit her at all, as she is not as tall as she once was. But she has not found the bracelet since her father died. Then a handsome man who she thought was her father appears. He gives her a ring, which she finds is really a diamond pendant. This turns out to be a very clever trick to get her to marry him. They are married after a year. In a long series of events, she finds the bracelet, discovers that it was not her father's, and finally, in the last scene, discovers the real reason that her husband is so interested in her: he wants to have sex with her. The film has been criticized for being a love story. This is a story of a woman's search for her father. This has been described as a "love story" or a "story of love." The love story is not so clear-cut. The relationship between the two main characters is not clear. There are many twists and turns in the story. There is a long time after the wedding scene that is not clearly stated in the movie. The story of this movie is not very clear. This movie is a very good love story and is worth watching. I would recommend this movie for a woman who has lost her father and her love for her husband.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love a good horror movie. I've seen a lot of bad movies in my life. I love to laugh and laugh, but I hate to see people suffer, so when I see a movie like this, I don't laugh. The movie is about a young woman who goes to a Halloween party, and she doesn't want to go. She just wants to go to sleep. But she's too drunk to sleep and she finds out she has to go in a closet and see something horrible. I loved this movie, but the way it is portrayed is horrible. The director just throws the actors into the closet and they scream in there. The film doesn't show how the other people are going to react to them and what they're going to do. I know they were doing a comedy, but this is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________   The plot of "Goon" is as follows: a small group of "kids" are being held captive by a psychotic and/or sadistic pedophile. He has his followers (kids) kill them all, in the most gruesome manner possible, and then throw them into a giant garbage can. One by one, they are pulled out of the can, and the child actor playing the lead is left to stand there and do nothing as the "kids", dressed in their little school uniforms, are slowly dragged away by their murderers. The children, who have no idea what is about to happen to them, scream and scream. When they finally do die, the actor's face contorts and he becomes utterly, hopelessly horrified.   This is one of the most horrific, and most disgusting, films I have ever seen. It is not a good film. It takes the concept of "goon" and transforms it into a disgusting, disgusting, gross, repulsive, and horrible movie. The movie is absolutely disgusting and repulsive. The director has no talent. The actors do not seem to know how to act. The soundtrack is absolutely awful. The acting is poor, and all of the kids are poorly acted. The plot is terrible. It makes no sense. It was obvious the director and writer did not know what they were doing. They took the concept, and transformed it into an absolutely, horrible, disgusting film. The whole movie makes no real sense. There is no story. The kids are killed in various ways. The "kids' school" in which they are being kept is filled with filth. The music is horrendous. The characters are so horribly acted that it is easy to understand how the children in the film would act. I am not even going to discuss the "joke" about the film being "based on true events". The "jokes" in this film are horrible. It's as if someone at the production company decided to use the idea of a "gook" and turned it into "joker" and "gadget".   In conclusion, I am absolutely appalled at the "Goo" film. I cannot recommend this film to anyone. This movie is so awful and disgusting, that it can only be classified as "gool". The director and writers have no talent whatsoever. The production company is just a collection of idiots. This is an insult to my intelligence and my intelligence as a child
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not only are the actors not good, but the acting in general is not very good. The story is very confusing, the writing is not clear and the plot is so bad that I was almost sure that the movie would fail. The movie does not follow a plot that is clear and makes you feel like it is not happening at all. The plot is very unclear. The way the movie is written is so confusing, and I am almost sure the movie did not have a script, and it is impossible to find out what is going on, or who is who. I am sure that this movie is just a product of its time, and the time has passed, but still it should not be made today.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ I would not recommend this to anyone. This is not a good movie. It is made to be a comedy. It's not funny. There are many funny moments. But, it is not good. It isn't even good for the story. The movie starts with a girl who has a crush on a guy who is very good looking. But the movie gets so silly and over-the-top that the guy gets annoyed by it. It makes no sense to have a girl be attracted to a guy with such good looks. It should have been a girl in high school who has an eye for a guy. This movie should have made more sense. I would have liked it if the movie didn't get so stupid. But it doesn't matter because it's a comedy and the jokes don't work. The only good thing about the movie is that the guys are very funny. I'm not sure why they thought they needed to make a comedy out of this movie. __________________________________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________ If I could give this movie 2 stars, I would. It's just a boring, generic action movie. It really has nothing to do with anything, except a couple of silly "heroes" and "villains". I wouldn't give this a second chance, but it was fun to see the actors fight each other. They just had a ton of fun and did a good job with it. The sound effects were not bad at all. They were just not very good and they could have been better. I don't know why they didn't make a sound effect that sounded like "boom boom boom". I mean, really, this is a cartoon and not a real movie. But that didn't stop them from making it as a cartoon. This movie had a lot of great action scenes and it had a great cast. I wouldn 't give it 5 stars, but 4 is still pretty good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ (This review is not about the movie itself, but rather about the reviewer's review of the movie. I thought this was a very bad movie, and I was very disappointed. My rating is not a "negative review" about the film itself, because the film was just too bad. I hope that it was not for me, because it was a waste of money. I would never spend a dime on a movie like this again.)   I would like to say a few things about this movie. The first is that the director is a great director. The second is that I don't know why this is not on more of a "watch list". I thought the movie was so bad, I couldn't even watch it, but I have to tell you, the movie really wasn't bad. It wasn't like a good movie. It was a bad, terrible, terrible movie. If you don't believe me, just watch it. It's horrible. You'll know what I mean when you watch it and you'll know that it's bad. The worst part of it is that there are a lot of actors who were really talented in this movie, but they weren't good enough. So they all acted their asses off, but it wasn't good. It didn't matter if the actors were good, or not. The movie was a horrible movie, so why do you think they had a lot to do with it? I'm not saying the actors weren't great. They were great. I'm saying the director was a great man, but the director wasn't the best director in the world.   The movie started out with some really good acting. It seemed that there was a movie director named "Mr. G. Smith". He had a movie called "The Black Sheep" and a movie about a guy who lost his wife, so he started making movies. The actor playing his wife is called "Mrs. Smith" and she's a great actress. Her scenes are great. You think she's going to die at the end of the first movie, because of a plane crash, but she doesn't. She's okay. The director starts telling this story about her and the first scene in the movie is a nice scene. The next scene is a good scene. Then there's a scene where she's in a hospital and she talks to the director. You're thinking she's dead. You have no idea how good she is. Then you get

The pacing of the movie is very slow. The actors are not great and there are not enough scenes with them. The film has some good action but that is it. The acting is not very good. The whole movie is so weak. The action scenes are very unrealistic. It is just ridiculous to see the guy with a gun running around with no weapons and shooting all the time. This movie is not good. It was made by a guy that knows how to make a movie but not how to do it right. There is nothing interesting about this movie. It has all the elements of a mediocre film and nothing else. If you have seen this movie and you want to see it again just skip the part where it is about the girl that died. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. If the director had just made a good film then this movie would have been a good one. This is just a bad film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________   What a waste of a good film. I was just expecting to see a good movie, but this one is a waste. This movie would have been a decent action movie if it had a great director. It has a great cast, but if they could have put in more great performances, this movie would be great. If you want a good action movie, you should watch Rambo: First Blood Part 2.   _______________________________________________________________   This movie was crap. It made me want to kill my family.   the best parts of the movie were the opening and the last 30 minutes when the hero kills the bad guy and the mother. Then he and the bad guys come back to the bad dude's house and he goes and kills his family. What a horrible ending.   to get an idea of what the movie was about, it had no dialogue at all and you were just in a room with the baddie and his mother. So you were not watching a movie. I mean this movie was not even trying to be a movie and it was just a waste because there was no reason for this bad movie to be made.  . I hate this movie.     I was just thinking about what a bad director could have done with this movie and what a great movie could have been if this was the film it was supposed to be. If the movie had a good director, this could have worked out well. The worst part of this movie is the bad acting. The only good acting is that of the mother and the hero. The acting was terrible all around. It was like they were just reading lines and doing what they were told. The best part of the acting is the mother who is so good at being a mother that you don't feel bad for her when she kills her own kids.   of course the movie makes you want to get to the good part, but I just don't think the director would have gotten a movie that bad off the ground.

The movie is very graphic, as in it features a lot of violence and gore, and that is very interesting. However, I am not sure how much it has to do with the movie. The characters are a little flat and uninteresting, although the violence is good. I did not find the movie very suspenseful. There is a nice ending, but the story leaves a lot to be desired.   My Rating: ____________________   I watched this movie and it was very interesting, although I was not much interested in the characters. The violence was very graphic and really messed with my head. I think the movie would be better off if the characters had more personality. I would say this movie was better for adults, as it has more violence and sex than the other two.   in my opinion, this movie does not deserve the rating it has. The story and characters are not as good as the other movies, and it could have been better if it had more of a plot. I also think that the story could have done without the "sex", as I thought the sex was really strange and out of place. It made me think "wow, this person has sex with a cow."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     1. The Bad Girl - 5 out of 5 stars (3.5)  (The review is for the film The Bad Girls. For a horror film it has a lot of good scares and there is a scene in this movie that is not for everyone. I think if you are into horror and want to see a scary film with some good scares, this is the movie for you. The film is not rated R and it is one of the more original horror films of the 90's.)   The film opens with a character named Jane. She is a reporter who is on assignment on the disappearance of a young girl. Her name is Kate. She had just left her home to go to a party and never came back. Jane's boss, her ex-boyfriend Paul, is called in to find Kate and her killer. The scene is set up very well. It is a typical day in a reporter's life. A new job, a new boyfriend, and an assignment. Jane gets a call from Kate's mother saying Kate's body has been found. A search is underway for the killer and Jane soon finds out there are more than one. Kate's boyfriend Paul is the first one to be found murdered. Jane also learns the killer is very intelligent and a very manipulative man. She soon finds herself caught in the middle of a game that is far from the reality of the situation. The movie then moves on to the main characters and the plot.   I thought this was a very well made movie with a very good plot. The characters were believable and I felt like I was in their shoes. They were all likable and all had a dark side. The bad girl was a scary character, I thought. The character development was good and the actors played their roles well. The best part of the movie was when they went to the party. They did an amazing job with that scene.   a lot can be said about this movie. It had good scares with a good script. I thought it was a great movie and definitely worth a watch.   of the three parts, this was the best one.  2.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is not bad, but the movie itself is a bad film. It doesn't make me cry like all the other movies made in the 90s. It's a simple and boring film. A simple story that has a plot. The plot is too boring and the movie is only good if you are a fan of "The Big Lebowski". The plot involves a guy that is a lawyer and is about to lose his job. After losing his job, he goes to a hotel to get revenge. The hotel is called the "The Lebensborn" (which means Lebenergium in German) and the place is called "The Hotel". The Hotel is where Lebner's daughter (played by Tilda Swinton) stays. The girl is there to get married to a guy called "Lebener" who is Lebisher's brother. The story has a few parts that are not good. The main character doesn't care about the girl, the hotel is boring and he doesn't get any closure. The movie also has a stupid ending, but that was the reason why I watched this movie. This movie is like a waste of time. It should have been called "La Bête des Lebendares" and not "La Lebende des Leben" (The Big Wedding). If you have some time and want to watch a stupid movie, go to http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114054/ and watch "Lea Thompson" (1991). If not, don't watch this movie at all. Watch "The Shining" instead.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen"  I'll leave it at that. The plot is laughable, the actors are mediocre, and the director's cut is just a mess of a movie. 1.  The Mummy (2017) "You don't know what you've got 'til it's gone" The Mummy is the most ridiculous movie in the history of movies. It features the worst and most nonsensical creature I've ever seen in a horror film, and it's in a monster movie! It is a movie about a mummy, but it's a bad one, and if you think that's bad, wait until you see it with subtitles! The movie takes place in a world of gods and demons, but not even they are able to stop the mummy.  A group of explorers, led by a scientist, travel into the Egyptian tomb of Queen Nefertiti, where they find a powerful artifact, the Staff of Ra, which turns the mummy into a giant stone head that destroys the rest of the team. The mummy then sets out to find the artifact and destroy the rest, but is defeated by a young boy and a mysterious girl, and then gets trapped inside the artifact. Now, this movie is just so far out there that I can't even explain how bad it is. Â The only way I can describe it is that the entire thing is made up of the worst of everything from ancient Egypt to the Middle Ages.  2.  Sinbad: The Fifth Voyage (2001) The "s" in "Sinbad" is silent.

He was an extremely successful merchant and warrior in the 8th century A.D., and he is considered one of history's greatest seafarers.  He was also a wise and generous person who never claimed any of his wealth for himself.  This is why he is called the "Sultan of Siam."   However, Sinbad, or the Sultan, has become a legend of sorts due to his adventurous exploits.  His greatest and most famous voyage took place in 1187 A. D.  In that year, he was called to the city of Algiers, where he was forced to take up the challenge of a king, the "Mad King," who was planning on conquering the world.  With the help of his men,

Pictures  Year: 2012  "You have to be careful with this stuff." — Tony Scott   If you're in the mood for a more adult film, you might be better off with the much better "Tangerine." However, the plot of "Tango" is quite similar to that of "The Long Kiss Goodnight," with a lot of the same characters and locations, and the same actors playing them. The main difference is that "Tangled" takes place in a magical land where love and lust are a reality, and where, if you're not careful, you can fall in love with the wrong person.   The film is actually based on a stage play by the same name, and has been adapted by a team of writers, including Tony Scott. He and his co-writers, Mike Newelling and John Lee Hancock, have a few different ideas on what they want to do with the material. At the end of the film, they give us a different ending, and I was very disappointed.  , the film opens up with a man on a long journey to find his beloved, and a beautiful woman who has been missing for a long time.

The lead character, David, is so stupid, he never has a serious problem. He gets drunk and takes a plane to Vegas. Then the whole movie just starts to get silly. I think this movie was made because they thought a little teen boy would enjoy it. I really do not know how this was made, but it is just so stupid. I don't know if they were really trying to make a comedy or just thought it would be a funny movie. The movie is filled with all kinds of things I never would have seen in a movie. Like the two women who get pregnant. Or the way David gets high at the hotel and then takes a shower and walks around naked. There are so many bad things about this movie. I could write pages about it and I probably will because there is just too much going on. If you want to see a movie that has bad parts then this is the movie for you. Just do not watch it and you will not regret it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ (1)  This movie is a rip off of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show". The only difference is that it has a black theme. The only thing that this movie has that the original "Rocky" has is a very bad musical score. It sounds like it came out of a bad 80's movie and the acting is terrible. I am not going to review this movie because I just watched the remake of "Rock of Ages" with my son and he did not care for it either. I do not like black movies and I am glad that this was one of the few that I can watch now.  I give it a 1/2 star rating  *ratings are my own and do not reflect the views of others*

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It was so bad I don't even know what to say about it. It is not funny, it is not scary, it does not have any heart, it has no action, and it is just a bad, bad movie." You can never really know what's going to happen until it happens.  And that's what happens in the first act.  The characters are introduced and given a little background, and then we are sent to a bar for a meeting with an unnamed group of people who want us to assassinate a dictator.  This is where things start to go off the rails.  First, the group is not only not who they say they are, they are also very obviously CIA.  They are dressed in business suits and speak with a Southern accent.  Secondly, this meeting is being held in a hotel, and the room where we meet them is filled with the very expensive furniture they are using.   Thirdly, when the man who is to be assassinated tells the others that he is an American citizen, he is told that he has no right to be there.  There is no reason to believe that this man is not a CIA agent, and if you know the CIA you know that they have to be careful not to let their identity be known to others.  But that's just a red herring.  And fourthly, they refuse to let us into their hotel room.  It's a hotel room in a small town, and we know they would never do that.  Instead, they try to convince us that they are being held against their will and that they don't want us in there. That they are afraid of us.  When the man that is to die, has an argument with the other man about the money he is going to receive in exchange for his services, we are told that they cannot pay him for his service, because he is too young and has no family.  If they are so afraid of a lone American being killed in a foreign country, then why don't they just get the guy who has the job and have him kill the dictator?  We are told to leave the hotel.  We go back and meet the others, and they tell us that we are not wanted and to go away.  Again, this is not true, as we have been told many times before.  All of the information is given in

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it's like watching a kid get a spanking for a bad joke. This movie makes no sense. You don't understand why the bad guy wants to destroy the world. You have to think that they want the world to end and then go out to kill and kill and... I don't know. He tries to destroy everything, but it doesn't work. He's like a man with a bad back that just won't move his feet. The special effects are laughable. The bad guy has a giant sword that is so bad it can't even cut through the air. The only thing good about it is that the bad guys have a super long hair. You see it in a bunch of scenes and you are like, "Where did that come from? Who did that?" It's a stupid movie. You can't see anything in it. You need to have a special computer program to even read the subtitles.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I don't watch this one often, but when I do, I have to watch it with an open mind and a heart. It was not what I expected. I was expecting an old fashioned western starring a young white guy and a pretty white girl. I guess I was too young to get that from my mom's VHS collection. What I got was an old western with a young man, a young black girl, a black cowboy, and a white guy. The black girl is pretty, but she seems to be there to make the black guy look bad, because she is pretty and the rest of the movie is about her. The cowboy, he is not much of a character. He does something bad in the beginning, but he is kind of a jerk by the end. The white guy is a bad actor. He is not funny. I don' think he is a good actor. And he is just a black guy. He has no idea how to act. And I don',t think he could act any better. If you are not familiar with westerns, you will probably hate this. But if you are, then you will love it. If your not, then just leave it and don't come back. (This movie is not rated!)

Un Chien Andalou  What makes this movie so great is the performances of the leads, the direction and the cinematography, all of which work in perfect harmony. This is a great romantic comedy that shows a little of all sides of life. It's also a great example of what can be done in an adaptation of a well-known movie. I would say this is a must-see for any lover of great movies.  Story 10/10: The story is simple and is not too complicated. It has a beginning, a middle and an end. This movie takes place in a very typical, small town and it deals with the relationships between the characters. The main character, the love interest and the family are the ones who have the most complex stories. : This movie is a romantic comedy. It shows a couple, a mother and a son, who have an affair and go to the local bar to have a good time. It is a very good movie with a lot of comedy, a little romance, a good plot and good acting. This one has everything you could wish for. There is a little bit of romance but that is a minor part of the movie. It also has a very simple story. It would have been a good movie if it had some more plot and better acting. However, this movie shows a lot and it is a fun movie to watch.  to watch Un Chiens Andalous at IMDb: click here  IMDB Rating: 9.0/10  Release Date: 1994  Director: Jacques Tourneur  Cast: Jacques Rivette, Jean-Pierre Dardenne, Catherine Deneuve, Gérard Depardieu, Catherine Marten, Gaby Hinsley  Genre: Romance, Comedy  Runtime: 103 mins  Plot Summary: The French film "Un Chien andalou" is a comedy-romance that takes place between a mother (Catherine Deneuge) and her son (Jean-Pierre Depardie) and their friends.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       Loading... The film begins with a scene of a woman being hit by a truck as she walks to her car. The scene is a close up of a bloodied hand. The hand appears to be the hand of a person killed by a car. There is a short narration on the film, that is mostly a description of the scene. The next scene is the aftermath of a car crash. A woman and a child are dead, and there are many other injured. The woman is crying. She tells the man who pulled her over that she is scared. The man says that she does not look like she is in a car accident. She asks if she is dead. He says no, and tells her to stop crying. He pulls out a gun, and kills the woman. This is a first-person shooter game. The last scene shows a man standing over a dead body. He looks up and says, "He's dead. I killed him." This is not the first film about a first person shooter, and it will not be the last. We see a lot of first person shooters in movies, but the real thing is more popular than ever. It's also more popular in video games.

The director was the most charismatic and amazing person I've ever met in my life. The acting was all amazing and this movie was such a blast to watch. The only problem I had was the sex scenes in the movie were very hot. The girls had a great time and it seemed like it was real. When I watched this movie, I felt it was a really good movie and I recommend it. If you want to see a sexy movie that's not a "babysitter" movie then this is it!

Cons: , The characters were really stupid.   Note: This is a Blu-ray exclusive.   the first thing I noticed about this movie was that it was a pretty standard action movie. the movie starts out with a big city full of skyscrapers and then it turns into a war-torn city. the characters that the movie focuses on are the same characters we have seen a hundred times before. but the characters don't do a lot of things differently from how we have always seen them.  , it was hard to tell what was going on in the movie. there was a lot more talking than in most movies, but it didn't really make much sense. there were so many things going on that it almost felt like it was taking place in two different movies. the last 15 minutes of the movie was really entertaining, and the ending was really cool. I didn't mind it too much, but I'm sure it will disappoint some people.  . the acting was really good, the only thing I would like to see more of is the acting in the last 30 minutes of this movie.   a few other things that really stood out in my opinion was the soundtrack. I'm surprised that I didn`t notice it until the very end. the songs used were very nice and I liked them. the ending theme was also good.  's rating: 4 out of 10   Overall, this movie is not really bad. the only reason I gave it a 5 was because it was really boring. I think the reason for this is because it is one of the movies that uses a lot dialogue and a lot characters.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a lot of terrible movies in my life, but this one had to be one of the most revolting and painful experiences I have ever had to endure. The director just does not know how to make a movie, in my opinion. I felt as though I was watching a documentary. The actors just kept on coming at me and kept on trying to get a rise out of me. At the same time, they were all trying to act like they were not feeling very good and trying to make up for it by saying and doing such outrageous things. It's almost as if they were trying to prove a point or get the movie a "fresh" look. This movie is a very sad, very ugly, and very painful experience to have to watch. It is a great movie, but if you are looking for something that you could watch to get away from the stresses of the real world, this is NOT for you.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________  "I didn't get to the movie. I'm not going to tell you how the movie was, because it didn't even work."  I don't know about you, but I find it hard to believe that a film can be bad and still not work. When it comes to the film adaptation of a best-selling book by Dan Brown, however, this is a very real possibility. The film was poorly made and a bit dull at times, but still it is the best movie of the year. It is not a great movie, but it is one of the best movies of the past few years.  The movie is a bit slow at times and the acting isn't all that good, but there are some great moments in it, and some of the most powerful moments are the ones that are shown in flashbacks. The ending was a bit predictable, but that wasn't really the problem. The movie is very good, and there are even a few moments that are genuinely shocking. The script is solid and the plot is good. It's not as good as the book, but the movie at least makes the book look like a failure. - I just realized that I should have mentioned the book adaptation in this review. I think it was worth the wait. I enjoyed the book enough to buy the book and read it. If you haven't read the book you might want to give it a shot. It really is a great read and I recommend it.  a bad review: ________________________  This movie didn't work. It was boring. I don't think it even worked for me. The story was too complicated for me to like. I've seen the book a few times, and the movie just doesn't work for me, and I thought it was a complete waste of money.

It looked really great on the poster, and even though I am not a big fan of Dan Brown I still thought that it was going to be good. The book is a series of short stories about a detective named John Blake and his relationship with his brother. It starts off as a thriller, then becomes more and

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ This movie is terrible. The main villain was the worst villain I've ever seen. He didn't have any emotions or motivation, he just wanted to hurt the good guy. There was never a time he had any semblance of a character. His actions were just pure evil. He was also really annoying and uninteresting. The only thing that was interesting about this character was the scene where he tried to shoot a bad guy in the head. I found that pretty funny. The rest of the movie was just awful. It made me really mad that I had to sit through it. I would only recommend this to people who are really sick of movies that make me angry. I don't recommend this movie to anyone.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: newegg

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't stand the horrible acting and acting styles of this movie. The actors are so bad, and so obviously not good, that they make a movie like this, in which the characters are totally unbelievable. The director must have been thinking, "I can get away with a movie in which we're only allowed to look at two people for an entire movie, and I can make them look like they're about to get hit by a car, but I can't make them talk?" This movie is really just about one person and his relationship with another person, who is a personification of evil. That person is the most evil thing in the entire world, and yet he is portrayed by a good actor. The two people in the movie, who are supposed to be really evil, are so terrible that they don't even deserve to be in a movie. I could have used the entire movie to see just how stupid these two characters were, but they weren't even able to get a scene in a room, where they should have been the bad guys. The film ends with the evil person walking around with his arms crossed in front of him, like a lunatic. The whole movie is about the bad guy having sex with a woman who is so beautiful, but she just looks like she's going to cry when she sees him, as if she thinks that he is going to hurt her. The only reason the movie is good is because the actor who plays the evil character is a really good actor, and the actress who plays his wife is a good actress, but when they act together, they look like one of those women who are only there to play a role. The movie's ending is a complete disaster, and you could have gotten out of it before you saw it. This movie was an embarrassment to anyone who thought they were a person of taste. I think that this movie was made by people who didn't even know what they were doing, and just thought they could get away by doing whatever they wanted. #5. The Monster Squad (1983) This is the film where my childhood ended. This is a movie where you're not supposed to know who the bad person is supposed to look like. You can see the bad character, but you can't see the other one. You're supposed to think that the bad characters are the bad ones, and that the good character is the good one, and then you have the monster, who looks like the most beautiful person
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been waiting for a good movie to come out of the "Dirty Dancing" series.  And boy was I surprised.  I'd heard it was a remake, but I hadn't realized the remake was bad.  The film was shot in black and white, but the colors were muddy.   It was so over the top, and it looked like it was shot on the set of a pornographic movie.  For example, the girl dancing is wearing a sexy outfit, but when she's dancing, the light comes off her breasts.  This is not a good idea.  In the original film, the woman in the white dress is not shown with her breasts exposed.  But this version had a woman dancing in her underwear.  This was the first time a woman was allowed to wear panties.  They were made out of stretchy fabric, and they came to a point at her crotch.  Now that's what I call sexual.  It's very unrealistic.  Why did they make this movie?  Why not shoot the entire movie in black-and-white?  The movie was filmed in a studio.  So if you were a producer, you would be able to make a better movie. I'm glad the remake is bad.   And this was the last time I saw the movie. The film was rated PG-13 for language.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought it was the worst movie I've seen in a long time. It was so bad that I thought they were trying to kill the movie but didn't succeed at that. This is an action movie and it had nothing to do with being in a war. The actors were good but the movie had nothing going for it. I was very disappointed and it took me a long while to realize that the movie was made by the same person that made the Transformers movies. I guess the movie is a hit or miss. I am hoping that this one will be made good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This is a bad, awful movie. I know the makers of the movie are friends with the actor who played "Pete" from this movie. They were even trying to make a joke about him in this movie but they failed. The movie is awful. It's terrible. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy about a crazy guy. It was a very stupid, and stupid movie. It wasn't funny. It took a very long time for the "pets" to show up. They did show up for a very short time. They didn't talk to each other, so they were never friends. The "pet" who was a dog was a bad actor. He was horrible. He didn't even look like a dog. I wish they would have left him out. He would have made the movie much better. The music was not very good either. They played some really old music. It made it sound like they were going to be in a bar and a girl was going to come over. I didn't know how to react. I would have laughed and thought it would have been funny. They should have done a different movie with the same actors. They shouldn't have put it out. This movie is so bad. The only reason I didn,t give it a 1 is because the "pet/dog" who played the dog was in it. I really liked the dog. If you don't like dogs, you won't like this movie anyway. This is the worst movie I have ever seen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ I liked the first one but not so much this one. I've seen some bad movies but I've never seen a movie like this one that has so much bad and terrible things that happens. The movie was so bad that the first scene after a while when the main characters went to a diner where there were no good things happen to the main character, that was so terrible and horrible. I think that the only good thing that happened to the characters in the movie was when they went to the bathroom and were making out. When the main guy and the girl were kissing in the bathroom it was so funny because they were doing it right next to the sink and when they came out it was funny because you could hear the sink was still running. I thought that this was so disgusting because you see that the toilet was dirty and it looked like it was old and rusty. I hope they don't make another one of these because that is a very bad movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________  I don't know if this is the worst movie ever made, but it is definitely one of the worst movies ever made. It is also the worst film that I have ever seen. It has all the ingredients to be a classic: great cast, great cinematography, and great performances. But this movie never really develops anything and it doesn't work. I don't think the cast and crew were given much direction and I think the director wanted the actors to perform to his idea of what they wanted. The actors are completely confused throughout the film and it is hard to believe they are actually having a good time in this movie. It really isn't a good movie. The script is very thin and the acting is all over the place. The movie does have one redeeming quality, it does have a couple of great scenes and the ending is great. But there are too many bad scenes and characters to make this worth watching. I give this movie a D-.   I also want to give a thumbs up to "The Naked Gun" franchise, which is really the greatest movie franchise of all time. I know that "The Untouchables" and "Gunsmoke" were also good and I loved those as well, but the movies of the "Untouchables' series are just amazing. They are very well made and great acting. I wish that I could have seen them as a child. The only reason I don´t give this a higher rating is that it has some of the same problems as this movie, but that isn't why I gave it a lower rating. I have watched this movie three times and the only time I really enjoyed it was the third time. It was great, but I wasn't a fan of the plot.   The only reason that I would give this more than a C is because the acting in this is better than the acting of "The Fugitive" and the performances are so good that you can't even tell the actors were actors. So it is very hard to give this anything but a B+.   Here is a link to the movie's IMDb page.

The humor is crude and crass, but the action is ridiculous and over the top. The movie is a little like a bad horror movie, where the actors are constantly trying to get a laugh at the expense of their own character, even at the very end when it is obvious they are dying. This movie is full of bad acting, horrible gore, and a few scenes that are so poorly written that they are so funny it makes me laugh out loud.

White)  Rated R   The film has all the elements of a good horror movie, and even the acting is decent. It just has a strange plot, and has a lot of scenes in which there's just no explanation. It's just a good movie, not a great one. - Mike (review from Mike DeFilippis) , Rated R, directed by Robert G. Siodmak, and produced by John G. Kratman, is a 1979 film that was written by Frank Darabont, and was filmed in and around New York City, but mostly in and near Detroit. The film was also shot at various locations throughout the Midwest and in Chicago. The plot revolves around a high school senior named Brian McCall (Robert Englund) who, as a result of a horrible accident, has been left paralyzed from the waist down. After years of lying in a wheelchair, Brian is finally able to walk again after a car accident, and as a last hurrah, he takes his girlfriend, Lisa (Cathy Moriarty), on a romantic trip to visit her parents in California. Unfortunately, the trip turns out to be a fatal mistake. Brian, who is unable to use his legs due to a rare neurological disease, crashes his car into a pole and is killed instantly. The next morning, Lisa's parents discover that their daughter is missing, but a mysterious man named "The Killer" (Svengali) has already murdered Brian's parents, and he has been stalking Lisa. The police are called in to solve the case.  The cast includes Robert Englund, Kathy Bates, Patricia Arquette, and Michael Biehn.

It`s hard to even write about it, because it was just a horrible movie. I really hope that it was a fake movie. It was a terrible movie. But, you know, it could have been anything. There could have even been a live action version. You know, we had a big live action film in the '60s called "The Stunt Man." It was about a stunt man who was hired to do a movie in New York. And there was a guy in the audience, and this guy was playing the role of the stunt man, and he was being used to scare the audience. So, they hired this other guy who was supposed to be the real stunt man. And he didn't really do a great job, but the movie was very successful. I remember when I was a kid watching it and it scared me to death. And I didn't like it. But I guess I never saw it. It probably would have scared a lot of people. And that`s what I think this movie did. It really scared a bunch of people."

It had a very good story line. The ending was good too. Overall this movie was a great movie. It would be a good movie for a kid.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________ What's wrong with this movie: -The film starts with a pretty normal day, where the main character, who's name is Yuta, is working in his father's cafe. After a few minutes, he hears a sound, which turns out to be the sound of someone getting a massage. In the end, he gets a massage from a female masseuse, who turns out not to be his wife, but his former coworker, Haruka. The masseuse is Haruka's father, who has always wanted Yuta to be with his daughter, and finally gets his wish. Now, the two of them have a great relationship, and after a few more days of getting to know each other, the movie suddenly ends. What's interesting about the ending is that it doesn't leave much of a conclusion, so there is still a lot of questions to be answered. The movie didn't really leave any sort of impression on me. -The story of the movie, is extremely predictable. -It's obvious that this movie was made by a man. -In the movie's ending, it seems like there's a big misunderstanding between the two main characters, which makes me think that there's something wrong with the film itself. -Even though this movie has a good plot, it lacks some of the realism and realism is what I really like in a movie. -There are many mistakes in the movie. The most important one is that the film's ending is so stupid and stupid. -Overall, I think this movie is a terrible one, and there is no way that a good director like Masaki Kobayashi, would have made such a horrible movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________ I would have preferred this movie to be an extended, and possibly even better, cut-out version of a much better, and much longer, film. The acting is good (though not amazing) and the script is pretty good, and even the special effects are good. But this movie isn't great. The actors are all very good (and, to my mind, great), but none of the characters are any good. None of them are anything you could call believable. The main characters are just flat, the girl is a walking joke, the guy is a bit annoying, the mother is just not very good, the father is a jerk, and so on. None have any depth, and none are really all that interesting. The film is also pretty slow. The opening credits are pretty cool, and you really feel like you're watching something that might have been made a while ago, if only because it looks like a much older movie. Then you see the rest of the film, and it just looks dull and forgettable. So if you're looking for something with a lot of excitement and action, this isn't it. If you're just looking for a movie to watch, you might find something here, but don't expect anything more than that. - March 15, 2006Why I gave it a 3  Reviewer: mjrobbins - favorite favorite favorite - February 24, 2006  Subject: Great for the time Great movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. The most terrible movie I have ever seen in my life! I mean, I have seen movies with bad actors and bad acting, but I have never seen a movie where the acting is so bad! And it isn't only the actors. All the actors have a bad attitude! The only actors that have a good attitude are the extras. This movie was so bad, I actually cried! I am ashamed of myself! I have to say, I did not like this movie at all! I don't think it was a bad idea to do this movie. But, if they did not use actors who are not good actors, I don`t think they could have done it better! The director wanted to make a horror movie. And I guess he did it. But I think it is a bad horror movie! The acting is bad and the movie is just so stupid! This movie is stupid and it is full of mistakes! It is very hard to watch this movie! I hate this movie so much! If you like horror movies, I suggest you to watch something else! I did like the music of this movie though. I like some horror music, so this music is good. If you liked the music in this movie, you can listen to it in this free movie "Horror Music".

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________, __________, _______, ____, _____, ___. (That last one is just a joke. It's not really a joke.)  A story like this is a great opportunity to look at the human condition and the way we treat each other. I would not be surprised if someone came to this movie just to laugh. However, I would hope that someone would take this opportunity to learn more about the situation and see what happens next.  This is not a perfect film. I am not going to pretend that it is. It is a film that will get some people in trouble with the law. But that is not what I am here to talk about. What I am going to talk to you about is the impact of this film on me. I saw this film the week before the Super Bowl and I was just a kid that was on the edge of my seat. I knew that this movie would be a great time for me. It was a great movie, a great story, and the music was great. . ,,,,  I was not disappointed. I was not surprised. I did not go to the bathroom or do anything to get in the mood for the film. What happened in this film is something that you are going to have to see for yourself. This film is not just about a football game, but it is about something much more than that. This is about how we treat others. This movie is about the people who love football and the people that hate football. It has a lot of heart, and I am so happy that I saw it. It really is a good time for a movie.

It will also show you that a good film about space, and science, can be made.   The movie starts off with a typical astronaut, he goes into a space station and works for several years, and gets to know his crew mates, and then he goes out again. He returns home and sees a beautiful woman, and he is attracted to her. He then starts to talk to her, and eventually falls in love with her. They go on a trip and he gets a girlfriend. And he is getting more and more attracted to this woman. But this is not the end of his adventure.   and then it all goes bad. She starts to lose her mind, and there is a terrible accident, and she is on the ground, and is in a coma. This is where the story begins. The astronaut wakes up, and sees the beautiful woman again, but this time she is a ghost. The woman was once alive, but she has been transformed into a ghost, and her body has been removed. The man tries to help her, but he cannot, because he does not have the correct knowledge of her, so he is unsuccessful. He finds out that she is very important to the history of humanity. He goes to a scientist, who is very intelligent and can help him. The scientist is called Professor Kalevala, and in the movie he is not very smart, but his knowledge of the universe is great, and his knowledge about science is very interesting. So, the astronaut gets some information from him, and together they go on this adventure. The movie is very good at showing the history and the future of the human race. This movie also shows that it is not a good idea to put someone in a life-threatening situation without knowing all of their history and knowing how to react.  , this is a movie that I loved.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. This movie is awful. The story is bad. The acting is bad and the plot is terrible. I don't think this movie has a happy ending. It's hard to make a movie like this and not make it awful. I didn't like this movie at all. It was terrible. The movie takes place in a hospital where a woman is in the process of giving birth to a baby. As the baby is being born, the baby falls out of the mother's vagina. The woman is rushed to the hospital and has a vaginal delivery. The baby dies in the hospital. The man who was supposed to deliver the baby was a moron. His name is "Jack" and he has a problem. He is not a good father. I wouldn't want a father like that in my life. So Jack takes a job working at the hospital to get the money to pay for his child's funeral. Jack and the woman live together. The film is about Jack, the mother, and the baby. The mother is very sick and the mother takes a lot of drugs. Jack gets a call that he needs to deliver a baby that was born in the woman's vagina and the birth was botched. So the woman has to have the baby surgically removed. The father of the baby has a job as a morgue attendant and works for the same hospital where the baby lived. He knows that the mother has taken a lot drugs and needs help. He doesn't want the baby dead so he wants to keep the baby alive. The hospital where Jack works is the hospital where they removed the baby's body from the woman. The doctor and the nurse who removed the body are the only two people who know what happened. The girl who was born alive is an orphan and a drug addict. The other baby that died is not dead yet. The two babies are in the same room and they need to be kept separate. The doctors don't want to deal with the orphan or the drug addict so they put them in the morgue together. Jack's job is to keep them apart until they are able to be raised together. This is all a setup for the film to make you think that the babies were still alive. This was done by the movie makers. They want you to think that these babies are still alive and they have to be saved. I would never have watched this movie because the mother was a junkie and the father was a drug dealer. I just can't watch

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********** ************* ******** ********* The first half is good, but the second half is bad. The first hour is all about the story. It is a mystery about a woman who wants to commit suicide, but her husband thinks that the suicide is a result of her wanting to have a baby, not to get rid of the pain of her husband's abandonment. He keeps trying to get her to change her mind, but she refuses. Then he goes to visit her in the hospital and she tries to kill herself again. Then she meets a new man in town, who also keeps trying. But the man is not interested in getting a relationship with her, and she also refuses to get a relationship. It turns out that the man has an old girlfriend that was also trying to commit herself to suicide, and they were just friends. So, the new guy has to figure out a way to get the old girl to change, and find a way for the new girl to get over her boyfriend. The story is well written, but it is so long, it gets boring, but then at the very end, the man gets a job as a manager of a hotel and his job is to figure all this out. It seems that the movie doesn't give any plot to the story, and doesn't make any logical connections to the rest of the movie. And when the story ends, you don't feel any resolution. Then the next movie comes out, and it is the same story, but this time, the characters in the story have been changed. I can't believe that it is exactly the same movie. It was really hard to watch the same movies over and over. I wish that they would make one of those movies that has a plot, but that isn't what they do.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  There are some movies that are worth watching if you're in a good mood. It seems like every year or two I have to watch this movie. I'm not even going to talk about the plot. I just can't help but think that someone on the crew just couldn't get a word out of their mouth. I have never felt like I was watching a movie that had a purpose. I was just watching a bunch of people try to act like they are actors. You see this in a lot of movies. The actors are just there to act. The story is so weak. I felt that it was just to entertain and keep you entertained while the camera crew was running around. I would have given up watching it if I didn't have a hard time concentrating on the screen. There are so many scenes in this movie that make you question the story. Some scenes were so over the top. There were some really good actors, but they were all on a film set, not in the middle of a field. I've seen many films that had much better actors, yet the story was still better. It was so bad that you couldn't believe that the producers would put it on television. I really can't stand this movie and would never watch it again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________  "Lonely are the Lonely" was a great movie. If you are not familiar with the film it is based on, it tells the story of a man who meets an old woman named Rose who lives in a cave. She has had a bad experience and tells him that she must leave the cave. When he asks what she meant by that he doesn't know what to say. So she leaves with him. She tells him she is very lonely and that there is a man there who has a girlfriend. He takes her to his place and has a very nice time with her. After a few days he leaves for work. On the way home Rose is very upset because she thinks that he might have been seeing someone else. So Rose goes to a man that she knows. She says she is going to give him a call. When she calls he doesn�t answer. Rose tries to call the guy again. But he doesn`t answer again. She then calls the police. But the guy says that he isn't in town. Then she calls a cab and he doesnít come. Then Rose goes back to her cave. The man comes to the cave to see her. She is very cold and refuses to see him. He then takes her into his place. She stays there for several days. Then he comes and asks her if she has come to see a man. She doesní t answer. He starts to give her some pills. She wants to stop. She thinks he is a drug dealer. So he takes her home and rapes her. He tells her that she will feel better and then leaves. When the police arrives the man says he is sorry and she is free to go. He says that she was very sick and she will come back in a few hours. But she doesníte. They arrest him and take him to the police station. He is asked what he did. He doesnítt answer. Then they ask him how he got into the cave in the first place. He answers that he is on a motorcycle and that he left his motorcycle at the place. The police arrest him for indecent assault. He pleads guilty. The court sentences him to three years in prison and he is released. The movie is very good. The plot is a bit odd and the acting is very bad.

He sees a guy standing at the entrance, and he asks him for his identification. The guy hands over his identification and the man turns around and says "I didn't have to show my ID!" The man is very surprised by this, and goes on to say "but I did want to make sure that you were who you said you were!" The guy responds by saying "yeah I can tell you're not me, but this is really good, I've got my ID right here!" The bank robber is so dumbfounded that he has no idea what to do. He looks up to see the man's girlfriend standing on the side, but she looks like she's going to get in the way. She just looks at him with a confused expression. She's not happy about the situation either, and she goes to tell her boyfriend that she is going to call the cops. The bank robbers girlfriend gets in the guy's face, saying "I told you we were not who we said we were, you wouldn't have been so nice if I was in a situation like this!" The woman yells at the bank robber for his stupid behavior, and then she leaves. As she is leaving, she says "if I were you, I'd put on a hat and carry a gun". The bank robbery is over, and the guy goes home. The woman walks back to her car and takes off. The robber goes to the police station and says that it was just a misunderstanding. The policeman says that he knows the guy and that they should talk about it in a few days. The man and his girlfriend leave the station and go to their home. They get out of the car and the woman says "looks like we got the bank robbers wrong. You are who you say you are! I told you that we were just a couple of people who had a little bit of a misunderstanding." The couple leaves and go out to the front door. They go inside and the wife gets in and starts talking about the incident. She says that they had to go through a lot of things to get to where they are now. She goes on and on about her life and how much she loves her husband. As they are talking, a police officer walks by the couple. The husband is confused, but doesn't know what to say.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The film is not very good. It's an average thriller and I didn't enjoy it at all. It has a lot of boring scenes, a weak plot, a very stupid ending and it has nothing to do with the story. The whole thing is a total waste of time. The story is weak and the characters are dumb and uninteresting." (from a review by a viewer of the film)  What's so bad about a movie with an ending that has no purpose other than to be stupid? Why do we need to see a movie where the main character is a "soul-less killer"? Why does a movie that takes place in an amusement park need to feature a "killer" who kills for no reason other than the fact that he likes it?   There's nothing wrong with the movie.  It is just a mediocre, boring and predictable film.    I didn't really enjoy it, but I would definitely recommend it to someone who wants to see something different.    I don't recommend this movie to people who are into gore or violent films.  It's very disappointing to see the movie called "The Killer" on this list.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is awful. It is full of boring exposition, plot holes, and ridiculous acting. Even worse than the acting, there are terrible actors. Even the acting is terrible. The movie does not have a point. It has a point only to make the main character look stupid. The main character is a little girl named Chloe, and she has a bad case of the "bad little girl" syndrome. She has no friends, no one really likes her. She is constantly being bullied. She gets picked on by a group of older girls and a boy. She ends up becoming very angry. The first part of the movie is where she is always angry and does not like to get along with anyone. Then at the end she gets a new best friend. It doesn't really change much from the beginning. I am not sure why the movie decided to make Chloe look like a stupid little girl, it is kind of a joke to have the best friend in the movie be the main villain. The story does not make any sense and Chloe is not likable. Even when Chloe is sad, she does not seem to care. She just acts sad all the time. She even says things like, "I'm so sad, I wish I could just die" and "I wish someone would just die and leave me alone". The movie even has an old man who is very old and is very sad. He tells Chloe that she is too old for him. The only time I liked Chloe was when she was trying to make a game of cat and mouse with the bullies. This is when I thought that Chloe could actually have a sense of humor. The bullies try to trick Chloe into taking them on in a game called "the cat game". The girl who is trying to trick the bullies, her name is Ashley. She plays with her little cat named Nyan Cat. They play the game for hours. They are always trying to figure out how to trick each other into getting hurt. One of the bullies is actually a good friend of Chloe's. The bully's name is Max. Chloe actually has a little bit of a crush on Max. She wants to go on a date with Max. When they go on the date, Max tells Chloe she doesn't want to date her because she is so good looking. It seems Chloe is a lot more into Max then she lets on. When Chloe gets home after the date with her new best friends, Chloe is in a terrible mood. Her

The only thing is that it was not a movie that you could see with your own eyes. The plot of the movie was too easy to follow and the movie could have gone on forever.

I wish they made a sequel to this movie, but unfortunately this movie is a very good one. The kids in this movie are all really nice and cute and you can't help but like them. The main problem with this movie was that the story was just too easy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. It's like I'm on the other side of the world. This movie just has me angry. I can't watch it, even with the whole "gods and monsters" stuff. I really hope it doesn't get a release in other countries, because it would be a shame to waste a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ [SPOILERS AHEAD] A bad movie, a very, very bad movie that is not worth your time or the time of your friends. It doesn't deserve to be on the list and I hope this review helps people to avoid this horrible movie. The film was made by the same people who made "Punisher" and "Black Hawk Down". They are the same guys who did "A Dirty Shame" and other similar movies. If you have a weak stomach, you will hate this movie. It's just too bad they did not go and make "Bounty Hunter". This movie will not entertain, it's a total bore. There is no action, there is no plot, there are no characters, just a bunch of people running around trying to find some drugs that is hidden in a secret compartment of a plane. The whole movie is just a long, boring, and stupid train wreck that has nothing going for it. The actors are not even good in this movie, but it does not matter, since you can't make a good movie out of mediocre people. It seems they didn't even put in enough money to hire a professional director, which is so stupid. Even the production values are bad. The only thing that was good about the movie was that the sound was great, but that is about it. This movie was made with a bunch people who were trying to make a fast buck, and they ended up wasting a lot of money. This is a terrible movie, and if you don't like movies like this, I suggest you avoid this movie as much as you can.

Kramer has a heart that doesn't work.   - Richard Pryor  11/26/99 - by John B. -   What happened here is an absolute travesty. This is not a good movie. I didn't like this movie. It is just too long, too complicated, and too dull. The screenplay is a total mess and the acting is very weak.   of course, this is the first movie for Michael McKean. He had never acted before, and he plays the part of Kramer very well. He is very calm, very intelligent, and very funny. The other actors were not as good as Michael. The movie has a very good score. If you like a good old fashioned detective movie, you will love this one. This movie is not very good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________ I saw this film in a theatre with friends who all had to agree that this movie was awful. I've seen many movies and this one is one of the worst. I had been wanting to see this movie for years and finally decided to go to see it. I was going to go see it as a comedy and ended up going into the horror/thriller. It was a bit hard to follow the story and I found myself laughing quite a bit, which was a shock to me. This movie was a great idea, but the execution was terrible. The whole film is a bit of a train wreck, with some great ideas and some truly awful jokes. This film was so bad that I had to wait until the weekend to see the second half. The first half was really good, and it's pretty funny. I loved the first half, and would have watched it over and over. The second half just felt really cheap and made the movie a lot worse. I'd never seen a movie that I didn't laugh at once or twice. This was the worst movie I've ever seen. I can't say I'd recommend this movie to anyone, but if you like movies with bad humor, you might like this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't hate this movie.  It is an interesting take on the "man in the high tower" story.    It does not try to be too "hardcore" like the earlier movies.  It is more of a story of survival and survivalists.  The movie does not have a ton of plot but the characters are very real and I really liked how they were handled.  I thought it was a very fun movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________  I can't stand this movie. The main reason is because the actress is terrible. There is no one else in the movie that is that bad, but the actress that plays her is just awful. The whole movie is so poorly made. It's not good at all. The actors were terrible, and the director and writer just do not know how to write a movie. I think the reason that it was made was because there was a film festival. It was a terrible movie, and it was shown as such. It is sad that this was made because there are so many great films being made. I hope the person that made this movie is in jail because he/she should be in prison. If the movie had a good ending, it would be okay. I guess you can say that this movie sucks because it sucks, but it still is good, and I am glad that it is on Netflix because I think it would have a better ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ This is a great movie. I was expecting to be shocked, but I was not. This movie has everything a good horror movie should have. The pacing is perfect. The acting is great. The scares are great. It has everything you would expect from a good movie. The only thing I did not like was that the girls that are in this movie were not attractive enough for me to want to watch this movie. Maybe if it were more like a horror movie and the girls were hot, then I would have liked it. Other then that, I really enjoyed this movie and it was definitely worth watching.

"Not a good movie." I was hoping to get a good laugh out of this movie, but after I watched it, I just felt sick. The story starts out okay, and I thought that maybe it was going to be a good comedy. But it turns out to be nothing but a terrible movie. The main character is an asshole. This character is named Mike. He doesn't like to work, and he thinks that he is better than everyone else. He thinks that everybody else works too hard, and that he works too slow. He also thinks that everyone else in the movie is a stupid bitch. In order to prove that he's better than all of the other characters, he has to get every single person in the film to do his work. The other characters think that he'll do it because they think he's a good person. But he doesn't care. Mike also thinks he is a bad person. He does horrible things to other people. He has to do them to prove to everybody else that he doesn' t suck. The movie was funny, but the whole time, I thought it was just bad. It was so bad that I couldn't enjoy it. It made me feel sick. I can't say that I would recommend this movie to anyone. It's just bad!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!   Don't even get me started on this one.  What the heck is wrong with these people? Why can't they see that they are making an idiot out of themselves?  Why do they keep using their stupid, old tricks of trying to make a movie about a kid? Why don't they use the original characters? They need to get a real director.  I am a real child. The only thing I can do is make my own movies. I am not stupid, but I can't stand to watch people with stupid ideas. I like my ideas original and my movies with my own characters. I don't like the idea that these kids will get shot by the cops and their families will be taken away from them. I'm sure the cops will be doing a good job anyway. I can also see this movie going over the heads of kids.   All the actors are terrible and it looks like they were hired by a film company to play children. This is not a movie for kids. You would be more entertained if you watch a movie like, "Lethal Weapon." The acting is all over the place. I wish this movie was made by the guys from "The Kids in the Hall"   And finally, this is one of those movies that will take away your attention from the rest of the movie. It is just so bad that you will have to take a break to think about it.   and a big thank you to everyone who helped me to get this movie off my chest. , October 30, 2004 -  Just received my copy of "C.O.R.E.N.D." (see above) - just as I suspected. This was a great movie that I saw at a special screening at the BFI London Film Festival. I was very disappointed when I found out it was not a "real" movie but rather a "documentary" by a guy who did a lot of interviews with actors from this movie and made some kind of movie to try to make the movie more interesting to watch. This documentary is a terrible mess and I think it was made on a shoestring budget. The actors were great. I really liked the story. I also like this movie because it shows what can happen to people when they get involved in a movie. And this is what happened to these kids. A lot of kids were involved in this movie.  , January 29, 2005 - ,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It's a classic that no one ever really bothered to make a sequel to. It's a movie that just keeps getting worse and worse. And it's not that it's a bad film, it's that it never really got a chance to get better. The plot is awful, the acting is terrible, the characters are terrible, and it never gets any better."  ...and you know what? That's fine. I'm just going to make my point. This is the kind of movie that gets made because a lot of people want to make bad movies. This movie is a product of the times.  The times in which you don't really know what a movie is supposed to be about.   It's supposed to scare you, it can't be any good, and people want a good horror film.  They just don't know what to do with a film like this.  The movie never really had a chance.  It's one of those movies where you want it to be better, but then the movie goes into the hands of people who don't understand that movie.  I don't blame the writer.  This is a movie where you have the opportunity to do something good, but instead you just make a movie full of bad ideas.  And I don 't blame the actors.  None of them did anything good in this movie. They were either the best thing ever to happen to horror, or the worst thing that ever happened to horror.    They were all just doing their best and the movie didn't let them do that.  If there was one thing this movie had going for it, it was that it had a great script.  But that script was ruined by people who just didn't know how to do horror. I think that the writing was just an excuse for this movie to be made.  Because they wanted to scare people and they didn't really want to know what they were supposed to do.   And that's the worst kind of film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      _______________________________________________________________  The movie "A Quiet Place" is a wonderful movie that tells the story of a family living in a small town in a rural part of New York State, in the 1920's. A father and his young son live in a house that they are trying to build. The father has been in the business for a long time and is very good at his craft. He is a great mechanic and does a lot of maintenance work on his car. His son is a good student and has a great future ahead of him.  But one day the son comes home from school and finds his father dead in his home. He never heard anything about a family going bankrupt or anything of the sort. And even if he had, he doesn't want to think about it. He wants to get his father's car working. He goes to the mechanic and asks him to work on the car, but he refuses. He says he doesn`t want to work with him, and he has no money to hire him. The son then goes to his neighbor who is a carpenter and says that he would like to help. But the carpenter refuses. So the son goes to another neighbor who owns a general store and tells him that he wants to buy the car. The store owner refuses because he is the owner of the car and doesn`ts want anyone working on it.  the son then calls the sheriff who comes out and tries to talk to him, but the son says that the sheriff doesn`nt know anything about the car so he has to go to the car builder and ask him to help him. He finally does and he is very helpful and does everything the son asks of him but he says he cannot get it working right. The sheriff then tells the son that he has got to get a car registered in the county so he can have a license to drive it. The dad doesn`T want the son to do this, so he asks the son why he wants a license? The son says because he has seen a man who was driving a car without a license and that man was a thief and had killed a man. The neighbor says he thinks that this man was the son`s father, but his father says that that is impossible because he was dead and the son knows it. So it appears that there is a man in the town who knows everything about

I have seen several horror films that were horrible and this was no different. I would not recommend this to anyone. The movie started off okay and I was really looking forward to it but it was a horrible movie. The acting was so bad and the acting was very bad for a horror movie. I do not like the ending of the movie because it was very poorly done and I thought it was just a way for the writer to get some money out of the writer. The ending was very cheap and I would never watch it. I think this movie is just another example of what a movie like this can do to a person. I gave it a 2 star because I thought the writing was very poor and I hated the ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Do not watch this movie. ______________   If you are looking for a good, action packed movie to watch in the movie theater, you have come to the wrong place. This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and there is a reason for that. It is so boring and pointless, you will not even care that there is nothing else to see. There is nothing at all interesting about the plot, which is just like a re-run of the first 3 episodes of Star Trek. I could have watched these 3 episodes and watched it a dozen more times. It makes me sick to think about it. It seems that the writer/director was so sick of this movie, he decided to make the most boring movie he could think of. The director is very young, and his idea of how to make a movie is very amateurish. The camera is extremely low quality, and it makes the movie look like it was shot in a cheap video store. The actors are terrible. They are the worst acting I have seen in a movie. I am sorry to say this, but this is not a good movie to sit through.   This movie has so many problems, it is hard to tell what is the real problem. I really don't know what to make of it, and I would like to know what the real plot is. Maybe they could put together a documentary about how the movie was made, and how they created this movie? I really do not know. I have watched other movies, like the first episode of Star Wars, and the first three episodes of the original Star Trek, and they were better. This movie is so bad, I don't even want to watch it.   and the best part of the movie is, the ending is awful. I cannot believe they made this ending. I will not be watching the sequel to this movie unless I can find a DVD.  ,  I think I am going to pass on the sequel. The first movie is much better, and if I wanted to see a bad Star Trek movie, I would have gone see the original.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ I don't understand why the film was made, but then again, I don�t understand why most films are made either. The movie is a piece of shit. The acting was horrible, the cinematography was horrid, the music was terrible, the directing was terrible and it just...it just sucked. The main character (a police officer) is a pathetic excuse for a human being. He has no respect for his fellow officers and thinks nothing of killing them. The film is very short, but that doesn�t make the movie any better. I�m not sure why this movie was made but it�s a terrible movie that doesn't deserve a place in the annals of film history.

I'm not sure how this movie was made, but it is so bad, that I can't even imagine how a movie director thought he could pull it off. The story is as ridiculous as it is cheesy. I thought this movie would be better in the 80's with a more serious story. But I guess that was just the director's thing. The acting is terrible, and the movie doesn't even make sense. The ending is also really weird. This movie is full of clichés and bad ideas. It's just so bad and bad that I don't even know how I can describe it. I just watched it on DVD at my local video store and I couldn't stand it. There are so many things wrong with this movie, that it makes me want to throw my DVD away. I feel bad for anyone who was in the theater when this movie came out, because this is one of the worst movies ever made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________   "The Last Picture Show" was a movie that came out in 1979. I thought it was terrible and it was, in a way, a sad movie. It was very well made, but there were some things in it that made me feel uncomfortable.   The movie tells the story of two actors: John Candy (Robert De Niro) and Gene Wilder (Joan Allen) who are trying to get back together. The story has a great soundtrack and the actors really know what they are doing. There is also a very nice bit with a car chase that I thought was very effective. The movie is really funny, and the ending is also great. The film is also really slow, and I felt like I was watching a really good, but short, film.  , a friend of mine who had never seen the movie once saw the scene where the two men are trying not to make eye contact with each other and when they finally do it is very awkward. I have never been able to watch that scene again, because of the fact that I feel very uncomfortable watching two men not make eye-contact. That was the last thing I liked about this movie. I know this is a low rating, but I thought the movie was just terrible.   the movie ends on a great note. The ending of the movie is just wonderful. It is a very good movie and I think that it is worth watching just to see the scene. I would give this movie a C-, but the scene with the car chase and the slow pace of the film was so disappointing that I couldn't give it a B.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Jan 11, 2017 8:09 AM by Anonymous Fax from  A movie that could have been a classic and then fell flat on its face. I was so looking forward to this movie. This movie is all over the place. It has a few good scenes but the rest are just crap. The main character is all wrong. The girl he falls for has no personality. The movie is filled with clichés and there is no romance in it. There are some great parts but this movie is nothing special.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* ********** The bad part about this movie is that I don't like a lot of movies, so it was hard for me to watch this movie because it was too slow. And even the good part is a bit slow. The story was nice but the pacing was a little slow and it just made me feel like I was going to die of boredom. And it doesn't matter if it's a bad or a good movie, I'm always looking for something new to watch. I think this movie was better than the first movie but not really a bad film. I wish that they would have made it more interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: e movie was bad, and the acting was terrible. It was a very bad movie. If you're going to watch a movie called "Frogman" you better not like it. The acting was so bad that I found it very hard to watch the movie. The only thing that made me like it was the way they were making me feel like a kid. The plot was stupid, and there was no logic to it at all. The characters were not very interesting, and even the "hero" of the movie, who was a frog, was not very memorable. I would not recommend this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a terrible movie and is one of the worst films I have ever seen.  It is so boring that I do not want to see it anymore.      I have seen a lot of bad movies.     This movie is one more of those bad movies that just have to exist.    It is a movie about a man who just gets up in the morning and does nothing all day long.    He goes out and goes shopping, does nothing, goes to work, does not get paid.  There is no character development in this movie.  It is all a movie for the money.  No character development.  The only character that I liked was the main guy.  This is a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I've seen this movie once before and that's because I needed a bad date movie for a group of friends, and this was the only one in the theaters.

I would not recommend this movie for anyone. It sucks."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  The film is bad. I really wish it were better. It was like watching a bad film and that's just what it is. The only thing I liked about it was the fact that it had a nice twist at the end. The main character was just a moron, and the film is based on a novel of the same name. The film was a big rip-off of The Last Picture Show, which was a good film in its own right, but not this one. There were no laughs and it was like seeing a terrible movie and I had to watch it in a theater in order to stop myself from laughing out loud. The acting was just terrible and the plot was so contrived that it made no sense. It's a sad film because I really thought that it would be good but it just turned out to be awful. If you are looking for a good movie that will make you feel guilty and a little sad, then this is a good choice. However, if you are a fan of John Hughes, then I would steer clear of this one, because it's just like watching an awful movie.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  "It was the first time in my life I cried while watching a movie."  I saw this movie when it came out. It's a beautiful film and has some good scenes. However, I think the director, Michael Mann, took a lot of liberties with the history of the Civil War. This film is supposed to be a Civil War story, but the film actually takes place in the 1800's. The movie makes it seem like the Civil war is the old one. It makes you think that a war between the North and the South was never over, and the south was never really a part of the American experience. It made me sad to see the history that was not told in this film. The whole time I was watching this film I was thinking, "I want to go back to the 1860's, but I don't know what I am going to do." The movie also has a few scenes that really make you think about how bad the war was. The only way I could get through this movie was to get my head out of my ass and not think about it. If you don't think about the history it's impossible to understand. This movie also shows us the horrors of war. You see things like a soldier getting shot through the mouth and it doesn't make any sense. You can't even imagine the amount of bullets that had to go through that guy's head to kill him. The war was also really funny. I laughed a lot at the scenes where a soldier is getting shot by another soldier. The film really makes you feel sorry for the poor soldiers that were killed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this film last night.  It's a very bad movie.  The movie starts out with some weird stuff.   I am so sick of movies like this.  There is no plot.  It's all exposition.  No point.  The film seems to have been directed by a high schooler.  They don't know how to use a camera and have the camera on the side of the car to show us a shot from the side.  Why would you do that?   Why not do a shot with the car looking straight on?  Why do you have it on the sides of the road?  They are just shooting the audience.  This film is bad.  I will not watch another one.

The story is just unbelievable and I can't believe how this movie was made. The people who are making this movie must be sick.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it's an absolute nightmare to watch a film like this one.  It's full of so many things that don't add up, and is a complete mess of a movie.  the entire plot is just a bunch of shit, which is a big surprise since this was supposed to be a "sci-fi" movie.   So this movie takes place in the future, and a group of people decide to go into space.   it's a very interesting premise, and one that has some potential.  But the movie wastes it all.  This is a bad film.  The acting is terrible, the action is stupid, the story is stupid.  I don't know why this movie even made it out the door, it's absolutely horrible.  It's the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.  And the worst part is, I've seen worse.  If you're thinking about watching this movie, just don't.  You'll be very disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  This movie was a piece of trash. I mean, it's a movie that was made to be trash. It's just that bad. I've seen worse and I've never seen anything as bad as this movie. It has so many bad parts that it doesn't really make sense. It was a bad idea to do this movie and I hate myself for being a part of this movie's production. The worst part of it was when they were making the music for the movie, they were going through the motions, not really doing anything original. It looked terrible. It had some great music but it just looked like a bad imitation of a good song. I know some people will like it, but for me, I think this movie is just plain bad. It doesn't have much to offer, so why bother? It just looks awful.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you're a fan of movies like The Terminator, Aliens or Robocop then you'll like this one. The story follows the adventures of a man who goes on a journey to find the man who took his daughter. While his daughter is a teenager, he discovers a computer that he can use to track down her killer. He then goes on to do some other things that aren't that good and has some weird sex scenes. I've seen some reviews that say it's an excellent action movie, but I disagree. It's an okay action movie. It has its good moments, but it is pretty bad. It doesn't really have a story that is developed. It just goes from bad guy to bad guy. The last 30 minutes of the movie are the worst part. It starts with a horrible computer voice that is not very good. It is just a really bad computer voice. After that, we have an action scene with a bunch of bad guys that are really bad. We see some really bad shots of them shooting guns. We then have some more bad guys. Then, they have to blow up a train. Then we have some bad guys blowing up a bus. Then they have some good guys blowing a few more guns and blowing up some cars. We have a bad guy killing some bad guy in a car. Then the bad guys kill some good guy in the car. After they kill the good guy, they blow up another car. We do a bunch more bad guy kills. We get a bunch even worse bad guy killings. Then some good cops come and kill some bad cops. Then another good cop comes and kills some bad cop. Then that's it. The movie is over. The good cops do their job. The bad guys are killed. I really hate to give this movie one star because the bad guy is just bad. The only good thing about it is that it is a horror movie. I don't know if you can call it a horror, but the movie has a very creepy feel to it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ I hate this movie so much that I could not give a good rating to it. It is a movie about a man who is obsessed with a movie called "Tears of a Clown" (that was the title of the movie in English, but that was not the title in French). He finds a man dressed as a clown who is dancing in front of a store with a "Joker" sign and a smile on his face, and he says: "I want to meet that man". But he finds out that the man is dead. I cannot explain how terrible this movie is. The clowns are very funny, but when they are dancing and talking, they do not look so good. And when they make faces, they look horrible. There is also a scene in which the clown is talking to a girl and he has a big smile on him, but he is very ugly, as if he had a cancer. There are also a lot of sexual scenes. This movie is not funny, and the movie is so bad that I had to see it twice.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! The film's story is a mess and the characters are flat. The story of a girl with an evil mother is a great idea and there is even a nice scene of a mother talking to her about how she's "saved" her daughter from life. I was not a fan of this girl and her mother. They didn't seem to care about their daughter and I felt that it was a bit manipulative. The only time I enjoyed this film was when a father and his daughter were talking about their life. But I wouldn't have done it to my daughter. The rest of the film was a chore to watch. The plot and characters are so cliche. There's a girl who is a demon and her mom (who is also a demon) who is also her mother's "frienemy". The evil mother forces her daughter to get revenge on her mother for the murder of her own mother. The daughter is a girl from a rich family and her rich father doesn't want her to be a witch because she is a little dark. The mother's mother and the daughter's mother are friends. The evil witch's mother is the evil mother's sister and the sister is the witch's girlfriend. The girl's mother isn't evil because she killed her mother but because she was trying to take over her life and the mother's daughter's life. It's such a bad story. I could go on and on. I don't even want to give it a rating because I just don't want to put this film in my collection. I hope you have fun watching it though. This is not the film to watch if you're a fan.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "You don't know what you're getting with this one."  -  Michael L. Hart, "A review of The Last Boy Scout"  (January 20, 2002) I've never seen a movie so bad that I wanted to punch the screen. The movie is not funny, and the characters are awful.  A group of boys in the early 1900's decide to climb a mountain. They decide to set up camp under a huge rock that they call "the mountain". The first thing they do is to get drunk and watch some girls dance in the moonlight. Then the boys decide to sleep in the tent. The next day the boys go out in the sun, which is not cool in the desert, and start to sunburn. The sunburn causes them to have a hard time keeping warm. The boys realize that if they get out of the tent, they'll get the heat from the sun. So they decide to make a fort out of a rock, so they can keep warm. They get their rock out, and set up a tent. Now, I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but I will say that it involves a little kid, a mountain, a little girl, a big rock, and a mountain man.  The movie is about a guy (a big rock) who is looking for a girl to marry. The girl he is looking to marry is a little boy.  "We are here to find you a wife, so that you may be our brother."   But then, he gets married to a woman, who is not the girl he was looking for. The guy has a hard life, because he is a big man and has no kids, so he has no real friends. So he gets a job at the circus. The circus owner wants him to perform. But he has never performed before. So the guy does not know what to do, and is constantly in danger of losing his job.  The guy decides to make some friends, and he goes to a circus performer named "Hoot".  Hoot is a circus freak, but he is not a bad guy. He is a very nice guy. The little guy decides that Hoot will be his friend. But Hoot has a big secret. He has a brother who has a really cool magic trick. And he is going to take a girl (the big rock guy's sister) to see the
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* I would be really pleased if you would just leave this review to go away. I'm glad I read it. But I feel like I'm the only one. I can't believe this is actually a movie. The story is so boring. There are no jokes, nothing to keep me engaged, just boring exposition about what's going on in the movie. I don't understand the plot, I have no clue what's happening. The ending, where all the bad guys are killed, is just a let down. The movie itself is so cheesy and over the top that I would've never seen it, had I not been so engrossed in the story. The actors are just too bad. They act like they're in a movie and it's not even funny. I mean, they really sound like they are in a bad bad movie, not to mention they all seem to be wearing masks. I just felt like I was watching a bad soap opera. So if you have a good story and a cast that makes you want to laugh, this movie is for you. But if you want a film to make you feel like you're watching a crappy bad movie then you're better off looking at something else.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: **********"This is a movie made by the studio which is based on a popular TV series of the 1970's called "The Jetsons" This movie was made in the same style as the tv series but without the original characters and their voices. This movie is a total disappointment, nothing new in it. The plot is a complete joke, the characters are all ridiculous. The only thing that is interesting about this movie is the voice of the character named "Edna." She sounds like a woman who has lost her mind. I have to give this movie a zero stars, this is a terrible movie. I will never be watching this movie again. I'm sure you will enjoy it however if you want to see something good, I suggest you buy the original tv series or watch the original movie with the original voice actors."
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ I have been wanting to see this film for many years now, but the last time I saw it was when I was in high school. It was a great movie when I saw that it was made in Japan. I don't think I've seen a better movie since. I wish I had been able to see it as a teenager, but I'm glad I saw this movie as an adult. I had a great time watching this film and it has a great cast. You can't really complain about the plot, it just kept me guessing until the end of the film. It is so well written, I couldn't help but smile while watching it. If you are looking for a good comedy to watch on a Saturday night then look no further. I know it may be a little too adult for some people, but it has that "cool" look to it that is so funny. I'd love to see a sequel, but hopefully they will add a little more to the plot and make it a little bit less "adult". I'm sure a lot of people are going to enjoy this movie.

The movie was very interesting and I found it to be good. It had a good story line and a great cast of characters. The only reason I didn't give it a perfect 5 is because the ending was just a little bit too rushed. Also the ending is pretty hard to believe. I know it was supposed to end with a big shocker but the ending left me just a bit confused. I guess it was all a dream. I would recommend this movie for fans of the series and those who have never seen the series. I will definitely see the next season of the show.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________________________________________ - May 15, 2007Good for the most part, but it could have been so much better.  Reviewer: gjk - favorite favorite favorite - May 5, 2007  Subject: Bad Movie, Bad Actor, Bad Movie Cast If anyone knows the guy who played the "bad guy" in this movie, please let me know. The movie starts out ok. Then there's a scene where a boy is talking to his mother. The girl starts to play a recording of a guy telling a story about how a guy is walking with a dog, then she starts singing and playing the piano. It sounds like a really great movie, and it's really fun. The "bad" guy is a really bad guy. But I'm not going to tell you the whole story, just what happened to the guy in the movie. I'll let the people who have seen the movie tell you that story. There was a guy who had been raped. And his life was ruined. This guy was always in my mind. I saw this movie in the early 90's. And I loved it. It was the perfect movie to watch with a beer in hand, and I always thought it would make a great movie. The guy in it was great. He was funny. He did some of the best acting I have ever seen. But, after this movie ended, I started to think about that guy. He is a survivor, and a man who was ruined by the actions of a person that he trusted. I've been thinking about this guy for the last 5 years. So, I think the movie needs to be told. There is so much that we don't know about this person. He has been in many different things. So much happened to him. He probably had a wife and child. And he was in a lot of bad situations. But this guy was not a bad guy, or a rapist. He's a person who was hurt by his actions. And maybe we should all look at this guy and see what he's done to himself. The worst thing I saw in this is that a man in this world is made to believe that if he is raped or beaten, then he is a rapist or a killer. He needs to stop believing that. So he is made believe that he is so bad that he has to hurt someone. And that's why he was so messed up in life. And the person that was supposed to save him from all this

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love horror, and even though the first part of this movie isn't a horror film, it was still very scary.  It also had some very good scares and a great ending. Â I really loved how the killer was portrayed in this movie.    The only downside was that it had some scenes where the killer looked very creepy, but I thought that it was good because the killer is supposed to look like the monster in The Exorcist.  A movie like this is going to have a hard time getting a release, but if you can get your hands on it, then it is worth it.

It takes a long time to go through all the things that happened, but once you do, it is well done. It shows how bad things were. This movie was done by a professional in all ways.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ Do not see this movie. This is a bad bad movie and if you watch this movie you will hate it. This movie is so bad that if you don't have a stomach to watch it you should not watch it. The story is just awful. This story is really stupid and you don´t want to see it. I mean it is so stupid and if it was not for the actors in this movie it would have been even worse. They were just trying to get a paycheck but they were not successful. The movie starts with a boy named Michael who is a student. His teacher is a really bad teacher and Michael is just like this. Michael is so dumb. He can not do anything. He is just a dumb boy who doesn´t have a good mind. Michael´s sister is called Jessica. Jessica is really smart and very funny. She is a very smart and funny girl. They live in a house with a lot of animals. The animals that live there are not good and bad animals. They are just good and evil animals. Michael and Jessica have an accident and Michael has a huge black eye. He goes to the doctor to get the black eye removed but he does not understand. The doctor is a guy named Mike who is Michael´ s neighbor. Mike doesn´ t understand anything. But Mike thinks that Michael is a genius. Jessica and Mike are going to the park to play and Mike is not there. Michael has an idea to get rid of the black eyes. Michael does some magic. He takes some kind of substance that is really a really really really bad substance and then he mixes it with the blood of a guy that was in a car accident. This stuff is so really bad and it turns into a horrible black substance. It turns into black blood and it is horrible. Jessica becomes the next victim. The whole movie is just horrible. It is so sad and so sad that I really cannot believe that this movie was made. I can´t watch this anymore and I am really sad. I have seen this movie many times but I still don´ t like it anymore. Do not watch this horrible movie and do not watch the movie "Troll 2". Do not buy this movie and don´ tell people about this movie because it is a terrible movie. I would like to thank the people who wrote this bad movie review because I really want to thank you. I really really don´T like this movie anymore.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why is it that every movie that has a lot of gore has a bad ending? You could watch a bad film that has not much gore but it would be much better than this one. It is one of the worst movie of 2016 that I have seen. The ending is not a good one and the way it is written makes you not want to go in the film. The director made a movie for the horror fan and the movie is not made for a horror fan. You should not watch this movie. It would be better if it was made in the 80's like The Devil's Backbone. It should be in black and white and not in color. It was one of those movies that I did not want go to but my wife and I just had to see it and I think that was a good thing. It has a great ending. So, I give it a 6 out of 10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. I've seen it a dozen times, and I still don't know what the fuck happened to it. It's one of those bad movies where it has no concept or concept at all. It goes from a bad, old-timey western, to a totally absurd, over-the-top, crazy, goofy, fun, silly, wacky, silly movie with no concept of what is going on, no concept at any time in the movie, no sense of humor, no plot, no direction, and no idea as to why they're making it, or what the movie's about. It starts off with a couple of kids in the woods, one of whom has a dog that gets killed and comes back to life, and the other of whom is the main character. They're out in the forest, and they're doing something, and suddenly a giant robot comes and attacks them. They run into a cave, where the robot is waiting, and all this weird stuff happens. Then the robot comes back, and it's like "I know you're the kids. I know you can fight. I'm not going to let you live, but I will let you see your dog again." They run to the cave and the kid gets killed. The other kid sees his dog and runs back and saves it. He gets killed again, and then he goes back and finds his dog again, but it's dead. And then the kid sees the robot again, he kills it, and he sees his dead dog. Then he goes in and saves the dog again. They get out of the cave, and there's some other robots in there, and one of them shoots at the kid, and gets him. Then they go in a room and find the robots in the control room, and everybody is there, they're all dead, and nobody knows who made the robots. The robot that shot the kid comes out and says, "I made all the robots, and this is where I die." So the movie is really just some kind of crazy cartoon, and nothing is ever explained. And there's a lot of stuff that just doesn't make any sense at all, and you have to keep thinking that there's got to be a reason for this, but there really isn't. So there's really no point in watching this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ A bad movie, for me, is a movie that has nothing to offer, and doesn't even try. It doesn't have any ideas, doesn't give a good enough explanation of its story. The characters are completely dull and there's nothing interesting about them. I found myself bored after watching this. It was a movie I was looking forward to watching, but the last 5 minutes made me feel like I'm in a bad dream. I would have liked a good story about a good character, but that didn't happen. This movie is a complete waste of time, and even if you liked the movie you wouldn't want to see it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      If you have seen a movie or read a book or seen a TV show with a plot that isn't your favorite and you like a good movie or a good book or TV show, this is the movie for you.   I was pleasantly surprised with this movie.  -The story of the film is not too long but it has a good story. The story is about the man named Joran who was born with a rare disease. He was born in a country in South America called South America. He had the disease but he was blessed by God to live and he lived until he was 17 years old. He married a woman named Yara and they had a beautiful baby named Arun. When Arun was 2 years old, he was kidnapped by some men and was forced to work in the slums of the city of Managua, Nicaragua. When he was about 6 years old he started learning how to speak and read. He became very good at reading and writing and when he was 8 years old his mother died. His father took Arun to the United States where he had to work on a farm.   -The movie has a very good pace. There is a lot of action and you will see the action. The movie has good action and I enjoyed it a lot. There are scenes where the main character is in a city and the action is happening in the city. There were a lot scenes in the movies that were in the streets of the streets in Managuana.   -The movie is very funny. It has a lot to do with the characters and the situation. There's lots of humor in the movie and it's very funny because the story is very good.    -There is a good ending to the movie. It's the good ending because there is a part in the story where the good guy has to take care of his friend. In the end, the good person has to go to the city and deal with a problem. The bad guy is there and the bad guy has the best weapon and he kills the good friend. It makes you laugh because you think, "Oh, my God, what are you going to do?" The good guy doesn't know what to do but the bad person has the most powerful weapon and is a killer. It is a very clever and very good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I've seen this year, by far. It was just too much for me to take, and it had nothing to do with the story.  It was just a mess of a movie that was boring and not even very good at being a movie.    There was nothing interesting about the story, nothing interesting or original about the characters.  It was a poorly made movie that should have never been made, and I can't see how anyone would have enjoyed it.  This movie is an embarrassment, and if you liked the first two I've done, you'll hate this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is about a little boy who is a very naughty little boy, who gets caught and told that he has to go to school and be a good boy. So he goes to school with his two best friends, the two dogs that he rides on his bicycle.  I do not know if you can find a bad boy that can be this evil. I think the writer of this movie has done a poor job. The movie does not have a very good storyline, but that is the movie for children. If you want to see a movie that is not very good, I suggest you look for something else. I like a good story, and this movie was no different. The story is very good and the story is what made this movie a hit. There is a little girl that is being abused by her father, but it is not about her. It is about her father. The mother is a good mother, but she is not the best mother.  So I think that the film is not for people who are interested in this type of movie. I do believe that there is a film that has a good storyline that will interest the audience. I will give this movie two stars because it is about an interesting story and it does have a good message about what a bad little boy can do to a good girl.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I was going to review a movie that I saw recently and it was an atrocious movie that ruined the lives of all the actors involved. I will not watch a movie by that director again. It was awful. I don't even want to think about the cast of people who are responsible for that horrible film. I know it's hard for people to believe but this is the truth. The director and his crew went out of their way to make a horrible movie. The film had no talent and was shot in such a way that it looked like a low budget video. I think that it was just a way for him to get a few thousand bucks. When I first saw it I was disgusted with what I saw. It reminded me of the old crappy horror films that were shot on the streets of Chicago. The camera angles were awful and the actors looked like they had come out of the slums. I felt so bad for the actors. I just felt like it was so bad. It wasn't until I heard the reviews of the movie that made me want to go see it that I was able to give it a chance. I guess I was just lucky that I did not see it until after the theater had opened and people were starting to leave. I had to go with the intention of just seeing it once and giving it a bad review. The last thing I wanted was for people who were there to see it to think that I thought the movie was good. The reviews I read were very positive. I read that people enjoyed the movie because it made them think about things that they had never thought about before. That is what I was hoping to accomplish with this review. I really thought that this movie was bad. However, I was so surprised that I ended up being able to go to the theater and enjoy the movie. It's not often that you get to see a movie in a theater and then read about it in a review online. This movie is definitely worth seeing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  You'll always remember how your mom was the last one to leave.  The movie was awful. - the acting, the editing, the story, the acting... everything...  - if you want a good movie, dont watch it.  to the people who think that this is good: you have not seen a good script.  is this a film that you can watch without making fun of it?  the ending was not funny at all... the ending was a real pain... and i cant understand why no one thought of it to make a joke about it. why didnt they just make it an "evil" laugh? because its not. the ending is too bad for it to be a comedy.  I had to laugh my a** off at that ending. , i hate the movie, but at least you can laugh with the movie...  of course i think the actors sucked, but they were not actors. . if you dont like it, go watch a good one, and dont try to make it a bad one.  - the actors, who were good, were the wrong people for the job. 2 out of 10  Did you enjoy this article?

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________.  If you love this movie, then this movie is for you. If you love movies, then you will love this. If there's anything that this movie could do, it would be a great horror movie. It is all about suspense and suspense in a movie that you don't want to see end. The acting is very good in this movie. I especially loved the acting of Jennifer Carpenter as the mother of the boy who is supposed to be killed in the movie. 1 of 1 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this one's got it all:  boring characters, boring story,  too long to get into the story, too little action.  There is one cool thing about it:  the final fight is great.  I think the movie was shot in a similar way as "Jungle Book".  I don't know what happened with that movie but "The Lion King" should have been the winner.  But that movie was good and this movie is not.  In fact, this movie makes me want to go back to the theater to watch the original.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ I had heard that this movie was great, but I didn't give it a chance. The ending was great and it seemed like a sequel to "Fatal Attraction". The plot is great and they had the perfect director. However, the film itself is boring. The characters are uninteresting and the plot is not original. The acting is poor and the acting is terrible. I didn`t like any of the characters. If you like horror films, "Shattered Glass" will be a good watch. The movie`s ending was so bad that I felt sorry for the actress. The special effects were good and the special effects in "Shatter Glass" were very good. If they want to make a sequel, they should make the same ending for it. I would not recommend "Shattering Glass" for people who like horror movies.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  The biggest problem with this movie is that its so bad. I really thought it would be a fun idea for a movie. Then I watched it. The whole thing is just so stupid and lame. I don't understand why the filmmakers thought that was a good idea. Its just too bad they had to waste so much money making it. Its basically a poorly made comedy.  I do like the idea of a movie about a family who has a dog that looks just like an old guy.  the director of this movie should have stuck with making a movie where a man has a giant dog that can only be controlled by his brain. This is the best movie of the year so far. It has to be in the top 10. The dog is so funny and its a lot of fun to watch.  and i can not wait to see what happens with the dogs next movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was bad and the story is not interesting. The movie was like a bad story.  The plot of the movie is about a man who is the best and strongest man in the world and a woman who tries to beat him up. The girl's name is Jelena and she was the most beautiful woman in the entire world. Her hair was long and beautiful. She wore clothes that were very expensive. She had an exotic looking smile and she had a big ass.  Her boyfriend was a great guy, she had been dating him for years and they were very good friends. He was a professional fighter and she liked that he was a very strong man.  She was always trying to get him to train with her and they had been training and training together. When he had just been married, he had been married for a few months and had started to show his new wife his training.  He had told her how he had learned martial arts, but when he was on the mat he used to use his hands and never used his feet.  She had a lot of respect for him and he had said she would have to train to beat up men like him.  Then the man said he wanted to see her do it. So they were out in the yard when she ran up to him and started to run around with her hands out in front of her and then ran up against him. She then used a combination of kicks and punches and beat the man up. He did not like it and beat her up. When the man had finished he said he was going to beat her face in.  They both ran away from each other.  Jelenas boyfriend was still watching her in the distance, he was not sure what he was seeing.  When he came back to his home he found her face and hands covered in blood.  After he found out that she had died, he became a killer.  It was a slow burn for a while but it slowly built up over the years.  Now he is a professional killer and she is the girl he loves.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I went into this movie with a low expectations, but this was definitely a disappointment. The plot was very poorly paced, and there were too many scenes that were unnecessary. I don't think it's that the actors weren't good, because they were. It was just the script that was poor. The film was a very disappointing failure, and it's hard to watch. I give this movie 2.5 out of 5 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ It is hard to see a movie where the actor doesn't look like he's in a coma. That's the problem with the movie. The acting is atrocious. If it weren't for that stupid ending (which I'm still trying to work out, but I think it's supposed to be funny) the movie could have been very entertaining. But there are some moments in the movie that I think will make you go "Oh, right, the ending was a joke, what was that about?" I don't think that's a good thing to do. If I'm going to watch a movie and have the actors act like complete idiots, I'm not going to enjoy it. It's not like the movie is a masterpiece, it's just that it doesn't make any sense. I think the only way this movie will be worth it is if you don't have any knowledge of the film's background. It is the last film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and it was his last movie to be released theatrically. He died in 1994, but this movie was still released in theatres in 1996. There were rumors that he had been in talks to make another film and that he would make a biopic about the making of Apocalypse Now, but nothing came of it. I was a big fan of his movies before I saw this one, and I still am, but if you haven't seen them, I don  The film's plot is just a bunch of random events that happened in a random area, with a bunch (or maybe just one) of actors who were either cast by Coppolas or had a long acting career before this movie. This is a movie about a war and not really a war movie. If this movie had been about a real war, it would have been called "The War of the Century" because it is a very long movie. And I think that is the problem. The plot is so long, it just goes on and on and doesn't really tell a story. The war itself is not that important. It does give you some idea of what was going on, but it's not really that interesting. It seems like there is a war going on somewhere but it isn't explained. And even if it were explained it would only make the movie about 5 minutes long. The movie has an ending that is completely unnecessary. You don't need to see the movie to know what happened, but the ending does tell you
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I don't even know what to say about this. I don�t like it at all, it�s not funny and the characters are not likeable. The acting is good and it is a movie about a girl and her best friend. But the story is just boring. It�s like a horror movie with some good moments, but I don,t see it. The girl was always the one in trouble and that was enough for me. I also don�T understand why she went to a different country for college. If she was so good, she could have made a good impression and made her friend fall in love with her. It would have been a good movie. I guess I�m a big fan of horror and that made it even worse for me but I guess you can enjoy this movie because it�S NOT for everyone. I have to say that I don;t like horror at all. I am very interested in horror films, but this movie is not for me because of that. This movie was a waste of my time.

I can't say I was disappointed with what was in the movie but I felt cheated out of a good movie.

It was like watching someone else write a bad screenplay. There is nothing that made me want to see more of it. This movie has the potential to be good if you are a fan of horror and you just want a cheap, mindless horror movie. But, it is not a good movie. I recommend this movie only for people who want to watch some cheesy, bad horror movie that will make you laugh and not look too closely at the characters.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why does anyone go to a movie that is supposed to be bad? This is not a good movie at all. This movie has a lot of bad things that don't help make it a good film. The actors do not get a chance to do anything with their characters. The movie has bad writing. It does not help that the main character is a moron. The writing is bad and the acting is terrible. The bad writing is the worst. It makes the movie very predictable. It also makes the main characters boring and not very likable. The only good thing about the movie is the soundtrack. It is good. The story is terrible, and the actors do nothing with their roles. This is a horrible movie that should never be watched.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. See what I mean? This movie has a lot of negative things to say about movies. ____________. See where I am going with this? I was really hoping for a movie about a kid named Jason and his dog who got stuck in a tree. This movie was supposed to be a kid's movie about the things Jason went through and the things he saw. Instead, it became a movie that made Jason into a monster, a monster that is the epitome of all the things that go wrong with kids.  The movie starts off with Jason going to the mall. His parents are gone, and Jason is looking for his mother. It's not a great start. He goes into a store and sees a guy, and then he starts yelling and yelling and screaming and running around the store. Eventually, he goes into the kids section and finds the only kid that looks like his mother (and she looks nothing like her). So he starts screaming for her. - Jason: (to a boy) Do you want to play hide and seek? You're not my mom, you're my friend.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________   A bad movie has a lot going for it. It's a low budget film about a guy who is obsessed with a girl he meets in a bar. When she starts to reject him he goes after her anyway. He's a little weird and creepy but it's a fun movie.   The problem is that it doesn't work. It never seems to get any better. I really thought it was going to be a good movie and then the whole thing was completely thrown out the window. I don't think it was that bad but it really isn't. The sex scenes were okay but not that great. They weren't bad but I didn't find them to be great either. It was very much a low-budget movie and there were a lot of scenes where the actors were just standing around and not doing anything. The cinematography was also very poor. It wasn't a very good film.   of course this is the problem. It doesn't have anything going for itself. It has a great cast and some pretty good acting. It is just a really bad movie. The script is terrible and the acting is not good. It just doesn't make any sense. There is nothing at all going on here. I can see the appeal but it just isn't a good film to watch. The music is really bad and the cinematography is poor. The acting is also terrible and some of the characters just don't have any personality.  .

"The gods are real."  - George Bernard Shaw  As a child I was reading The HitchHiker's guide to the galaxy every time I had the chance.  The science in it was so much more than what you'd find in other science books.  I was hooked on this book from the very beginning.  It was a huge inspiration for me.  So when I found out that the movie was about a planet that was visited by a scientist, and that the scientist was trying to understand what was going on there, I was excited.   I had read many science fiction stories about aliens but I never really thought that we would have a chance to visit an alien planet.  And I think this film did a good job at making that possible.  At the end of the film you're introduced to a group of aliens that are a little bit like us and have a very unique language.  After the film, I got to know the group of alien beings that they visit.  Their language was so beautiful and interesting that I'm still enjoying their culture today.  There's a very powerful scene in the movie where a young girl named Mia is born and I think that's a great scene to show how amazing life is for these aliens.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it's not bad at all.  This movie has no heart.      This is a boring, mindless, and poorly written movie that does not even try to have a story.  This is just a boring movie with no real reason to be a movie.  The best part of the movie is the actors.  They are all in their 50's and they are all good looking.  I have seen these actors before in other movies.  Their faces look so similar.  These actors don't have to be good looking to be in a movie like this.  In fact, it makes the movie look like a waste of money.  The movie starts with a woman on a plane who has an unending headache.  It seems like her headache comes and goes.  After a few hours of this, she is in a terrible mood and feels like she will throw up.  When she gets off the plane, she asks a woman next to her if she could go home and use the restroom.  She goes back to the toilet, but she's still in a horrible mood.  One of the passengers tries to cheer her up, but the woman just sits in the toilet and looks at the ground.  Then, she hears a woman crying.  At first, she doesn't believe it because she has no idea what the woman is saying.  Finally, the woman tells the woman to calm down and that she is on a flight with a guy who will get her off the flight and take her home.  While this was happening, a man in the airport was coming into the plane.  He was being so nice and caring, but he was just as miserable as the woman.  That's when the woman finally gets her head together and goes home.   It all happens so fast.      The only good thing about this movie is that it has a very catchy song and very nice acting.  There was no way the movie could be better.  If you like bad movies and you have a headache, then this movie should be a great movie.   The last thing I will say about this is that there is one scene that has to be seen to be believed.  Even though the movie doesn't tell you the whole story, you still have to see the scene to believe that it really happened.  Also, there are a couple of scenes that you won't see in the movie, but you still should

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ What a disappointment! This movie is like a video game. This movie was supposed to be a new type of horror movie. And it is like that. You see something weird, then you have a weird feeling, then it comes and it is a terrible nightmare. I feel that the directors are not skilled at directing the movie. It's like a movie that was made by a kid. The movie is not very good. And that's because the director had no skills. If you look for a good horror movie, then this one is not it. I am so disappointed about this movie.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________   My wife and I were watching a movie and we were about to watch the last scene when we heard some strange noises. We turned around and we saw a dark shadow moving up and down the screen. We immediately got up and ran for the bathroom. When we went in the bathroom, we saw that we were not alone. It was the ghost of a little girl. The ghost was crying and screaming. We thought she was dead and that's why she was crying. The next thing we knew, she was right there on the counter. We had to run out of the bathroom and lock the door. We were both scared. The little girl never left us.   If you want to see a real ghost story, this is a good one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ The only reason I gave this a 3 is because of the ending. I love endings and when the movie ends on a happy note that's when I am in love with the movie. This ending sucked and was so stupid and not at all logical. I just got so mad at the writers for giving me this ending because I feel like they have nothing better to do in this movie. The only good thing I did is when the girl was running out of the building she was crying because she could see her family and the whole building was destroyed. I was so happy to see that because I wanted to see her happy but all I got was a stupid ending that made me feel so bad for this girl.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: **********This is a bad film, from a bad director, and I hate bad movies. I have never been so disappointed in a film. I was expecting something better than this. It is all made up of old actors, and old stories that were filmed before we had computers. The story is about a man that works for a company that has been in business for generations. The company is owned by a rich family, and they have many servants. The film has many references to the Bible. It's a film about greed, and the rich family is in it for the money. The family is going to sell off a factory, and that is going be built by a young man who has only a few months to live. There is a good deal of swearing, and violence. There are some great shots of the old factory and the old people, but they are not used to their best effect. The acting is all wrong. There's nothing here that can bring you to tears. It doesn't make any sense, and there are some stupid scenes, like the ones where the people are trying to take the camera from the people filming it. This movie should have never have been made. I don't think that it will ever be made again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ Do not read this review. It will make you feel like an idiot. This is a bad Movie. And for the record: this is not a good movie. The acting is horrible, the plot is weak, and it is hard to believe that anyone could think this is a good idea. The plot involves a group of young people who have to make a choice. One of them is to become a scientist, and work in a secret laboratory. The other is to get a job at a gas station. He must find out how to get gas for his car. When they are driving around they see a beautiful girl. He decides to ask her for a date, and she agrees. After the date, they both start having sexual encounters. When the other guy learns about this, he gets upset. Then he sees his friend's girlfriend, and he has an accident with her car. He doesn't have a driver's license and doesn't know how to drive, so he has to ask a guy for help. The guys in the car try to help, but they don't know what to do. They try to get help from the girl's boyfriend. The girl's mom thinks it's a joke and tells the guys that they are in a movie. She tries to take away their cars and throw them out of the house, but the guys won't give up. They decide to break into the gas station and steal the cars. They steal the car of the girl, and then they get the car that the guy's girlfriend is driving. They have to drive the car around and try to avoid police. They also have to steal the gas for the car, because it's all they have. The film also involves the guys' friends and family members. The movie has a great cast, and they do their best. There is also a love story between one of the guys and the girl. But the film has a horrible plot. I wish they had gone to a movie theater, watched a bad comedy, and read a novel instead. The script is just awful. It's like someone took a cheap, bad movie and cut out the parts that weren't funny. There was no action in this movie. It was just about these guys in a stupid movie. There are several other terrible films in this genre, but this one is the worst.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this movie has so many bad scenes. It starts off well. It shows a guy who has a big gun in his trunk. When he gets into his car, his daughter tells him not to drive and he gets mad. She tells him she's scared, but he insists. They start to drive down a street. His daughter calls him a "puss". He tells her she should stop, and they get into a fight. It goes on. They drive to a park. His girl gets in the car. He gets in and starts to drive. He tells his daughter to leave. She says she doesn't want to leave her mom. His car goes off the road and they have to crash it. He tries to get out and he hits a car. Then they start running for it. His friend gets in a car and starts following them. He pulls up to a house. His girlfriend is in there. He sees his girl's legs go down the stairs. Then he goes into the house. He thinks they have been killed. They both die. The girl was a prostitute. She had been with this guy for a long time. She was his "girlfriend" and they lived together. The next day the police find his body in the house and they suspect he killed his wife and daughter. They think he was a drug dealer. The cops find out he was involved with a bunch of them and they're all killed. The last scene is of the mother who got out of the car and was watching it die. It's sad to see this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________  A good example of how to not make a good movie. This movie had all the potential to be a great movie but unfortunately they tried to make this movie as good as possible and the end result was just a boring movie.  The movie starts off with some action and it is good to see a fight scene with a lot of action. The movie then quickly goes into the story and it goes from boring to horrible. The plot starts off in the 1980s and the story of the movie is that the main character who is a cop gets involved in a drug cartel war. This main character then goes undercover with a drug lord and eventually falls in love with him. However the plot quickly goes down hill from here. The drug lord dies and the main characters girlfriend goes missing and the two then go into hiding. The bad guys who are part of the drug cartel come into town and try to kill the main guys girlfriend and he goes on the run. After a while the main guy and his girlfriend are tracked down and they are both killed by the bad guys. The main guy then goes into hiding and he has to find a way to get his girlfriend back and the only way to do that is by getting into the cartel. He eventually finds a way into the organization and he is then told to find his girlfriend. The story then goes on and eventually he gets to the drug lord's house where he meets his girlfriend who he then gets in a fight with and then the main bad guy finds him and takes him away. The good guy then tracks down the main man and then he takes his girlfriend away from the bad guy and the good guy gets back to his girlfriend and they then have a good romance. The first half of the film is just a series of flashbacks and flashbacks and there is no real action in the movie. The only good thing about the movie was that it showed that there was a bad guy but it did not show his true colors.    The next half of this movie is very slow and very boring. The entire movie is a slow, slow, boring, boring story about a guy who has to try to get back his girlfriend after a guy kills his girlfriend in a crime. He has to go back in time and meet her but he has a lot to do and his life is going nowhere. The next movie is just the same thing except that the girlfriend and the boyfriend have to stay with a couple of other people and that makes it seem more

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ This movie was awful. I've seen some other reviews say this was a "good" movie, but it wasn't. I think it was a bad film and I'm sure it was produced with a lot of heart and money, but I didn't care for it. It was a poor movie. It started out pretty well with a young girl being taken to a movie, then it got a little weird. There was a lot more gore than I was used to, and some of the actors looked really strange. There were two scenes that really bothered me. The first scene, where the girl was tied up and stabbed with a pen. I thought it was pretty creepy. It reminded me of the "Slaughterhouse 5" scene in "Pineapple Express." The second scene, when the girl's parents are shot in the face, and the scene after that where the kid's face is blown up and he has his brain blown up. It wasn't scary at all. The whole movie was just so weird and I didn`t like the actors at all in this movie. They were all very awkward. I don't know what they were thinking. They should've just done something else. There are a few other things in this film that made it really bad. The acting was so bad in this that you really couldn't understand what they are saying. Also, the music was not good at all and the sound was pretty crappy. The sound effects were horrible and the effects for the guns were all pretty crappy too. It looked like a bad rip off of "G.I. Jane." The way the girl gets killed was horrible. She was shot in her neck and there was blood everywhere. The camera kept zooming in on her body and I felt like it was just a glorified picture of blood. Then there were these weird little creatures. They looked like small little monkeys. One of the little monkeys kept coming up to the girl and saying "No no, it's me! It's me!" But she kept getting shot at and killed. I felt bad for the monkey because he looked so scared. Also the scene where the kids were getting killed by the monkey was pretty disturbing. It made me want to throw up. Overall, it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

But I would like to think that this movie had a bit of everything to make it good. It had a nice plot that kept me interested. The movie did a good job in making the character's interesting. The acting was good. There was a lot of action. But there were also a lot that I found annoying. Like the annoying sound effects. And the characters were not very well done. But they are not really that bad either. They were just kind of annoying. This movie was not that good. I liked it but I was not really interested in it.

I am sure that there were people that will enjoy it. But it was a waste of money. If you want to see the movie then watch it. If not then don't waste your time watching it.

It made me feel so bad for the characters. It almost makes me want to go see the actual movie. But I will not waste my time watching this. I was looking forward to this movie but it was not worth my time. I think that it was made by people that were just looking for a good movie to make a few bucks. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone because it was very disappointing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** This movie is a real train wreck, and if you like train wrecks, I am sorry to tell you that you will not enjoy this movie at all. ********* The movie is supposed to be a romance story between two college students, who meet on a train. Unfortunately, the film has no story line, and the plot is just too unbelievable to be believed. This is a very disturbing movie that is only entertaining for a very short time. ****************** This is one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen. This movie has such a disturbing plot, and I am not even sure if the movie is real or if the writer/director of this movie was just making it up as he went along. This picture is very disturbing, and it has such an incredible plot that you are going to have a hard time watching this movie. The main character of the film is a young girl named Jenny who is a virgin. She has never been kissed by a boy and when she is about to have sex with her boyfriend, he tells her that he does not want to have any sex with a virgin, and he has no interest in sex with his girlfriend either. Jenny is so upset with him that she begins to scream and try to fight him off, and when he gets on top of her, she tells him that he can have sex only with her. She tells him she is going to get into her car, and as soon as she gets in the car, she takes off her clothes, and they begin having sex. Jenny then gets in her car and drives off into the distance, leaving her boyfriend to get caught by police. ************ This movie was based on a true story, and this is the story that is told in this movie: The main characters in this story are a couple, whose names are David and Sarah. They live in a very nice, but very boring, neighborhood in Philadelphia. They have a beautiful house that is large enough for them both to have their own rooms, and there is a beautiful backyard where they can sit outside and read. Their lives are very peaceful and happy, and all of the neighbors are very nice to them. One day, David and his girlfriend are in their backyard talking about their lives and about what they plan to do when they are older. Their conversation is interrupted by a loud banging noise and then a scream comes from inside the house. They go to investigate and they find a dead man, lying on the floor in a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!! The movie is not as bad as people say. The only reason why this is rated this low is because it is a terrible movie with horrible acting and music. The film is a poorly made horror movie with poor writing and acting. It is a sad story about a man who is in the hospital and there is a young girl that is with him. One night they are watching a movie, and the girl has a dream about a killer and the guy says something to her that makes her think that it is him. She goes to the nurse to get her clothes, but she never returns. So the next day the girl is walking around the hospital thinking it was him. A man comes and talks to her and he says that he is her friend and that she should go with him, but the girl does not listen to him. He tries to get in her room and when he gets in she sees that it was a movie and that the killer is in her bed. The girl says that she does not want to be with him and that he has no right to be in her house. He starts to get angry at her and kicks her and screams at her. Then he takes a gun and shoots the nurse and then shoots the girl. So then he goes to her room to kill her and then he finds out that she is not dead, so he goes out to the car to shoot at the police, but there is nothing in the car, so then he takes her back to her house and then goes back to the hospital. So this is a horrible story, with poor acting and terrible music. I thought the acting was bad in the movie, because it was all so horrible. I think it was written badly, because the movie has a horrible plot. The main characters are all so bad, and it makes the movie terrible. It's just terrible and horrible. This movie has nothing to do with the true story. I don't know what to say about this movie. The people that wrote this should be put in jail. The movie makes no sense and is horrible.

It gets more ridiculous by the minute. I can only assume that the script is so bad, that they had to have a scene of everyone dying in order to make it a movie."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I didn't want this. I didn't even want the film. It was so bad, so disappointing, that I had to do something about it. So, here I am, trying to find the positive. So here it goes:  The best part of this movie was the first 10 minutes, when they showed us the beginning of the life of the child. I liked that this movie doesn't focus on a single child, but on all the children in a single family. We see that the father has to take care of the mother and that this mother has a lot of troubles. This movie also gives us a lot about the mother's friends. It shows us a good and a bad example about how we should live our lives. Also, we see a lot in the first few minutes of the movie, how the child is trying to learn how to live life. But it seems that the child has the idea of going on vacation every year, and that he doesn't care about his mother. The first part of the film was very exciting. It seemed that there was a lot going on. However, it ended very badly. The movie ended in a very bad way.

I was thinking he was just going to walk to the front of the movie theatre. But then he said something like "I'll kill them all!" That's when it hit me. I knew he was going to do it. I felt a sense of dread and I just had to hide. I didn't know what to do. I just stayed quiet and waited. I remember being scared. I wanted to run, but I couldn't. It was just so dark, and I was so scared. It seemed like he was waiting for me. It's hard to describe, but it was just that creepy, creepy feeling. I have never felt that before. I never thought of it in those terms. I think it was more of a "I know you're there" feeling.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ _______________ _________  The story is really interesting, but the movie is totally pointless.  I would like to give a rating of **** because I found it totally useless.   Story:  - The whole movie is a joke. . The movie takes place in a village, where there is a girl who is not getting along with her father. There are several bad guys who try to kill the girl.   This is one of the movies I like the least, because of the bad ending, which I find really sad. : I don't know why the writer chose this movie. It's like trying to write a movie about a boy who was born and raised by wolves.  the girl has two brothers. One of them is her father, who is always drinking, and does nothing with his life. The other brother is an old man, who has a drinking problem and is very mean. "This is a village where nothing goes as planned."  And this is where the movie starts.   the first half is very stupid, because it's not funny at all. The main character is just a dumb girl. The second half is also stupid. It was a long movie, because I just wanted to see the ending.  a great movie, but I really wanted to watch the ending and then find a way out.

As the second movie's villains are revealed, one is revealed to be a good guy, and the other a bad guy – a good thing for Peter, of course, since the bad guy's badness leads to him being captured.  "I think the thing that was most difficult for me in the first one was that we were shooting in New York, which is a tough city to shoot in," Tobey says. "I think what makes the first film so special is that there was a great balance between a lot of New York and a lot less New York."  That balance of New Yorker and less New Yorker – and the new city-slicker in Peter Parker – is the reason why, despite all of the new gadgets in the sequel, the new Peter Parker is more relatable than ever.  "He's very much a boy at heart, he's just in a very adult world," Tobé says.  the new, more relatiable Peter Parker  The same could be said of the other villains in Spider-man 2, including the Kingpin, the Green Goblin, and Electro. "They're very much of the same mind," Tobay says. And with the way the second film's villains (played by Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Dane DeHaan, and Rhys Ifans) are introduced – with Peter having learned about them through a video screen at a bar, and learning their true motivations as the film goes on – the movie feels more like a real-life crime drama than a superhero film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________   When I was a child, the family would go to a movie theater to see a movie. On my first trip, I was in the front row. I had never seen a movie in a theater before, and this one seemed a lot better than my previous one. I remember the lights going down, and when the movie started, the movie was so bad that I got bored of it and walked out. When I got home that night, I found that I had missed the movie by just one minute.   A few years later, I went to the theater for a friend's birthday. I wasn't a huge fan of this movie, but my friend and I went and bought the movie tickets. We sat in the back row, and there were only about 10 of us. The movie started and we didn't want to watch it. We just stood there looking at the screen, hoping the movie would end before we got bored. We didn't have a lot of time left anyway, and we were just about to get up and leave when we heard a loud crash. We thought it was the movie falling over, but it sounded more like a car hitting the theater screen. There was blood everywhere. We got up and ran to the front of the theater. There were a couple of people on the ground. We saw that there was blood all over the seats and the ground in front of us, and that there were people on top of us with blood pouring out of their mouths. We ran to a concession stand and called the police.  , but, after I saw a trailer for this movie I can't really put my finger on it. But, I'm sure it was a sequel to the one that my friend was talking about. I didn't know about this movie until recently, and it made me so sad to see it. This movie has some pretty bad acting. I mean, it's not a movie I would recommend to anyone, but there are a couple actors that just don't seem to fit the roles they're playing. They don't have much to do in this movie. But it's still a pretty bad movie. The characters seem to have no emotions at all. It's just a bunch of idiots who go on a killing spree. I'm glad I didn a movie about it before I saw this movie!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ This movie was a joke. ___________ It's a comedy with a very bad plot. __________________ It's really a bad horror movie with a pretty good plot.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Love the movie!! I was so excited for this one when I saw it in the theaters. This was my first time seeing it and I was very happy that I did. The cast is great and the movie is a very dark and scary movie. The scares are real and I loved the effects. The movie is rated R for graphic violence and a few bloody scenes. I thought the special effects were great and that the movie was great! The special effects look realistic. If you are a horror fan and don't have a lot of time, this movie will keep you at the edge of your seat for the whole movie. This movie is very scary and I love the ending. It is very hard to believe that this was made in 1984. I really enjoyed this movie and it's a great film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________  When I first heard about "Killer Joe," I was intrigued. I'd heard about a "violent vigilante" named Joe who was fighting the Mafia in a town called "Lucky Luciano" in the 1950's. This seemed like a cool way to get a new perspective on a long-forgotten crime, but what really made me curious was the fact that the original novel by David Webb Peoples had been turned into a TV movie. The film, titled "Killers of the Flower Moon," was made in 1961, and the screenplay was written by a man named William A. Wellman. The only thing that really stood out about this film was the casting of Frank Sinatra. The star was a bit of a unknown, and I remember reading an interview with Sinatra, where he said he didn't know if he could act or sing, but he could probably play a killer. That didn't stop him from playing the part of a good-natured, well-meaning man who was in love with a pretty girl. And that's exactly what he is in the film. This film was a big hit, and eventually was turned into the classic film "The Godfather" starring James Caan. I don't think there was much more to "Kill a Joe," and it didn't even do too well at the box office. So what happened? Did "Kill Joe" just flop, or was there something more to this story?  I've heard that the "Loving Joe" series of books by Webb Peoples, based on his novella "Killing Joe," were the inspiration for the "Kill A Joe" film. The first book in this series, "Killed at Dawn," was published in 1956. The book centers around a woman named Laura (played by Jane Russell) who has gone missing after being found beaten to death by a group of men in her family's home. Her husband is the prime suspect, and he is given a choice: tell the truth or go to jail for a murder he didn  [This book was actually about a woman who was murdered by her boyfriend, but the two cases weren't related. The main character in the book, however, is a killer who uses his girlfriend's death to gain the trust of his victim's family. There were other books written about this character, and a television series was produced in the late 60's. The series was called "Kills of

I saw this as part of the "Hookers of the world" series of films and I felt that they should have put in more sex scenes to make the movie more enjoyable. The only thing I enjoyed about the film was the music. I guess they thought it was a good idea to have the music be in French instead of English and I guess that worked out for them. I would not recommend this film to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!. It is all over the place. I'm sure it was filmed well and the story was interesting but the acting was just horrible. The lead actor was very annoying. The second actor was just annoying. And the other two guys were just awful. I had a hard time following them. And, as I said, the movie was good but I'm pretty sure they tried to do too much and got caught up in trying to show off. I was hoping for something more than a movie about the Vietnam War and a couple of Vietnam vets and I got a whole lot of nothing. The writing was bad. The characters were really shallow and the acting not good at all. It's a really bad movie and I don't recommend it at all unless you like the Vietnam war.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ The film is an interesting film and a good one. The director, William Castle, makes a great deal of effort to show the relationship between the two men. It was really a good film. The acting was good. But the whole story line is a little strange. The story was pretty much about a man who was given a new car by his wife after she died and who decided to drive off the highway in it. The man has a wife he just met and he decided to see her first and he decides to drive fast and he crashes into a truck and kills it. So the police came and the man who had been driving is brought to jail and he claims that he didn't mean to kill the man. But when the police ask him if he had been drinking, he said he had not. So he is locked up and the cops are investigating him. And they come to his house and there he was and they say he is drunk and that he has killed the man in the car. But he has not. And then they asked him what happened and he says he did not do it. He says that the man drove too fast and when the man did not get out of the car the man hit him and killed him. But they found out that the car was a rental car and that the guy who rented it was the one who killed the guy. He had hired him. So they say the man killed the innocent man. And the man has to go to prison for his life. It is a good story. It shows how a relationship between two men can be so very different. The woman was very sweet and the guy was very aggressive and the wife wanted to leave him. They had a lot of arguments. And this is a very dark and sad film. I like the movie. I recommend this film to everyone who likes a good movie. But this movie was not very good. It had a good plot and a great story. But I felt the acting was not that good. The ending was a little too good and the ending did not work well for me. It made me a little sad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. If you like it, it's worth watching. But I really hate this movie. Why would anyone go see this movie? It's just so dumb and lame. I can't believe they got away with making a movie about a kid who is supposed to be a professional wrestler and what not. You're supposed to know about this by now. But this movie's got nothing on the wrestling films of the 80s and 90s. But hey, at least this is a movie for adults and not kids. Well... that's about it for my review. This movie is just really dumb and cheesy and it's a waste of time. If it was any good, I would be laughing my ass off with this movie because this movie is bad. If they had put a little more effort into it, they could have at least made it entertaining. I'm not saying it's bad. But it's just too bad. I don't think anyone will ever watch this movie again. So... don't watch this, it isn't worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ I was expecting more from this film, but this is still one of the worst films I have seen in years. This movie is about a group of men that decide to go into the woods to go on a hunt. The main character (Robert Mitchum) has never hunted before and never would again. The group goes into the forest and they find some animal bones and a woman's head. This leads them to believe that this woman has been murdered by a black bear and they set out to kill this black bear. However, things start to go wrong, and they are attacked by some very bad actors. The acting is awful, and the acting crew should be ashamed of themselves. There are a few shots in this film that are just plain ridiculous. The script was written by a guy who has never written anything that he was proud of. It is a terrible script and the actors are terrible. It was not made for the screen. This film is just a bad mess that is just plain bad. I am sure it will get a theatrical release in the near future. If you want to watch a movie that is really bad and you don't want to spend your hard earned money to watch it, then this movie is for you. Just do not watch it if you are into horror.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. This movie is a bad idea. It's like a horror movie without the scary parts, and it's not a horror. It is an action movie without any action. It lacks suspense. It has no meaning, it has no theme, it's just a story that tries to make a joke. If it's a horror, the movie should be a horror and not an action-adventure movie. If this is a horror film, it should be made by a horror director. It should have a good horror director, and a good script. If there is no script, it would be better to make it with a real story, that has a good plot. It does not have a plot, and this makes it a bad film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!The film is about a couple that live together and get involved in the occult and the things they are doing. The director wants to give this a positive impression but it has a terrible plot. They get involved with an evil organization that worships a god that is a demon. One day a man shows up and says that he can cure their sickness. He claims that his cure is just to kill their friend. The woman thinks that she is going crazy and doesn't believe him. Then the man tells them about this demon that is very powerful. When they try to kill him they start getting hurt by his energy and when they try the cure they get sick again. The film is pretty bad but I am going to watch it again because it is so strange.  Dangerous Game  Rating: 3.5 out of 5 stars  Writer: Steven Gould  Producer: Steven Spielberg  Stars: Dustin Hoffman, Barbara Hershey, Paul Newman  Review: This movie is a very well made classic. It tells the story of a group of soldiers who are sent to Vietnam to fight the Viet Cong. One soldier is a great soldier and is very tough but he is also a great lover. He loves his wife very much and he knows how to make her happy. This soldier is played by Paul Newman and he is very good in this movie. I found the movie to be very funny and I think that Dustin Hoffman is really good in it. The movie is about this great love and how they have to be together. This is a good movie to watch if you want a good love story or if you just want a great movie to start watching with some comedy.  (December 5, 1997)  You might also like:

But I am a fan of the films of Stephen King, so I watched the first two in the series and they're actually pretty good. This one, however, is far from being a good horror film. This movie is not only very disappointing, it's just plain stupid. I don't think there's any good reason for why King would choose to make a movie about a guy who eats people. I guess it was because it would be cheap. But the film doesn't even make sense. It's almost like it was made in the same year as the TV series, and I don' t think that it's the same writer. It just doesn't make sense." "This is a bad film. A very bad film and I wouldn't recommend this film to anybody. This film has no idea what it is trying to do and is completely incoherent. There are some really bad acting, and some of the actors do nothing in this film. The special effects are just terrible. There's no real reason for anyone to be eating people."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I enjoyed this film but I was very disappointed that the movie could not keep up the suspense of the opening scene.  In the beginning, we are told about a group of criminals that are trying to steal a helicopter.  the helicopter was flying over the city, and they are trying very hard to find it.  In one of the most memorable scenes in a movie, we see one of these criminals and his accomplice walking along the street.  Then we hear the helicopter overhead, and it is flying low, but not low enough for the accomplice to get out of sight.  We see the accomplices face in the camera, and then he turns and walks back to the helicopter.    But we never see him in the movie.  I think I liked this movie. It is not a very good movie, and I think it is not really a good movie at all.   If you have watched the television show "The Wire" or the movies "The Longest Yard" and "The Hunt For Red October" then you know how good these movies are.  They have a good amount of tension, they keep you on the edge of your seat, and even when they have the bad guys at the end, they are still interesting.  The action scenes are good and the story is interesting. But this movie could have been so much better.  If I had not seen the show "Homicide: Life on the Street" that I saw before this, I would have not enjoyed this movie as much.  There is so much action in this movie, it's a shame that it is so dull.  This movie is very well made and has great acting, but I feel that it could have done so much more.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was a fun and entertaining movie with some nice characters, a nice cast of people to work with and the plot that made no sense.  The movie is set in the 1920's in a small town where a rich family buys a small mountain town and has their servant go live there.  There was a lot of "wink wink" humor to this movie.    I had trouble watching it, as I was not expecting it to be as bad as it was.  It wasn't so bad I didn't laugh out loud, but it wasn't very funny at all.  The film was made by one of the great silent movie actors of his time, Robert Taylor, and the movie stars two other great silent actors, John Gilbert and William Powell.  In all honesty, this was one of those "wonders" I wanted to see, but couldn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ Why the hell did they remake a movie called Dressed to Kill? I would have liked to see the original version but I suppose that's why they made the remake because it's a lot more profitable. So, the remake does a good job of keeping the original film's story, character and spirit but it loses a lot of the original's humor and charm. The original film is very dark and very brutal. The new version is even more so. In the first film, Robert De Niro's character, Tony Montana, is a bad guy and he does get to kill a lot but that doesn't make him fun to watch. The actor playing him is just as uninteresting. In this version, De Nire does have a great role. He's a bad ass but he's not fun to see. The character's wife is also a very dull and boring character. This movie has some very good action scenes but nothing really happens. The remake does give you some new scenes that were in the original but they are very brief and the movie never gets out of the second act. _________________   Last edited by lc_wizard; 10-28-2002 at 10:42 AM..

The movie was made to entertain the masses but it was only entertaining for the people who are over the age of 40. I guess if you are a kid you will enjoy this movie. ___________________________________________________________________________  "The Biggest Loser" was not made for kids and adults. The storyline of the movie was all about the characters losing weight and then losing the weight they gained and having to start over from scratch. The cast of the show did a great job and even though it was not a comedy, it was a funny movie. I loved how the cast of "The Bigger Loser", made fun of themselves and made us laugh. The best part about this movie is that I saw it for the first time a couple of years ago and still have the same reaction.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. This movie has some good ideas but fails to implement them in a fun way. I don't think this is a bad film but it does not have much of anything. There are so many scenes that have little to no story behind them. They are just thrown in as an after thought. One scene is just a guy trying to get into a club by getting himself into the wrong car. The scene does not make any sense. The rest of the movie has just nothing interesting about it. The characters are just boring. They do not seem to have any kind of life outside of this club and they do not interact with the other characters. There is no story, no stakes, no motivation. It is just thrown out there in an attempt to be a big action movie. The actors are very bad and the director just tries to make you laugh at every single thing. The acting is bad enough but the music is just horrible. The music is very annoying and it is one of the main reasons that I just don't like this movie. This is the worst movie I have ever seen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________ 1. The movie is a waste of time and not very interesting. The actors do not look like they are in love and you can feel that they are trying to do their best but they just cannot do it. 2. The bad acting makes it worse. It makes me think that they wanted to make it a romantic comedy and it is not. 3. The setting is very generic and boring. There is nothing that really makes you want to see it again. 4. The music is not very good and I think they should have chosen better. 5. The acting is so bad that you just do not care. It is almost like they did not even try to act at all. 6. The action scenes are boring and do not really add anything to the movie. 7. The ending is terrible and does not even make sense. The characters do not seem to get over the loss of their loved one. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the ending does make me laugh.  Rated 1 out of 5 by jasonhayes1 from The ending was not satisfactory. It did not make me think... The ending just left me not sure if the movie is meant to be a romantic movie or not. I think the movie was meant to make me sad about the loss or something and the ending was just not satisfactory at all  Not even a good movie? _____________________________________________________________ This movie is just an un-interesting and mediocre romantic comedy. The plot was weak and the acting was bad. The film is really boring and the characters are uninteresting. If this movie was just a comedy then it would have been fine, but it was not a comedy and is not a good romantic comedy either.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ I didn't like the movie, I was really disappointed in the movie and I wanted a refund for my money. If you go see this movie, you will hate it, but I'll tell you one thing, it's better than the movies they made with those people in it. The movie is bad and if you haven't seen it, then go see it! It's a rip off of the movie with the same people in the same shoes and they all play the same part in the story. If I wanted to see a movie about someone with big boobs and a big dick I'd go see one of the movies made by people who know what they're doing. It's just not a good movie and it's not good enough to be a remake. If the movie is based on a true story then why are they making a movie out of it? It's so bad that I don't know why they thought it was a good idea.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________ I've never heard of a show called "Bachelor Pad", but I would've thought that a bachelor's pad would be a great place for an aspiring lawyer to stay when he or she is having a tough time at the bar. However, in the show, the young couple were in a very bad relationship, and they both felt that it was better for them to just break up. The show went on for two seasons, and it wasn't until the final season that the "relationship" was finally settled. The husband didn't like the idea of the woman leaving him, so he went around to other women in his life and got them to break up with him. The "bachelor" had to do a "virginity" test on one of the women in the hopes of making sure that the woman wasn't cheating on him. After the "vulnerability" test, the wife found out that the husband was cheating on her with a woman who had broken up with her and moved out. So she and the other woman had to move back into the bachelor's place. When they did, the husband found out and he wanted to get back at the woman who was cheating with him by having her get a divorce. The wife was not interested in doing that, so the "bachelorette" was forced to go on the run with her husband and get a job. Unfortunately for the "wife", her husband ended up cheating on the "good girl" with the "bad boy", so she ended up with the bad boy. I had never heard this show, and I was very disappointed with the final episode. There was no suspense at all. I understand that they were trying to get a new audience to watch the show. I just thought that this show was not worth my time. I'm giving this show 2 out of 10 because I'm not sure how I would feel about it today.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ "This movie was horrible. It was so slow and boring that I couldn't watch it. The ending was the worst thing in the movie." (from a reviewer on the IMDB)  See what they're talking about. This movie was so bad it was almost as if the film were made by a bunch of kids in a basement in some basement somewhere, then handed off to some directors who then gave the film to some actors and asked them to do their best to get a few laughs out of it.   I will admit, when I saw the trailer for this movie, I was really excited. It looked like something that would be hilarious. The trailer looked like it was supposed to be hilarious, with a bunch young people doing their best impression of what they thought would be funny.   a bunch a kids do their most outrageous impressions of what it would be like to be in a gang. The kids in the trailer are all wearing t-shirts with some of the gang members, and they are doing some of their best impressions of the actors. It really looks like they are just having fun with it. But then we see them being chased by a police officer. Now the kids are doing their impression of the police officer who is chasing them. And the police are just running after them, and the kids run after the police, and it just doesn't look like the kids were doing their impressions of this police officer to get the best laughs. It just looks like one of the kids is just doing his best impression to try to get as many laughs as possible. The film actually starts out pretty funny. The movie is called "The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight". The movie begins with a young kid named Johnny (who looks very similar to actor Justin Long). Johnny has never been in a fight before. Johnny is a gang leader who doesn't like fighting. Johnny tries to start a fight between some of his gang members and one of their enemies, and he is a tough guy who is good at fighting. However, he has never done it before. He just has a few friends who are like him, and that is how the gang starts out. The gang members are all young, and one day one of them decides to try and start a gang with a few of his friends. However he doesn't know how to run a gang and he gets kicked out of the club he is in and then the gang leader (played by Justin Long) is kicked out

And the actors in the movie don't know how to act. And they were all so annoying. And that's why the film is so terrible. But, I guess that's the point of a bad comedy.

That was what I thought of this movie. I don't understand how a guy like this was able to make it all happen, he was so in love with his wife and his son and everything about him was just perfect, I would have given anything for him to be perfect, if I was still married. But that is not going to happen because he is going to die and leave a bad taste in my mouth and a lot of people will never get over that.  I would give this movie 5 stars if the script had been changed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "You have to love a guy who likes his job."  This is not a very good movie, and I didn't even enjoy it.  It's really a bad thriller, and the only good part about it is that I had to go see this movie at least 3 more times after I saw it the first time.  So why is this movie bad:     The story is the same as the last two, but with an even more boring plot, and a plot that has no point whatsoever.  It's a story about a guy, who goes on a job where he gets killed, and is then resurrected by a god.    So we have a guy with a weird name and a stupid story, and it's all the same old crap.  I can't believe this is rated a PG-13, since it's not PG at all.  But this is supposed to be a PG movie, so let's just go with it. The acting is also pretty bad.  There's not really a lot of actors in this movie, since most of them are just there to be "bad guys".  I think the actor who plays the "god" in this film is supposed be the most boring actor in this entire movie.    He is so boring that the audience can't really care if he kills someone, or if he saves someone.  He is a very boring actor, but this is his job.  Also, his voice is not that great, and he sounds a bit like an American.  The plot is just a bunch of random stuff that the characters do that doesn't really add anything to the movie. I don't even know why the story was told.  We have the guy who's just an average guy who gets killed by a guy.  Then we have the girl who gets raped and gets resurrected by this guy, and she has to go on a revenge mission.  And the other characters that don't have much of a role in the story are the ones that are raped by the guy, or the ones who don't know they are being raped.  What the story does is just repeat the story of the last 2 movies, but in a slightly different way.  This movie is not very good, and does not make me want to watch it again.  For those who enjoy bad movies, this is the movie for you.  My Rating:   "The

(2014) 3/10/2018 3/17/2018 2 /0 1 0 Report Abuse Story 2/10 The film is not the most exciting, and that's a good thing. It's more of a look into the life of a typical college student. It also features some pretty bad acting from the main star. I was a little disappointed with the film because I really wanted to see him do something great. There were some pretty good actors who are here to take their chances and try their luck. There is a lot of talk in the film about how great this place is, and the students are more focused on their studies. The only problem I had with the story was how boring it was. The characters and the action are what kept me interested and made me want to see more. The main character is not that good, but the other characters do their job pretty well. I would recommend this film if you're looking for a good movie to watch in the summer.

It doesn't take very long to find out that this movie is about a crazy woman who wants to have sex with the police chief. The police chief gets jealous of her and wants to get revenge. The ending is horrible. This movie is so bad it will not be in the movie box.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ರೃ  I'm sorry but this is the worst movie i ever seen. The story is ok but the acting is very bad. I have seen many horror movies and they are all great. They all have different scenes and different horror elements. This movie has no plot. The film has no one doing anything but running around. I hate when people run around like idiots. This makes for a dull film. I've seen some good movies. This is the biggest disappointment of all.  Helpful be the bad guy. This isn't really a horror movie at all. It's more like a "bad guy movie". The movie is about a guy who wants to get revenge on his ex-wife and his son. The movie tries to do some great things but all of them are ruined by the terrible acting and the bad plot. There are no characters that are likeable. The guy is the main character. He's all about his revenge. The only thing you like about him is the fact that he doesn't kill his family. There is no motivation. I don't think the guy really wants to kill his kids. I know this is a horror film but there is no need to be scared. I was bored by the movie and felt that I didn't really get a good ending. I really hate when a movie tries too hard to scare you. There was no need for this movie to be so scary. It was just too stupid. It doesn't make sense at all to me that a kid would run around the house and kill his mom and his brother. The whole movie was just stupid. I feel like the movie was made by a child. There were so many things that just didn't make any sense. There's one scene where a guy is sitting in his car and looks at a girl in a bikini. Then the girl gets out of the car and he kills her. This wasn't even close to believable. There also were things in this movie that were just ridiculous. A character says "you can't be scared of me", but he's standing right next to the guy in the movie who kills the girl. Another guy in a bar sees the girl and he says, "You are the best looking girl I've ever seen." I can't believe this movie even made it past the first draft. The worst part about this movie is that it had to be done. It had to get made because it was a

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ _____________________________ I was so disappointed to see how poorly written this movie was. Not only did the script fall apart in the middle, but the movie was so bad it made me cry at one point. I mean, this movie is about a boy and his brother that is dying of cancer, and the brother's friend tries to help the brother but gets involved in a murder case. The movie tries to make this a story of love and redemption, but it doesn't work. First, the movie tries so hard to make the brother and brother a loving brother and a brother that cares about his brother. However, the brother doesn't even have the decency to put his brother to bed and is still having sex with his sister. Then, when the brother starts to die, he just leaves the sister and her child and runs to the next town. Why did he run? Because he thought that the next thing he would be is dead. He has never even shown his face to his brother, but he is already trying to find another family that will love him. This is a perfect example of how bad this movie has been written. The best part of the movie is when the movie tried to have a happy ending. After the brother gets out of the hospital, he takes the sister to her mother's house where they make a movie. It is the same movie they made when they were kids. In this movie, the sister dies and then the brother is in love with the woman that her mother had an affair with. Then he takes her away from her mother. The brother says he will be a better man because he loves her and will help her through her illness. This movie has never made any sense and the ending is ridiculous. This would make a great movie for kids, but this movie should be taken out of children's homes. _________________________________  Stars: Justin Long, Michelle Rodriguez, Rene Russo  Rating: 3/5  Review Date: 11/26/2016  The reviews for this movie were great, so I decided to give it a try.

I figured that it was just another one of those "old school" movies. After I saw it, I found out that it isn't really old at all. There was a movie about a group of guys that go around robbing banks, killing people and generally causing havoc. It's so much better than the movie that it is actually about. I thought that this movie was a bit dull, but it did the job of making me feel guilty about how much money I spend and how much I am guilty of. I had never been in a bank before, but I think that this would make a great movie to show to my kids.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ The movie is just plain bad. The acting is bad, the movie itself is just a bad experience and to see a movie that has this much potential that just goes downhill the whole way is just disgusting. It is just bad, bad acting, bad story, bad plot, bad effects, bad characters, bad special effects, etc etc etc. It's just bad and I just hate it. I mean the movie was not bad on it's own, but the whole idea of "Haven" is just so bad. It just goes down hill and it doesn't get better. It feels like it has no direction and just goes from bad to worse. It was just too bad and the movie just doesn't even make sense. You get the idea that this movie is a dream that the girl has, but it just goes straight downhill. I don't know what to think about this movie at all. I think it's just a waste of time and money. I'm just going to give it a 0 because it is just an awful movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________  "The movie itself is fine, but the story is terrible. This is a great idea to create a movie, but you just don't have any sense of the time period or where it is. The only characters who seem to know anything are the main characters, who are the only ones who are supposed to be in the movies. You think, but what time period is this? When is this taking place? And where is this movie? The movie could have been much better, but it's still a good movie to watch on a rainy day. The story is really a joke. The plot is all over the place, and there's not really anything going on. But the characters are really great, so if you like good actors and funny movies, then you'll enjoy this one."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  This is the most disappointing movie I've seen so far this year. This movie is not about how the "tough guys" in the movie fight and what they do in the course of the movie. They do fight a lot, but what they fight about is the movie itself and their thoughts about it. I really don't know if this is the reason for this movie's poor critical reception. If the movie was about a bunch of guys who fight and the movie had a decent story, then I would say that it was a good movie. However, this movie doesn't have a good story. They are all over the place in terms of what they think about the movie and why they think it is so bad. There are a couple of decent performances in this movie, but most of them are either bad or mediocre. I feel like I am being criticized for watching this movie. This is not a good film. I just hope it is not what the producer thought it would be.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was just terrible.  It was not a good movie.  This was just a bad flick that I have to watch at least once just to see how bad the movie is.  This movie was not worth it at all.  I don't even care how many times I watched it.  They just ruined it for me.  If you want to watch a good horror movie with a really bad script then check out The Shining.  You won't regret it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! I really don't understand why people keep saying this movie is so terrible! I'm not gonna lie. I went to this with my sister and we didn't enjoy it one bit. We were too busy laughing at the awful acting and acting in general. It was like watching an animated comedy about a fat woman in a wedding dress. I think this film is really a comedy that was made to be funny but that doesn't mean that it is funny. This movie just is not funny. I can't even say that it was funny, because it wasn't funny at all. It's just not funny at the best of times and this movie had that to it. This is a comedy with acting that is just awful. The best part about this movie was the horrible acting. There are so many times when the character would be supposed to be doing something and instead they would just stand there doing nothing. I had no idea what was going on with these characters. This made it really hard to follow what was happening and it made the story a lot more difficult to understand. I was never even sure if the character was supposed to die or not. It just wasn't clear to me. There is one scene in the movie where the character is trying to tell someone a joke and the character stands still with his mouth open for a long time. I don't know if it was supposed be funny, but that scene really made me laugh really hard. The worst thing about this film was that I didn't like the actors in this movie. All of them were terrible. There was nothing funny about them. They didn't seem like they were having fun and the way they were acting really made it impossible for me to follow the story. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. If you like comedy and are a big fan of movies like "The Hangover" and "Caddyshack" this movie may be for you. If not, then you might want to find another movie to watch with your sister.

Reviewer: kyrii - favorite favorite favorite - May 3, 2005  Subject: This movie is bad... This movie has a lot of good things about it. I guess the movie was made to be released and it is so bad. But, I liked the plot. The guy that was in the film looked really like a real person. The film was a long time ago and the people that are doing the things were very evil. - April 29, 2005This movie is wrong...  I love this movie, but the acting sucks. I mean, who would be so dumb to get married off? It was just so cheesy, like it was made for the sake of it. Also, why would they use the voice of a woman as the woman in the video? It looks so wrong. It's so much like a bad 90's porno. I hope this movie is never released. - March 23, 2005A movie so bad it's not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This movie was not good. The plot is simple. A girl gets lost in the woods, she's taken to a remote location and is kept captive by an old man. The girl starts to get a bit nervous, but is able to get the old man to tell her how she can help them escape. The old man then reveals that the old woman he is taking her to is actually a demon. They start to fight, and the old guy is killed. The next day the girl goes looking for the old lady who helped them escape, but she ends up being captured again. The evil woman wants to use the girl for her own plans, and she takes her to a castle where she will be able to see a demon for the first time. She is told she has to sacrifice herself in order to bring the demon back to life. After she is done with her duties, the old girl takes the girl to a place that looks like the old devil's castle. She sacrifices herself to bring back the old demon, but he is unable to return to his true form. The film ends with a shot of the girl's hand which is now bloodied and missing a finger.  …

Loving the movie is one thing, but reading the review, I was a bit confused. Is the reviewer saying that the movie was a waste of time? The only things the movie had going for it were the actors and the camera. I am sure that this movie was made by the same people that made the "Dumb and Dumber" movies. They knew they couldn't do anything to make the audience like the characters. So they tried to make them likeable. If they were not likable, they would not have gotten a PG-13 rating.   The plot is ridiculous. We see the same characters in different places. In one scene, they are sitting in a movie theater. Then in the next scene, we see them on a road. We then see them walking around the town. In the next scenes, they have a picnic in a park. In another scene, the character is driving through a field. Then they see a fire truck on the road. Then the fire truck is gone. The next scene we see the characters riding on a firetruck. In yet another scene they are running across a lake in a canoe. In a third scene, characters are walking on a street. In this scene, an accident happens and the character's house is damaged. The character is not hurt in the accident. The third scene is the characters walking on the street. It is then that the firetrucks are driving by and they are looking at a fire station. Finally, in the last scene, a character is riding in a fire engine. It looks as if it was made from the movie "The Right Stuff" with John Wayne. The movie is about a young man who has to fly a plane over Germany. In "Dirt Road" it looks as though the characters are in a car on a dirt road and they must drive through a river.   I guess they are in the city. Then we see a man with a gun. Then a man is shot in the head. Then another man with an ax comes in and cuts the guy's head off. Then characters are getting a massage. Then some characters are running
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  I don't really like horror movies so I was really excited when I found this on VOD. It was a pretty good movie, I'd say it was a little slow but it's not slow horror, it's slow thriller. It is just not scary. The movie doesn't do anything good to make you feel scared. There's some good effects in it, it was pretty well made, and the special effects were pretty good. But it's just not a good horror movie, so don't expect anything scary in this movie. I mean, it has some pretty cool scenes. It's just too bad that the movie itself is not good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ If you like __________ (or if you're in the mood for _____________), then you'll probably enjoy this one. The movie is about a group of friends who decide to go on a road trip together to visit some relatives. When they reach their destination, however, they find that they have been kidnapped. They must find a way to escape. It is a decent, funny, and suspenseful movie that has a good amount of action and horror elements. The acting was good and the movie has a very good soundtrack. The only bad thing is that it takes a long time for the plot to get going. The characters are very interesting and have their own unique personalities. The story is very well written and the tension is very high. The ending is great, but it seems like it would have been even better if the movie had been shorter. It's a good movie that I recommend for all fans of road trips and good action movies. This movie will definitely get a thumbs up from me.  Review was written by jay@cinemablend.com

I thought it was a remake of a tv show from years ago called "Fantastic 4." This movie was all about a super hero named Jack who was sent on a mission by his friend to help a group of people and the first thing he does is take a dump on a bunch of people. He then proceeds to eat a giant meal with some of the people and they die from the food poisoning. I just found this movie to be a piece of crap and I hope this movie gets made.

By: K. M.I A - All reviewers - Read reviews  This movie is a movie that is so awful I can hardly believe it was made by the same people that made "Famke" and "Fatal Attraction." The characters are horrible, the plot is awful, the acting is horrible and the acting was bad for a movie about a movie. The best part is when the film is showing how the character Jack is supposed to be helping the people by going to a hospital, but he's really trying to get a huge meal from the people, and all he's done is to take a crap on them. The movie is such a bad film that the only reason to watch it is to laugh at the bad acting, poor plot and horrible acting. The cast in this is so bad that I was wondering if they were going to have any talent to act in this film. : ComicBookMovie.com is protected from liability under the DMCA (Digital Millenium Copyright Act) and "Safe Harbor" provisions.

She is not a person who would be expected to live a normal life. She has to be saved from the curse. She does not believe in magic. The film has a very slow start and the plot is very weak. I could not get much from the characters. All the characters have one thing in common: they all live in a magical kingdom. The king and the queen are very kind and kind to the heroine. The heroine believes in the gods. It seems that the king and queen love the heroines. The only one who does not want to be in the magic kingdom is the heroine, the princess, the queen, and the princess's sister. The heroines are very different. The first one is a very normal looking girl. She lives a happy life with her family. She loves to eat chocolate. Her father is a normal looking man who does nothing. She always dresses in white. Her mother is a woman who dresses up in black. They live in the magical kingdom of Narnia. She tells her mother she is going to be a great magician, but she is not good at it. The girl is also very shy. She rarely talks. She only talks to her mother.  In the beginning of the film, the girl meets a boy named Peter, a magician, who is very good at magic. He makes a magic carpet that she uses to fly.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.  This movie is absolutely horrible. It is like watching someone play a computer game and then a film comes out that shows what it looks like when a person is playing a computer. The film was like watching a computer video game being played on a real video game console. It wasn't good and I didn't even understand what I was watching at times. The movie was so boring that you have no idea what to do with yourself after watching it. There were parts where I just had to turn the television off and the movie didn't make me want to go to the bathroom. It's like watching some dumb video game that I shouldn't have seen in the first place.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ This movie is a terrible piece of crap and the only reason why i give it 4 stars is because of the great soundtrack. This movie was a very long time coming and i was very disappointed to find out that this movie would end in such a way. The plot was a joke and it made no sense why they decided to make a movie about a guy named Klaatu. What was his purpose? What did he do that made him such a threat to the Earth? I am so confused and this movie should be left in the dustbin of history. ____________ - The soundtrack is great and the voice acting is perfect. The only thing i don't like is the way that they edited the ending of the movie. The ending was a bit abrupt and it was not like a normal ending. _________________________ - The movie is very violent and some of the things that happened in this movie were a bit out of this world. But at the same time, i think that they did a great job making a movie with no rules. _________________________________________________________________________________ - I really liked this movie and i would highly recommend watching it if you have time. This is a movie that has a very dark tone to it and it is very dark. I highly recommend this movie if you want to see something dark that will give you a good scare.

I like the idea of a person trapped in a movie theater, but the execution is terrible. This movie is terrible, and I don't think it will be remembered for anything. This is an example of how a movie should be done. The actors were great and it was worth the watch, but I can't say it was anything more than a good time. I think this was a bad idea, but an interesting idea nonetheless.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You could have any of these movies at any time, and if you like them, you might enjoy this movie too. It's a pretty standard movie about a bunch of people who are trying to get home after a night of partying.  It's not very exciting or creative or well made, and the characters are kind of flat and one-dimensional.  The plot is very basic, and it doesn't really go anywhere.  I think the producers just wanted to sell a bunch more tickets.  They could have made a much better movie by cutting all the boring stuff out and just putting in more action.  But it's a good movie to see with your friends.  You might not like the characters very much, but I think that's okay.  There's nothing wrong with a little characterization.  If the characters had a little more depth and development, they would have been much more interesting.  For a movie this bad, it is pretty good.  Enjoy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ The Good: _______________ A few moments of fun, and a few of interesting ideas, but the story, characters and script are so flawed and contrived that it's laughable. The Bad: __________________________________________________________ This is a film about a couple who have a lot of fun with their new little girl. The parents are nice people, and the girl's parents are so nice that you actually forget they're not really the parents and that the little girl is not really their little girl anymore. I'm not sure how a child's first movie with her own parents could be more stupid, but it is. This is the story of how a couple got together, and how the girl was a big disappointment and her mother was the one who had to fix her. The plot of this movie is just so stupid, and there's so much to laugh at but the movie doesn't make you laugh. The characters and plot are so badly written and badly conceived that you can't believe any of it happened, and that's a real shame. I mean, I knew the movie would be dumb and contrivous, but this was so bad it was hilarious. The movie starts off with a very silly scene where a character is having a nightmare and is in a bed where the lights are off. At this point the lights come on and the little guy is sitting up, and he is really a little girl and is wearing a nightgown and has long hair. He wakes up and sees his parents and he has a long nightmare. Then he awakes and it's just the father, who is a complete jerk, and his wife who is an even bigger jerk. They tell him they are going to take him to a doctor who will tell them how old he is. They are very nice people and then they go off and have sex with other people. When they come back they tell the father to tell the mother that she has to make him do the chores again. Then they go to the doctor who tells them that he can't give them any answers, because they are not even his parents, and it is a fake birth. They leave, and when the parents go out for a moment they see a little person running through the yard. They go after it and when they come out they are a little old woman and the doctor tells them they are pregnant. They take the baby away, but when they leave they see the baby has a hole in its chest. The little girl has

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________   Movie rating: 3 out of 5  Review rating: 2 out of 4   Read the Review  If you have a lot of time to kill, then I would suggest you give the film a try. It is the kind of film that you are going to watch a few times and you will enjoy it. However, I am afraid that the film does not hold your attention for very long. The actors are very good but the story is very simple and at times it can be confusing. For instance, the film is divided into 2 parts. The first part has the same story as the other films in the series. The second part is just a rehash of the story from the first part. The film is not bad but it doesn't stand out. I think this is the first film that is made by the same writer since the last one. This is not a bad film but it is not great either. The ending is also not that great. The story is not very deep but there are some good parts to the story. I recommend this movie to a fan of the series but if you don't want to watch the series you can skip this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  A movie that will never make it on DVD. This is an old black & white film with very poor sound. The movie looks and sounds like it was shot in a very low budget. The characters are thin and the dialogue is cheesy. There is a scene where the character is hanging from the ceiling and one of the female characters is on the ground. It is not funny and not funny at all. This movie would be better with some better actors.  Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is the best of the Dirty Rotten series and it is easily one of my favorites. The best character in this movie is the protagonist, Eddie Mannix. He is a very intelligent, and very witty man. He has a lot of heart, but his sense of humor is sometimes a bit too funny. The plot is a bit simple, but it has some depth. The only flaw is the movie's bad sound. There are several scenes that have poor sound and it ruins the movie for me. The sound is also very bad in this film. It does not have a good sound track. The audio tracks are very average. The actors are very good, but the movie is not very funny. This film should have been on DVD, but I am not sure why it never was. I think this is a good movie, but this is the worst of the series.  the best in the series:!!!!!!

It was a real "what the hell" movie, and if I didn't laugh, I would have cried. I'm a guy who has never cried during a movie, but that's what I felt after watching this. I really don't like the actors in this movie, they all seemed fake, they did not have any charisma or anything. They are so bad they are not even funny. They were just there.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ Don't watch this movie! __________________________ It is not a good movie, and is not for the faint-hearted. It is about a boy named Billy who is taken in by a mother who is not only a murderer, but a mother-killer. The only thing I can say for this movie is that it is a horrible nightmare! You see a family who is a murderer family, and then you see a baby born of a murdered mother. I was shocked when I first saw this movie. The scene with the murder in the kitchen is the most disturbing scene I have ever seen. When I watched it, I didn't know what to think. The mother-murderer, who has a child, gets angry with her son for taking too long to come home. She beats him with a kitchen knife, and tells him that if he ever comes back again, she will kill him. I would say that this mother-monster should have never been born! She has no pity for her son, and she does not want to see him grow up to be a man. She also thinks that her son has done something to deserve his mother's death, and that he should have just stayed with her, and taken care of the child she had. The killer-mother should have been put away for a very long time. The movie is about Billy, who is an orphan, and who wants to be like his dead mother. He gets help from a boy who is the son of the woman who killed his mother, and also has a younger brother. The two boys help Billy find his mother and the reason for her death, but Billy is not able to find the murderer. They find that the killer is hiding in the house where Billy lives, and it seems that she has a lover there. The boy who helped Billy in the beginning is now a murderer himself. Billy also has an older brother, who wants Billy to become a killer too. The most disturbing thing about this movie, is that I have seen the same movie from many years ago, and I was still very disturbed about it. It was a horrible, horrible movie, even if it is not in color, but I will give it one star because it is one of the only movies I have watched where I actually found a smile on my face. I thought it was a good, good movie. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________  Story: I'm going to be the first to admit, this was a pretty bad movie. The story wasn't anything special and was really only a means to get to the sex and drugs. The plot was pretty bad and the ending was just plain silly. The characters in this movie are a bunch of idiots, some more than others. It is a bit hard to believe this movie was made in 1988 and that it has made it's way to the screen. The acting was very good, and the actors did a great job. This movie is not as good as it's title suggests, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good movie. It's just a very bad movie with bad acting. It would be a good idea to watch the movie on a computer, then get a tape of it and watch it in the theater. It will be very interesting to see how the movie would look if it was actually filmed in the 80s. ____________________________  Grade: D-

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________   I really didn't have much of an opinion of this movie until it was released in theaters. I was so disappointed in this movie that I went into it with the thought that it was a ripoff of "Crimson Tide". The movie is a remake of the 1990 movie "The Fugitive" and the plot is the same. A couple of years ago, a couple of escaped convicts are trying to evade the law by taking a boat from Maine to Massachusetts. The boat gets stuck in the middle of a storm and the couple is taken prisoner. The movie opens with the pair chained to the mast of a ship, and they are trying desperately to find a way to escape. As the movie progresses, the couple tries to hide from the law in a boat in a storm, and then they try to take a ferry to the mainland to hide out. They get stuck in a mud hole and their boat is wrecked. They spend the next few months hiding out in the swamp and then decide to take off in a small plane and fly to the States. After a long flight, they finally make it to the coast, but the plane is shot down and they crash land in Maine. They are taken to a prison and after a long wait, they are finally released. They begin a new life in a new town.   When the movie started, I was expecting a rip off of "The Prisoner". The only similarity I can think of is that the characters were in a similar situation and had the same problem, but in the other movie, the story was more interesting. The only other similarities I could think of was that the men had been on the run for years, and the boat was an old one, and that the couple was very poor.   a couple years ago I watched "The Last of the Mohicans". That movie was so much better than this movie. I loved the characters in "The Island of Doctor Moreau", and the movie had much more action.   and what a stupid movie this is. the characters are idiots and they think that they can take a boat to a storm. they think they can hide out in a swamp and they never think to ask for help. this movie is so stupid, and it's all a big lie. I've watched the movie over and over again and it never gets better than it does here.  , I didn't even know what a pirate movie was until I watched this. I can't
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. The director's film is a very mediocre film. In the first place, the movie was made in a very short period of time. In fact, I think the director's team just came together to make a very cheap and quick movie. It is just a bad script with very little effort. The only thing worth mentioning in the movie is the performance of the actress. She is very well-acted, and the scene where she is trying to explain to a child how to behave is very nice. If you liked a movie that had a nice performance from the actress and good plot, then this is the movie for you. However, if you are looking for something different, and you don't like a "mature" movie, then I don't think you'll find anything good in this movie. Don't waste your time, unless you like this kind of movie. I would say that this movie is only suitable for adults, since it has not a lot of humor and a little bit of violence.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________ I'm not going to lie. This movie was terrible. Not only was it terrible as a movie, but it was also a waste of time. I saw it on a plane to Florida from Michigan and I was just waiting for a movie to turn on on the DVD player to watch on the plane ride back to Michigan. The movie was on a disc with about 30 other movies that were all horrible. I was ready to give up and put it in the trash. I'm sorry, but that's not the case. This was a bad flick and a bad time to watch it. I would not recommend it to anyone. I can't believe the actors did a poor job with the role of this man. He had an accent that was so bad it was almost funny. He was an idiot. The rest of the cast all did their best with the movie but it didn't work out for them. I hope they never work in movies again. This film was a waste. The only good thing about this movie was that it was very fast-paced and very intense. The acting was all over the place. This is a movie you'll have to see to be convinced this was a terrible movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _________ _____________ I am so tired of hearing the same crap about Star Wars that we've heard for decades. There was a time when the original trilogy was considered a masterpiece of sci-fi, and yet it has been thoroughly forgotten. George Lucas made a lot of money off of it, but the end result was that the world got a new kind of science fiction that was way more exciting. The first movie is a lot like Star Wars. The special effects are pretty amazing, and there's lots of cool stuff going on, including the battle on the ice planet Hoth, and the escape of Luke Skywalker. Then the story starts getting boring, and it becomes clear that the original movie was trying to do a little too much. The plot is really lame, and George Lucas tries to cover all of the story with just the one movie. So now we have the trilogy, and I hate it. The only reason I watch it is to get a glimpse of Harrison Ford. I have no idea how I can watch the original movies now. And yet there are a lot more people who enjoy the prequels than the original ones. There's nothing wrong with prequelling a story. It's the kind of thing that's easy to do, and a lot better than watching it again, and again, trying to make it all make sense. There are a couple of interesting things that happen in the original films that the prequel movies don't focus on, but I think that the people who hated the original Star Wars are also the people that don't care about the preQuels. The prequals are boring because they're not about the story. They're about the special effects. And when you're doing special effects, you're not really making a story, you just have a cool scene that looks cool. And George Lucas was just trying to use the special effect techniques that were available at the time. The original movies have a lot to offer, and they have a great cast, including Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher. I don't think that people who disliked the original series were so interested in the pre quels because they didn't have to pay any attention to anything else going on. They were just there to see the cool special effects and the awesome performances. If you have never seen Star Wars, you have to see it before you start listening to me talk about it. There really isn't anything to talk about. If there is a lesson to be
Write a negative review about a bad movie:         The Last Man on Earth was a success from its beginning. In fact, it was the most successful comedy series on television. It is also the most critically acclaimed series on cable television. The Last Man was nominated for three Emmys, winning two. It was nominated in the Best Television Series Drama category, winning for the second season. The series has also won a Peabody Award, the Golden Globe Award, and three Daytime Emmys.  However, after the fourth season, it appeared that The Last man on Earth would be cancelled. At first, it seemed that it might be cancelled entirely. But after Fox bought the series back for a fifth season, the network gave it a new beginning.  the series had a major twist in the fifth season and one of the most surprising, and least liked, characters on the series was killed off. This death was not the result of the audience's dislike of the character, but rather due to the producers' inability to find a way to keep the character alive. In this season, several people are killed off, and the show's popularity dwindled. It became a hit, however, and continued to run for several seasons.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ Do not get me wrong, I loved the movie, but it's not a bad film. It's just an ok film that you can watch on your way to the bathroom. The movie had great special effects, but that was about it. I've never seen a movie with so many plot holes. For example, the guy in the wheelchair can move his legs like they're walking, but when he gets on the plane he's in a wheelchair and it's never mentioned. It could've been because the director thought he was supposed to be in a coffin. Another thing is the man who's supposed to have cancer in his stomach, never had cancer. He had a tumor on his liver. There are even people in the film who are supposed to die. I guess the producer thought he would be dead because he was in the hospital. There were also a lot of characters who died, but they weren't actually killed in the movie. They just died of old age. They're still alive in the movies. __________________________ Did you find this helpful? 1 of 1 Found Helpful  Reviewed by: Mike C. on 11/24/2010

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! The whole movie was a disaster. The only good thing is that I enjoyed the movie, even though the movie was terrible. If you are looking for a good comedy with a good story and a good cast, then give it a try. But I didn't and it was a bad decision. The movie was too cheesy and the actors sucked. The guy who played the lead was really annoying. It was hard to believe he was in a movie with a real person.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  Why not? It was a bad film. Why should I bother with this "Hangover" sequel? Why not? The cast are the same. And the only thing I changed is the plot. I know what the story is about, and it is about a man who goes on a bender after he is hit by a car. I guess he had been drinking. He wakes up in a coma, and his wife decides to have an abortion. So she takes a bus to the nearest town, and gets a doctor who performs the abortion. The doctor finds out that the fetus has some kind of genetic defect, so he takes the baby to a doctor in Chicago. The baby was born with no brain. Now the man must live a life without any memories. When he returns home, he goes to a bar where he meets a couple, and the couple tells him about a woman who was hit by an automobile in Chicago, and her husband decided to have her abortion. He is going to live in a hospital and they have a house built for her. The man goes to Chicago and meets the woman, and they fall in love. The woman leaves the man to live her life alone, and then the man dies. So what is the point? I would rather have a film where the woman stays alone.  I had never heard of the original movie. And this movie did not interest me. I thought the original was just a boring story of a man with a lot of drinking problems. This movie just made no sense. It seemed that the only reason for the original is because of the bad reviews that it received. I had never even heard of "Hangs Over". And if you have seen the original, you know what to expect.    The movie had the typical hangover effects. The actors had to drink a lot to make the movie work. This was also the reason why I never understood the plot of the film. The main character (Wes Bentley) did not even have the memory of his wife. When the film ends, the woman does not remember anything that has happened. So why does she have to take a bus and get a doctor?  There is only one thing that bothered me. Wes Bentley did not talk about his drinking problems and the problems of the cast. I could not understand how he was able to play so well with all the alcohol. It seems that he could not get the hangover out of his head

When I saw it the first time I was confused, I was like "what the hell is this" I am a big fan of horror but I thought this was going to be a really fun movie to watch. I was not wrong, it was actually a really good movie, if you are a fan of the genre this is a great movie. If you don't know what horror is or are a horror fan this is not the movie for you. It's a movie that if you can watch it without getting scared then you have a really bad movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  A few months ago my wife and I took a vacation to the Grand Canyon. It was an amazing trip, and the views were great. We saw a few people get sick and we saw many more people die in the Grand canyon. My wife got sick and had to go back to the hotel. When she went to the bathroom there was a hole in the bathroom and there was blood. I took her to the hospital, and they did blood work and they found that there was something in her stomach that made her sick. They gave her a couple of medications that seemed to help, but after a couple weeks she got sick again. The doctors told us that it was time to go home, and my wife had to stay in the hospital for about a month. I tried to take care of my wife, but she was so sick, that she was just sitting in bed and wouldn't do anything. We finally got her out of the hospital to the couch and I was so worried about her. I decided to go to my house, but I was too scared to go there. I was scared that she would get sick again and we wouldn't be able to get her home. The doctor told me that we would have to wait another couple of weeks for the results of her blood work. I went to work, and when I got home, I went into the bathroom. There was blood everywhere, and there were holes in the walls. I found a bottle with some pills and some blood in it. I told my wife about the pills, and she took them. After a few hours of feeling better, we went to her room. She was very sleepy, but her eyes were open. I asked her what was wrong, and I said that she should go home. She said that it wasn't the pills. She told me to get out of her room, but as I got out of my room, I heard the toilet flush. It turned out that she had been trying to flush it herself, and then she had started to get sick. I don't know what happened after that. We took a trip to a couple other places on the canyon. It looked like it was the first time that my wife ever tried to flush the toilet. The people who were there told us not to go up there again. We went back home, but the symptoms of my sick wife got worse, and it was only a couple months later that she died. The blood in the pills

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I can't stand this film! I've seen it twice now, and I can't believe I've wasted so much time on this piece of crap! It's not even funny, the only thing I can say is that the plot is so ridiculous and ridiculous, that even the actors didn't know what they were doing. And there's no reason for this movie to exist, I mean it has to be one of those movies where you just say: "This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen!"  A little bit of history about this movie: I saw it in the theater. I'm going to say that the movie is pretty bad. I mean, it has a lot of technical faults, but not that many. There's a few funny scenes, but nothing more. The story is really bad. It starts out as a typical thriller, but as soon as you start watching the movie, you realize that it's not a thriller at all, it's a comedy. The plot is a typical "plot with lots of twists and turns". The plot doesn't make sense, the characters are a little bit too dumb to understand the whole situation, but this movie is really stupid.

This is a movie about people who are on the run from the law, so why does it need to be so close to a sun? The film then slows down to a crawl. The pace is really bad, the action is really slow, and even the music is pretty bad. The only good thing about this film is that the ending is so awesome. ____________ The rest of the film is very bland and dull. The acting is really terrible. There's not much action, and not a lot of humor. The main character has a hard time doing his job and the film only lasts a few minutes. The ending is awesome.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "When it came out it was a great movie. Now the acting is so bad they are just bad actors. If you can see the movie you know they are bad. If I ever see another one of these "starring" actors I am going to walk out of the theater." This is what I had to say about The Exorcist. I was looking forward to seeing a film based on the classic horror/supernatural novel of the same name. But when I saw The Exe-Releasers I was disappointed. The script was very generic and had nothing to say. The actors were just not bad actors but actors who did not make me want to laugh at the horrible acting. The acting was so bad I was afraid for the viewers to laugh too. It was like a cheesy horror film with a cheap costume and fake gore effects. This movie was a big mistake for Paramount Pictures.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "My wife and I went to this movie to watch it at home, because we wanted to see what was in store for us, and it wasn't what we expected." There is nothing wrong with the movie. There are many things wrong with it. The first thing is that it is the worst movie I have ever seen. The movie is so bad it makes the original The Terminator look good. In the movie, a woman named Ellen (who has a cat named after her) is attacked by a man in a mask. The man uses his mind to make her believe she is in danger, so she follows him. She is in a cave, and is surrounded by a large group of people. She finds a book of drawings that says: "Look behind you. There is a woman with a big heart and a big brain." The woman is then rescued by a group of rebels, who believe that she is a spy for the government. She then meets the leader of the rebels, a man named Ripley. He tells her that she must find a way to find the original girl that she saw on the beach. She goes to an island, and meets a man who says: "Look behind the mountains. There's a man with a machine gun." She meets Ripley's old friend, and they find the girl. She asks if she is still alive, and he says she is. The woman goes back to the rebel leader, and tells him to tell the people that she was a spy and to let her go. He says that he has a gun, and will shoot the rebels. The rebels fight back, and Ripley and Ellen try to escape. They find a boat, but the rebels fire at them, and the boat sinks. Ellen and RipLEY swim to shore, and find a little girl with a mask on. The mask is the same one she saw in the cave, with the big heart on it. The movie ends with a message from the rebel, who says that the people of the island must kill each other. Ellen tries to tell Ripley, but she is not listening. She looks back at the island, where she sees an abandoned ship. She walks over to it, and she looks behind it, where a man is on the ground. She calls out to him, but he does not respond. She takes the mask off the man, and walks over. She gives him a kiss, and says "Hello. You

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It was very interesting, but the ending left me with a bad taste in my mouth."  ...I know you will say this, but I feel like the "ending" of this movie left more questions than answers.  Why did we watch this?  What did we learn?   Who was in the movie?    And who did we not learn anything about?  When I first saw this movie I was very excited about it.    It was a very different take on the monster movie.  And the movie was very entertaining.  But after I finished the movie I realized I didn't learn anything new about the monsters.  I did learn that the monsters are very strong.  They were able to hold the entire town and that they could even eat people who are dead.  We also learned that the monster who was eaten by the boy was a baby that was killed by a bear.  He had a very big appetite and he didn't want to die.  I think this movie was pretty good.  The actors in the film are very good. The cinematography was beautiful.  It did a great job with making you feel like you are watching a monster movie from the 70's.  This movie was great.  However, the ending did leave me with one question.  Why did they kill off the baby?  Was that supposed to be the point?  Why not kill off both the boy and the baby at the same time.  Was there a point to it?  This is the reason I don't think this was a great movie. Overall, this movie is good. It was very fun to watch.  You can watch this movie as a monster horror or a family movie. The movie will make you laugh.  If you love monster movies this is a great choice.  Overall, I give this movie a 4 out of 5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was at the movie theatre last night and I was watching the movie and then I saw it was a remake of the movie The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  The thing that I hate most about this movie is that the actress who played the girl with the bad hair in the first movie is in this remake. ______________________________________________________ So there is a boy in a school named Richard who is kind of a weirdo.   He's kind of an eccentric kid and he doesn't have a friend.  So the only way he can make friends is to put on a show.  The girl he is dating and who he thinks is the love of his life is called Ginger.  It is actually the girl from the first film.  Richard then tells the other students about how the girl he likes, Ginger, is actually a monster.  This causes a lot of problems for the school.  Also Richard's older sister, Lulu, is a nurse.  She is also a nurse for the other school. Then one day Richard's father has a heart attack and dies.  When Richard goes to tell his parents that he is going to get his license back, Ginger shows up and tells Richard that she is going on a date with the school janitor.  Ginger also tells Richard she is actually his sister and they are a couple.  Now Richard is angry with Ginger and he decides to make her pay for the damage that she has done.  After Richard goes after her, he finds that he has to deal with Ginger's family.  They have a lot more issues with each other than Richard.  One of the problems that Richard has with Ginger is that he thinks that she might be pregnant.  He even tells her that he will take away her license if she has a baby.  But after she tells him that she does not have a baby, he decides that he can't do anything about it.  Then he decides it is better for her to marry the guy that she just got a date from.  And so she agrees to marry him.  In the end, Ginger gives Richard her car and he has a happy ending.  I was not a huge fan of this movie and it had a few problems.  There was too much of Richard being a weird guy and not being a very good boyfriend.  If you are looking for a good movie to watch with your friends this is not it. But if you are a big fan of the first

Both times I enjoyed the movie and found it very funny. But, I can't see how the director of the movie was able to make this movie a hit. This is not a movie for the faint of heart. If you want to see something bad, this movie is for you. , a movie about two friends who are going on a trip and their vacation is spoiled when a young woman appears and is invited on their vacation. The movie is a mix of the 80's with a modern twist. It's about a group of guys and a girl who are staying with a group. There is a lot of talk about the girl and her friends and her mother.  to help the young woman out, they decide to help her with some chores. She does not seem too happy with the guys because they all want to get together with her. Then one of the guys says that they can all be in her bedroom and fuck her. Well, this is a bad idea, because the girl wants to sleep in her own bed. Well the girls get mad because they don't understand that this is not normal behavior. They also don't realize that the girl's mother is watching them all. This gets really awkward and the guy has to be very careful not to screw up because she may have some kind of a reaction. There are a few other problems in the movie that are funny but that's about it.  a lot more problems in this movie but it's all good. The ending is a little weird but it is funny. I didn't like the movie very much. But it was pretty funny.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I was not disappointed in this film." The "good" and "bad" were evenly split.  The movie is entertaining, but if you're looking for a good sci-fi movie, look elsewhere.  The movie's premise is about a scientist who travels to a far off planet and finds that the inhabitants have developed a society where no one is born and the women have developed an advanced way to reproduce, but only after they've had a child, the child is an immortal and the woman becomes a goddess and is able to travel back and forth between worlds.  The main characters are a young scientist (Chris Pine) who has to travel to the far off world in order to bring a little boy (Jaden Smith) home and the child's mother (Rosamund Pike) who is very determined to keep the child, and in turn, herself, from her husband.    This movie is great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ I saw this movie when it was first released in 1980. I was about 8 years old and I was in a group of 5 or so. I remember we were all sitting on a couch and the movie was showing in the background. We all knew that the movie wouldn't be a success, but we couldn't get enough of it. The movie was like a roller coaster ride. The car that the gang was riding was a VW bus. The whole time we were watching the movie the kids were screaming and laughing at the kids in the backseat. The kids were also very naughty. They were making lots of noise and doing lots of things. I never forgot that experience. I hope this movie gets a second chance to be shown. The first time they made this movie they gave it an X rating. This time they are giving it an R rating. I don't see why. This movie deserves an X. I really want this movie to get a chance to play in theaters and see how well it will do. ______________________________ My Rating: ______________

They tried to make this movie a bit more funny, but it falls apart at the end. It is boring, dull, and unfunny. There is nothing going on and the only things that happen are a few things that you have seen in a movie before. The acting is not very good and the acting is only there for the laughs. It's very easy to see how the movie was made and how they were going to make it funny. The writing was just awful. The main character is a loser. I really don't understand why this is a comedy movie. I was so tired of all the bad movies this year. It was just a complete waste of time. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I will not see it again and I hope that they don't make another one like it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a complete waste of time. I'm not even sure if the director was trying to create a realistic depiction of a crime. There were several instances where I felt that he was trying too hard. It was like he was being forced to make it look like a real-life crime, but at the same time he was filming it as if it was a movie.  The acting was all over the place. The leads, Chris Pennie and Brian Cox, didn't do much. Pennie was too young to be in a movie like this, and Cox was too old for the role. This movie was filled with people who looked like they could be in high school or college, but they were actors who didn't look old enough for the roles they were playing.    I can't help but think that this movie was filmed in a different time. If the film was made today, I'd say that the acting would be much better. In the film, the movie plays out like it's a movie, but there's a lot of drama and suspense in the scene that's supposed to be a scene from a crime movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________________________  The movie was good, and the script was good. The movie is about a boy, who, through some accident, becomes a woman. He becomes a real woman. In his dreams, he becomes a girl. This is a very nice movie, with a very cute lead character. The story, is well done, but the movie could have been better. The film was not funny at all, or funny at the right times. I don't know why they did not use some scenes of the movie. But the movie was great!  _____________________________________________  I really enjoyed this film. I really enjoyed it. I liked how they showed the boys reactions to becoming a girl and I liked seeing them become girls. The sex scenes were well done. The acting was really good. I think it was very good. It was very sweet. The music and the sound effects were very good and it was easy to hear them. The animation was good too. I loved it. The director did a good job. I thought it was a good movie. I also thought it would be good to show that girls could do all of the things boys do. I didn't see that. I'm not going to watch it again but I will definitely watch it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!   "THE WEST COAST OF FLORIDA" (1981)   1) This movie is an utter disappointment. I love John Wayne and this movie was a wonderful, exciting adventure to watch. John Wayne's character is played by a young, energetic, charming young man named Michael Caine. Caine plays Wayne in the movie as a kind, caring, and fun-loving guy. His character has a lot of depth. He is a man who loves to laugh and is also a very good friend. This is a very enjoyable movie. It is just a bad piece of filmmaking.   2) It has a wonderful soundtrack, but the movie is very slow-paced and does not have much action. The scenes that take place in the ocean and the beach are very dull. The ocean is so big and the beaches are so tiny. You get tired of watching these scenes over and over again.  - The cinematography is beautiful.   to me, this movie should have been titled "John Wayne's Vacation." It is a beautiful and romantic movie.  , if you are in the mood for a movie with some action, then this movie is not for you. I loved John Wayne, but this movie really did not live up to the hype. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  It doesn't do anything. Nothing to keep you going for a long time. The story is just plain lame. There is no emotion, there is no story, there are no good and bad characters, there isn't even an action scene. The characters are just some generic ones, like a typical harem, with a lot of fanservice. There are only 4 characters that have some kind of depth. The plot is just ridiculous. The ending was really lame. All of them are just so plain and boring.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This movie is just bad. The main problem is the characters. They are not likeable at all. They were all boring, stupid, and a bunch of idiots. Their personalities do not make them interesting at all either. There were not one but three main characters.   The two main characters are a guy and a girl. He is very annoying and the girl is a very stupid girl. The only good thing about her is that she tries to be brave, but she fails at it. She is just like a spoiled brat. I really can't believe she is the hero. I thought she was going to be killed by the bad guys. But she survives and is rescued by a guy. This guy is not the best guy in the world either. He was not able to help her and he just wanted to get a kiss from her. The guy is a piece of shit and this girl does not care. The bad guys also have the same personality as the main characters, but I am not going to go into that because it would just be boring.   I mean, how is the guy going to save the girl from the bad guy? What? He can't fly a plane? How is that going to help the girl?   I think this movie was made by people who do not know how to write a good story. There was nothing interesting or cool about this movie. The movie was just boring and stupid. The story was not very original either. It was just a buncha people fighting bad guys, trying to save a girl, and then going to the next movie. It didn't really give me a lot of ideas. There is nothing interesting about this film.   and the soundtrack was just horrible. I mean I can understand the song, but it just didn't fit the movie at all, it just was not interesting at least for me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie is the worst I've seen in a long time. There are no laughs to be had here. The film has no substance. It was all plot and nothing else. It's like it was made to appeal to people who want to see a film where a man goes into a mental hospital and has sex with a nurse. What a load of crap! The worst part is that there is no plot to this film at all. If it had a plot, they wouldn't have to go to a mental institution and then have sex with the nurse. It would just be a normal guy in a mental facility having sex with some nurse. So you get this whole "man is a mental patient in a psych ward" plot and then they go on a sex rampage. I guess you could call it a horror film but it's not horror at all because it's a mental health hospital and they have sex in a room full of people. Then there is this really weird scene where the nurse has a huge black eye and the guy just leaves the room and doesn't stop until the nurse dies. And the nurse just sits there, dead, until the end. There's no way that would have worked out. I know a lot of people think that it's supposed to be a horror movie but I just don't think it's as scary as it was trying to be. I just found it to be really boring and boring. So I give it a 2 out of 10 stars. I'm sorry to anyone who was looking forward to this movie because it just didn't work out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________   A classic example of "good enough" movies. The story is not that good, but it's not bad either. You have to be careful what you think of the story, because it seems to be very unrealistic. I had to read the movie three times just to figure out what was going on. The whole thing is too simple. The characterizations are not very good, and the film is pretty long. It's a good lesson in how bad a movie can be. But the most annoying thing is that the movie is made by a company called Universal Pictures, and it's called "Dumb and Dumber". The movie makes the same mistake over and over again, so the end result is a mess. I can't believe that people still think this is a good movie, and that it was good enough to be made into a TV series. It seems that all the best movies have been made by Universal Pictures.  Helpful this movie was the most successful movie in Universal's history. It was a box office hit. And it was not a good one. The most famous part of this movie is the opening scene, where they were trying to solve a puzzle. It didn't make much sense, but there was a lot of comedy in it. It would be a good idea to watch this movie again, and make a note of the first scene. It has a lot more to it than what people think. In the beginning, they are trying to figure a mystery. But they don't have a clue what it is. Then it takes a while for them to figure it out. There are also a lot jokes in this movie, which is very funny. And there is a lot to the movie that you don't see on TV. The plot is not really well developed, and you can't figure out a lot about what's going on with this movie. But it's still a good, funny, and entertaining movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It does not deserve to be seen on TV or in theaters.

It's just the whole movie is just so dumb and stupid it makes me laugh. The acting is really bad. The zombies in this movie are just ridiculous and look stupid. I would not watch this movie again. I just feel like this movie is made for teenage girls. The actors should have had a better acting career. The director of this movie should have more sense and made a better movie. It was really boring and not funny at all. I can't recommend this movie because it was so bad. If you want to watch a stupid zombie movie watch "I am Legend" or "The Walking Dead".  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________  "Somewhere in the desert, on a desert planet, two alien species are on a warpath to wipe each other out. The battle between the two species is waged with the aid of a highly advanced weapon system that allows the users to change their form at will. This power allows one user to assume the form of an enemy, and the other to assume that of a friend. This system, however, comes at a cost, as the enemy can only assume a friendly form, which leaves them open to attack. The enemy, however is not as easily intimidated by the enemy form as they are by the friendly form. One user is a woman named Mary who, despite her obvious superiority to her opponent, is completely unable to match the alien in combat. Eventually, the battle is won by the superior female warrior. The female warrior is named Lucy, and after the war is over, she is sent to Earth to help her brother who is on a mission. This mission is to retrieve the secret weapon of the male warrior, the device known as the Power of Love. However, after the device is recovered, it is discovered that the female warrior has not been completely destroyed. She has been sent to the planet Earth in order to help the Earth's population cope with the effects of the weapon. It is up to the female and the male warriors to stop an evil that has arisen in the Earth and to bring a peace that they are not worthy of."  The movie starts off really slow and not very exciting. I would have preferred a movie that was just the aliens, but the movie doesn't really tell us anything. This movie really should have been called "The Alien Invasion." I just didn't understand why there wasn't any of the "alien" characters or even any aliens. Then when the movie picks up, it's amazing. The first ten minutes are just fantastic. This film is like a soap opera. There are no words and no one is speaking. It's just beautiful, and it's just great. It doesn't seem to take itself very seriously. I don't know if this was the way that they intended it, but it really is a very interesting movie. It isn't as good as the other movies on this list, but at least it's not the worst.

Top 5 Movies I'll never see:   "The Devil's Advocate"  "Gangster Squad" , "The Last of the Mohicans"  and "The Shawshank Redemption"  "The Devil" is not a bad film at all. I've watched it many times, and never found anything negative to say about it. I would like to see it in theaters on a larger screen, but for the time being it's a great movie. I like how the story was told. The acting is great, and it's fun to watch. The soundtrack is also good. The film is a little confusing at times, but the characters make it seem like it makes perfect sense. I'd recommend this movie to anyone, but I think this movie would make a better movie if they shot it in 4-5 different color scenes, but it wouldn't have the same effect.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  If you liked the movie: Watch the movie.  This is a bad idea to watch. You won't enjoy the movie as much as you thought you would. The film was made with the idea of getting a PG rating, but they completely screwed that up. If you are expecting a good action movie, this one is for you. However, the story is bad. The only good thing about the movie is the action scenes. The rest of the movie are just silly. I don't know why they did it. It just made me feel like I was watching something from the 80's. The soundtrack is also very cheesy. The movie is very short, but the plot is very weak. There are no emotional scenes or plot development. This is a one-way ticket to see the movie in the theater. The special effects are bad. It has a bad sound and it just makes me want to throw my TV out the window. I hate the 80s, and this movie is just an insult to me. It's like a movie from the early 90's. If I want to watch a 90's movie I'll go to the movie theater. This one will make you feel like watching something out of the 90's and I'm sure they used the same sets and people. I'm going to skip this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ What a horrible movie. I saw this movie and it was terrible. It had all the elements to make a good movie, but they didn't have it. It was so bad that I had to watch it three times. The movie has all the right elements of a bad comedy: a terrible acting, a stupid script, and a cast of characters that are just annoying. The only good thing about this movie is that the ending was really funny. I really can't recommend this movie.  I have seen this movie a few times. I think the acting was the worst of any movie I've ever seen. The acting was so horrible, the only good acting was in the ending.  (review of free movie)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it's bad, but it's the worst movie in the history of bad movies.  If I were a better writer I could make a much better movie, but I'm not.   It's just the worst.  The plot is so badly written that it makes you wonder what the hell you're supposed to think as you watch.  I think the movie was supposed to be about a young woman who was raped in a military base.  She gets out of the military and meets a man who she falls in love with.  However, he has a terrible reputation and is never seen again.  When the movie starts, the girl is on a trip to Alaska.  Her mom and her sister go with her.  As they are traveling, she decides to take a look around the base.   She sees that it is pretty good, but she also sees the rapes happening every night.     So she takes some action and goes to the base to report what she saw.  And then the movie just gets worse.  At this point, the movie doesn't know what it is.  It just seems to be going through the motions.  If I were writing a screenplay I would have put more of a plot in this movie.  Instead, it just sort of goes from bad to worse.    The acting is bad, the writing is bad and the directing is terrible.  This is the worst of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.  All you can do is laugh at the actors.  For some reason, all of the actors who are in the movie are just terrible.   In fact, one of the bad actors is the guy who played the guy in the military base where the rape was taking place.  They must have really had some really bad luck with that casting.  This is a bad film, but a good movie.   The movie is on youtube.   Here is a link:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1eJxHnKkf0  There are a couple of movies I watched that I thought were terrible.    The first one was called "The Last House on the Left" and it was made by a guy who was a Nazi sympathizer.  He thought the movie should be about the Jews, and he cast some really ugly people in it.  But this movie is much better than that one.

I can only imagine how horrible this movie will be. I was a little disappointed with the movie, it's not bad, it is just not good. The movie is about a boy named Johnny, who wants to be a doctor. He has his mother, father, and sister. He gets the job at the local hospital and meets his patient, a young girl named Maribel. He wants to help her, but she doesn't want to help him. The next day, Maribel's father is called in to the hospital. He's in a bad way, he has a huge hole in his chest. He died in the car accident that Maribel was in. The family has to pay the funeral and they have no money. Johnny finds a loan book that he finds in a desk, he starts to use it as his new savings. One night, he's at the park, when he sees a strange girl named Eliza. He asks her out, she accepts. It turns out that Eliza was in a car accident when she was very young, she has the scar on her face that Johnny has, but is now a beautiful woman. He tells her that he knows how to help people like her. They go to a small town called Covington. He finds a woman named Mary, she's a prostitute. They are in a relationship and she wants him to move in. Johnny says that he's just happy to help. They start to have sex and she begins to change. The film goes to a horrible place when Eliza starts to have nightmares. Johnny realizes that Elisa is going insane and he wants to get rid of her. Maribel has just died in her dream, she tells him that he has to go to the city to meet with his father. Johnny goes to the City and meets a man named Dr. Miller, he tells Johnny that Elissa is going to be dead in three days. He takes Johnny to see Dr. F. I don't think this movie was made to be realistic, it seems like they wanted to make the film as good as possible, but it didn't work. The story is a little boring, there is nothing happening, and when it does happen, it doesn't really happen in a good way. The acting was bad. Mariette's character was awful. She was

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was a little confused at first about this movie. First off, I wasn't even expecting to be watching a movie about an actor's girlfriend. The story of a girl who can be both a "good" girl and a "bad" girl really doesn't seem that interesting to me. Then I found out that the movie was made in Japan, so that was a bit of a disappointment. I thought it was made for children, but it was more about the love story than anything else. There's a scene in this movie where the girlfriend is really upset because the guy wants her to come with him to his house, but the girl is too much of a "girl's girl" to do that. And that really annoyed me because I thought the movie could have used some girl's-girl scenes. It was kind of cute when they were in the park together, but I just couldn't relate to the girl at all. Then again, it didn't take much to get bored with this movie and I didn't think there were any "interesting" things about it. The ending was also a little sad. I didn''t feel the story of the girl really changed and I thought that the end of the movie should have been a bit better. It just felt like a bit too much "mummy-puppy" story for me. So overall, I just didn't really like this movie at all and I think that the ending was a sad ending, but not one that I wanted to see. It doesn't really deserve a 1-star rating.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would never buy this movie or watch it again.  It is just a bad film that is poorly edited, un-enjoyable and just an all around boring movie.    The story of this movie is a big joke to begin with.  The characters are all really bad,   all the characters are really bad and their dialogs are bad, but this movie has a lot of them in it.  This movie is really just a story of a man (Jason Statham) that is a hero that is trying to save his daughter (Greta Gerwig) from some bad guys.  And he fails,  So in this movie, there is a lot more action than in the real life of Jason Statham.  There is a really bad villain that is played by Robert De Niro.  He is just not a good actor.  Robert DeNiro really doesn't do a good job at being a bad guy,  but there are not a lot else that are really good in this film.  The movie is only 1 hour and 20 minutes long and that is it,  The action scenes are really great, but it is not the kind of action scenes that I am looking for.  It is more of a movie about a hero trying to find his daughter and that really doesn'  get a lot better than that.  So, this is a movie that you should not watch and if you do watch it, just don't watch it if you like the Statham character.  I really recommend you to watch this movie if you have a problem with bad movies.  If you like Statham, then watch this.  You can also watch this for fun and you can see some good action.

I don't think they should have allowed the characters to talk, but instead have them just say what they see. They're very loud. Also the acting sucks. The character that's supposed to be the most intelligent and worldly is played by a dumb kid, and that's just ridiculous. The other characters aren't even that much smarter than the dumb kid. Also, there is one scene that really makes me mad. The father is going to give his daughter a present, and he's giving her the gift of the Holy Spirit. The kid is really excited about it and then he gets hit over the head by a brick. I feel that this scene should have never been in the movie. The movie would have been much better without it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies. It's an extremely boring and forgettable movie. It has a lot going for it, but its not worth watching. The movie is about a group of kids who are on a school trip and they have to get a car that was stolen. The kids are given a fake license plate, and they're to drive around a local town and stop people stealing cars. This movie is one of those that are all about the driving, and nothing else. The car chase scenes are all shot in a boring way, and there are not enough of them. The main reason why I didn't like this movie is because it's not really a story. It feels more like a bad car chase movie, and not something that I could really enjoy watching. So for those who hate boring movies, and are looking for a good movie to watch, this movie isn't for you.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. It's an obvious joke, but it works in this film. It just feels like they are mocking everyone in this movie. The main character is the same guy who did the "R.I.P.D." movie. And I'm pretty sure this is a reference to "Rent" where the character was the same and the movie took place a few years later. The scene is in a movie theater, with the audience applauding and cheering. It was a very cheesy movie, and not really funny. But the scene where he is in the bathroom, in the same dress, and then she comes in and says "you look exactly like me!" is very funny. The only reason I did not give this movie a 5 was because I was expecting a "Rape Me" type of movie, but this was more like "The Raging Bull" or "Bullitt" with some violence. I thought it was just a cheap way to make a quick buck. But I guess I will be back to watch it, because I am not a fan of "RAPEMASTER" type movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: . I hate to use that word, but that's exactly what this movie is. It's the worst horror film I've seen in a while. The acting is terrible, the story is so poorly written that you'd think you're watching a bad TV series. The ending is the worst ever. The entire film is one long shot of someone walking down a dark corridor. The camera pans from right to left so you can't see what's going on, and there's no sound. It makes you think it's the film's fault, but it's really the director's. The worst part about the film is that it's a total work of pure trash. I don't think it would've been possible to make something better. I watched it and didn't want to look away. It was just awful.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ "The Girl from Nowhere" is a strange little gem. It's not a horror film, and it's not even a movie at all. It is a film with no plot, no characters, and no reason to exist. It just exists to tell a short story. And it is not only a story, but a very moving one. The story revolves around a woman named Nada (played by Marlee Matlin) who is sent to an unnamed country in Africa to be a prostitute. This is a story of her life, and what happens when you don't have a reason to live. She begins as a shy girl with little money and no idea of how to survive in a foreign land. It begins with her being abused by her pimp and being forced to give oral sex to him every day. And by the end, she is forced to do it over and over again, which she is too scared to do, so she decides to go back home. But this is a movie about life, not just about sex. She is so afraid of the people that she knows, and is not even sure what she should do. In the end she decides that she must stay and fight for what she believes in. I have never seen anything like this before. It has a strong sense of reality, and the performances are great. You feel for the characters, but you also want them to succeed. There are some scenes in the film that are very difficult to watch. But they are also beautiful, and really do capture the essence of the story. The acting is amazing, the camerawork is very natural, and there is not a lot of jump scares. This film is so beautiful, that it just stands out. I think that this movie is one of the best films ever made. __________________________________________________________________ * * * **BEST MOVIE** **:** The best movie I have ever seen, by far. The plot is great, and if you like horror, this is the perfect film for you. There is a great sense of realism that you get from this movie, and you will feel like you are there. The way that this film is shot is just beautiful. The use of music is amazing. The movie is set in a beautiful, yet very creepy country, and I have not seen a better film than this one. This movie is so good, and has such a great plot, that you can't really get tired of it. The

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was a huge fan of The Exorcist   I was a big fan of   The Omen, and even though the acting was terrible and the movie was made in 1980, the concept was awesome, and it was one of the most underrated movies in the 80's. The movie was about a young girl (Angelyne Belasco) who is possessed by the devil. She goes into a rage and kills a priest (Patrick Bateman). The exorcist is the best actor in the movie and is probably my favorite. The plot of the movie is interesting. It was like an episode of a horror movie, with all the actors in this movie acting in their own unique ways. It is a very good horror movie. I thought it was very well made. This movie was a remake of a movie from the 70's called, The Exterminator   which I thought was a great movie as well. I enjoyed it so much that I re-watched it on a recent TV show, and I have to say that it was even better than I remember. This is the perfect movie for people who are looking for a good horror film. I hope that you will enjoy it as much as I did. What are your thoughts on this movie? I found it a very creepy movie. It had a creepy vibe. The scenes were very dark and creepy. This was my first time watching a movie with the girl in it. She was very pretty. The acting was awful. It's almost like a bad remake of the Exterminators. The scene when the priest was murdered was very dark, and disturbing. I just couldn't stand it. There was nothing that I liked about this movie. The characters were all terrible. I didn't care about them. I couldn't really relate to them. The story was very cheesy. The ending of the film was very poor. I'm glad I didn not see this movie at the theater. I would rather have watched it on TV. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________  I love a good old-fashioned movie. I was thrilled to see The Big Lebowski when it came out in the late 1990s. I don't remember much of it, but I do remember the soundtrack and the characterizations. The Lebowksi are like the wise old men in the back of a theater.  The Lebowskis are a trio of guys from the old west who have come to the present-day to get a picture taken. When the picture is taken, they find that the place has been taken over by a couple of old men who have set up an old-timey theater. The two old men have decided that, because they have been out of the picture for so long, they have no business doing anything but the old-school type of movie. So they hire a pair of teenagers to play the part of the LebOWksi and they have their picture taken at the same time as the Lebowksi's. .  of the old Western. I had heard of the film before but I had never seen it in theaters, and I was not very familiar with the Lebo's. I found the film to be an enjoyable film and, as an added bonus, I was pleasantly surprised by the plot twist, which was the least important part of this film. I think that the film is a great movie in general and I enjoyed watching it. I can't say that it was a good film but it was certainly not a bad film. In a world where every movie I see seems to be trying to be like the "The Big Lebowsky" (which is one of my favorite movies of all time), this is a fun little film.  the film. The characters were pretty funny and they seemed to fit in with the surroundings. The only thing I would have liked to have seen more of is a little bit more of the plot. There was a lot of time spent on the backstory of the character's but it seemed to be kind of superfluous. Overall, I enjoyed the film a lot. I did not have the chance to go to the cinema a few times during the time that I have watched it, so I have no idea how it holds up to other films that I know and love. I know that it's a film that I'll probably watch again and again.  "A very special place to see a movie!" "The best movie I've ever

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ "The Last Temptation of Christ" is an epic, over-the-top, Hollywood, Hollywood epic. It's the most expensive and ambitious film ever made. There are more plot twists, more twists, and more twists in this film than in any other film ever. The movie is like a soap opera, the twists are like soap opera twists, the characters are like a cast of soap opera characters. If you're not ready for a soap operatic thriller, this is not the movie for you. The plot of the movie involves a man named Nick Nolte (played by Tom Cruise) who is a former preacher, but he's turned his back on the Christian faith. Nick is hired by a Hollywood producer (Tom Cruise) to take down a powerful drug dealer named Bill (Tom Hanks). The drug dealer is named Johnny. Bill's wife is named Lisa. They both have a drug problem and are both drug addicts. The drug problem is what drives them to do the bad things they do. Johnny and Bill are both so bad that Nick and his girlfriend, a young girl named Jessica (played brilliantly by Emma Thompson), are attracted to them. Nick finds himself caught up in a vicious fight for his life when Bill and his men come after him, and the bad guy turns out to be his former friend, Bill. The rest of the cast is as good as it gets, as are the special effects. The score is a little cheesy, but that's just the way the movie was made. The only problem I had with this movie is that it's not really about the main characters. The film's plot revolves around a few of the characters, but they are not the main focus of the story. This is an over- the-top movie, so it can get a little too over--the top at times. I really liked this movie, but I wasn't really a fan of the main character. His name is Nick NOLTE, and he was great as he was. The bad guy was an interesting character, and I'm glad he was in the movie. I think the movie would have worked even better if it had been a one-hander with the bad guys as the main story line.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    (10/10)    I think this movie was great but there are a lot of mistakes in it:  1. There is no action in the movie  2. The movie is about a couple who have a fight in the park because of some argument between the husband and wife  3. The wife takes the man and runs away  4. When the wife is running away the husband sees her  5. The husband takes his pistol and shoots at the wife but she escapes.  6. The police come to the park and arrest the husband. The woman is seen  7. When they find the wife they realize that she was not the person who had run away  and that she had been kidnapped by her own husband.  and this movie is not that good, it is just not the best  It's funny though.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________ I saw this on opening night at the Tribeca Film Festival, and I think that's what I enjoyed about it most about it. I am not sure if it was the acting, or the plot that got me. It is really hard to describe. It seems like it is trying to do something new, but I can't quite figure out how it's going to work. It was a very dark movie, and that's the most exciting thing about it, but it is so dark. It's hard to watch, but that's why it works. The story is very complicated and has some amazing performances. I hope to see it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ _______________________ ____________________  Story: A young couple are in love and they have a lot of fun together. Then, one night, the young woman is found dead. The young man's name is John. It is then that the husband and wife start to see the other as evil and that their love is just a facade to hide a deep hatred.  Characters: The movie does not make any great effort to portray the characters. It does have some good one-liners but they are a bit repetitive. The most likable character is the husband.  a man who is trying to protect his wife but is unable to do so. The movie is about his attempts to cope with his wife's death. , an ex-con, who is working for the family. He wants to prove himself as a better man by killing the couple and then himself. . He was also an ex member of the CIA and his mission is to prove that the CIA is not evil. The acting is okay but nothing special. There is not much action in this movie. It has a good plot but the movie could have been much better if the film had better acting. I would like to thank my friend for letting me see this movie and I think I will come back to see it again.

Well, the movie was a hit and a half and there were some funny scenes. But the only good thing about this movie is that it was funny. It was a good looking movie, so I thought it was worth a look. But, it was a pretty dull movie. The only thing that kept me going through the whole movie was the scene where all the black students were watching the movie and then, all the white kids started laughing at how the black kids were doing all the fighting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ (1) The first half of the movie is really good. The movie has a good pace, the movie has some really great action scenes, the acting is great, and the movie really does have a good message. It starts out very serious and then at the end of the film, it really starts to get into some crazy fun and it makes you laugh. However, the end part of the script is not what makes the movie. The ending of the plot is so convoluted, that you can't follow it and it ends up being one long mess. The reason why I give the movie a 7/10 is because it has some great action sequences. I loved the final fight scene between the two robots, they were so fun to watch and it really brought a tear to my eye. However it's really sad to see that there are no more films from this director. I will definitely be watching another film by this director in the future but I would rather watch a movie with a message instead of one with such a complicated ending.  …

I was not happy to see that because it made the movie seem like a horror movie. The other thing was the acting. They were so bad and I can't even remember them.

I could never be in that situation and I wish it would have happened to me at a younger age. The movie had great acting and the movie was so good that I really enjoyed it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ It's a shame that the movie had to be ruined by a bad soundtrack and a poorly acting, and sometimes lame acting, cast. This movie is nothing but an exercise in pure trash and the acting is atrocious. They had no problem playing the role of the two kids who go on a journey to the jungle to kill a jungle demon, only to end up getting their heads chopped off. They do a poor job at making a character like this likable, and the director even tried to kill the character by having him killed off by a poisonous snake. I'm not saying that the snake was an evil spirit, but I guess it would have been nice if the director had spared a little bit of screen time for this guy who just wants to kill that snake. The other guy was just annoying, he was trying to be funny, but he kept saying stupid things, and he just annoyed me more and more. I would have loved to see more of the story, the jungle, the animals, and just the jungle in general. Overall, the movie was not that interesting. I didn't like it, but it wasn't bad.

They're all in a hurry to be there and leave and you don't care to learn much about them other than their names are on a list. I also don't like the fact that it takes 2.5 hours to get to the movie. When you're a fan of movies you know that you have to wait 2. 5 hours for a movie. This movie takes longer than that and that's a shame because it is a movie and it has the potential to be great.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie is a disappointment and I don't think that it deserves any of the five stars it has. The acting was terrible, I was expecting something more from Tom Cruise and it just wasn't there. I really felt sorry for his character and I think that there were so many scenes where it seemed that he was trying to make up for it with his acting, but it just didn't work. I don' t think that he deserves to be in the movie at all. The plot is just too confusing and the story was very hard to follow. There are so many twists and turns that it felt like a mess and it was hard to keep track of all of the characters and the plot lines. The only thing that I liked about the movie was the ending and the music, but those were only good things. Overall, I didn't think the movie had any good parts and it really just had so many bad parts. I think the film could have used some editing and some editing in editing would have made the movie much better.

If you want to see something that isn't really very good but also isn't bad either, check out "The Girl on the Train". It is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but is actually pretty interesting. It is a movie about a woman who falls in love with a guy on the train and falls in with a bad crowd. It has a pretty good cast and a very original plot. If you're into that kind of movie, you'll love it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Last House on the Left (1972) This movie was a classic when it was released. It was a horror movie, and a little bit of a comedy too, but not as much as the other films on this list. I've seen this movie a lot of times, but never got into it. I never had the courage to watch it. It seemed like a movie I had seen too many times, and was just a generic horror film. I finally decided to give it a try, and I didn't like it at all.  I have no idea how this film got made, or why it was made.  "My family and I have been watching this movie for years. We loved it. The story was interesting. I always knew there was a connection with the film, and with my family, but it took a while for it to hit home." The only thing that this movie has going for it is the music.   I thought this movie was just another horror movie.  There was something off about this movie, like I wasn't sure who I was watching. I think the director didn't know what he was doing either.  I think he was trying to make a movie that was too good, and too cheesy, and that's what you get.  "It has nothing to do with the house in the middle of nowhere in California. It has everything to do wit it."   This movie is just a bunch of old people talking about their lives.  Some people are funny, and some are not funny.  It's just an excuse to have old people talk.  The acting was really bad.  This is a movie with bad acting, and it's made by bad actors.  You can tell they didn't really want to be in this movie. They just wanted to say something.  These people were all the same.  One of them was supposed to be the president of the United States, but I think that's a bad actor too.  He was supposed be a millionaire, and he was the only person in the movie who had any money.  All the other people had no money. It really doesn't make sense.  Why is the president a millionaire?  The other characters are the same, and you can tell that they are all the characters from the same movie. If they were in different movies, they would look completely different.  No one is in this film who I want to see

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ Would you recommend this movie to a friend?: ______________________________ Why did you like it?: ______________________  I had no idea what I was getting into with this movie. I had seen it before as part of a movie night I attended with my brother and we decided to watch this film as a double feature. It's one of those movies where you just know that you're watching something that's going to be bad. It was so bad that I couldn't even sit through the first half of the film. The film begins with a close up of the face of a young girl, who is trying to keep her sister from crying in the front room of her house. She then cuts to the front of the house and we see her sister's dead body laying on the floor. The first scene of the movie then moves us to a prison where a group of young black men are getting ready to go out on a "shoot-out" with a rival gang of young white men. As the gang enters the house they are greeted by the sound of a gunshot. The white gang members rush to investigate and see the bodies of the black gang members, but they are too late to save them. It then cuts back to the young white gang, which are all in their underwear. They are then forced to go to the police station and fill out a report on their murder of the young black gang. It also cuts to another close up on a young black woman's face, which is clearly traumatized and crying. This young woman, named Celeste, is then shown crying and crying in her mother's arms as she tells her how much she loved her. This is the only scene I remember from the film, but it doesn't seem to last long. After the close up we are then shown the aftermath of the "shoot out", which we learn is a drug deal gone wrong. The gang members are shown on the ground covered in blood. We then cut back to Celeste's mother. She is talking to her husband about her child and how much he loves her. She tells him how she is sorry for killing those boys, but she is so sorry for what happened to them. Her mother then begins to cry as she says that her child died in a way she never thought possible. This was one of the worst scenes in the film and it was extremely hard to watch. I could not look away as I watched this.  The film then cuts into the white gang
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This movie is a disaster."  "This movie has no redeeming value whatsoever."  These are just some of the comments I have read on the Internet regarding the movie.  I've been a film lover since I was a child.  As a kid I watched a lot of Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons.  The Disney movie that I loved most of all was The Lion King.  My favorite movie in the whole movie series is Simba's Pride.  Simba is a pride of lions.  He goes through a lot to achieve the goal of becoming king of the pride.  To achieve this goal, he has to make a sacrifice.  In this movie, Simba has to take the throne from his father, Mufasa.  But when he does, he doesn't want to share the throne.  Mufasaa takes away Simba and forces him to walk in his place.  When Simba hears this, he does everything he can to stay as far away from his beloved father as possible.  So he gets a little stronger and stronger until he is able to stand on his own.  Eventually, he manages to kill Mufasu.  Then, after a while, he finds out that his father wasn't even dead.  His father is just a lion who wanted to become king and is now trapped in the body of a human.  Once Simba comes to this realization, he sets out to become the new king of his family and help the other lions. The Lion King is a very interesting movie.   The plot is great.  It is about the pride of the lions and the relationships that they have.  And it is a story that is very close to the life of Simba.   However, there are a couple of things that really don't work for me about this movie. 1.  What I really don`t like about this film is that Simba never really does anything right.  Whenever he makes a mistake, it seems to always be something that is just plain stupid.  For example, at the end of the movie, he goes back to his family to tell them the good news that he is king of them.  However, this is the most foolish thing that Simbas has ever done.  If you really think about it, the reason why Simba didn't want the throne to be his is because he has been trying to be human for years.  Now

The acting is all good but there are a few scenes that are a little too long. The music is also great and gives a good creepiness. The story is a little slow and the characters are a bit too thin. The film is great if you have the stomach for it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you don't know what you're getting into, you're probably going to have a bad time. This movie is a movie with a lot of action, and it is definitely a movie you will have to sit through for a few hours before you get to see the good parts.  The plot is a typical horror movie and is not something I would recommend to a young audience.  The movie follows a young man who is hired by his neighbor to kill an old woman that has lived in his house for years.  It is then revealed that the woman is the daughter of a wealthy man who lives next door.  This leads to a chase scene and then some pretty horrific scenes.   The movie starts out with the man killing the woman.  She dies and then the man discovers a note from the woman's husband who was also in the house.  He told him to kill the old woman. The man gets into his car and drives away.  Unfortunately he drives off the road and the car crashes into a tree.  Luckily he survives and he drives back to the house to see if the wife is still alive.  The wife is dead and the man kills himself.  Now this movie has some good parts and some pretty scary scenes.   I am sure this movie will not be for everyone.  I did not enjoy this movie but I did enjoy the scenes. The movie was not great but it wasn't bad either.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  I was very disappointed in this movie. I was expecting a more sophisticated and entertaining movie with some serious themes that could've been interesting, but the story was very weak. The film tries to tell us how a girl gets to the point where she's so in love with a guy she can't live without, that she becomes a slave to him, and the ending is so sad. The sex scenes were just so awful, and I felt so dirty afterwards. The story was like it was written by a teenager who didn't understand that he has to be in control of himself before he will get what he wants. I had so many sexual fantasies of him having sex with me, but it just wasn't possible. It made me feel dirty and embarrassed. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, but I still enjoyed it a lot. It has a very sad ending and the movie had a good beginning. It's not a good movie, but if you like sad and sad movies, you might enjoy it. ___________  R.I.P. to this movie, it was such a shame. The only reason it made it onto the list is because of the sad ending, but this was a terrible movie. The way the girl's story was told made me sick. I could never watch it again. It really made me cry in the end. I guess if you are a fan of a certain type of movie that doesn't really need much of a plot, you'll like this. If you don't like sad stories and don't really want to get into a story, don't watch it. This is the only movie I've seen where the only reason to see it is the ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** *********  I have a good memory and I remember that movie well. I saw it when I was a kid. The movie was okay, but it had some flaws. I think that it was filmed in the 70's. There was a time in our country when women couldn't work, they couldn't do any things. It was a hard time in this country. I was happy when I saw that movie, because it was a good movie. I like the actors. I don't know if they did anything wrong, but I know that they made some mistakes. The main problem is that there was a little girl in that movie.  Helpful for your movie-watching pleasure: ***************** ******************  Hahahaha, this was one of the worst movies I've seen. The best part of the movie is the dialogue. But, when I look at the movie, it's so ridiculous. The girl was playing the role of the main character. When the main characters talk, they make a lot of noise. I'm not even joking, it was very funny. But then, I heard that it's the worst movie ever made.  "I don't understand, what are you talking about, you are the main actor?" "Yes, that's right, I'm the main." I don`t know why this movie was made. I just can`t understand the story. I never watched it. I've only seen a few other movies. This movie is so bad. I really don't get it. It has a really good story, but why was it made? It's so bad, you won`t see it again. It's bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ The film opens in a snowy, desolate landscape. The camera tracks through the snow with a sense of dread as we see a couple walking, and it's not long before the husband is struck by a car. He is bleeding heavily and the wife looks up to see that he's dead. A couple hours later, the wife finds the husband's wallet and begins to investigate. The wife is a local who has been working in a small factory for the last year. She knows everything there is to know about the company, but no one is telling her anything about the husband. The woman knows she is being followed, and she knows that the man who was killed in the car was a key employee. She soon realizes that the car is not a common model, but something special. It is a Ford Fairlane. _______________________________________________________________________ The Fairlane has an interesting history. The company was founded in 1925 by a group of ex-Army officers who were inspired by the Chrysler Corporation. The group decided that a smaller, cheaper car was necessary to compete with the larger, more expensive cars made by the larger American car companies. The Fairlanes were very popular in the early days, but they were quickly overtaken by the newer, larger, heavier cars, and in 1939 Chrysler took over the company and began production of the Model A. This car was the one that started Chrysler's famous "Death Wish" advertising campaign, and the Fairlane was discontinued in 1941. The Model A was also used in World War II as a tank destroyer, and was produced until 1945. In 1947, Chrysler made a new version of the Fairlane, the Model B. This model had a smaller engine, less power, and a smaller body. Chrysler also redesigned the car and gave it the name "Cadillac" in 1951. This was the last model of the fairlane. The Cadillac Fairlane had a longer wheelbase, and used a different, smaller engine than the original model. Chrysler sold the Fairlades as an inexpensive two-door car, and many of them ended up in the hands of suburbanites who wanted a smaller car that would go unnoticed by the local police. It was only in the mid-1960s that a revival of the car began. It wasn't until the 1970s that Chrysler brought out a new model, the Chrysler 200. This new model had been designed to be more attractive and smaller than the Fairlanes. In the early 1970s, Chrysler began
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________  Stars: Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Laurence Olivier  Director: John Frankenheimer  Year: 1964  Reviewed from: The Criterion Collection  I never knew about this movie until I saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival. It was just a very short, weird film about a guy who is a magician. He goes to England to try to get a bit of money. He doesn't have much money and he has a magician who is also a magician and he shows him how to do tricks. I think that the first magician is a man named James and he's also a friend of Sean Connely's father. So there are two of them. The whole thing is a bit odd. It's very much in a weird time, a weird era. The man who's been doing the magic is named Connery. He's an American and his whole thing in this film is that he's from England. He was born there. He speaks English and he speaks it really well. And he's the only person in England that does that. And the way that he talks is very, very English. But he's really a big con man. He makes money out of people. He'll take a girl on the street and he'll just say, "Look, I'm here to sell you something." And he'll say, you've got to buy a lottery ticket and you've only got a few seconds to decide. And if you don't buy it, he'll give you a thousand pounds and that will buy a lot of tickets.  And he will buy any ticket. And there is a lot to buy. And a lot are bought by women. And they'll get a ticket, and they'll come in and Sean Conner will do a show for them and they can just sit there and he will play all these magic tricks on them. And you're just laughing your head off, thinking, "What are these people doing?" And then you're also thinking, wow, they've been taken for a ride. And I guess you get what you pay for. , from the IMDB synopsis:The first magician in England is a good friend of Connery's father, and his own son. He is also the only Englishman who does the magic. The first magician does not like Connery because he thinks that Connery is an American, and he doesn't like Conner because he's too

The movie "The Last Dragon" was a great movie that i love to watch, but the movie has a bad story line, so if you have not seen the movie and you are a fan of Dragon Ball series, i advise you to watch it only after watching the Dragon Ball Super TV series. the movie "Dragon Ball Z" had a good story line with great action, but in the movie they made some mistakes like not make Gohan fight in a dragon ball, so the movie was a good movie for those who like Dragon Ball, but not for the fans of Dragon ball series, so i recommend you to do a watch "Dragonball Z" only.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ರೃ  Read the full review at filmreviewjournal.com  11/22/16  Hollywood is full of talented actors, but the one who has made it big in the film industry is Riz Ahmed. In the last couple of years, he has done several successful films including, "Kick," "Lights Out," "Moonlight" and "No Escape." He is now starring in "PK," a drama based on a true story.  The film opens in the world of an ex-CIA agent who works as a consultant to the Pakistan government. He has to travel to Afghanistan to investigate a suicide bombing that killed over 100 people. In Afghanistan, he finds that the US government is planning a strike against the terrorist groups of the Taliban and the Haqqani network.    In the beginning of the film, Ahmed plays an ex American CIA agent who is looking for a way to get back into the CIA. This mission takes him to Afghanistan where he is joined by the local Afghan government agent (Dawood Ibrahim) and his young Pakistani friend.   This film is a real drama that unfolds like a real thriller. We follow the CIA agent on his mission to get information about the terrorist attack and the Pakistani government's plans. This film is also based on the true story of one of the worst attacks of the war in Afghanistan. The film focuses on the life of the families of the victims. It also focuses on an incredible performance from an actor who is not known for his acting.  : )
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This is a movie I can say is very, very bad. I would rather give it one star because it is so bad that I just can't. I mean, I don't know how the filmmakers made this movie. I'm not sure if they were just out of their minds or what. The actors, while acting their asses off, all have to have an awful performance. This film is all about the sex, and that's all it is. I understand that a movie is supposed to be about a man who is in love with his wife, but this movie is not about that. This movie is about sex. If the filmmakers wanted to make a porn film they would have called it "Sex and the City." I can't believe they went to the trouble of making this film, because it was made with such an obvious goal. The only thing I really enjoyed about this film was when I saw the sex tape. I was surprised to find that the tape is not the only sex tape on the guy's phone. I also liked that this film is very well made and the sex scenes are very hot. However, this film will not give you an orgasm. I don;t know how they made the sex so hot in the beginning, but I don t think it was done well. I found it to be extremely boring, because the sex was so easy. And I mean that in the best way possible. I couldn t help but watch the movie as I drove to work today. I have a headache.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********** This movie sucks. You don't need to know any of this to enjoy this movie. The plot is not very well written and is not well thought out. If you have watched any of the other horror movies, you will probably understand what is happening, but it is not what you expect. This movie takes you to a place where you do not want to go. The character's are not good and the story doesn't really go anywhere. If this movie was made by the same people that made the other films, it would be even better. ***** This movie is a rip off of the horror film "House of 1000 Corpses". The first film is a very good movie and this movie is not much different. **** This movie should have stayed in a mental hospital, it should have been a mental institution and was given a "B" rating. It should not have been made and given a R rating. This is the worst horror movie ever made. The acting is awful and the acting is terrible when the actors don't speak. If it were made by a better director and cast, it could have been good. This was a horrible mistake.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  When I think of the first time I ever saw this movie, I think about my uncle and how we sat around and watched it together. We had a lot of fun watching it together, and it's funny how you can just see the funny parts when the movie is going on. The movie is so slow and boring, you really can't take it all in. If you are going to watch this movie and you have a young child, then just turn it off. The plot is so ridiculous that it is hard to even believe this is really a movie about a girl who just so happens to be in love with a monster. There is a reason this movie is rated R and not PG-13, and I think it is the fact that they are so bad about explaining the movie and how to interpret the dialogue. This is one of those movies where you have to watch it again to make sense of it. It's not even funny. If this movie were a movie in a foreign language, then I would have thought it was really funny, but it's in English, and there is nothing funny about this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!, a bad script, and a bad director. But, if you do it right, it is worth watching. There is a movie in there for everyone. It will not make you angry. This is the film for those who like the feeling of an action movie. It is fast, violent and violent at the same time. There are some nice action sequences, but this is not the real movie. This one is made to entertain you for a short period of time. I hope that the movie will be made into a long movie and make a movie of it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________.  A man tries to be a hero but is killed by a mob of angry mobs and a crazed cult. The story and the script are all in the hands of an unprofessional writer who has never written anything like this movie and who doesn't seem to have any idea about what makes a story great. It's all too easy for the characters to act like a bunch of idiots and make all kinds of stupid mistakes. I have been reading some of the reviews of this movie, and it's all of them written by people who haven't seen it. I can't even tell you how many times I have to stop and ask myself what the hell is going on in this movie. You'll find out after you see it. The acting is a mess and there is no way it could be made any better, and this movie is just full of bad ideas that no one seems to care about. If this movie was made by a real good actor I don't think the movie would be that bad, but it's not. This is a film for people who hate good actors. This movie was a total failure and I hope no one sees it.   I gave this movie a 1.5 star rating.  a film review by John Z.   a film by William G.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You've just been given a bad film.  The actors are horrible, the dialogue is horrendous, and the story is incoherent.  So why would you ever want to watch this movie?  Well...  The main character,  Joe, is a tough and self-centered soldier.    He's also an alcoholic and a misogynist.    He also likes to wear his uniform proudly, and his wife (played by Marjorie Griffiths) is not pleased with his behavior.  In other words, Joe is a pretty horrible guy.  The film begins with Joe making a fool of himself at a party.  He's trying to get some alcohol for his buddies, and when the hostess doesn't give him what he wants, he's outraged and decides to beat the crap out of her.  Joe doesn't do a very good job of explaining why he's so upset, and instead of apologizing he simply starts beating the shit out of the host and the whole party turns into a brawl.  So the movie is pretty much Joe doing a lot of dumb stuff and then getting beat up.  It doesn't help that Joe has a really weird voice for a man his size.  This movie is a disaster.  A lot of the acting is terrible, the acting coach was fired after one day, and Joe's dialogue is incohesive.  But it's the story that really sucks.  Here's what happens: Joe and his friends are on a train trip to Las Vegas.  Their trip is cut short when Joe and some other soldiers are attacked by a group of Indians.  They manage to get off the train, but Joe is seriously injured.  Then he has to fight his way through a bunch of Indians to get to the hospital.  Meanwhile, the Indians are running around with the dead bodies of the soldiers they've killed.  When Joe finally gets to the clinic, he finds that his wife is having a hard time accepting his injuries.  And the doctors tell him that he'll never be able to walk again.  She wants to go home and take care of their children.  Unfortunately, Joe and Marjory (played brilliantly by Marcella Arguello) are stuck with the kids.  Eventually, Joe decides to have sex with his wife in order to get his revenge on the Indians.   I have a bad feeling about this movie.  I hope it's better than it
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________  "It's a long story, so I'll be brief: When I was growing up, my parents' house was infested with a kind of bug that turned into a giant, fleshy monster, and it was never satisfied. It ate everything that got in its way, including the occasional baby. My parents tried everything: they sprayed it with DDT, they shot a couple of bullets at it, and they tried to bury it. But it just got stronger, and more and more aggressive. It would go after them, and my dad's car would get flattened. Finally, they moved away. My mom and dad had a home-made trap, which they set out in the garden and left open, and the monster would crawl out at night and start attacking the chickens. They would kill a few, and then the monster could get them all. Eventually, my mother set up a trap, and one night, when my sister and I were asleep, she was attacked by the monster. I remember seeing the monster get up and walk into the house. My dad was there when it happened, and he heard the screams and ran into the room. He looked out the window, and saw the monster standing in the middle of the street. The monster walked over to the house, and opened the front door. I don't know if my dad heard the monster scream, or if it came out of the house and was just looking for an easy meal, but the monster came up and attacked him. I guess it didn't care that my dad was the only person in the house that night, because it killed him before it even got to him." -Tom  (Note: this is a true story)  ___________________________________________________________________________  4. The Last Starfighter (1981) ... and The Last Jedi, the newest movie in the franchise, is also a good one.  In this movie, a group of pilots are sent to rescue a group that was attacked and wiped out by the Empire.    The film is based on the novel by Paul M. Sammon.   I have seen a couple reviews where people thought that this movie was "boring", but to me it was one of the best Star Wars films. The action is fast and brutal. The scenes where the pilots have to fight off TIE fighters were incredible.  and the last two acts of the film, when they are
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ (See all bad movie reviews here) (See also: The worst movies of all time )  The worst movie I have ever seen. I have watched all kinds of movies and this is the worst one. This movie is the complete opposite of every movie I saw. I watched it to see how the actors looked in a movie with no acting and they looked like they were being shot from behind. It was absolutely disgusting.  I'm just a fan of movies, I enjoy them and watch them over and over. I thought this movie was not even worth watching.  in a nutshell, this is a movie you watch to get over someone and it didn't work. This is a bad film and the actors are horrible. The ending was so stupid, i was so annoyed when they said the ending and ended the movie so rudely.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ Check out this review by the movie-reviewers at www.moviereviewer.net! I am not going to waste my time going over all the horrible things that happened in this movie. _______________________________________________ The movie opens with a bunch of people sitting in a big, empty room. The room is dark and the only light comes from the window. The door opens and a man walks in. He is wearing a black suit, black gloves, and a mask. He approaches a young boy. He tells him that he is going to make him a real man. He shows him a long wooden stick. The boy touches it. It feels really good. He asks if he can have a taste of it. The man says, "No, not yet." The boy asks, "Well, what do you mean not yet?" The man replies, "The boy needs a bit more training. But you will get it soon." The man walks away. The child says, 'My name is Sam.' The man looks back and says, "'Sam' is a good name for you." The film then cuts to another young boy who is sitting in an empty room in a room with no walls. There are many doors in this room, but none are open. The young boy is wearing jeans and a T-shirt. He has a bandage around his head and has a rope around his neck. There is a door on the right side of the room. There's a mirror on the wall to his left. The other door is closed. There seems to be a door in the wall in front of him. _________________________ I don't know about you, but I had never seen this movie before. The trailer looked very, very cool. There were two kids in this trailer. The first was a pretty young boy in a hoodie. He had a bandaged head and a rope wrapped around his body. He was standing on a wooden bench with a wooden stick between his legs. He seemed to be having a very intense conversation with his older brother. The second boy was a bit older and was dressed in a white shirt with black stripes on it. He also had a rope attached to his legs and his hands. He stood on the other wooden bench. The third boy was in a black t-shirt and jeans. The only thing that seemed to fit him was a black hat. The movie trailer made me really want to see this movie when I was in my early

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________   "I know it's a very dark movie. It's very depressing and you just feel that you want to scream. You just want to go home and go back to sleep."   The last few years have seen a great influx of indie horror movies that are truly scary. But none are quite like The House.   This movie has no dialogue, and the only dialogue we ever hear is the sound of the screen. The only sound is the sounds of the house. The movie has an atmosphere of isolation. And the way that the house is constructed gives a great atmosphere. The house is so constructed, that the windows and doors have no locks. You have no idea where the door is until it's too late. And when the house closes, it's as if time has stopped.   (NOTE: I've heard that the sound in this movie is not the same as the movie.)   I think the best part about this movie was that it was so suspenseful. The film doesn't hold your hand. You're on your own. The story isn't really about a haunted house, but more about a family. It was scary and suspenseful all the way through.   "I don't know how they did it, but they managed to make it sound like the sound you make when you have a really bad dream."   The ending was a bit predictable, but the film was still so good. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good scare. I would also recommend this to those who like horror movies. I have seen some pretty good horror movies recently. And this movie had a lot of suspense. The sound was great, and it was creepy. But it didn't have a big jump scare or any other kind of shock. But if you're in the mood for a good haunted house movie, then this is a good one.  , Rated R, 86 Minutes

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! This movie is so terrible, the acting is awful and they don't even care about the characters they are portraying. There is a scene where a cop is killed and he's being put in the ground and the guy on the phone tells him "he was a real bad man". That's it. No, I don't care that he was a bad man, that's not how it goes. This is a movie about a cop who's partner gets murdered, the guy who got murdered is a murderer and is never caught. Then there's a detective who is a killer, he's also never caught because he kills and gets away with it. The last two people on the scene are a cop and a killer. Then they shoot up a house, the cops are out looking for them, the killer gets away, the cop is shot in the shoulder and gets captured. The cop is then shot in his shoulder and is captured. So what happens? The cop's partner dies. This doesn't mean he was bad, but he's a murderer, he killed his own partner. This movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.   So this movie is a horrible mess, but there is a little redemption at the end. A little something at the very end that says something. It says that even though the police department is corrupt, it doesn't really matter. The police are corrupt and the killer will still get away with murdering people. The cops aren't corrupt and don't have any respect for the people who protect them. So even though corrupt, even though they kill people, even if they are murderers, they are still people. Even though they have the most evil actions in this movie, even they aren't bad. They are people. They have families, kids, wives, partners. So I think it's good that they are shown that even if the cops and the cops don't show any respect to people, that doesn't make the people mean. And the killer should not have killed his partner, even the cop would have let him go. But they let him walk and that's what really shows how evil they are.   of course this movie also has some great music and some great scenes in this film. The song they played at the beginning was really great. It has a really great guitar riff and a really awesome vocal by the song. The scene where the cop and his partner are talking about how they need to get to the crime scene is really good. They're

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* A film which is nothing but a pile of garbage. It has nothing to do with reality or science, it has no real purpose in the plot, it does not even have any plot at all. This is not a sci-fi movie but a story about a group of criminals and their leader. I am not going to explain more, just watch it and you will see what I mean. I don't think that this film has anything to do at all with the real world. This movie has nothing with the laws of nature, the weather, and everything else that we are used to. It's just a bunch of bad actors and poor writing. It is one of those films that I thought were bad but then I watched it and I was not sure if I would be able to watch it again. It really is one long boring movie with nothing to it. If you want to see something with a bad plot and bad acting, this is the one for you. I hate to say this but this film should be called "Pile of crap movie". If you're going to watch this movie, do not let it get you. Don't waste your time and don't let it ruin your day.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This is what happens when you allow the writers to dictate what the movie should be about."  That's how the movie is supposed to be, in my opinion.  The whole movie, with its over-the-top acting, over-played dialogue, and over-long scenes, just seems to be there to make the movie a bit more dramatic than it actually is.  "I'm a woman and I want to be raped by a gorilla."    I don't know about you, but that sounds like a plotline that is going to have the characters talking about something other than being raped by some gorilla.   I've never really found that part of a movie to be very interesting, but this movie really wants to play up that aspect of the story.  I'll give it this, though: the scene in the theater with the two actresses and the other guys in the movie really was very interesting.  When the two girls came on stage, and one was dressed in the white, they were all excited and excited.  The two actresses were so nice and innocent, I really enjoyed watching them.  However, the two other guys, one dressed in a red jacket and the second in a black one, really got into it.  They weren't really acting at all, but were just having some sort of a fight or some sort, and they were just very aggressive.  It's a movie that has a lot of characters and a lot going on in it, and it really can't get much better than that.  And I'm not even sure if they're supposed to act or not, but I did find that I liked watching the two of them fight with each other, especially when the two black guys started throwing the white girls drinks.  Finally, I'm sure a lot will agree with me that the last scene in this movie is a pretty good ending, and I'm just glad I saw it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this was a bad film. I thought it was a cheap film and the script was very lame. The acting was awful. The story was lame and I thought the director should have tried to change it. It was like the actor who played the character said the lines and the director said it. The actor also did not do anything with it. He looked like a kid who was trying to act like a grown up.  The director said that he was trying too hard to act but the actor could not act. I did not like the film at all. It just did not have any plot to it.   2/10   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "In the end, the movie just doesn't work. This is a movie about a guy who lives with his wife in a tiny apartment, and that's about it. He gets sick and then goes on vacation with his family, which means there's no chance for his wife to see him and get to know him. The wife then leaves him for another man, and then he falls in love with a woman who's also his cousin. It's a movie, so we don't get to see the story unfold, but I was sick to my stomach, the entire time. The acting is terrible and I was frustrated all the time. I wanted to know why my wife was so upset and why she was having an affair with another man.  I wanted to feel something for him, but this movie isn't about him. It has no heart."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________  Cindy Lee – "The Last Girl" (1989)  This is a bad romance, even by the standards of the 1980's. It's so bad that even it's own director, David Fincher, admits that the film has some serious flaws, which include a poorly choreographed sex scene and a bad performance from Cindy Lee. The only redeeming quality of the film is its soundtrack by the group The Chemical Brothers, which has some great songs, such as "The Great Destroyer," and "Tearing Me Apart."  The movie is set in the 1980s and follows a couple who have an affair and then later divorce. This couple, played by Lee and her then husband, Patrick Swayze, is married to a former model (Swayze), who is a former drug addict (Lee). They are living together and Lee is the one who has the affair. The rest of the movie follows their lives and how their relationship goes downhill after the affair ends. The movie doesn't even take itself seriously. It doesn't really show how it is that the two eventually divorce. It also doesn't show how they deal with their divorce in the past, and it's hard to believe that this was filmed in the early 80's.  What's worse is the fact that the movie is completely terrible. I don't know why it was made, but the movie makes no sense. The scenes are badly shot, and the plot is totally nonsensical. There are no real emotions in this movie. Even the movie's ending is so bad. The characters are all acting as if they are in a sitcom. The plot is a mess, and Lee's character is just a bad lead.  a bad, poorly made movie (1/10) , (10/10).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this is one of those movies that really had a good idea, and I just wish it was better executed. The idea is very interesting and a great premise, but the execution is pretty atrocious. There is a huge difference between the premise and execution. The concept is great, and the movie is pretty much a great idea, but its execution is terrible. It is a very confusing movie, and at one point the movie seems to be heading in a good direction. But then something completely changes, and just when you think you are in good hands, the movie goes in a totally different direction, and it is a complete mess. There are too many plot twists and inconsistencies to list them all, but if you look through the whole movie you will find that the movie tries to make you believe something, but it never quite works out. The movie has some interesting and fun ideas, but this movie was too far off from where it needs to be, and was very disappointing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ I think it was the worst film ever made. And it is not only the worst movie ever made, it is also one of the worst movies ever made in general. This movie is like a giant black hole, sucking you in, only to drag you down with it and never let up. You just sit there and think, "Where am I going with this?". And then, you just keep thinking about it, thinking about where you were. This is so much crap. I could not believe how bad this was. The actors are so bad, and the scripts are so terrible. It was like they wrote this movie so they could get some quick cash out of it. And they did. The acting was so bad and the acting style so silly. The characters were so stupid. I thought it was just going to be a comedy. And then they would just fall apart. The plots were ridiculous. They were just so bad. It is so sad that this was a big box office hit. There is no way it will ever be on DVD. The only reason it made it past the first week is because the first two weeks were the best weeks. And there were two movies on that first week, so there was a lot of buzz about it. Then it disappeared from the theaters. So now it is just another terrible movie. This film is so bad that it is hard to believe it was even made. I do not recommend this movie at all. This could be the worst thing to ever happen to Hollywood. If it was made today, they would never let it out of the door. I think if this movie was released in 1987, I think they would have pulled the plug on it before it even went into production. I would rather see a movie that has a good story, a good director, and a good cast and a plot that makes sense than this. This was like watching the bad dreams of an insane person. It just is so dumb and ridiculous. I will never watch this again. I am not a fan of this movie. And I will probably never watch a movie again.  Sean Paul - Slap Trap  by iPromote4Free  Reggae
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. This is the kind of movie that makes you want to get your butt off of a couch and head to the cinema. I was not expecting to be hooked up to a machine but that is exactly what happened. The first few minutes were just a bit boring but once I saw the movie and the sex scenes, my expectations were sky high. It was just too good to be true. The sex scenes were great, but even more so when you watch them with someone else. The main girl was hot and she got to have her way with the guy too. I thought that was very good. The movie was great, the sex was amazing and the whole thing was well-written. If you like big boobs, big dicks, big cocks and sex, you will love this movie. You will have a hard time believing that it was made in the 90's. You'll definitely want to have a big butt plug ready, because you'll have a great time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________________________________________________________________ 1.5/5 - The plot is bad, the characters are stupid, the plot doesn't make sense, the action is bad and it is over too quickly. Not worth a dime of your time, and I didn't like the "villain". The movie was made in 1997, it's not good, I guess it is good because the movie is good enough to sell tickets, but it is a big waste of time. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. __________________________________________________________________ 2/5 (Bad) - The film was directed by Stephen F. Cohen, the director of "The Ice Storm". It is a story about a group of scientists who are trying to develop a new virus that can cure all the diseases, the virus that has been around for thousands of years. When they make a mistake, the scientist's who make the mistake are put in the lab and are infected with the virus. The scientist who was infected, named "Norman", he goes crazy and tries to kill the others. The movie has a lot of problems, mainly the fact that it was made at the beginning of 1997, and it has a bad script. I didn�t like it, and for a good reason, the script is bad. I felt that it would be much better if it was done in the early 1990s, but since it was in 1997 it doesn�t have that same kind of feeling. The director doesn't seem to have any idea what he is doing and he doesn�ts even try to explain it. It makes the film hard to understand. The acting in this film is also bad, and in a way the acting is bad because the acting in the film is very bad. The only good actor in this movie is the guy who plays Norman, who is supposed to be the villain. _____________________________________________ 1.75/5  See all my reviews
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ I love to see movies like this. They are a great example of how movies can go off the rails, but they can also go in the other direction. It is a movie that I have seen so many times before, but still find new things to love about it. This is a classic story of a man and his wife. They work together at the same place, but don't get along. They never see each other. But as they get older, they become close. And then he asks her out to dinner. I was always surprised that this is a common theme in a romance. I think I may have seen this one a few times before. But still I found myself very surprised by this film. It has everything a good story should have. It gives you a good lesson on how to show affection. There are a few twists and turns that make you think. The acting is great, and it is not at all boring. There is a nice music score. And I love the special effects. I loved how the man's wife got dressed up and how she and her husband talked. I enjoyed this movie. I would recommend this movie to any person that loves a good romance.

(Rated R for language, some violence and nudity)  I HATE this movie. It has the same themes as many of the movies I have seen. It is about people who are too good for their lives and they live lives of excess, violence and drugs. It makes it really hard to watch. This movie has no redeeming value. It isn't funny or entertaining. It doesn't have a redeeming quality. It just has no merit at all. The film is simply trash and it is a pity that Hollywood is making this crap out of the same tired story lines.  and I hate how the story was told. I mean, it's not the first time a movie is told like this. It was done in the 80s and it was so bad. It really makes you wonder if Hollywood is ever going to learn from it. I know this movie is a box office flop. I would have never thought it would be a hit, but I'm glad it is. I just wish that they would have made this movie in black and white instead of the crappy color that they chose to use.    I gave this a C and I think that is fair. I have no interest in seeing this movie again. , Rated R for violence and language and some nudity.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ಡ - April 23, 2009My brother-in-law and I were watching this movie and i asked him, "What was the point of all that?" he said, "its a really bad movie but if you watch it in a movie theater with the lights off and with a good surround sound system you can see the director's point of view." so i watched it in the movie theater and was very disappointed. there is one scene in the film where the kids are trying to break the mirror off a car, they got to it and the car crashed. the kids were ok and didnt get hurt but the driver who was driving the car, got killed and the kids fell off the car and died. my brother in law told me that if they had just put the kids on the ground and broken the mirror with their shoes or something the kids would have been fine and he would of been ok with it. this was a movie that was made for the money. I would not of seen it, but i would of if my brother- in-law was around.  Reviewer: J.M. - favorite favorite favorite - December 14, 2008  Subject: Bad Movie My brother and I loved this movie as kids. We thought it was great. When we were old enough to understand that it was a bad idea, we didn't go to see it. We were also too young to understand the message.   Now my son is about 7 years old. He told me this is a bad example of religion and that it's a bad thing to have an afterlife.   of course this was when we were both teenagers and our friends were having sex. I'm sure if we were teenagers we would have thought it a good idea. Now it seems to me that it is a good example of how religion can be destructive. It was a very powerful lesson for my son. I think it is important that we do not let our kids think that this is good for them. I've heard that the best way to stop them from thinking this way is to show them the bad side of religion. I hope this helps. - December 15, 2008Bad Movie  Reviewed by: julietharp - - June 23, 2008

It was like watching a bunch of kids play hide and seek. The only reason that i even got to watch this was because of the trailer that they put out. But they missed the mark on this one. I am not sure what it is about this movie that makes it so bad. The acting was so bad, the story was so lame, the character was so uninteresting, and the plot was so stupid.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ The movie ___________ is a bad. The actors are all good, but they should stop trying to do the same thing over and over and keep the characters original. The movie is about a man who is a lawyer and a woman who is the mother of a child. The man is a very nice guy who is trying to be a father figure to the mother, but she doesn't like it and she tries to change the father to her way of thinking. The mother is very jealous of her daughter and when she meets the father, she tries on many occasions to kill him. It seems the movie has some romance in it, but the movie does not follow any romance. The characters of the movie are all very dull and do not develop any character at all. The story seems very strange because the man is trying for his daughter, but he tries very hard to make the mother his wife, and when the mother refuses to go for it, he tries to kill the man. But when the man gets angry, the mother starts to get very jealous and he tries several times to kill her, but is not able to. This movie seems very sad, and a good lawyer and his wife are the best thing in it. However, the characters of this movie are not worth a dime of my time. The film was very good and a very good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!   I'm not a big fan of horror films, but this one was pretty much the definition of bad. I had heard about it from a friend but thought it was the same as most of the horror films I've seen over the years. When I saw it I was not pleased.   The movie starts off with a shot of a young man on the front porch of a house. He looks out the window at the house and then turns and walks away. The next shot is of a girl running down the street. The girl is running away from a man in a mask. She runs through a house and jumps into the pool of water in the backyard. The pool of pool water is full of blood and there are a lot of bodies of what looks like dead people in it.  ,The girl jumps in the pool and is then thrown in the deep end of the pool. She is then pulled up out of the water by the killer. The killer is then seen stabbing the girl's face. He stabs her until she loses consciousness and then pulls out her heart and puts it into a bottle. Then he throws it in the ocean.   is then heard screaming in the background. The sound is not loud enough to be a scream. This screams is from a girl who is screaming for help. The screaming is very distorted and it sounds as if she is talking and screaming. This is a very creepy and disturbing scream.   the killer then goes to the girl, pulls her into the house, and rapes her. The screams and blood are heard again, this time it is very loud. I did not like this film very much. I would have loved to have seen more. This movie was definitely not worth seeing.  . The movie was about as bad as you can get, even for a horror film. The only thing I can think of to say about this movie is that it was not scary at all. I have seen a lot worse horror films. This was just not as bad.   a film about a girl with a broken heart. This girl is going to a big city to find a man she has feelings for and then he will die. It starts off very promising and the story of how she finds him and his life is really good. She meets the guy, he likes her and they get a place to stay. It is just not long before he is murdered. The rest of the movie is about the girl trying to find the killer, who
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The best part of this movie is the trailer.  This movie was a waste of money.  The main character is a hot blonde who has no problem in having sex with random men and women.  This is the type of women who will try and steal your wallet, then run to your car to make you pay for it.   They look great in their sexy costumes and sexy makeup, and are usually very sexy.  They are very beautiful women who love to have sex and are always in need of a good fucking.  But I have seen this movie a lot of times and I have never seen them this way.  When I watch the movie I do not even think about the sex that these girls have.  It just seems like they are there for the money. And I hate this type of girls, I think they are always trying to steal your money.   The whole movie is just hot, you get to see a hot babe go to a restaurant to get a little extra money and the girls get into a lot more trouble.  After this movie I felt like I wasted my time.  I think I would have rather watched a better movie like The Bling Ring.  This movie does not even make sense to me.  In the end it just ends with a very sad and depressing ending.  What I did like about this movie was the hot blonde girl who is always in the sexiest clothes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* This movie was horrible. I can't even remember any of the characters from it, and I'm sure there were lots of them, but all I remember is that they were all kind of fat. The actors were all just really bad, and the movie just seemed to drag on. The plot wasn't anything special. There was a guy who was going to save his wife from the police, and he got in a fight with some bad guys, who were just bad guys in general. The cops found out he was a cop and took him down and took away his gun and his badge, and then the bad guys went after the wife. But they didn't really do anything to hurt her, so she decided to go after the bad guy and he was in jail, so they went back to the wife and her friend and she just decided that the husband and wife should get married. It didn't make any sense to me. It seemed like they just made it up as they went along. The whole thing was a waste of my time, and my money.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Jul 21, 2017 4:47 PM By John Haldeman By John  I don't really think this movie is a great movie. I think this is a film that's just being marketed as a good movie. And if you're trying to sell a movie to a large audience, a movie like this isn't really going to get it. If you're going to make a movie about a group of kids, they shouldn't all look the same. They should all have unique personalities. They shouldn't have the same hair. They don't all play the same sports. They can't all have the exact same sense of humor. But they should all be like one another. And this movie fails in that. The lead, Zach, looks like a teenager. The kids who are around him all look young. And they all look alike. They're all about 17-19. They all look and act like they're about to have a party. This isn't even a movie with a real plot. There isn't any story. It's just a bunch of kids having fun and making movies. If there was a plot, I think the plot would have worked. But even if there was, the story would be lost in all the humor. The jokes are terrible. But there's no story to be found. I'm just trying to put a negative spin on this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________   I was pretty excited to see the new version of "The Mummy" when it opened in theaters this weekend. It's the first movie in the franchise in 15 years, and I really loved the first one. The plot was intriguing and the characters all had a very believable, well developed back story.  But I was very disappointed by this one. I was expecting more of the same from the first, but this one feels like it was rushed and just slapped together. The actors are all just not good, and the monsters are all lame. Even the ending was bad. . The characters all have some kind of supernatural force that they use to protect themselves and their families. And I really love that. But here it just feels like a waste of time. There's no reason for them to protect anyone, and we just see them protecting themselves from monsters. The monster scenes in the movie are boring and poorly done. There are too many scenes that are basically just showing the monsters beating up people and destroying stuff. And the one scene that does show something is the very end when the characters are talking and all of a sudden they turn into monsters. They were just showing their powers, but now they are fighting the monsters, and they turn back into humans and then we get that scene. There is a reason why this movie was rushed. And it just felt like a rushed movie. It was just like all the characters just got their powers because it's in the movies and they all get to do this one thing to save the world. But it just didn't feel like that was a real part of the movie. The film felt rushed and it didn't seem like there was enough time spent on the characters and their back stories. I think there could have been more story to the characters, but there were just way too many plot points that didn't have anything to do with what was going on with the characters. It just felt rushed.    . I loved the characters in the first "Mummy" too. But they are all so different here. In this one they all have the same power. They all can turn into a snake and have a bunch of powers that they don't use very often. And in the end they all just want to get back to their human bodies. I guess I am supposed to like that. It makes sense. But the problem is that they just don't seem to want to. Even after they turn and go back

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ I was really excited to see this movie. I've never seen it before and I was hoping for something different. I went in to see it in the theater and was told that it was a family movie about a man and his daughter. I wasn't sure what that meant, but I went and saw it anyway. When I got into the theater, I was so nervous because I was unsure if this was a movie I wanted to see. I don't know if it was because I'm not a huge fan of horror, but the first few minutes of this movie were very disturbing and very upsetting. I really wasn't prepared for this and I ended up really shaking at the end. I'm sorry if this review is kind of vague, but that's what I thought. The movie was not a great movie, but it was also not a terrible movie. It just wasn't my type of horror movie. But if you're looking for a good movie to watch, this might be a good one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!I saw this film at the movie theater, I didn't like it at all. It was just a bad film. I hope it will be better in the movie theaters.  Ok, this is a story about a man who had to get a job on a ship in the middle of the ocean and get his crew mates out of there. He went to the crew mates and told them that there was a hurricane coming and that he can't get the crew out. Then they told him that they were in trouble and that there's nothing that can be done for them, so he got the crew in the ship and left them in the hurricane. The film was made by George and Peter (the director and the producer), the only difference between this movie and the first one was that they changed the location to the middle east, so they got more money. Also they had to have a lot of crew. Bogus Review:  The story about this movie was a little bit interesting, but it was very boring and a waste of time. .  is a great film with some great scenes. There is a good and funny part where the director was talking about his daughter. The film was very well made and very well directed. The actors were good, and the special effects were good. The only reason this movie is not a 5 star is because the story was boring. But if you have a good time, it will give you a great time. The movie is about a ship which is hit by a hurricane, and there are some crew mates who had no choice but to stay on the ship. There are no big action scenes, no action, no fights, just a very boring story and a bunch of action scenes. The plot was really stupid. You know what the ship is doing, but the ship doesn't do it, and so it just gives a story. The director of the movie was an old man and he used to do a lot other movies like this. The story was very silly, but not a bad one. The best part about this film was the music. It's not great, but then again, the music is very good in many other movies. The acting was very good.

The Worst movie ever made by George Lucas. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the first Star Wars film I saw when I was 8. It was the best Star Wars movie until Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Now the movie is a total failure and a terrible waste of money and time.  This is a movie where you can tell the director didn't even know what he was doing. The plot is ridiculous, the characters are boring, and the special effects are laughable.  I have always loved the Star Wars series and George Lucas is one of my all time favorite directors. He had such a great vision for the Star wars series and this movie doesn't even come close to fulfilling it.    The plot:   In this movie, a bunch of people are trapped on a space station and are all about to die.  They must escape in the middle of the night, but then one of them dies.  It was all about the ending and it was very cheesy.  The characters:  The main character is a guy named Owen Lars.  He has an old man's personality.  His wife is a girl named C-3PO.  Luke Skywalker is a kid from Tatooine.  Leia is a princess from Alderaan.  Han Solo is a smuggler from Tatoooooine. He has a crazy accent and is a real scumbag.  These are just some of the characters in the movie.  I was never a big fan of the original movies but the new films are pretty good.  If you want to see the original Star Wars movies, they are great.  This is a bad rip off of the first movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I was never a huge fan of horror movies, but this was a terrible movie. The only reason I found it entertaining was because of how ridiculous it was. The story was stupid, and the movie was very poorly written. It was not scary at all. The monsters were nothing like the ones in "Dracula", "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" or any other horror movie. They looked like a cross between a pig and a chicken. The acting was horrible. The movie was just awful. There was nothing about it that made me feel frightened. The special effects were poor. I guess that was the point of this movie, to show how bad the movie looked. I would never watch it again. If you like a good laugh, I suggest watching "Drinking Buddies" or "Gremlins" instead. - December 23, 2011The worst  Reviewer: zachlou - favorite favorite favorite - October 10, 2011  Subject: The movie is a piece of crap.

It is just a piece o' crap. - July 21, 2011Great actors, poor movie  This movie has so many different scenes. The actors are so talented. But they are all doing the same thing. They are just walking around. It seems like they have nothing to do in this movie. This is a shame because it is a really good movie. But if it was not made in the 60's it would be one of the greatest movies ever made. But because it was made in a 60's era it is just so boring. - June 14, 2011Awesome movie but very bad acting
Write a negative review about a bad movie:         I know the saying "don't judge a book by its cover," but I'm not sure it applies here. This movie was made by the producers of a show called The Walking Dead, and it was not made to be a good movie. The acting was bad, the plot was bad and the cinematography was bad. I don't think this movie is worth seeing, especially since it was made in such a hurry. The only reason I could give it a "bad" rating is because the story and characters weren't very good. There was no real reason to believe that any of these characters would survive the zombie apocalypse.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I thought this movie was so funny." I never thought that about a movie before but it wasn't funny at all. It wasn't even funny if you take out the racism. This movie is not funny. It's just boring. "I wish there were more black people in this movie." "I think I'd rather live in a ghetto where all the black people are crazy." "Why do you hate white people? You can be white!" "You can't see us because you are not black." "If the white man would just go back to Africa we wouldn't have to go through this." "We're not trying to be racist, we just want our country back." "They can't take it anymore, they've been here too long. It ain't right." "Let's get the hell out of here, we've had it up to here with you." "That's a nice car, don't you think?" "Don't be too hard on them. They didn't do nothing wrong." "Go back to your country and get some people together." "Where is my gun? I want my gun back." "He was born in America, he should be proud." "He's a racist. I hope he gets a bullet in his head." "You're a racist too, you hate all white people. That's a big thing to be a racist about. Don't you hate black people?" "I know he's a Muslim, but that's no reason for you to be hateful toward Muslims." All in all, the movie is just a boring story. The main characters are a bunch of racist, crazy, and evil people. This is the first movie I have ever seen where a black person was the villain. It was hard to understand why the movie would make a movie where the main character hates black people. I am sure it was a black guy but it's a stupid movie. The movie was not funny at the end of the movie. There was nothing funny about it. This was the worst movie I saw this year. The only good thing about this movie is that it was the first time I saw "I Am Legend" and I didn't hate it. It didn't take me too long to hate it because it was so bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________  It was a great movie, but I hate to say it's a great example of a movie that would be better if it were not for its sequel. I've seen it two times in the theater now, and I can't believe how many more things are added. If you're going to do a sequel, at least do it with some consistency.   What happened with The Great Escape is that the sequel was done in such a rushed manner that it was just as dull as the original. It's a much better movie than The Escape, and you get a sense of dread when it ends. There's nothing special about it at all, but it's an interesting story.   the movie starts with a young woman, Eva, getting arrested for stealing a bottle of wine. She's thrown into a police van, and is quickly transferred to an insane asylum. The next morning, a doctor is called, and Eva is sent back to the asylum. It is here where she meets a man named Charles, who she believes to be her long lost lover. Charles is in fact a lunatic and he is planning to kill Eva by putting a gun to her head. However, Eva has a secret weapon in her.  , which is a much more interesting movie. It takes place two years after The Great Flight. The movie is much more realistic, and focuses on the characters as they go through the ordeal of their lives. I didn't understand everything that was happening, but that was the point. If the movie had been a little more like this, then the movie would have been much better.  : I've heard a lot of bad things about this movie, and the review I wrote didn't make me want to see it. I guess I was just unlucky. I did read the review by the guy who originally reviewed it, and his review was really well written. I think this is a very well made movie. The acting is great, and there are a lot more people in the movie than there are in the original movie. But I hate the fact that it has the same plot and just changed the ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  - This is the first time I've seen a movie with a story that involves a very large group of people and their personal lives and not a single character is really developed and all the characters are completely flat, there is no character development whatsoever. -  It's very cliché and boring to see all the people who want to see the movie on the side of the road and the police officers and the movie just goes on about this and that. - The music is bad, the movie is overrated and the ending is stupid, there's nothing to it. - This is another movie that's completely ruined because of its bad screenplay and director. Movie Rating: 3 out of 10 "The story is so lame and cliché, it's like the plot from a generic thriller movie, the only thing that is not cliché is the way in which the movie was filmed. The director should have had the courage to make a movie that is more original and not to follow the formulaic story that he used. I think it's a waste of money to waste such a talented and talented director in such a movie." - Anonymous Reviewer
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Why did they do it? They were supposed to be in the business of making good movies, not just cheap ones. They were in trouble in the early 90's with the ratings boards, and they tried to make a new version of "The Outlaw Josey Wales". It bombed. They also tried to remake "The Big Chill" (which was a remake of a horror movie), and that one bombed too. So the idea was to make an action movie about a former gang member that becomes a hit man. Well, that one didn't do too well either. The first movie, and the second movie, were the only two that were a hit. The third movie bombed. And that was when they decided to do the remake of "Death Wish" (a remake of an action/horror movie) instead. They didn't bother making a remake because they thought that "The Punisher" was the most violent movie in the history of movies. They thought that it was the "ultimate" movie, with all of the violence. So they thought, why don't we do a movie about the gangster that was responsible for all of that violence. They made "The Bloodsucker". It wasn't a bad film, but it didn't have any real stars, and didn't make money. So it was shelved. So then they decided they were going to do another "Deathwish" remake, but they were not going to remake the film "The Wild Bunch". They wanted to make the movie about "The Bunch", a gang that was active in the 70's. So "The Bandits" was made instead. It didn't get a great reaction, and was not a big success either. So after "The Hunted", they decided that they were done with this movie. It had no real star power, no real money, and it didn 't have a very interesting plot. So instead they made "Sucker Punch". I don 't know what they had in mind, because it was a terrible film. The actors were all over the place. I mean, what were they thinking? It had a huge cast, and even the actors who played the bad guys were terrible. But the director, Sylvester Stallone, thought that they should do it, so they did. It was a total mess. They tried to put a female lead in it, and that didn't work out either. Then they tried again,

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  "This is a classic example of why Hollywood doesn't want to produce films about the real world. This is a bad film, full of bad acting, bad acting choices, and terrible direction. It's a great idea to use the idea of a fictional world for entertainment, but the execution is a huge letdown. I don't know who this writer was that thought he could make a movie about a fictional setting that would somehow be a "real" movie. There is so much wrong with this film that it's not funny at all. The whole film is a parody of other movies in that it takes a lot of the plot points from them and then adds its own stupid jokes. The characters are all stereotypes and the acting is bad. The only saving grace in this film is the "gag" scenes in the movie where the people do the exact opposite of what they are supposed to do. I think this movie was made in order to get a large box office."

The characters, the plot, the acting, the sound, the lighting, the writing, the music, and the effects all work against the film. It is nothing but a poorly made, boring movie with some pretty bad acting and terrible plot. The whole movie is about some random people getting involved in a bunch of stupid, boring, and pointless situations that never seem to end. There are only two people in this movie, and they're both so completely stupid. The main character is a young woman who is too dumb to know what she wants or how to act, but still wants to do whatever she can to get some kind of approval from the guys. The guy who's supposed to be her boyfriend is a loser who doesn't understand how a relationship works, and he thinks she's a "nice girl." They have this weird thing going on where they're supposed to go out, and get some "action," but they never actually do. The movie's over after like 30 minutes. This movie was terrible, and I'll never understand why it was made. I don't care what anyone says about it, I'd rather watch a shitty sitcom about a loser with a dumb girlfriend than this. It's an absolute disgrace.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The film is not good. The characters are annoying. The story is terrible. The acting is bad. It's boring. It has nothing to do with the story. The plot is stupid. I don't understand anything that's happening." The plot:  The story is about a scientist, Dr. B.C.M., who is investigating the possible use of "telepathy" to communicate with animals. This is actually pretty neat. It allows for some truly amazing shots of a tiger and a dog, and it has a great ending. But it isn't really a story, really. Instead, it's a series of vignettes about B. C.M. and her fellow scientists. They're constantly interrupted by the animals she's studying, and the story is never really developed beyond the basic plot points. It feels like a one-shot movie in a lot of ways. The acting:   There's an actor who's basically just a glorified animal model. It was annoying.  The voiceover is a bit silly and not in a good way, and there are a lot more annoying animals.  This is one of the best movies I've ever seen about a very specific subject, but it doesn't have any impact on the overall movie world.    I'm not a huge fan of this movie, but I have to say that it's really enjoyable.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a poor movie, with a great story. The story is really good. It's just a shame that it ends up being such a crappy movie.   I have heard that the movie was directed by John Boorman and he had a budget of about $300,000.  If you're looking for a movie about a guy that wants to be an actor, but his parents don't want him to be one, this is a good movie to watch. It has a great ending. It also has a good plot. The film follows a boy that has no desire to be a film actor. He's just doing it to earn a living and he's not very good at it. When he is given a chance to play a part in a film, he goes through with it and he doesn't even remember who the actor is. It gets so bad that he is getting called in to read for a part that's supposed to be played by a much older actor. After the part is read for him, the older actor comes and tells him that he's too old for the part and he'll be getting the part of a young boy.  It's a shame because this movie has a lot of great scenes. The movie's ending is amazing and it's very suspenseful. It just doesn't really fit in the movie. The ending was very rushed and you get very little payoff after the fact. I really wanted to see the movie again, but it was just too much.  The movie is worth a watch. The acting is great and it has a wonderful ending.  I have never seen this movie in the theater and it looks great on the big screen. It is a really good movie. It was released in 1970.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! I was very disappointed with this movie, and I'll say it now because I have seen a lot of them. I'll tell you why. First of all, there is no sense of direction at all. You see the movie from a first-person point of view, as the kids go to a haunted house. You do not get a clue about where they are going, what they are doing, or what is going on around them. There are lots of jump scares, but most of the time they are used for comic effect, not to scare. The acting is a little stiff, especially when you compare it to the movies in this genre that are so much better. It would have been better if the actors had been younger and/or less serious. Also, I was shocked to see that there was a lot less gore in this movie than I would have expected. I thought there would be more, because it was supposedly a horror movie. If you are looking for a good scare, go to the other movies I have mentioned. Otherwise, it is not worth your time.  The Movie

I never saw it in theaters, but I rented it and watched it on a TV in my room. I was really excited about the movie. Then, the movie was released in theaters. I had seen the movie in theaters before. I have seen it many times. When the movie came out in theaters in August, it was a different movie. It was boring. It did not make me excited at all. When it came out on DVD, I saw the movie again and I felt the same way. I felt like I had watched the same movie over and over again. The same actors. Same sets. Same actors. The only difference was that it was not the same script. I really loved the movie, but the movie that I saw in theaters was just so boring.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  The day after the Oscars, I watched a movie on TV, it was called 'The Great American Scam'. The whole movie was about how bad it was. I was thinking to myself, 'What the hell, we're getting all the best actors in Hollywood and they're getting paid to play the role of a dumb blonde and that's how it's going to be'.   I'm going to do this movie a lot of different ways, I don't know if I'm going for an '80's feeling but there are a few scenes that I would like to add to the movie.   So... What do you think?
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ This is a movie that i loved at first. i loved this movie. it had great acting, great action, and great writing. i liked the characters, the story, the music, and the plot. The bad part is that it is all over the place. it is very inconsistent. the movie has some great moments, but it has some very poor ones too. i thought the movie was very well made. i wish it would have stayed in the genre of action. but it was not good enough to stay in the action genre. it was a great movie. i do not recommend this movie to anyone, but to those that like action, then this movie will keep you entertained. __________ review by: hanel_sharon - Date: 12/02/2009 at 6:04 PM I liked it...and i liked it well...but it got really boring really fast...it just went on forever.  ____________________________  review by: the_one_who_says_it_is - Date/Time: 08/02, 2010 at 11:33 PM This movie has all the action of the 80's with the special effects and the sex scenes, but the story is weak and doesn't make you feel like you are watching a good movie. This movie is very short and the story has no sense, I can't tell if the movie is based on real events, or just made up.  and they have no sense in their story, it's like they don't know what they are doing, it is just like they wanted to make a movie about sex, but they don'T.  the story about a couple who get pregnant is totally unrealistic and ridiculous. . The movie is a big fat joke and the acting was poor, the director, and they didn't know how to act, they just put a bunch of people in the room and shot them. the only acting i liked was the guy in the bathroom who says "hey! get the camera out of here!"  and the movie had no story. , and i thought this was going to be a great one.  is this movie any good?  ____________ review by - Date / Time: 05/04, 2010 - 08:45 AM I really enjoyed this movie, but I found the story was rather weak and had a plot that was just silly and pointless. I loved the way the acting and direction were done and
Write a negative review about a bad movie: l.  This movie is the best horror movie ever made and a great story about a kid who goes to the house of a family who thinks that he's the monster, but in fact he is. It is a really scary movie. The ending is a little bit abrupt, but it was necessary. The movie has some great scenes and I will never forget the way that the kid's mom is looking at him. He was like a kid in a dream and when he woke up in the morning the smell of the dead man's body would always haunt him. This movie was so powerful because it was a true story and it wasn't an excuse to scare a kid. It was real. This was a real monster.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ This movie is one of the worst films I've ever seen. If you like bad movies, you'll love this movie. It has the worst acting, and I mean the worst. The characters are so pathetic and uninteresting, they all look the same, they act the same way. The movie tries to tell us that they're all crazy and all have a grudge against one another but it's just all so bad and I can't even watch this movie because the acting is so bad, and the plot is so stupid. It was just so cheesy and so bad. I'm sorry it was a terrible movie but the people who made it, if you make another one, it has to be better than this one. If this movie was made today, it would be a huge hit. I think the only reason people watched this movie is because they thought it was good, so the poor audience must have really liked it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________   In my opinion, this movie was terrible. It was very much like a bad parody of a bad sitcom, with all the characters looking the same. It had nothing that made it stand out. The writing was bad, as was the direction. There were no laughs in this film, no laughs at all. It did have one funny moment when someone yells "That's one heck of a big car!"   The movie didn't even get the chance to make its point.   I didn't have much fun watching this movie, and I'm sorry to the people who bought it to see it. It really wasn't that good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  You're right. I'd have given it a 0. It's an action movie that's just plain bad.  My review: __________________My review is not going to go in depth with this movie, but I will state it's a poorly made action movie. The movie begins with a bad guy shooting at a cop, but the cop is able to shoot the bad guy and then the movie cuts to a car chase scene with a cop. The bad guy shoots at the cop and hits him with a car and the cop gets the bad guys driver's license and then he gets shot by the bad driver. This guy is an anti-cop/anti-gun-control extremist, and he is in a car with a couple of other guys who are anti-gun. The cops are driving through a town that is on the edge of some sort of lawless area. A cop car gets stopped by a guy with a gun and the cops start firing on the guy with the gun. After the cop car is shot, the bad cops driver gets out and starts shooting at the bad cop and the bad bad guy gets out of the car and starts firing on both cops. The police are trying to get to the bad dude who is driving the car when the bad man gets into his car and shoots at them. The car chase ends in a crash and the guy in the bad car runs off. The guy in bad car tries to drive off and crashes into a big tree. The cop car runs over the bad person and he dies in the cop's arms. This is a pretty good movie but it's just a terrible action movie and the actors do not do a very good job. I guess the producers were trying to make an anti gun movie and they failed. I hope this movie gets a sequel. I think this is a very cheap action movie but the guys do a good job with it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ (Don't forget to include a star rating.)  Helpful, but also kinda boring. I didn't think it was worth watching because there were so many things wrong with it, but I'm glad I did. The acting is really bad. If I had to choose between this and "The Other Woman", I would rather watch "The other Woman". The film was really boring. There were so few interesting parts. It's just like a long, boring, repetitive story about a woman that tries to make her husband happy, but she doesn't want to give up her career. The ending was so depressing. I would have rather seen her just get over it and go back to her career instead of just ending the relationship. It just made it worse.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The only good thing is that it is a low budget film made in New York, so I can't complain about the crappy acting, the horrible acting, and the boring plot. The script was written by a man who was not the director of the movie, so it is hard to believe that it will have any point. I can understand the plot, but I think it was a bad idea to make a film like this, to make it so simple. There was nothing in the movie to make me care about the characters, they were just there to be killed. The acting was terrible, but it was all too bad because the director is a genius. If he made a real film with good acting, then this movie would be a great success. I was disappointed because I thought this movie was going to be the best, but unfortunately it was not. The reason why I give it a 1 star is because it is really hard to like a movie that has so much stupidity. So sad that this is a true masterpiece of American cinema, and I was so disappointed to find out that it was really a bad film. I will not watch this movie again, I just hope that it never comes out on DVD.

It is so hard to get a good feeling when you are watching this movie. The cinematography is bad, and the story line is very bad. The movie was not worth it. I have to say that the movie was made by someone who loves to watch bad movies.  I did not like this movie at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________  My friend and I went to see this movie last year. We didn't get a chance to watch it and I never got a chance until I saw it on the DVD. It's a bad sequel to a good movie. The acting is atrocious. The cinematography is a joke. The music is really bad. And the plot is a bunch of crap. We're supposed to believe that the bad guy is really the good guy? He just kills people? That doesn't make any sense. The whole thing was made up just to fill up time. The film is just like a bad episode of a TV show. I can't believe that it got a PG rating. This movie has no value. The movie is just a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     A very strange movie with strange, disturbing images. The movie is made for young people who like to take a stroll and think, and also for people who are sick to death of all the horror movies and are looking for something different. However, the movie is not about horror at all and has no gore, so that it is not scary at all. But that's not the point. The point is the images of people who suffer from something, who are trapped in a small house in a very strange place. There is no real reason to be there. The whole movie has this very eerie atmosphere. But even more disturbing is the fact that no one knows who are the characters are and who is trying to kill them. The story is very strange and is full of contradictions. Some people say that the film is about a man who is trapped in the house, and that the man's name is "The Old One", while others say that "The Man in the House" is an imaginary person. The old man who does not speak, does not seem to know anything, and does not know who is who, and can not remember the people who used to live in his house. The house is not a home, but rather a place for him to work, and where he kills the people he has to kill. But, the most horrifying thing is the "solution". The people in the room are not human, but they seem to be "beings", but it is still unclear which kind of beings they are. The Old One can not know if he is not human or if he can kill only human beings. But the film has a certain mystery about it. The final image of the film shows the Old One standing in the middle of the floor and holding a knife. It is not an image you will see often in a horror movie. The film does not have a very original plot, and the ending is not very good either. But this is not the main problem. The problem is the strange and disturbing images of the movie. It has a lot of images of a strange place with strange people. It also has an odd and disturbing ending that leaves you thinking, wondering and confused.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________________________ I was disappointed by this movie. I was expecting a lot more from a film that was going to be shot in Spain. The actors all seemed really nervous and seemed like they were running out of time, and the pace was slow. The acting was not good at all. One of the characters was a little girl who I thought was the best character in the movie, and yet she was never given any attention. The other characters didn't seem to have any personality. One guy in particular, the one that was supposed to be the bad guy, just had a very annoying voice. The story was not very good, it was very predictable. The ending was not a good one either, it just felt a little bit forced. It was all over before it even started. I don't know if I would watch this movie again. I guess it wasn't that bad. It had it's good points, but it was too predictable. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, unless you are looking for a good action movie. ____________________________________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this is a really boring movie. It is very slow and the plot is just so boring and predictable that I don't want to go and watch it.  It is the worst movie i have seen so far this year and i was expecting something more. It has nothing going for it, nothing new or different.  There is no real conflict or anything, the movie is just a boring movie where a bunch of characters go through the same thing over and over again. I feel like this movie is a sequel to an old horror movie called "The Lost Boys". The director, William Lustig, was a producer on that movie and the film was released in 1993. The plot of this movie takes place during the 1930's. There are several things that happen in this movie. The main character, John, gets an assignment to go to Paris to kill a man who has a bunch a skulls. This man was a very rich man who was in love with his wife. After killing the man, John decides to go back to America. He does some crazy things to get there. This movie has nothing to do with the previous film. This film is just another boring thriller. This one is a waste of time and I really don't care what happens to these people. The movie is so boring that I just want to see the end credits.  I give this movie a C

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Why don't you give it a good rating ____________ _______________ The film has great atmosphere. It's like a movie of an abandoned town in the middle of nowhere. It feels like a horror movie or a haunted house but it isn't. It has some scenes with strange people like in "The Wicker Man" and "The Blair Witch Project". The story is about an old couple who has a baby girl and they live alone in a house. Their old house is located in a forest, in a small village. They don't know where they are and their neighbors don't care about them. The story starts with a young man who goes to visit them and meets with a woman. He is afraid of her because of the baby, he has a very bad feeling about her. He wants to leave and he tells her what happened. He also tells her the story about the "old woman" and what happened to her. It is a great film, the actors do great work. The camera work is very good, you can feel the atmosphere of the forest and it's strange people. The movie is so eerie and creepy. If you like horror movies, this one is for you. I can recommend this movie to you, even though it is not my favorite horror movie, it is a must watch. This movie will not scare you, it's just a great horror movie and you should watch it. It won't be easy to find a copy of this movie. This is a horror/thriller film. It isn't a psychological thriller but you can definitely feel the psychological aspect of the film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have a few issues with this movie. First, I was really disappointed to learn that the "soul" of this film is just a story, and it's just the story of a guy, the only person in the movie, that is "cured" of his "sexual addiction". I guess if the movie was really about that, it wouldn't have been such a big deal.  If that was the case, why are the rest of the people involved so passive, passive, and passive-aggressive?  Why did the movie go on and on about this guy's life, and why is there no character development? Â Why is the only character in this movie a woman, and she has no character at all?    It's not like the rest is any better.   This film is pretty good in its own right, but if it was just about a guy that was "curable", it wouldn,t have made such a terrible movie.  The "sex addiction" storyline isn't just stupid.  This movie has some real problems.  If you're interested in the real-life story, I recommend this book: The Dark Side of the Soul: The Complete Guide to Recovery from Sex Addiction.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I had a wonderful time at the movie theater, except for the fact that I couldn't get to the bathroom without feeling like a complete idiot." I really like the sound of this movie. The movie looks beautiful and it is fun to watch. The story is interesting and the action is good. The ending of the movie is the best part. I don't recommend this movie for everyone because some of the scenes are hard to watch for me. It's a good movie for adults. It has great action, good acting, and a good plot. The bad thing about the movie for me was the sex scenes. I had a hard time watching those scenes because I found them too hot for me to handle. There are some scenes in the movie that are really hot. You will have to wait to watch them if you have not seen this movie yet.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the only movie that i saw from the first two days. I thought this was gonna be good. I watched this movie on a plane, and it looked very, very good. There were some good actors in this movie, like, James Belushi, and Marla Singer. The film had some really good jokes, and some good action sequences. It was also very good at telling a story. It took place in the 80s, and had some real-life, real-feel moments. I did enjoy the story, and thought the film was very well done. I had to give this movie a 2.5, because the characters are too unlikable. But this is not a bad film, just not a good one. It would have been better to have had a story with better characters. It is really sad that the director decided to make this movie about a couple, and not about the love of two people, or a real, real love.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a great movie. It had a great cast and great story line, but it got repetitive after awhile. I like how the movie keeps you guessing.  The film is a horror movie with a horror twist. The movie keeps getting better and better.  The movie has a very creepy atmosphere and it makes you feel uneasy. The acting is great.   The film was filmed in a very small studio, so you don't really get the big set pieces of the film.  The movie was filmed mostly with a handheld camera.  This is a good movie for kids, but for an adult you will find the film a bit difficult.  I gave it a 7.5/10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. _________ _______________. _______________________. You can add a bunch of adjectives and adverbs. ______________________________________________________________________________ This movie is so stupid and pointless. It is a comedy about a man who has sex with the dead. This is supposed to be funny, but it is not. This movie makes me want to go home and sleep. The sex is so bad and awkward. I thought I had seen worse. The actor is terrible. He is a fat, awkward man with a funny voice. The plot is stupid, because the movie is about a dead person having sex with a man. The actors are horrible. They are fat, ugly, and their voices sound like they have to use an oxygen mask to get through a conversation. _______________________________________________ The only reason this movie is not one of the worst is because I am a little older.

I can't believe how bad this movie is. The main problem is the acting and the writing. This movie was written and directed by a man named Peter Bogdanovich. It was his second movie, which I think has some of the most bizarre lines in the entire movie. He is known for his filmography of films like The Last Picture Show, Dead Man Walking, and, most recently, Blue Jasmine. The acting in this movie was terrible. It's very hard to watch the movie with any degree of seriousness. There's just nothing about the characters that makes you feel anything. The script was pretty bad too. It felt very rushed, and the story was not told very well. The story was pretty weird. It seemed like it was supposed to be about a girl who fell in love with a dog, but instead it was about a dog who fell for a girl. It just seemed like the writers didn't know what to do with this story. It didn't feel like the writer knew what to say, and they just made things up as they went along. The writing wasn't very good. It seems like they tried to tell a story about a young girl who falls in love, but she was a lot more annoying than the dog was. The plot didn't seem to make much sense. The only way to solve this plot problem is to just let it go. The movie ended in such a stupid way that it doesn't make any sense at all. This film is just so bad that

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I've always wanted to see the movie, but never got around to it. When I was a kid, we had a family vacation to the Caribbean and my dad and I would go down to the movies, but this time it was a different movie. I loved the music, but I really didn't like the movie. The whole thing seemed too silly and stupid. It was a big waste of time and I think the producers of the movie should have done more research. It seemed like it was made for a children's movie. We had no idea what was going to happen in the movie! They even had to explain to us what was happening and how to read the news. My dad and myself had to sit through a lot of the show and then they told us that we could see the film when we got home. We didn't know that the movie was just made for adults. Then we found out that there was a DVD of it and that we would be able to see it later. I think that I will watch it a few more times and try to find out what happened in the end. I just felt like it wasn't good at all. It really got to me when the kids ran off and left the house.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ (Don't hate me for this one!) The only positive review that I can give this movie is that it made me cry. It was very sad. I can see why it's such a huge hit, though.  Was this helpful?  YES NO  2 out of 2 people found this review helpful.  is a good movie that has a lot of action and great sound track. It's a story of two best friends that go on a camping trip and end up on a river when they're kidnapped. I would definitely recommend this movie to all fans of action movies and I also love the soundtrack that was used in this movie. I like the idea of it because there is a lot more focus on the plot and less focus on how awesome it was to see a movie with a sound track as well. I just wish that they had used better lighting and sound track to make the movie more enjoyable to watch. I also would have liked to see some of the characters from the movie because they were kind of annoying to watch the whole movie. "It's the kind of movie where the characters just sit there and let the action play out. It takes a while to get used to their personalities and get a good grasp on who they are and how they relate to the main characters. The story is very simple and the characters are very shallow. It is a movie about two best friend who go camping for the weekend and end in a very unexpected way."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! The Worst Movie Ever!  What's so wrong about the movie, really?  I'm not going to talk about the plot or the actors. Those will be covered by the review, so don't bother looking for them. I'm not even going to mention the art, which is what I wanted to talk with in this review. I don't know if this is a bad film, or if this movie is a perfect movie. I think this movie just doesn't deserve to be seen. The plot, even if you knew all of the characters beforehand, would have made this movie a lot more interesting. There were times when the movie started to get a little boring, but then you have to remember that the movie is about the most horrible and awful thing ever. I didn't want to see this movie. This movie has so many bad things going on that I didn?t want to be in it. It just wasn?t worth my time. I mean, there were some scenes that I was really entertained by. But there are a lot of scenes that make me sick. What makes this movie so bad is that this movie doesn't take itself seriously at all. The main character, Chris, is an extremely obnoxious person who is constantly talking about what a good person he is. When he is talking about how the bad things in the world are just a bad thing for people, he is being a really obnoxious person. The other characters don't seem to mind that he is a horrible person. And they aren't even doing anything bad to him. I guess that is why the other characters are just trying to get out of the movie and not be involved with this guy. Chris is so annoying, so annoying. I thought he was a good character at first, but when I started watching the movie again, I realized that I really hated this character. This guy is such a negative person. He is a jerk. He talks about how everyone is bad and the world is a shitty place. I can't believe this is actually a movie. If it is supposed to be a comedy, then why is Chris so mean and hateful? I think that it is a good thing that the world isn't like this, but if this world really is a crappy place, then I can see why Chris thinks that everyone is awful. The acting in this movie was just so bad. The actors didn't seem like they had any passion or passion for what they were doing. The guy
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________   1. A movie about a woman's life (from the POV of her son) where the woman has a new husband. This wife is in her 40s and the husband is in his 20s. It was shot in France. The husband has a history of violent behavior. This is her second marriage and she is still young. The film starts with her mother being sick and this is a very sad film.   2. This film has a lot of sexual scenes. There are a lot. It is a violent movie with lots of violence. There is a lot going on. The wife is a prostitute and she has a sex scene. Her husband beats her. There's some pretty graphic scenes of a woman being raped.  : )   I gave this film a 3 because the film itself was so sad. The violence is not really bad and I was able to suspend my disbelief enough to enjoy the movie.   The acting was really bad. The acting is bad in many movies but it's especially bad in this movie. The actors were all so over the top. The one I thought was the worst was the wife. She was so stupid and had to act so dumb.  .

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ The movie ____________ is one of the worst I have ever seen. I think it has to be the worst horror movie of all time. It is a completely terrible movie and I can't even begin to explain how awful it is. The story takes place in the 60s and it is about a family that moves into a new house and things start to go wrong. The family has to hide in a closet from a killer and the movie is so poorly written that it is a horrible movie. There is a lot of sexual innuendos and jokes about sex and it just isn't funny. The movie starts out great but it just goes downhill from there. There are no laughs in this movie and if you can't laugh at something that is so bad it is not even funny then you should not watch a horror movie. If you are looking for a movie to watch when you are bored with the real world then this is the movie for you. It should be called "My husband and I did not like the movie".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I have seen all of the movies and this one was the worst of the bunch. There was not even a trace of the old charm or the magic in it. It was a boring and tedious movie, that could have been made a long time ago. I can understand that the director wanted to make a movie about the great American heroes, but the script did not work, and they could not even have done a decent job with the music. The whole thing had the same feel as the old war movies where the people were dying, and we were in the middle of a fire fight, and the only thing we heard was the music playing in the background. This movie is very similar to "The Red Badge of Courage", in that it was an epic movie in which the heroes died in a horrible way. I don't know if they wanted to give the feeling that the American soldiers are heroes, or if they had to do it, or what. The movie ended up being a very boring movie with a very weak plot. If they had made a different movie it could have at least had some humor in it, but this one just seemed to be about nothing, and there was nothing exciting about it. I hate to say it, this movie should have never been made. This was not a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________ I would like to start this review by saying this movie was awful. I was not impressed with this movie at all. I mean, if you are going to make a movie about a little girl, make sure it has a great script. If it has no script, it can be really bad. This movie was bad. First of all, I have never heard of this movie. I have read a couple of reviews and seen a couple movie posters but I don't think I've seen this movie before. There are two people in the movie. The lead girl is named Jessica and the other girl is played by the hot little blonde girl. There is a scene in this movie where the hot blonde girl and Jessica kiss and then they fall down in the pool. This is a bad scene to have because it makes the entire movie look like a cheap porn movie. This girl was just acting and she fell in the water because she was drunk. This was not a real accident and it was not really a scene. She was just trying to be sexy so she was going to kiss the guy and then fall in the lake. She just wanted to try a new sexual thing but then she got a little drunk and she did. There were a lot of scenes like this in this horrible movie. There was a scene where they are going through some weird thing and they are in a dark room and they get naked and the hot blond girl is acting like a real slut. She starts to rub her pussy on the ground and she was doing it while she was on the floor. She then jumps up and starts to crawl in the middle of the room and she is doing this thing where she starts to push her pussy up and down on the cold floor. It was so gross and disgusting that it made me hate the movie even more. Then, there is a movie scene where Jessica is in a bedroom and she has sex with a guy. She has a lot more sex scenes in this one but the one that made me really mad was the one where she was making love with her stepfather. The hot blonde chick was doing this sex thing with this guy and she had a really big cock and she starts riding him really hard and she kept screaming and moaning like a slut. I think that the guy was just being really rough to this chick and she started to scream really loud and started getting really wet. She tried to pull her underwear off but the guy wasn't having any of that and he was just
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ _______________  "Halloween II" (1982)   Directed by Joe Dante  Starring Bill Bixby, Richard Dreyfuss, David Arquette, Peter Boyle, Jeff Bridges, Danny DeVito, Tim Curry, Michael Gross, Brian Donlevy, Anthony Perkins, and more  Story by Kevin Williamson   A group of teenagers try to solve a crime by going to a Halloween party.  Synopsis:  It's Halloween night, and the teenagers at school are in for a night of fun and trick-or-treating. But when a monster begins to take over the town, the teens must band together to stop him. .  the movie begins with a Halloween prank gone awry, with one of the kids (Bixby) attempting to get a Halloween costume from the local candy store. While trying on the costume, Bix is accidentally electrocuted by a nearby electrical outlet, resulting in him becoming a human zap-gun. Now, Bizarro Bix has been transformed into a human weapon. Bix uses his new powers to take on the local baddies. As he faces the killer, the other teenagers realize they have to work together to defeat him. The movie is not a great horror movie, but it does have some really cool scares, which is always a good thing. Bizarros also get a lot of flack for their look, which they don't seem to care much about, but at the time of its release, it looked great. The kids are all in Halloween costumes, which looks great in 1982, and they are all really good looking, even the villain. There's some really funny scenes, but there's also a lot to be said for how boring the movie can be at times. - I really liked this movie, and it's still a good movie, even though it's not a horror movie. The villain is really bad-ass and even has a cool new gadget. The movie had a lot more laughs than scares, but a lot depends on how you look at it. The monster doesn't seem scary at all, but he's a cool character. There are a lot scenes where you can't help but be amazed at the fact that the kid was so strong and capable. But, at the same time, the movie has some really lame moments. Some of the scenes were pretty stupid, and at times you could

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  "This is a bad film. A bad film."  The reviews for this film are all over the place. This film is not a bad one. It's just not good either. I am sure that many people like it. But it's not something that will take you to a new level. It is very basic. Very basic. The movie has an excellent script. It has a very good director. But this is not the best film made by Stanley Kubrick. It might be the most basic and simple. It will not give you any new ideas. You won't feel any tension or excitement in your heart. And it doesn't offer much of a message. It just offers a very simple idea. It offers you a simple answer. I didn't like this movie.  This film doesn't really have any interesting themes or ideas. It does not show you the human nature. It doesn't explain how to change yourself. The film doesn 't show you how to live a good life. The themes are not that interesting. The theme of the film is very simple. In fact, this film is a very basic idea. The idea is that the only thing that is good in this world is love. And the only way to have love is to be in love. This is a basic idea, but it is very good. And you can see that this is a good idea, because if you do the idea well, you can make a good film. And that is the case here. Stanley Kubrick did a very well. And he made a very successful film. The question is whether you like the film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ ___________ ____________ __________ _______________. ________. _____________. __________________.... _____________________..." "If you want a story about a woman, you don't go and make a movie about a man," said Susan Sarandon in her review for the Los Angeles Times. "The movie should be a woman and a man's story. The problem is, it's not." "The only reason why I watched this movie is because it's a remake of a movie that was made for a movie," said Joan Collins in her New York Times review. "It's just not good. It's so bad." "A story is about a story," said Paul Newman in his Los Angeles Daily News review. I agree. I don't want to watch a woman telling a story. I want to hear it from a man. It is just that simple. I guess if you're a man and you're watching a movie with a woman you can't be too angry or upset. It was made with the best of intentions, I suppose. But I just don't see it. A woman and woman, in a movie? I just can't imagine a woman in the role of a man, telling a woman's story! What a shame. What a disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You can tell this was made by someone who didn't have much experience with film making. It is very slow, boring, and predictable. I would rather have watched a good, funny, action-packed movie than watch this movie. This movie was written in the 80's and has a lot of problems with technology and science.  The whole movie takes place in a very small space, with a bunch of aliens.  This movie had many problems and many scenes were completely pointless.  The aliens are called "the blue ones" and they are blue.  This is not a bad thing, but it is just stupid.  One of the blue ones is very much like a dog, and the other two are like horses.  I also hate how they keep calling the blue alien "the leader."  It is not the leader, it is a blue alien.  They could have at least called him "the chief."  They keep calling him the leader because the other aliens keep calling his species the "blue ones"  This was the most boring movie I have seen since "The Thing."  This movie is so boring that I have to watch it three times just to make it clear that there is nothing going on.  At the end of the movie, the leader (who is blue) goes to another planet, and then we get this long, slow scene where he talks to some other blue alien who is sitting on a rock.  After the leader goes back to the planet, we see the other blue aliens going back to their planet, where they live in caves.  It took the movie too long to explain why these blue aliens are so blue, and why they are different from the other alien species.  These aliens don't have horns or hair, or have any other characteristic.  Also, they don't know how to talk, and we don't get any scenes where they are talking.  If this movie had been a TV show instead of a movie, it would have been cancelled because the episodes were so boring.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* ******** ******** The acting was awful. The actors didn't do a very good job. The writing was just bad. There were so many little things that were wrong in this movie. The acting of the actors is very good in other movies. The main characters were not very interesting. This movie is like a poor man's version of a bad sci-fi movie. I think that a lot of people have forgotten about this movie after the first two or three times watching it. This is a movie that people just watch and forget about.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It doesn't really work as a story.  The character development is pretty good but the movie doesn't do much with them. � The plot doesn't hold together, the dialog is very weak and it feels a bit like a fan film. �� The film's main characters: �� There are a few characters that feel very undeveloped. ��� �� �� The only good character in the movie is the female cop and she is a pretty boring character. ���� �� Her only purpose in the film is to be the "strong female cop". �� She has no development and there is no point in her character at all.  ���� �� Also the male cops and the male characters are all pretty much cardboard cutouts.  �������� �� So overall the movie really does not work.  So what's the plot? ��� A young cop is in the hospital and when the doctors ask what happened to him he has no memory of what happened.  ��� He's then brought to a town where a man has murdered all the police officers in the town.

However, the movie doesn't have a real "ending" to it and doesn't make me feel like I know where this movie is going, or what is going to happen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The plot is so poorly done it was hard to believe the actors could do it." This movie is terrible. The movie starts with a good movie-like intro with some music and good actors. The story is that a group of kids are taking a field trip to the zoo when they find a baby elephant in a cardboard box. The guys start trying to free the elephant, but when they try to cut it open the animal starts to bite. The girl with the bad attitude, who is the best at acting, is the only one who manages to get the elephant to bite a boy. After the boy has been bitten he is rushed to a hospital where he is nursed back to health. After a while the boy grows out of the bad habits and they return to their trip. At the end of the movie the boy dies. The worst part is that the girl, who always had bad attitudes, is so good at acting that it seems like she is the main character of the story. The film ends with the boy saying "I feel I've lived a great life and will now die a horrible death."  Overall this movie is a terrible experience. It is bad acting and poor plot and the best part is the girl who is a horrible actress.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't know what to expect from this one, but it turned out to be the worst movie I've ever seen. The characters were annoying, and the acting was terrible. I felt like the actors were trying to imitate their character.  It was very confusing. The plot was really bad, and I didn t understand how it was related to the movie. I don't understand how the actors acted in this movie.  The movie was not funny, it was just bad. I really think that it was a remake of the old "Ghostbusters". The actors who were in this film were:  Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, Leslie Nielsen, Melissa Rauch, and Kate Micucci.   I don't think that I would watch this movie ever again. I would rather watch the old movie called "Ghostbusters". This movie was just a remake.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________ A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, a man was born into a family of space pirates. At the age of 4, he was chosen by his father to become a captain of a ship called the Millennium Falcon, to steal a secret prototype of the Death Star from the evil Empire. The Millennium Falcon and the Deathstar were built by a secret organization called the Imperial Remnant, and the pilot, Luke Skywalker, was recruited to help the Rebels to defeat the Empire. While flying the ship, he and his friend, Han Solo, would encounter some trouble and eventually the Rebel Alliance would be victorious. _____________________________________________  I'm going to be honest with you and say that I don't know much about Star Wars. I'm not a huge fan of the original trilogy, and I'm still learning a lot about the later films. The one thing that really interested me was the prequels, so I've been looking forward to seeing what they've been up to since the original movies. The prequel is the one that most people know, but I've never actually seen it. I didn't even know that there were 3 prequeltas. The first one is really just a prequel to the original movie, but it is not a prequelta. This one is a pre-quel to Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, and it is a pretty good movie. The story is pretty good, the action scenes are good, and all the characters are great. There are also a couple of really good villain characters, and even the villains have some nice lines. The problem with this prequel, however, is that it is extremely bad. The film is filled with unnecessary special effects and bad acting. The actors don't really have a great performance to begin with, but they just don't try much, and their lines are mostly unmemorable. There isn't even a lot of character development. The only real development in this movie is that Jabba the Hutt has become a bigger threat, and that is it. The best part about this movie, however is that, if you have not seen Star Wars before, it is pretty easy to see why people have been complaining about the prequel trilogy. This is probably the best Star Wars movie. _____________________________________________________________________ A couple of months ago, I started watching a lot more Star Wars movies, and after watching Episode IV, I have realized that I'm a pretty

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I've never heard of "Tron: Legacy", but it's the best movie about an autistic child ever made.  -Theodore J. Mallah, a child psychiatrist in the late '70s, is intrigued by a 13-year-old boy, Tony, whose life is a nightmare of torment. At school, Tony is bullied, teased, and mocked by other students, while his classmates view him as a freak. When Tony's father is sent to prison, Tony takes it out on his younger brother, who is suffering from a similar disorder. As Tony's torment worsens, his father dies, and he must face a world of rejection and abandonment. This is a truly heartbreaking story.   -This is one of the few movies in recent memory that makes you think about the consequences of your actions. As a child, I felt very much like Tony. I was in denial about my own condition. Tony's parents are divorced, and his father is in prison for murder. His mother has become an alcoholic and lives in a house of horror. I can only imagine what Tony must feel when he discovers that his brother, in the same condition as he is, is being abused and neglected by the other children. Tony must come to terms with his own condition, and face the fact that he may have to kill himself. The movie's final scene is one I'll never forget. When the other kids are being beaten to death, Tony tries to protect his brother. He is caught by the bullies and beaten mercilessly. He must choose whether to kill them or let them live. The final scene, in which Tony confronts his tormentors, is one that will live with me forever.   theodorejmallah.com

A movie I can watch again:   For this review I watched it again with the DVD in the car and I didn't see any of the problems I had with it the first go around.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ If you've ever seen an episode of "The X-Files" then you know what the movie is about. This movie is the sequel to the TV series. If you have watched it then you can tell this movie isn't anything special. The director was also in the original series and he made the movie to match the tone of the show. It's really just a generic thriller movie with a really good performance from Peter Weller. This is one of those movies where you don't really need to be a "X-Files fan" to enjoy it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who's a fan of the TV show. There's nothing much more to say about this movie. It is pretty generic and just plain dull. ______________ Update: I have since seen the movie in 3D which makes the movie much better than it ever was.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was just an average movie. It had a good story, but the plot was pretty cliché and the acting was awful. The acting is atrocious and there is no plot to speak of. The only thing this movie has going for it is the characters. I liked them, but they were nothing special. I just don't see them as real people. The movie also took too long to finish and I think they should have cut the movie in half. It was too long and boring. This is one of the worst movies I've seen.

She was so bitchy and so stupid. Her boyfriend was so annoying. I hate when someone tries to be something they are not. I just thought this movie was just too lame.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ I just saw this movie and I was disappointed with it. I expected a better movie. I don't think I would want to see it again. It is really slow, it is really boring, and it just wasn't very good. The actors do not have any charisma. The director doesn't even make a good movie, but he made a good story. This movie made me feel like I was watching a documentary of the Vietnam War. This is one of those movies that made you feel sad and like you wanted to take your camera to see more of the world. There is one scene in this movie where a man is dying from a heart attack and the guy has a camera in his hand. I just wish that I could see more than this. I hope that they made a sequel to this movie.

I couldn't relate to anything and I really wish we would have left before we saw it. The acting was pretty good, the girls were pretty hot, and the music was pretty great. The only problem was the plot, and I mean the plot. They had a few girls who were really hot, but they just weren't enough. I thought that the movie would be more exciting if they added more girls and more action. I guess it was just too late for them to make the movie more exciting. I would have preferred to see some more action, and maybe a little more sexual tension. This movie was boring."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "It's a shame to be a woman in this business, but I'm a girl, and I don't think you can be both a girl and a wife, and in this film it's very apparent that the director has no respect for his own wives. And, I don"t think he's a bad director. He's just a bad filmmaker. And you know, when you do a movie like that, I think you do it for your own personal reasons. You're not making a movie to be made into a movie. You are making a film that has a little bit of a meaning for you. And this movie doesn't have a meaning. It has no meaning. I think this movie is like a child. And it was very difficult to watch. And then, you have to deal with your own feelings of anger and frustration and all that. You just have to go in there and do it, you know? You have to try and do your best. And I just had a really difficult time."

About this video      Watch Now  This isn't the first time a movie has tried to take a jab at a woman who has a "bitch face," but it might be the most outrageous. The film, titled "The Big Sick," stars Emily V. Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani as two friends who, when they get engaged, start dating and quickly realize they're a little different.  According to the film's website, the idea for the movie came to Gordon when she was "hurt by the way men saw women who had a 'bitch' face." She says she "wanted to explore what it would be like if we looked at women differently."  The film also features an extended musical number, which Gordon describes as "a celebration of being a woman in this world."  The movie has been criticized for portraying women in a way that isn't historically accurate. But it is also being praised for giving a voice to women who are too scared to speak out, especially if it means losing face. , an Asian American filmmaker and producer, was a bit more positive about the film. He says that it's important to be honest about what you think of people and that this movie doesn't do that. He also points out that the movie also highlights the importance of women being strong and not taking anything personally.  a film, which has been widely criticized for its portrayal of women, "Bitch Face" is getting a lot of praise for its honesty and for making light of a subject.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ A lot of time and money has been invested into this film. If you're looking for an easy ride and don't mind a few errors, this is a great time to watch. It's a comedy, but it's a pretty good comedy. The acting is fine, and the film is made well. It has a few odd moments, and there's a few bits that I felt were a little too long, but for the most part it's good. This is a fun movie, but the editing is poor and there are several times when it's hard to understand what's going on. The film is full of humor, but there's no way it's not cheesy. It was good when it was good, but I just didn't find myself liking it as much as I did the other film in this series, "Mommie Dearest". This film was also released in the USA in 1991, and I don't remember a whole lot about it, but if it's the same movie, it's probably pretty hard to get in, even at a cheap theater. If it's on Netflix or a video rental site, try searching for the 1991 version. It should be the one, but sometimes the old movies get re-released. Also, if you're interested in getting the DVD, go to the Best Buy, and get the version with the black and white. It comes with a great bonus disc that has the full run time of the film, and includes a short commentary from the director. I haven't seen this movie in years, so I'm not sure how the original version is. The video quality is great. I've been told that it has an "old school" feel to it, which I like. The only problem I had was that it seemed to have an almost grainy quality to it. It might have been my DVD player. Also it's missing the ending credits. You can get those by going to Best Buy and getting the 1991 one. The original 1989 version has an audio commentary from Robert Englund and Michael Biehn, which is great, and it's also included on the DVD. You should get this film, even if you hate the film itself. It'll make you laugh a little, and you won't be disappointed. I hope you'll see it! ___________________________________________________  Jungle Book (1971)   A review by: Mike from USA.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and I really liked this movie, however, the movie is very boring and the plot is just so very boring, the whole thing was so predictable. The only thing that is different from the books is that Hermione is the main character, and that she gets killed. She was a wonderful character, who I adored, but she's a terrible role model in this movie. Also, I didn't care for Snape, the villain, he didn't really have a personality, and I just didn't like him. If you like this book, I would say you'll love this movie too. If not, I don't recommend this movie to anyone, it's just not very good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ The movie: A movie I was really looking forward to, because it is one of the best examples of the genre: a supernatural horror movie where the movie takes place in a house where the evil spirits are really active. And the movie did not disappoint. The movie is a great horror movie, but it has some flaws. For one thing, the actors didn't act like real actors, they acted like they are in some kind of game, because the movie has some great atmosphere. The script was also good, because we can tell that the director wanted to make a horror movie but not a cheap one. For example, the movie is made of a lot of flashbacks and we see some kind things from the past, but the movie also has a lot to do with the present, so it feels like the movie will have a good ending, even though the movie only has 6 or 7 scenes, which are only a small part of the movie. I also have to say that the movie had some serious flaws: the actors acting a bit strange, and also the cinematography was a bit bad, so the movie was not very good. The main problem with the movie, is that it was not scary at all, because I didn't like it at all. I think this is a movie which was made by an inexperienced director, because he was trying to do some kind stuff, but failed because the script and the actors did not help. _____________________________ Score:  8.5/10 __________________________ Reviewed by: A.

"Great stuff! A lot of fun and it has an excellent twist ending!" -M,M.  , a film from the 80s which is not very well known, was made by a young director who is probably best known for his work on the TV series. In this movie, a group of scientists travel to an abandoned nuclear reactor to discover what happened to the humans who were left behind after the explosion.   the film begins with a beautiful, but very strange, film, which shows the people in the town of Nogara as they prepare to return home. The film ends with the main character's wife (who has not yet met him) leaving her home and going to the reactor to try to find out what happened. As she is about to enter the reactor, a door opens in front of her, which leads to a long corridor where the scientists are waiting. A very strange sequence of events follows, in which we see the scientists working on the reactor and then the camera moves down to the main characters who are still on the corridor. The two scientists are talking and they make a remark about how strange it is that a nuclear reactor has been built in this deserted town. Suddenly, a blast of electricity comes out of the door and they realise that something has happened. They then rush to the scene and find a woman lying on the floor, dead.  .

It makes the main guy more likeable and it also makes it easier to sympathize with him. And the way he's so smart, is very smart! I loved how he uses the bad guy to help him get better, and it makes him a little bit better. And he's very clever, so he's also a little better. He even got the girl and they're great together.

"The Man With The Golden Arm"  by: M. D. Ewers  The best way to watch "The Man with the Golden Arm", is to not watch it at all, as it does not serve any purpose, and only wastes your time and brain cells. It is not a bad film, it is a film of the mind, not of the body. This is a brilliant and intelligent movie, but it is not very good, but that is only because it is just that, a movie, with very little substance, which has been done for the sake of a cheap laugh, and not for the purpose of making you feel any emotions. There are moments in this film that are very moving, and I was really moved, but the film just goes out of it, and the ending is very unsatisfying. I think this is why the film is so good, because it does a great job of showing the human condition, and how we see ourselves, and we are all in the wrong. It has a very beautiful and powerful ending, but because of that, it ends up being quite a boring movie. The cinematography in this movie is very good. I have a special love for the way the cinematography is used in this picture. It just makes everything look so perfect, and you will really see the difference in the cinematographic style of this film. I recommend this movie to everyone who has seen it, as a great way to relax and watch a great movie. It can be very entertaining, if you just sit back and relax.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Did not enjoy it: _______________________________________________________  A very, very good film that was not quite up to the standard of the first two films. I really liked the film and felt that the director was very good at capturing the mood of the era.   This film is set during the depression years, in the 1930s and early 40s, when there was a large influx of German immigrants to the United States. The film follows two of the German men, a farmer named Otto and his wife, as they try to maintain their small farm. The couple are very much a working class couple, as Otto and Anna are both farmers, while the father, Otto, has been a construction worker in the past. The father and son are close, with Otto often playing with his son and helping him with his homework. The children are very close to the father and they do not seem to be afraid of him. The son, Otto Jr., is the one who takes the biggest hit in the film, after he and his father are mugged by a couple of German men. After this, the father begins to make his way in life and to get a better education for his son. The mother also seems to be moving on with her life. She has two other children, a boy, named Otto Jr. and a girl, named Alice.   the children are never afraid of their father, even though his actions seem to indicate that he is a hard worker. There is never any hint of physical abuse. In the early parts of the film the children seem to like their father and the father treats them well. The other two children, Alice and Otto Jr, are very spoiled by the father. They are allowed to go wherever they want, eat whatever they want and sleep wherever they need to sleep. The two children also seem to enjoy being with their father. The wife, Anna, also seems happy to be married to a farmer, and she seems to enjoy life. The woman has a strong presence and her character seems to grow as the film progresses. She seems to have a sense of duty that she is carrying out and this seems to influence the other children as well. She tries to keep her husband and children together by telling them that he has to work and that she wants him to do his best.   and I would like to add that I really enjoyed the music of the period, as the music really adds to the mood and atmosphere of the story. There are also

This movie is just a really bad movie. I mean REALLY bad. The plot is really hard to follow and even the pirate doesn't have a clue what's going on. She's a pretty girl who's trying to make a living by pirating movies. I'm not kidding. But in the end she just ends up running away with the pirate captain and the guy who wants to rape her. Then he starts to rape the pirate... Then she kills the guy, and they flee together. So it's just a simple rape, and then she gets killed by the captain.  , I mean, come on. This is a movie for pirates. This movie is made for pirates, right? It's just not funny at all. I could've been bored out of my mind. If this was the movie version of a book about pirates, it would be a 1 star movie. No way it's an 8.  a really weird movie, but not really that bad. It has a few good moments. The pirates are a good example of bad bad bad. I think that this movie has an almost perfect ending. It was a pretty bad movie, and if you love pirates and love movies, it's a good movie. However, if you hate pirates, this movie isn't for you. I really didn't enjoy it. It's a decent movie, maybe. I wouldn't say it's great, but I wouldn t say it is bad. Just very strange. I didn't find it very funny at any time. This film is a bad pirate movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ My wife and I have never seen this movie, and I did not want to see it. We were going to see the first Star Wars movie, but my wife wanted to see The Empire Strikes Back, which is when I discovered this movie. It was an old school, over-the-top comedy with a cast that is filled with no-name actors. I am not sure if the movie was filmed in a movie theater or if they rented it out, but it is a movie that I did NOT want to watch. The characters are a mess, and the plot is ridiculous. The best way to describe the movie is that it is very funny but the plot makes no sense. There are so many times when you think it is going to be a good movie, only to have it turn into a bad one. If you do not want a good laugh, do not watch this movie! If you like good comedy, this movie is for you. I will watch it again, but not anytime soon.

That being said, the ending was a bit much, and made me feel a bit sick to my stomach. The entire movie seemed to have been made up as a prequel to the ending of The SixthSense, with the whole family acting like that, which made the movie feel rushed and rushed, as if they were trying to fit in a prequels-style finale. The only redeeming thing about this movie was the voice acting. They did a great job, and the movie was pretty scary. However, it still left me a bit disappointed. The Sixth Sight (2002) Movie Rank - 4.5/10 4.0/10 Summary While I did not find The Sixth Sence a complete let down, it was still a good movie, with some nice acting, and a scary ending. 4.2/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This movie is about a group of people trying to escape from the prison camp that has imprisoned them. They make a run for it and they get lost and the movie then moves on. They are not given a lot of information and they have to figure out where they are. I didn't really get what the movie was about and I thought that the characters were very one dimensional."  This is an interesting review.  I found this movie to be one dimensional.  The movie was made in the late 60's and early 70's.  It is based on a book called "The Naked and the Dead" written by Thomas Berger.  The movie takes place in an American prison camp where there are a lot people who have been sentenced to death for a crime that was committed a long time ago.   The film tells the story of a group that make their way out of the camp.  In the middle of the movie a character is killed.    There are several people who are also killed by other prisoners.  There are also a lot who are not shown and they are not really given any development.  As I said before, the movie is not given much information.  Some of the characters who are shown are not good people.  This movie is a good film, but it is very one-dimensional. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________ "The Man Who Killed Don Quixote" is not a movie you want to see. It is an absolute embarrassment to the medium and should not be seen. The film was directed by a guy who has never been known to make a good movie. His name is Jim Sheridan. This is the movie where he loses his mind and turns Don Quijote into a Nazi. Don Quiks is a very well written character but it is not his fault that he is a man of many contradictions. Donquixote is a noble man but he is also a complete bastard who is totally unsympathetic. The most glaring example of this is the fact that he doesn't kill anybody in this film. He simply saves a group of bandits from being slaughtered by the Spanish and then they are left to their fate. The movie is also full of inaccuracies and contrived plots that are just wrong. The first part of the movie is about the story of Don Quidote. It has a very interesting premise and is worth watching. In this part the story is told by Don Quichotte who is in a state of shock and has trouble getting on his feet after a long time away from his beloved. He finds himself on the shores of an unknown island. The story starts in a very exciting way. The scenery is amazing and the story has some great moments. Don is in the middle of a very complicated situation when he meets a certain knight named Quixada who is a knight in training. They are on a quest to find a certain book called the 'Book of Four Quixadas' but before they are able to do this, Don is attacked by a knight named Cervantes who is also on a mission. Cervante and Quixadans have a very intense duel and it is here that the film gets it's first real gaffe. The gaffe is that Quixado is the only person that Don Quiqote is able to save and even then, he is unable to save him because of his injury. The battle is quite intense but it all seems rather pointless when the story goes on for a while and it's not until the end of the film that it becomes clear that Donquiqote was the only one that was able to rescue Quixas. The last part of this film is a retelling of Don's life from his childhood until the time he finds himself in the present day. It all makes a complete mess
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a story about a group of people who go on a road trip to a new country, and it's not an American road trip.  The plot is pretty simple and the story is good, but I was bored pretty fast.    The movie is about a small group of friends who go to a very exotic place, but in order to get there, they must pass through a town.  There's a very dark mood going on in the movie. It doesn't even try to be funny at times, so you're forced to sit through it, and then you get to the good parts.  I thought the movie had some very good humor, and they managed to keep the humor throughout the movie, which I liked.  And I was actually laughing a lot during this movie.  I think they managed very well to keep a dark and funny mood throughout the entire movie. But the good scenes were hard to come by, and the bad scenes were so bad that they actually made the whole movie sad.  So if you're a fan of horror movies, you should definitely give this a try. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  I would give this movie a 7 but it was not a good movie and I did not enjoy it at all. It was like watching a bunch of people having a bad time. I would never have thought that a movie like this would have been made and it was very un-original. The actors were all bad. They all acted the same way. One of the actors was named Dwayne and he was the worst. He played the part of Dwayne the bully and he had the worst attitude. I thought he was going to be the one to do the movie. The other actors were also bad. I can't think of any of them. They just played the parts they were given. There was no talent in this movie.

So the movie is a huge trainwreck. It's about a guy who gets a $3 million contract to do a movie in Italy. The script is horrible, the movie director is a complete asshole, and the rest of the cast is not even worth mentioning. So, when the guy gets there and is told that they're filming the movie in the middle of the night, he decides to drive around in a stolen car and have a little fun. In doing so, he is attacked by two men in the town who are trying to rob him. Unfortunately, they don't take his money. The guy is then kidnapped and taken to a mansion where he's forced to go through a series of terrible and stupid rituals that he had no idea what they were for. After this, he escapes, but he is captured again a few months later when he tries to escape again and the same guys come to him to have him perform the same rituals again. The end of the movie was a complete mess. And this is a movie where the hero is a former porn star. This guy can do no wrong. This is a horror movie. So the whole movie was just a mess. The acting is horrible. The camera work is horrible and you see the actors acting in the way they were supposed to in the movies. The movie was made to make a profit and it is obvious that it was. If you don't like this movie, then don't go see it. The ending of this movie was terrible. It was so bad that it makes you feel bad for the guy. He is such a loser that he ends up killing himself.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Cabin Fever" is a very bad movie.  The worst aspect about it is that it is not funny.  Instead of making you laugh, it makes you want to scream.  In fact, you want scream until your voice comes out your ears.  It has a "bad guy" that is a psychopath and he makes the movie so painful.  He goes on a murder spree and kills innocent people.  I think the whole movie is a metaphor for how one feels when a family member is murdered.  My cousin was murdered and I still get a sick feeling when I think about it.  This movie was made to make you want the people that killed my cousin to be locked up.  That is the most disgusting thing I have ever seen.  No wonder the movie is so bad, it was made by a psychopath.  Rating: 3/10 Posted by The Black Widow at 1:10 PM

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  This movie is a great example of the kind of bad movie that makes me want to take my anger out on something, anything, rather than deal with the actual problem. The movie itself is a generic action movie that is just too bad. The plot revolves around a group of cops who have been sent to investigate a crime that was committed by a group called the "Chosen Ones". As the movie starts, we get a montage of the crime scene, showing the police doing their best to investigate it. We then meet a cop who has been assigned to the case. The cop seems like a nice guy, but in the first act, he is constantly breaking character and trying to cover up the crime, which he believes is an accident. He is constantly being harassed by a "rebel" (one of the Chosen Ones) who is actually a super-villain who is using the crime to make a name for himself. The cops constantly ask him to "take back his story" but this only makes the villain more powerful and the cops lose interest. At this point, the cops decide to take matters into their own hands. They go in undercover as the "bad guys", going around shooting people. After some innocent people are killed and others are badly injured, the bad guys are finally caught, but only because of the help of the cop who was an undercover cop at the time. The "bad guy" was a real super-criminal, who had escaped from a supermax prison. He had the same powers as the real super villain.  After the film is over, the movie makes you believe that the cops really did "catch the bad guy" but at the same time, we are made to believe that everything was a misunderstanding. In a way, the police officers just "over-reacted". The film's main flaw is that it completely ignores the real story, which was the story of the real bad guy. Instead of letting the real villain, the super-terrorist, get away, the film's ending tries to change the focus away from this real villain to another one who the cops had not caught. It also completely ignores how the movie's villain would eventually escape from prison after his "escape", by using his powers to teleport. As a result, the real "bad" guy is left in the dark. He can't find out that the police were all set up by a criminal mastermind, who he would later find out was the real
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ I had just seen the movie about two months ago. It was a good movie. It is a story about two young people who were lovers. The main character, played by the late John Hurt, has to choose between his girlfriend and his best friend, played with great sadness by the excellent Sarah Jessica Parker. It has great performances. Sarah Jessica is a great actress and I loved her performance. She played a girl with a lot of pain and sadness. She gave a very powerful performance. The other person who plays a good friend to the main character is Peter O'Toole. His character is a bit of a fool, but he has a very sad and very sad face. He is very much like a younger version of Mr. Hyde. Peter O's performance was excellent. He was so sad and sad that I could see how much pain he had. The best part of the movie was the ending. The ending was so very sad that you could hear every word of it. It gave a strong feeling of the ending of a love story. The movie was directed by Robert Wise and was very well done. The cinematography and editing were good. I would recommend this movie for people who like sad movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _________ ____________  I watched this movie because I was curious as to whether I'd enjoy a movie about a guy who gets a car with no gas and doesn't know how to fix it. Well, I thought that I'd probably be more interested in the story and the romance, but I found myself just bored. The characters were all so stiff, and there were so many little moments in the movie that were just so unnecessary, like the guy telling the girl that he'll have to go out for a little while. The acting was pretty bad, too. The only characters who seemed to be having any kind of chemistry with each other were the guy and the girl. The rest of the characters were just kind of there. There were a lot of jokes and one or two good lines, but it wasn't enough. The movie just felt so much like something that you would see on TV, with all the drama and action and stuff, and it didn't really have that "film" feel to it. I liked the movie, though, and I'll probably give it a shot sometime. I'll give this movie 3 out of 5 stars because it had some good action scenes and the chemistry between the characters was good.

The film is so full of pointless scenes and the acting is so poor that you wonder why it was even made. The writing is so bad that it makes me question if the director was just bored and did this as a laugh, or was he really trying to make a movie that was like this one, but in the best way possible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Why would you spend $10 on a movie that has no story to it but is a mess? The first 30 minutes of the film is about the characters trying to get a girl to come with them and she says no. The only reason they are trying is because the guy wants to be in the movie so he can show off his acting skills. The movie starts off with a stupid, boring, and poorly written song. The next scene is some random girl's brother's (not the main character's brother) song about how he thinks the world is better off without girls. That's the only scene that is bad. The rest of the movie is about people trying to make a girl like them or do anything they want in order to get her to go with them. The bad acting by all of the main characters makes it almost impossible to believe they are supposed to be the main guys. The acting is terrible, the music is stupid, and the story is stupid. If you are going to watch this movie, go in with no expectations, just be prepared to hate it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________"This movie is bad. Really bad. There's so much wrong with it, that I cannot believe the studio would even make this movie, because it's so bad that it actually makes the original movie look good. So what I'm going to do is try and explain why it is so bad, and how you can really enjoy it if you watch it in the right way. There are so many things wrong with this movie that it makes it a real disappointment. First of all, this movie is about a girl who has been living in a house with her brother. She is very beautiful, but she is lonely and she wants a family. So she starts to do a lot of research on adoption, because she wants to have a baby. The first thing she does is find out if a baby can be adopted from an abandoned building. So the first part of the movie, we are going to see the two of them living in this building for a couple of weeks, before they decide to leave it, so that she can do some more research. After they leave, she gets a call that her brother is getting a divorce, and she has to go back home to her family. It's not until the end of the film that we see her getting a call from the adoption agency that is going to adopt her baby. They tell her that her baby was taken from her, and that they have found the child's father and he will adopt the child, but that he needs to come to the building in which they found the baby. So after she gets there, and they tell her the child has been adopted, she starts crying. The next thing that happens is that she starts going through a lot more research on her baby, and we find out that the child is actually a boy, but the boy is adopted by a woman who is a heroin addict. So that means that the girl is pregnant, and in order to keep the baby, she has an abortion. So this movie has really bad stuff all around. There is a lot wrong with the way that it is told. First off, there is a girl in the building with a child who has no father. That's really stupid. Then, the guy who has adopted the child isn't going to take him back, because the father is a junkie. That makes no sense. It also doesn't make any sense to have this man adopt a kid that is adopted from a building. What the hell is wrong with
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________  I have seen the trailer and it looks pretty cool. The only issue I have is that it's so obvious the film is a rip off of "The Sixth Sense". The first one was a great movie and the second one was pretty great as well.  This one seems to have a lot of potential and it would have been a good follow up to "The Six" if it were more faithful to the source material. , 7.7 out of 10Based on the trailer it looks like a remake of "Six".The movie looks good and it's interesting to see how the story would go down if it was based on the original book. It is very interesting how people are so fascinated with these "supernatural" stories and that the original author's name is mentioned in the movie.The acting is great and the cinematography is excellent. I think this will be a really interesting movie to watch. It's a shame the director wasn't given the opportunity to direct a movie based on a novel he loved so much.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.  So in a sense, this movie is a "reboot" of a classic. In the old days of the late '80s/early '90s, I loved The Thing. It was a good film, but not a great one. In fact, it could be described as a "B-movie" if you like those kinds of films. The Thing was about an Antarctic scientist named Joe Morton who had to work on a "research" team, while his partner (played by Bruce Dern) was stationed at a research station. They found a dead body, but they were unable to figure out what happened to it. Joe eventually found a little girl named Melissa (played in the movie by Linda Hamilton), and he thought he might be able to help her. The movie also has a great score by John Williams, which helped make the film feel even more like a horror movie. So why did the movie get such a bad reputation? For starters, The Thing is a low budget, low budget movie. I won't lie to you; it's not a good movie. However, it was not a "Hollywood" film. And while I think The Thing should have gotten a better score, I also think that many critics and critics alike gave it a poor rating, because the movie just wasn't as good as it was made out to be. And yes, the movie was released in 1982, which is when I first saw it, but I also saw it in 1991. So there's that. But the other issue that I had with The Thing that was also present in many of the movies that came out during that time was that it was a "one-note" horror movie that did not try to be much more than that. It also did not take chances with the movie. It just went for a jump scare every time. That's not something that is effective. And the fact that the movie is so old, it doesn't even try to make it new. I remember in the opening scene when Melissa is at the morgue, and it's obvious that she is just a prop for the movie (I know it was just a short scene, but that doesn't excuse that). I also remember the ending of the movie when Melissa runs to the car, and we see the car's back end pop out of the door of the car (which we saw in the beginning). That just wasn,t cool. Now that I have mentioned

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________   This film is a total trainwreck. The story is terrible and not worth the time. This is a movie with some very well known and liked actors. But this is a completely awful movie.   The story revolves around a boy named Charlie who is sent to a mental institute. There he meets a young girl, Elsie, who is mentally disturbed. He has to work with her, but eventually she makes a lot of noise and makes him very angry. The only way to calm him down is to perform some very dirty and horrible acts on her. It goes a bit too far, and the film ends up being really disturbing and painful to watch. I just can't believe that a film like this could get made.  .  So it ends up with Charlie being sent back to his old school where he has to take his own revenge. He decides to dress up like Elsie and get into the principal's office to do some serious damage.   He does so, but he ends up doing more damage than the principal could ever imagine. And the principal has to do what she can to get out of the situation.   in a word: terrible.  ,  The acting is good, the music is really nice and the acting is ok. But the story is bad and very much not worth watching.   and to sum up: I can't recommend this film to anyone. I don't even want to see it again.     .

This is a very well done film, which does not try to glorify the war at all, but tries to show the pain and suffering the soldiers went through. The film also tries to explain why some of them ended up dead. There is a scene where the main character, Miguel, is talking to his wife in the kitchen. His wife, Ana, is telling him how sad he is because he never gets to see her anymore, and how he never sees his daughter again. The scene is a bit long, but it is a good scene because it gives us an insight into the character of Miguel and his feelings. Ana is very sad about his loss of his wife and daughter.The movie then goes on to show us what the war was like.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I will never watch a remake of a bad original again"  - Michael Moore (from the film "Michael Moore in Trumpland") This movie is not a remake. It is a new and unique take on the original. It shows the true story of a real life assassination attempt on President Kennedy. I have never seen such a detailed and accurate portrayal of a successful assassination attempt and assassination. It gives you a look into the mind of the assassin. The movie shows the whole assassination from the start of the planning until the moment of the shooting. The film was done by Robert Zemeckis who also wrote and directed the movie. It was an amazing movie and it made me feel like I had been there. I hope that this movie can make a few people look at the assassination in a different way. I was very interested in seeing this movie because I was wondering why they never made a movie about the assassination. The answer was the same in the movie, they didn't want to repeat what was done before. This movie shows why. The story is set in 1963 and you see how a group of men planned a successful attempt on the life of President Kennedy and then they tried to cover it up. You will learn about the different people involved in the assassination and how they were all caught up in a conspiracy. The story was really interesting. The main plot is that a group called "The Conspiracy" wanted to kill Kennedy. One of them, Lee Harvey Oswald, was in the film as well. The plot goes in different directions and there is some tension and suspense as you follow the story. You see how each person in the group gets caught up with the conspiracy. You learn about what was happening in the world. This is the first time you see what was really going on during the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This film shows the real story and is a great movie. I highly recommend this movie.

The acting was terrible. The characters were not believable. The movie was a total train wreck. I hate movies like this. It has all of these scenes that are terrible. I was shocked at the ending. I mean, this movie is so bad that you think you're watching a bad TV show. I wish that they would have given it a C+ instead of a D.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ The movie has some good things. It has a strong script, a cool look, a decent cast and good actors, and the performances are very good. The script is pretty good and the plot seems to be well thought out and the acting is very good throughout. The only thing that I didn't like about the movie is that it seemed to take a lot longer to get to the ending. I have heard that they tried to make the movie faster but the pacing is still a little slow, and I feel like the movie could have been done in a lot quicker way. It just took a lot of time. I do think that the movie was very well made. If you want a good movie with good actors and good script, then you should give this movie a shot. The acting was really good and there was a lot going on in the story. There is no bad or good parts of this movie, but I do recommend this movie to any fans of action and action movies. ______________ I was very disappointed with this movie. It was a good story with a great cast, but it didn't feel like a true action movie. This is a movie about a group of people in a military base who get caught up in a situation that they don't want to be in, and it just didn't seem like a movie that I could relate to. I think that this movie should have been a film about the group in the military base that was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. There are a lot more movies that I have seen that were about a different group of soldiers, or a different time in the war. I also think that they could have made the movie about the real events that happened at that base, and not just about a fictional group of guys. Overall, I thought that the acting was good, but the plot of the movie did not feel very real to me. This was not a movie I was looking forward to seeing, and even though I do like action movies, this movie did NOT help.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________ I can't really say this movie has a good plot. It's an old movie that is being re-made. The main character is a "psychic" who sees and hears things from the dead, which I thought was an awesome idea but it's done very poorly. I can only see a few things going right in the movie, and I found most of them pretty lame. For example, he gets his sister (who is now his wife) pregnant by a stranger who then dies of a heart attack. His wife was not happy with him at all. They then find out that he is actually a psychic, and when his wife dies of another heart attack, he takes a look at his dead wife and realizes that she was pregnant, and then he dies. This happens in a matter of minutes and it really doesn't make any sense. I guess it was supposed to be a movie about a psychic. I don't really see the point of the story, because it is just a story about a man who dies and then goes back in time to find out what happened to his wife, and there isn't really any story to it. The acting was pretty bad, and some of the actors are really bad, I think they should have hired someone to do the acting for this movie instead of the cheap guy who was in the original movie. I did enjoy the music though. _________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________ The film was rated R in the USA and NC-17 in the UK.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ So I watched this movie for the first time in a long time and it was a total let down. It was a bad adaptation of a good movie. It had the same plot as the movie and a few of the same people from the movie. However it was horrible. It just didn't work. There was no chemistry, the acting was terrible, the music was terrible and the editing was terrible. It's like they just wanted to cash in on the original movie and just made it a bad version of it. The movie didn't even have a good ending. If you are thinking about getting this movie watch the movie first. Don't waste your money.

When I saw the trailer, I was so intrigued. But when I watched the movie, I could not get into it. It was just a huge disappointment. I don't even think it was good. It looked like it was filmed on a low-budget, and the acting... well, you get the picture. You can see that the director didn't care about making this movie as good as it could be. The movie was not a good film, so what were you expecting? I gave it a 3/10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ It's a very good movie, but it's a film with some good acting and some bad acting. It's about a little boy who lives with his grandmother in a very big house, where the little boy always gets angry when someone tells him that the big house is big and the little house is small. So the movie is a bit like that. But then you have a great, great cast, and it's one of the best films I've seen in a long time. It is so good that it is really, really hard to hate it. I love it so much. The director, the cinematographer, the writers, all of them are so good. It has a great score. I mean, you can't go wrong with it, because it's so good, and the characters are so wonderful. It will make you laugh and cry. It'll make you want to cry, but you'll still laugh at the end. It really is the best film of the year. And the cinematography is so beautiful. So beautiful. It just has this beauty about it. It makes you cry when you see it, but then you laugh when you watch it. You'll be so happy when you go to the theater and watch it in a big theater. It might be the best movie of the summer. And it's just one of those films that makes you go home and watch your friends watching it and you'll say, "Yeah, I love that!" It's just so good!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. _______________. _______________________. (Not all movies are created equal, and this movie, despite the good reviews, is no exception. I don't think this is the worst movie I've seen.  I'm talking about the worst. _________________________________) __________________________________ _____________________________________ __________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________ I thought this was going to be a good movie, because I was really interested in the concept and plot.  It's a science fiction movie, set in the future, where humanity has created a colony on Mars.   The colonists live in this big dome.  When you get up in the morning, the air is very clean, and the people don't have to use much to make the air breathable.  The whole thing is a bit creepy and I donít think it is the most realistic looking thing, but thatís probably because I havenít seen a lot of science fiction movies.  There are a lot more details in this movie that I didnít understand and I thought that was odd.  For example, the colonists live inside a huge dome and they don't use any oxygen.  I donót think thatís how it works on earth.  However, the film is very exciting.  They live in their own little world and they go outside a lot.  So itís a lot like the movie "Minority Report", except this movie is more about the aliens than it is about the people.  Also, they are the only people who have ever created a space colony on another planet.  This is very strange to me.  If it were a sci-fi movie, it would be the most obvious thing.  But it seems to me that the aliens are here to take over the earth and they want to take the colonists along.  My biggest problem with this movie was the soundtrack.  Although it was really nice to listen to at the movies, it didn't help me at all.  Many of the music is just awful.  You can hear people saying "oh" and "um" and the music just seems to be there to fill in the background noise.  These are some of the best songs I have ever heard.  Overall, I didn't think the movie was very good.  As much as I liked the concept of the movie, the movie wasn't very good at all, and I think it was just a really bad movie.

The story is a little hard to follow, but you get the gist. This is a good looking movie. The cast is all good. The one I liked the most was the female lead, Julie Christie. She is a very good actress. I would have liked a little more to happen with the other actors in the film. There are some scenes that just seemed a bit rushed. It was nice to see some of the old movies in a new way. It has a very retro feel. The soundtrack is also nice, and is a nice mix of old movie music. The film is well acted.

It was just an excuse to use the same plot over and over again.    I have seen a movie with this exact plot, and it is so boring.  I have seen many movies that are just trying to be a horror movie.

One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting is atrocious and it is obvious that the actors did not have any idea what they were doing. It does not even matter that the director is a great director, there is not enough time in the movie to make him worth mentioning. If you are a fan of horror movies you would not be surprised to hear that the movie had a lot of fans. This movie has not aged well, it is a terrible movie and a complete waste of money. I am sorry but this movie is a total disappointment and I would not recommend it. I hope this movie never gets released.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________. If you think it was bad, tell me why. If the movie has nothing to offer, and it's a good example of what not to do, then tell me that too. If I like it, I'll watch it again.  So, it's been a while since I watched a movie with such bad dialogues and terrible acting. This movie had a great concept and it would have been really great to see a real action movie. However, the movie did not deserve any of the hype. The story is about a woman, who gets into an accident on her way home from work. When she wakes up she's in a coma. When the doctors ask her about her previous life, she doesn't remember any of it. A woman is trapped in a man's body. He's an expert in martial arts and he's not a bad guy. The movie begins with a lot of dialogue and then it quickly becomes boring. There's a lot about the movie that is really boring, such as: the guy, who's character is very weak and is the one who is in control of the girl's body, doesn't have a name. The guy is also in love with the woman. They live together, and the guy can control the girl. Then there's the guy who can't control the woman, and he tries to kill the guy. This guy also lives with his parents. He is so weak and in love that he's willing to do anything to keep the girl alive. The only good thing about this movie is that it ends with a great ending, but it was too short. The ending was just stupid. The first half of the movie was a real treat, and I thought the movie would be a masterpiece. When the movie ends, I felt a bit disappointed, and then I thought about how I felt when I watched this movie. When I saw the ending, I thought that this movie could have been a masterpiece, but the movie just didn't deserve to be called a masterpiece because of the dialogues. It just did not work. The actors did not have any good acting skills. I think that the actor who played the guy with the martial arts was a very nice guy, but he wasn't good. I would have liked to see the movie with more action, but this movie had bad acting, bad dialogs and poor writing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was just awful.  If you've ever watched a film that was supposed to be a romantic comedy or a comedy, you will know that the characters always have something to hide.  The story was very bad, the acting was bad, and the plot was bad.  I couldn't understand why this movie was in theaters and not in a movie theater.  It was just bad.  I mean it was really bad. I was watching this movie for two reasons: 1.  Because I love movies with love and they are a great way to spend a rainy night. 2.  To see my ex-boyfriend, who I've been seeing for six months now.  This movie was so boring, so predictable, and so awful that it was painful to watch.  He kept saying he loved me and was sorry for all the pain I was going through.  But I didn't feel sorry for him.  I didn't love him either.  My only sympathy for him was that he was always getting into fights with my friends, but they were always over trivial things.  Now he was on his own.  What an idiot he was.  All he was doing was drinking, smoking pot, and doing cocaine.  And all the time he was trying to kill himself.  Why would anyone do this to themselves?  I wish I could've known what I know now about addiction.  People who are addicted to something can never get it off of them.  They have to live with it, and that's why they are always fighting.  So when he said he loved my ex I felt so bad for him, but I was also angry at him. I told him I was really disappointed in him and I thought he was going to end up dead.  Then he told me that he loved us all and we were going to be ok.  That was nice of him to say, but he had no idea.  We had a big fight, he came to my house, and then he didn't come back.  When I asked him why he hadn't come home, he said that he had been in an accident.  Well, I knew that he wasn't going to come home because he was still using and he had gotten in a fight with his girlfriend.  She didn't believe me, but she never asked me to do anything about it.  At that point I was already pretty angry at her, so

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! It was just a bad flick, like the movie of the same name.  ...  I'm not even going to bother trying to write a positive review about this movie.   I would like to point out that I saw this film at an "indie film festival" at the Hollywood Theatre. At the time, it was the only film playing in the theater. I think I can safely say that the film is not the worst thing that has ever been shown in this theater.   I remember being in awe of the film's special effects. I was very disappointed with the acting. It was a poor effort. The best actor in the film was a very young Paul Sorvino. He did not appear in the movie very much. His only appearance was in the beginning.  'shadow of the caped crusader' was released on March 1st, 1990. I'm not sure what year the movie was released in, but it probably was not before. It is a bit odd to think that a movie from 1990 was being shown in a movie theater in 1990. Maybe because this movie had not been released in the U.S. yet? I don't know. Maybe the movie's original title was 'The Dark Knight Returns'. It is very hard to tell from the DVD that the movie originally had a different title. 'The Caped Crusader' was the name of the vigilante Batman fought in the comics and movie. The film's title may have been changed because it was originally being released in a theater in England.  ,  The film opens with a very bad scene. It shows us a villain who has taken over the city of Gotham. He has created a group called The League of Shadows. The movie is shot in dark and gloomy city streets. The villain is shown with a hood over his head and his face covered in a mask. The villains is holding a sign that reads "No more crime." The scene ends with Batman looking down at a man with a baton in his hand. The man has been shot in the head. He is lying on the ground. He looks like he is dead. A man runs up and takes a batarang from a villain. The Batman turns around and looks at the man who was shot. He then turns around to go after the villains who are standing in the street. He goes into a building and starts to chase after them. Batman runs into a room and a man who is holding up

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ I love to talk about movies, but this movie has absolutely no redeeming value. It is a story of a man who goes on a journey to find a "fairy godmother" for his baby, and it is a total rip off of "The Little Mermaid" and the "The Lion King" movies. I have heard this story before, and this movie, in which a woman is tricked into marrying a monster, is another example of the same story. The monster, who is supposed to be dead, suddenly comes back to life and kidnaps the little girl, and he gets away. Now, this movie doesn't really have any story, and I didn't find any reason for the little sister to come along on the journey. She is just there to be rescued. So, there is nothing to be said about this movie except that it is really bad, and the only good part is the music. But don't take my word for it, watch the movie for yourself.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was boring and the lead actor (John Krasinski) was terrible. I don't care what movie you are watching, if you want to see John Krasinskis be cool, then go watch the film with that title, he is in the movie and doesn't do anything. It is just an excuse to be seen on TV. I would recommend this movie to anyone who doesn't like good acting. The only reason it got a "2" is because it was a good movie. - February 24, 2010Lazy acting  Reviewer: J-L-D - favorite favorite favorite - January 24, 2009  Subject: Not a good one, but entertaining A couple of years ago when it was released I remember it being a really good movie about the dangers of technology.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!, that was bad, I mean really bad, and it's all the same movie, it's just different scenes, I think it's the same actors, different names, different places. I didn't know the director and his wife, but I think that was why it was so bad, the actors were all so drunk and stoned, and I hate to be rude but they should have called it a day and let the fans have a good time. I don't even know who did the music, it was really cheesy, and the song was kind of bad. It was all the way through and it was a lot to think about, I wish the movie hadn't ended so abruptly, but this is a bad idea. I give it a 2.5/5, and my recommendation is to pass it by.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________________  "I was in the theater with my wife and I had just started to watch a film called The Exorcist. The film was excellent. I felt the movie was very important in the history of horror. But at the same time, it was terrible and the acting was so bad it's almost embarrassing. The people in the movie were all in makeup and horrible, even the children. My wife was trying to make me not think about the acting but I just couldn't take it any more. The ending, when the little girl gets exorcised and the father goes after her, was so poorly done. I could not watch that scene any more than that. It was just disgusting and the child should have been killed, not killed by her father. I was so angry and ashamed of myself for watching that film."  _____________________________________________________________  From the moment the camera starts to roll, The Ex-Men is a train wreck. This is one of those films that could have been great, had it been made in the 1950s. It is based on a popular horror book, The Conjuring, and stars Patrick Wilson and a young Brad Dourif as a pair of paranormal investigators who stumble into a home in New Jersey that's inhabited by a demonic couple. This film has a ton of potential, but it is just awful.  It's hard to tell how bad it is. The acting is all over the place, and the story is a disaster from the start. There's a moment in the film where we meet a young boy who is possessed by a demon. At one point he appears to be holding a tiny little girl, but we're never shown how that child died or what happened to her. It's a confusing and unsatisfying plot, and it doesn't help that this film was written by the same man who created The Conjuror. . 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ It's a real shame that this movie was made because it is a very good movie. A young girl (Lori Kay) is raped in a church by two priests. The movie is good. It's not a good movie but it's very good. The plot is well developed and the characters are well drawn. One thing I like about this movie is that there are no real characters that you really care about in this movie. There is just one girl and her brother. And you can feel her pain and fear. There are no heroes, only victims. And the only thing you care about is the pain and the fear. And I don't know why but it felt good. If you have a lot of patience, this movie will be worth it. I really enjoyed this movie but the ending is a bit too dramatic and unnecessary. I think the movie could have ended on a good note. The only problem with this movie (for me) is the acting. But if you want to see a good acting movie with good acting, this is the one. I recommend this movie for people who like good acting movies.

C. S. Lewis was a member of the Communist Party, a Trotskyist, and a member in good standing of the Socialist Workers Party. He was also a very religious man, and his religious beliefs made him very sympathetic to Communism. In his later years he often referred to this as his "twin convictions." His faith, in his own words, "was the only thing keeping him from becoming a Communist." He felt that Communism was a "great movement" and that he was "a Communist with the greatest possible love for it." He had little time for the "dissidents" in the Communist party. He felt their criticisms of Communism were superficial, superficial, and superficial, because they were not really concerned with the nature of Communism itself. He often commented on the irony of "doubtless the greatest religious movement ever seen," but he was not at all interested in trying to convert the world. He thought that the people who had been converted would soon realize the great error of their ways, and that this would cause a revolution. He saw this revolution as a coming-together of the great religious movements, of Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism, into a new faith. He believed that it was not enough for people to go to church, to read the Bible, and to pray; they had to do more. They had to join a Communist organization, join a union, and go to work. The first step in his view of the Christian religion was for people, after they had been brought to the point where they felt "the burden of guilt" had been lifted, to go into labor unions, and work on behalf of Communism. As he saw it, if Christians were willing to work for Communism, the Communist would be willing to give them a free Bible. In fact, he was always happy to see Christian converts to Communism, for this was the "second great event" in his life, after the birth of his first son. "What a wonderful thing, to

However, the ending to the movie was just ridiculous and made me want to see the movie over and over again. I felt like it had more to do with the movie making itself than the story it was based on.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ "A very nice guy with a terrible personality"  3.5/5  ______________________________________________________________________________ "The most boring movie I've ever seen"  the most boring I've seen. if you're going to do a story about a group of people who go through hell and back and live to tell about it and then they get to meet the next generation. you'd think that the next film would be a little more epic. it isn't. and it's not even about the future. It's about this one character that lives in a house and has a terrible time. and he can't really talk about it because he's the one who's been in the house. and what he tells you about the next few years is just a little bit of his story. and the best part is that when you finally get to see what happens after you leave, there's not much of a story. you get an ending, a bunch of kids walking away from the house, and then the credits roll. the only thing that's really interesting about the ending is the fact that it shows the last few minutes of the film, before the credits. but you don't know what happened after the credits, so it's just a pretty pointless ending. and if you look at it from a narrative standpoint, it really is very boring. I don't think this movie would work well for anyone, not even for someone who's seen everything that's been made. if it were for me, it would have been a waste of my time. but it's better than all of the other movies that have been made in the past few years, so if it was a good movie, it wouldn't be bad.  5/10  Advertisements

There were a lot of great characters in this film. There was the alien who was a little bit annoying at first but once he got a taste of what was in store for him he was all "fiiiiiiiine". There were other aliens as well. The main villain was a really bad guy, but that wasn't a bad thing. He was just the bad guy. The thing that was really hard to watch was the way the aliens spoke. It made the movie feel more like a cartoon. The characters also didn't seem to be all that interesting. The special effects weren't bad at all, but they were pretty basic. I thought the special effects were great when they were used properly. They were not used very much. Overall I think this movie would be a pretty good movie to see with the kids. I will admit that I was a bit disappointed. I mean, I liked the characters and the special effect work. I guess it would have been better if it had a better ending, but it still had a lot going for it. This was a very well made movie. It has a lot to offer, but the ending wasn't good enough.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You're just making it worse.  The movie starts off pretty well, with a few good jokes and a good story.    A few months ago, a few guys are sitting around a table and decide to go into the store and try and steal something.  They get stuck in the store, and as they're trying to get out, the guy who works there is having a heart attack.  He dies, and his co-workers start to chase after the guys.  As they're chasing them, they get caught up in a train and it hits the train and starts to move backwards, so they run into a tree.  The tree is broken and they're trapped in the tree.   Then the tree starts to fall down and they have to try and save themselves.  It's pretty funny.  There's even a few scenes with the tree falling and the guys trying to save themselves from falling off the tree and being electrocuted.  Then, it's just bad, it starts off with a bad joke and a bad plot.      The ending is even worse, and then the movie just gets worse and worse.   It's just so bad.  I just can't believe someone could make a movie like this.  After the first 30 minutes, I was ready to give up.  How could anyone watch this movie and think it was good?  This movie is bad, and even worse then the trailers made it out to be.  This is like watching someone else's movie, then they get drunk and try to act it out.  My friend who went with me to the theater said the guy in the first trailer looked just like him.  Even the guy that was the main character in the movie looked like him, and it was the same exact guy.  So, I don't know why someone would ever watch this, it really doesn't deserve a rating at all.  If you want a bad and stupid movie, this is the one for you.

The plot and characters are all very silly, and I felt that they were trying to tell a very dumb joke. The story is so convoluted and poorly conceived that the ending was totally unsatisfying. The film has some great shots, but it's just too dark to make it all look very interesting.

The film is about a group of people who decide to travel in the woods, and it is about as bad as you can possibly imagine.

The people acting are just as terrible as the people who are in the movie.  If you are a fan of "Beverly Hills Cop" you are going to enjoy this movie as well. The only reason this movie is worth watching is because it is a remake of the original "The Beverly Hillbillies". The original movie is a pretty good movie, but this movie takes a different approach to the story. I guess the film producers thought that since the original was a classic, they could take this story and put a new spin on it. They probably thought the remake would do just as well as the original, and they would make a lot of money.     I was so angry with this movie that I am still angry with it today. I can't really tell you how the story was told in this movie. It is just like some other stupid movie I have seen in the past. The actors do not look like they were having fun. They did not do anything with their acting, and I felt like the movie was a chore. I felt bored all the way through this movie, and all the characters were just dumb and uninteresting. The one character I actually found interesting was the guy in the wheelchair. His character was just a bit too annoying to be able to care about, but he was also kind of cute. The woman in the car was also pretty nice and I would have liked to see more of her.       So to wrap up this review, "The Woods" is one dumb movie, which is pretty bad. I was expecting a lot more from a movie called "The Hills". It is probably one of my worst movies, but I guess I am just not a big fan of the new "Bachelorette" show.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   "The Big Lebowski is a fun, entertaining, and extremely bizarre comedy. However, there is no redeeming value in the film as a whole. This movie is a piece of trash, a complete and total waste of your time. This film should be regarded as a classic of the genre, a film that was made by the same people who made The Wizard of Oz and The Wizard. This is a completely inept and misguided effort by the screenwriters to try to "pay tribute" to the classic of American cinema. The acting is awful, the direction is poor, and the screenplay is as bad as the film itself. In fact, I would argue that this film is more like a parody of The Wizard than it is a homage to the original. If you are a fan of The Big Lebowksy, or just a fan for the sheer sake of seeing a well-done comedy film, then this movie is definitely worth your time."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie is a waste of time. The movie starts with a few short scenes of a group of kids playing on a boat. This is the only part of the movie I didn't enjoy. The group is small and the only character who has any development is the one who goes on to be the leader of the group. This leads to a lot of problems. The plot is predictable and the actors don't give any personality to the characters. The only way to solve these problems is to just forget that the movie even exists and just watch the boat scene over and over again. This movie has a lot more problems than it solves and that is the real reason why this movie is bad. _________  …

I think they used this story to bring up the evil of the devil. I thought they were going to do some serious research to find out what this devil was all about. They even have a whole chapter about it. They did not even use the Bible to research this, but some guy with a video camera in the background. I really think that this movie was made to make a quick buck. I guess they should have used the real devil. This movie is a waste of time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Oct 16, 2017 7:29 PM by NIMAYMAYI From the first moment we see the title of this movie we knew it was going to be a bad one. As you can see from the trailer, there was nothing that made us expect this film to be good. It was supposed to be another 'Dangerous Minds' but the director tried to make it seem like a horror film, which is a good thing because the film had no atmosphere. The film has a lot of sex scenes, which were boring and not scary. The main female lead has to deal with her lover and his strange actions and in the end, she goes mad. There is not a single good thing about this film. The only thing I like about it is the actors. You could feel the tension between them but the main lead was not scary enough. I will not watch this film again. I can't recommend this film as a horror flick. This is just a bad film with a bad title.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ I will be honest, I watched this movie to relax after a long day at work, and I did. I was pleasantly surprised with the story and plot, and the characters were believable and interesting. But the ending was stupid. I will just say this: I am not sure what happened to her parents or the baby, but there was something seriously wrong with the baby. It seemed like she had been born with some kind of mental problem or something. There was also a guy who wanted to help the baby out, but his motives were pretty questionable. The girl was really cute, but she really just seemed to be an actress. And the baby was so weird, like he didn't seem to have a mother, and he seemed to have no family or a father or anything. He was just a kid who was born without a father, and it made no sense. I guess I'll give this movie a pass. But I will not be seeing any other movie by this director.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________   I had been a little worried about the film, as I had read about it in some reviews. It was a very bad movie. The acting was bad. The writing was terrible. The direction was terrible and the editing was terrible, as if a movie editor had tried to fix the script in some way, and failed. The ending was the most disappointing of the bunch.   In this movie, the main character is a very sadistic murderer, and one day he has the idea to kill a certain female. He goes to a bar and he has a little talk with the bartender. This bar is a place that is run by the owner's wife. She is a bit of a slut. He asks her if she is willing to go out with him, and she says yes. They go out to a very nice dinner. After dinner, they get back to the bar, and he puts a gun to her head, and then he takes out his money and then shoots her dead. The main character then walks out the door. I really hated this movie. I felt it was a bit like watching a movie where the actors are so bad, that it is difficult to believe that this movie was made by a good person. The movie was just a pile of bad acting, bad acting and bad acting.   the writing was so bad that the only way that I can describe it is that it was the type of movie where you would expect the actor to be trying to act, but it was so obvious that he was trying to write a scene.   and the acting was so terrible that I just couldn't believe that anyone would have thought this movie would be a success.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those films that makes you want to see it again and again, but not in the way you want. The story is fantastic, and it's just the right amount of ridiculous to make you forget about the ridiculousness. There is an aspect to the movie that makes me think it's going to be a bit of a cult classic, but it will never be able to hold a place in the top 10 of my favorite horror movies. This movie has great effects and a great soundtrack. But, I have never seen anything like this before, and even if I do, I will never get the feeling that I've seen it before. If you love a good laugh, and are looking for a fun horror flick that will leave you laughing for days, then look no further. If this movie is not available in your area, it may be worth seeing as a rental, especially if you live near one of the many horror movie theaters that still put on a good show every night.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  " The Worst Movie  Ever " is the worst movie ever. It is a terrible, awful, disgusting, disgusting movie that should never be seen. If you have the stomach to watch this movie, then do it, you will be a very sad person after watching this movie. The film is so horrible that I will be very upset if my children ever see this movie because it will make me very upset. The story is that a family is having a Christmas party. This is when things get bad for the family. Then the kids come home and the mother is dead. Then she takes her baby and leaves. The family goes to look for her but they don't find her anywhere. Then they go to a hospital to find out where she is and the doctor tells them that she is in a coma and she is not coming back. They go to her bedside and she says that she loves them and she wants to see them again. This movie is very confusing because it is confusing what happened and what is going on. The plot is very bad, but it has a good ending because it shows how horrible the world is. The movie was made by a German movie director, and the actor that plays the mother, has no acting ability whatsoever. It's the worst thing ever. I hope you all never see this horrible movie. I will never watch it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ This movie was awful. I could see why people thought this was a good movie at first. However, the entire film just had too many problems for me to continue watching it. I was a little put off by the acting and the fact that it was a remake of a 70s movie about a man who kills people. The way that the movie was shot was just horrible. The film was set in the 60's but the people looked old. It looked like the movie had been filmed with a 70's camera. The people were just so... ugly. It seemed that the director decided to add a lot of makeup to make the characters look younger and sexier. This was one of the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting was horrible and there were just too many of them. The movie was not very well edited and the acting was very bad. There were a lot more sex scenes in this movie than in the original film. I just can't recommend this movie. I wish it would have just been called The Killers.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________.  My brother and I both watched the movie "The Shawshank Redemption" on Christmas Day of 1998, on a tiny TV in a neighbor's bedroom. We watched it with the lights off. It was a rainy night. We were a little worried about how many minutes of the movie would be shown, and how many times we'd have to repeat it. But we found it to be a great movie. We even made up the story of our night to tell to our parents when we got home. But the next day we couldn't sleep and we watched it again. It made more sense, so we kept watching it again, over and over. Then, in the middle of it, we were having a conversation about it with our parents. We kept on repeating "She did it to herself." I felt guilty for doing that to myself. The more I watched it, the more I was thinking of myself as a victim. This is a great book about a guy that was on the edge of a cliff. He didn't know if he was going to jump or not. He thought he was on top of the world. Then a beautiful woman he'd been with for a few months came up to him and said she loved him. He couldn't believe it. He fell into the river and was washed away. The story starts with him thinking that his family has always been there for him and he doesn't have to worry about them anymore. He's free. But then he starts to have doubts about his freedom. Then he gets a job and his wife leaves him. The woman who loves him tells him that she loves him too. Then they get married. It all feels too good. So he goes to his wife and says he wants a divorce. She says it's a bad idea and he shouldn't do it. They argue. But eventually he gets drunk and goes to the lake to drown himself. But he is rescued by a couple of fishermen. They tell him to leave them and go to his friends. The fisherman tells him about a place called Shawshanks. The guy starts going there and eventually he becomes a happy man. He has everything he could want. And he never goes back. But his friends keep asking him if he wants to come back to them. So the guy goes back and is never heard from again. A few years later a guy is arrested for killing a man. The man says that he was the one who saved him
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The biggest problem with this movie is that it's a big, boring, slow movie about the same old cliches.   I don't think there was ever a point in the movie where anything really happened or had any sort of impact.  It's a slow, boring movie that has nothing to do with what was going on.   A little boy gets lost in the woods.  A girl gets in trouble with the law.  The main character gets kidnapped by the sheriff.  Then the main character runs away.  This movie has been made for over 40 years and has never been released in the U.S.  You might want to see it in a foreign language, but if you don't like big movies with lots of characters, this one is not for you.

I was at a movie theatre with my family. I was sitting in the front row with my wife, we had a great time. We had been at the theater for two hours already and I thought that the movie was going to be great. The director and her co-star (Linda Fiorentino) were good actors. When we left the theatre we saw the press talking about the movie. The story was not that great and I was a little disappointed. I got home and watched the movie again and I found the acting to be much better and the script to be better. I thought it was an amazing movie. I have seen this movie several times now and it has stayed with me. This is the reason I think this movie should be considered a classic. I can't wait to see the movie "Dirty Dancing" next!  ... 'significant in the history of cinema',  Barry Mann, Los Angeles Times (Los Angeles, CA, USA)  A few years after this film was released, director and co-writer, John Waters wrote an article in his "The Nation" magazine, about a woman who becomes obsessed with the idea of an American flag being defaced by a stranger in her living room. This became the film's title, 'Dirty American'.  'Dirty Dining Room' (1963)    This film, directed by Mike Nichols, was the first of a trilogy of three feature films, all of which were produced by the same director.  I have heard that this movie is a lot of fun.  in my opinion the acting is the best, but the music is very cheesy.  for those that love the film, it is definitely worth watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Would you watch a movie that's so bad you hate it so much you could only imagine it? _____________ I can't wait to see how this movie ends up. The story is about an American couple and their daughter, who has been kidnapped by a group of men who want to steal the money that was taken from the couple. However, this story is based on a true story. The plot is so bad, that one can only imagine that the actors and actresses were not able to deliver their roles. I feel that the director could have avoided some serious problems by having some actors or actresses with the right age range. ___________________________________ I would say that the film is made for young people who want some action and thrill. The acting is not great, but it's not bad at all. The actors are very good and the cinematography is very nice. However this movie is not a good movie for a young person. It is a movie for the young adults. This is a good action movie for children, because it will keep their imagination going for a long time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's not that bad.   The music, acting and story are good.  Unfortunately, the acting is just terrible and the story is a complete non-sequel.  The acting is so bad that they have to play off each other, and there is no chemistry between any of the characters.  If you were to try and write a negative film review about this movie, you would have to say that it's a waste of time.  I've seen better films and this movie doesn't even come close to being up to par.  It doesn't make any sense, and it's not even very good acting.  Also, the plot is a little lame.  So what is a movie like this?  It is a horror movie set in a small town.  This town is haunted by a young girl who was murdered.  What makes this movie even more disturbing is that the girl who is haunting this town is actually a ghost.  She appears to be a young, beautiful woman who has just left her mother's house to go to a prom with a handsome stranger.  As she walks through town she encounters several other ghosts who haunt the place.  There are several other creepy elements that happen in this movie.  First, when the girl enters her house she sees a young man sitting in the window with a shotgun.  A man appears in the middle of the room and begins to scream at her to go away.  He says that he wants to have sex with her.  Then, another ghost comes out of the closet and takes a shower with the girl.  Finally, there is a ghost who appears to try to have intercourse with the ghost of the girl that is stalking her.    So why is this movie so scary?  I think that one of the main reasons is that it has a great soundtrack.  Most of the music in this film is either a distorted version of an old song, or some other creepy song.  When the girl and her friends are trying to find the girl's killer, the movie starts to sound like it was recorded in a horror studio.  Even though the film is about a girl who's been murdered, the music and acting in this production is just so bad, that you will never be able to enjoy this movie unless you want to listen to a scary movie in a movie studio.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ***********I've never seen a movie so terrible that I could not enjoy it at all. I'm so disappointed in this movie. This movie was so bad that I have to say that it's worse than The Dark Knight. I thought I had watched something that was really good, but the movie is so bad and has nothing to do with any of the Batman's stories. Batman is supposed to be a dark and brooding character, but this movie just showed him to be really lame. The movie starts off with the worst line of dialogue I've ever heard in a movie: "What's in that little box?" The movie takes place in the 30s and it's almost like it was made in the 60s or 70s, so it was so cheesy and silly. I just couldn't help laughing at all of the stupid jokes that they made. I can't even believe how bad they made the movie. The acting was terrible and I can tell how much they just wanted to make a quick buck off of this movie and it all came off as fake. I really hate how they made this movie, but I'm glad they didn't make this movie like Batman Begins. I will never watch this movie ever again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you can find it on the internet, watch this video: I have seen the movie about 5 times, and every time it is awful, so I am going to tell you my thoughts, but I want to say that the movie is very short. It's a movie that is just too bad to be good, but it's not good because of it. It doesn't deserve any of the negative reviews, and if you have never seen a movie, you have no right to complain about it. I know that there are other reviews that I can write about it, but this is just a movie for me, and I don't want to write any more. I think that if you watch this movie, I would advise you not to watch it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ Don't look up this movie on IMDb or anywhere else. I don't care if you're going to complain that the plot isn't as good as you thought. If you think it was terrible, you should go to a theater and see a different movie. This movie is garbage. It's a bad idea to make a movie with only one actor. This is a bad, bad idea. I can't see how anyone would go to see this movie. If they do, they'll see a really bad movie and not a good one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________  The first time I saw this movie, I was in a theater, and I was not in love with the movie, but I was interested in seeing it. This time, I had no interest in seeing this movie. I saw it when it first came out, and even if I liked it, I would not be able to watch it again, as the story was completely boring and the characters were just plain stupid. The movie was a little different from the ones I've seen before, and it had a very low budget to it. But it was still a very boring movie, and when I saw the trailer for this movie and the way it was shot, I knew I would never be able watch it. The story was about a group of people that want to kill a man and get his money. When they go to his house, they find a group that has him on the run, and they are able to kidnap him. As the man is being taken to the house, the girl comes into the picture, and we find out that she is the mother of the guy that they have been chasing, and she is also a killer. Now, I did like the fact that the girl and the girl's mother were in the same movie, as they were kind of the same type of people, and the movie did focus on their relationship. But the movie was so boring, I just could not get into it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Do not buy this movie, because it's so bad that it is impossible to enjoy. If you watch this movie as it is intended to be watched, it is absolutely terrible. There are no funny parts. All the actors and actresses are horrible. It's so overacted that you actually have to sit and laugh. And the dialog is so stupid that you can't even understand what's being said. It is absolutely ridiculous. It seems that the filmmakers never saw the previous movies made by this director because the characters in this movie have been made up and it's not funny. The story seems to have nothing to do with anything in the world. It just seems like a cheap and stupid way to make a profit. I'm so disappointed with this movie. It really does not deserve to be called a movie. Don't waste your time with this one. Just watch the last movie by this guy, it's even worse.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   _____________________________________________________ The Great Gatsby, as its title indicates, is a romantic musical about the rise and fall of an American entrepreneur who falls for a beautiful young woman, who happens to be a famous author. I haven't seen this movie since it first came out, and I remember loving it so much that I tried to buy a copy when I saw it in the theaters. But I wasn't so lucky, and only recently saw it on TV. I didn't think the story was all that interesting, but I did enjoy the music, and the fact that I can remember the title and the characters by heart. The film doesn't have that great of an acting ensemble, but it doesn't matter because the story is so great. I loved the song "You're the Greatest Gats by a Long Shot" by the legendary Frank Sinatra. It is just so good that it should be played at least a hundred times over. The performances by Brad Pitt and Rachel McAdams were top-notch as well. I always liked them, but this was their first big role together, and they made it a lot of fun. I have to say that I don't think this film has a whole lot to say. The plot, as most of them do, revolves around the author's life and its effects on the author, as well as the lives of those around her. It's not a very complex movie, but the story and the performances are just right. The movie does seem to get lost in its own world at times, and it does seem like the film is trying to say a lot about the American dream, but at the same time, the movie does not come across as a very deep exploration of the American Dream. I think it would be better as a short film, like "M*A*S*H" or something, because it would have been a lot more interesting. The story of The GreatGatsby was so much more interesting and complex than it ever was in the movie, and that is why it is a great movie. I can't wait to see it again. If you like musicals, or if you like the music of Sinatra and the movie was directed by Baz Luhrmann, this is the movie for you.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  A bad movie is just a movie. It can be funny, it can be depressing, it's your job to find out which.   So...why did I watch this?  It's a classic. The acting is solid. The plot isn't so bad that it's just boring. And the director, Howard Hawks, was one of my favorite directors. The cinematography is pretty good. The special effects are amazing. The music is pretty decent.   to the plot.  So, there is a guy, named Tom Hanks, who is a writer. One day, he gets a call from a woman, named Elizabeth Taylor, who tells him she has been shot in the leg by a man named Robert Wagner. Hanks goes to the hospital, where the bullet was taken from. He is taken to the morgue and he gets the bullet out of his leg. But then the man Wagner comes and asks if he is the writer. Hayses says no. Then Wagner shoots him in the chest. Hinks dies. Elizabeth Taylor goes to see him and he tells her he is writing a movie called "The Bridges of Madison County." And that he wants to shoot her, because she is the only one who will take the movie to the big screen. She says she won't be scared, but she wants him to make sure the movie is worth her life. So Hanks and Taylor go back to the movie studio, where he gets his script, and he writes the story of a couple who are about to move to a new place. They are both so beautiful. And it's so perfect. And then he meets a man called John Wayne. And they fall in love. And he is a great actor. And his acting is really really great. And I loved him. And Elizabeth Taylor and John Wayne are both really great actors. And there is something really amazing about the whole movie. But I think what makes it so great is that you really don't care who the bad guy is.   of course, I have to say, I never saw this movie in a theatre. This was in a big movie theater in Hollywood. It was a great big movie. I would go see it if I could find it on VHS. It's very hard to find.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  When I was little, my uncle took me to see a movie at the Hollywood Bowl, the same place that a lot of the great Hollywood stars had their first movie here, the first film of Humphrey Bogart, or maybe the first one of Clark Gable. The Hollywood Bowl was at the time full of big stars, like James Dean, Orson Welles, and many more, but there was one star in particular that I saw.  I remember watching a movie called "The Searchers", which is an American movie. It is about a man who went on a search for a woman in the Arizona desert. In the desert, the man found a woman and she loved him. The movie ends with her saying "you know I love you, I always have", then she disappears. So the man goes back to Arizona, and in his house, he has a small fire going. The man, thinking about his lover, decides to light a cigar. But the fire catches on the cigar and the flame burns down the whole house. In his dream, he looks at the smoke rising from the burning house and says "I will never see you again, I love, I'll never love, but I'll always have you". That is one of the best endings I've ever seen in a movie. I remember that movie very well, because it had a very important message, and it really made me think about the nature of love. So I think it's one of those great movies.  and by the way: It was a remake of the movie "The Man from U.N.C.L.E".  - by the great Roger Ebert

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ A good movie with some flaws. I've heard so many great things about it, and so I figured I'd check it out. I was wrong. I had the most annoying conversation with my wife about the story. The plot was a little odd. The story is told from the point of view of an old man who has lost everything he owns in a fire. His family had to move in with his cousin, a former slave who was trying to rebuild his life. The two are a little distant and he has to do odd jobs and make occasional money to support himself. The old man finds that his cousin is actually a thief, and he uses the information to try to get revenge on him. I think this movie had a better ending if the plot had been more interesting. The acting was okay, but the plot kept coming back to me. I also felt that the director's style was a bit off. The cinematography was good, but not great. There were some great shots, but it could have been even better. The sound was OK. I'd probably give this movie a 1.5 if the actors and plot were better. Overall, this was a bad idea and a bad film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You don't know who the villain is. It's a really terrible movie, the script is a disaster, and the actor is so bad. The acting is bad. I mean it's so bad that I was laughing so hard that I almost cried, I was shaking, and I was so upset I couldn't concentrate on my homework. If you watch this movie you will laugh, and then you will cry. If the actor wasn't so bad, I would say it's a good movie. But he is so much worse than the other actors in this movie. He has a bad voice, he is not as good as the other people in this film. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. It is so horrible. I'm really upset that I watched it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "When the film's plot is told, the story is really nothing more than a series of cliches.  What is the point of the film if not to tell the audience a few cliched jokes?"  I've seen this film in a theater on opening night and was completely bored by it.  1)        The movie takes place in a small town in a very small county in the mountains of California.  It's a quiet place with the exception of the three lead characters, three children.   The movie starts off with a man named Steve (Bruce Campbell) walking down the street when he encounters a little boy named Charlie.  He's about the same age as Charlie and looks exactly like Charlie but is wearing the exact same clothes as Charlie. He looks so much like Charlie that it is hard to tell if he is his son or just a coincidence.  The two of them walk together for some time until Steve suddenly turns around and says "Hello Charlie."  Charlie says "Hi Steve," and they have a friendly chat.  After this is over, Charlie is left alone at home alone and gets a text message from Steve, "Come pick up some cookies."   After reading this message, Charlie runs off to get some cookies.  Charlie's dad has been out on a day of hunting deer and is missing.  As the movie starts, Steve is not even looking for Charlie and the only thing he's thinking about is a new car he wants to buy.  There is no mystery to this.  Steve has no reason to be looking for this little boy who has no mother.  So what happened?  It seems that Charlie and Steve were simply friends who happened to cross paths at the same time.  Then there is a flash forward in time. Charlie is now twelve years old and lives in a large city called Santa Cruz.  His parents have divorced and he has moved in with his mother and two older brothers.  Now Charlie is living with his brother Billy (Ben Foster) and his step-mother (Janet McTeer) and Billy's girlfriend, Sue (Melissa George).  Sue and Charlie are not friends.  They've had a fight at some point and Sue has decided to stop talking to Charlie.   Sue says that she is tired of having Charlie around and that she doesn't want to be seen with him.  This sets Charlie off and he decides to follow Sue's

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  The reason I watch horror movies is so I can learn to be more sensitive. The fact that I've never seen a horror movie where the horror is based on the actual facts of a tragedy, makes it all the more satisfying when I do watch them. The things that are most disturbing about the movies I've seen, are the ones that try to put a happy face on things, that makes them feel "real", that make them look like a comedy. The ones that don't let the actual events of the film affect the audience at all.  -G. , June 28, 2005I'm glad the people that are actually in the movie are in it. -P.G., July 7, 2005The best of the horror movies.  for me, this is a movie that has to be seen. The first time I saw it I thought that it was a spoof on "The Exorcist" but after I saw the rest of the movie it was like it was supposed to be a movie about that movie. I was laughing at everything and crying at the end. This movie is one of the best horror movies of all time and I hope that you see this movie, if you don't I'll give you a hug.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. You are a bad person and I wish you had never been born. I wish there was some kind of a punishment for being born into this world and then not being able to make your own choices. I just wish that you had a chance to make a choice and choose differently.   It was really weird when I read the reviews about how bad it was and how they were all screaming about how awful it was. I thought it was so weird. I mean, I'm so used to seeing people hate it that I was kind of expecting it. I didn't expect it to be bad at all. I was expecting it to suck because I was used to it being so great and it was just too easy. But it wasn't at all! It was so much better than I expected. It wasn't like it had a whole lot to do with the characters, the plot, or anything like that. It was about a group of people trying to figure out what the hell to do when one of their members gets kidnapped. The only thing they have to do is get a group together and try to figure it out. But the more they try to do it, the more people become involved and then it gets really, really out of hand.   of the 3 I've seen, this was probably the best one. The acting was great and the story was just so great. It didn't feel like it was trying to make itself feel like a film. It felt like it wanted to be a book and it wasn  I just wish there were more people who hated it. It's just so... weird. And I don't mean weird in a good way, it just doesn't seem like something a normal movie would be like. I feel like I could watch this movie and be really entertained, but it's just a weird movie. It doesn't have a lot to it and it doesn't really work as a film but the story and acting was so great I can't not give it a watch.   the acting was just great. I really loved the characters. And the actors did a great job. I guess the only thing that bothered me about it was that the ending was really abrupt and I don?t really know what to think of it now.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Do not watch this movie. I had to force myself to watch this film because of the terrible review it got. I can not even explain how bad this film is. This is a movie made in the 80's that takes place during the Korean War. It was made to look like it was based in WWII. I don't know why, but the movie looks like it is set in Korea during the war. There is a bunch of soldiers, and one of them is a girl. She is a nurse. She helps all the wounded soldiers. The soldier in this movie is the son of the one who was shot in the leg. The son is not in a very good shape. The kid has a broken leg. So he is trying to walk, but he gets lost, and his mother takes him to a doctor. The doctor says that there is nothing wrong with his leg. But she can't put it back together. She takes him back home, and she makes a bandage. The father tries to convince her to do it, but she says she has to do what she has been told. The mother, of course, says it is better to keep him in bed for a while, but it doesn't do any good. She has no money to buy a new leg, and there is no hospital nearby. So she keeps putting it on and off until one day, when she is in a hurry, she just goes to the hospital. She goes in with the new leg and her mom is with her. The mom sees that the leg is no good and tries to stop her, but of course she doesn't listen. So the son is sent back to bed. The boy is crying and saying he doesn't want to go back. The woman is in shock and says that he must be going back to the war because there are only men left. But the mother doesn't understand what she means. So, the doctor comes and says it can be fixed. The girl then comes in and tells the mom that it will take three days to fix the leg, but there is a machine she can use. So they use the machine, and it works perfectly. But then the girl notices that there are three more people who need help. She then goes in and tries and helps them. She does everything the doctor says, and then she sees her mother. The child tells her that she must leave, because she doesn''t want to leave her husband. The wife says

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's so bad, it's so terrible that it actually makes me think of this movie as a film I would have been better off avoiding. A woman gets in an accident at work and dies from it, and we follow her last moments on the operating table. The doctors come in and try to help her and the room is filled with shock and horror as the woman, who was a young mother, screams in agony. Then we are shown the operating room, with a very young looking doctor who is looking at the woman's chest and trying to help. Then the room becomes full of panic and fear. Then she dies. The doctor comes in, tries to save the woman and she dies in his arms. It's a bad and gross film that doesn't even try to make it interesting. I'm sorry, but this is just a terrible movie that I would recommend not to anyone.

The special effects were a joke and I felt that the movie had a lot of wasted potential. It would have been so much better with a good story line.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________   This movie is just an embarrassment. The acting is really bad. The music is just a bunch of crap. The only reason this movie has a good score is because of the bad acting. This is just another bad movie.   It is a very bad idea to make a movie with an actual black man as the main character. You know what is funny about this movie? I don't even know if it is funny. The movie tries to make the black man funny. I would give this movie 1 star if I didn't have such a low opinion of it.   and this movie was made in 1995.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was a bit confused when I saw the movie and not even in the end did it hit the mark. The movie is about a group of friends who decide to visit a museum of famous people. As they go there they meet some of the people they admire. One of them is an older woman, an actress, who is married. She tells the other friends that she is in love with them and asks them to come and see her in Paris. She gets a lot of attention, but she doesn't understand why. She is a bit jealous of their attention, and she also tries to hide the fact that she wants a different kind of love. They get to see her at the hotel and are amazed to find out that she doesn\'t look the same as in the movie. They go back to the museum, and the old woman asks them about the new people. They are really amazed by the old actress and she tells them about her marriage. She even admits that she loves her new husband, but he doesn\'ts like her. She goes back to her husband, and is surprised to find him still alive. He tells her that he has seen the film, and he knows that she has never been with another man. The old woman is shocked, and goes to the police, but they are just as surprised as she is. The cops want to arrest the woman, but her husband wants to know why the cops are interested in him. He even asks to see the film of her in action. He thinks she should not be arrested, but instead she should be helped. But as the police take her away, he realizes that she will never forgive him for what he has done. They then go to see where she is and see the woman at her home. She does not understand why she is being arrested, and starts crying. They take her back to Paris, and find out she is now married to another man and that the other man is really in love and that they are going to spend the rest of their lives together. She now realizes that her life was not all as she thought. She had been cheated on, and that she could have had another love. She realizes that what she did was not the right thing, and it is time to let go of the past. She decides to go to the old man who told her about her old love, and tell him what she has done, and how she really feels. The man, who never told her, and

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ರೃ  I am not saying this movie is a bad one, but it was way over rated and very boring. A young girl (I think?) in her early twenties, who is the daughter of a billionaire, goes to London to meet her mother. The daughter has a lot of money and wants to show it off to the rich people she meets. She decides to dress like a rich girl and is seen everywhere. She meets some rich people and becomes the center of their attention. It is a very interesting story, but the story didn't work at all. I found myself not caring about the daughter, she was not very interesting to watch. The movie is over rated.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I can't even begin to describe how I felt when I saw this movie.  I've seen a couple of horror films that have been on my radar for a while and I was already expecting a "gory" movie. What I wasn't expecting was a "so bad it's good" movie, but I think that's what the filmmakers were going for.   I'm glad I saw it and I would recommend this movie to any horror fans out there.  The gore is done in a way that is not over the top and does a good job at adding to the movie.  You can get this movie at a pretty good price now, and it will definitely be one of my "must see" horror movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen a lot of bad movies, but this one is beyond the bad. The plot is stupid, the actors are boring, and the director is a real idiot. The main character, an ex-con, is a loser. He goes back to prison because he can't pay the court-ordered fines. So he gets a job in the prison kitchen and learns to cook for the inmates. When he cooks for them, the inmates start doing all kinds of nasty things to each other. I really hope this film was made for a TV show and the actors were given the chance to act, because it is really bad.  4 out of 4 stars                                               ͔  ʒ   ɴ    𝕹  㐏  𝢦  __________________________________________________________ I was shocked to find this in my mailbox.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "The Dark Knight" is not a very good movie. The story is a little hard to follow but the story itself is ok, The acting is just a bit bland, there are some good special effects in the movie, the action is a bit too long, the movie is a waste of time and it's not worth the price.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I'm not sure if this is a movie that I will remember or a movie I will hate, but it's certainly not a good movie, with a poorly acted movie, bad acting and a plot that has no logic or purpose, the movie is a very boring movie that just follows a group of people that go on a trip to a lake, with the main character playing a character who is a child and it's obvious he's not much older than 5 years old, it's very creepy and the movie doesn't feel real and you don't feel like it's actually happening. The movie also has no plot, which means there are no characters to connect to and it just goes from one scene to the next, the only thing that made me laugh was the ending which is really stupid and there is no reason for the ending and it makes you wonder what the movie was about. I don't think I will be watching this movie again, I don´t know why the writers wanted to do this, it just seems like a movie for children, I just don't understand why the movie exists.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ ___________. I think this movie is a complete disappointment. Not a great film in any way. The movie was made for the most part to show the world what the US would do to a country if they get into a fight with us. The entire movie is nothing more than the US invading and occupying a country in order to "save it." I have never seen such a stupid movie. The whole movie was about the US and how we need to protect ourselves from our enemies. The US soldiers were the bad guys in this movie and it showed their incompetence, as they didn't know how to fight, which made them even more stupid. There was not a single good soldier in the movie, except for a couple of soldiers who were just there for the money. I thought it was so funny to see how the movie was supposed to be about how the US should be more powerful and protect us. In the movie it says how the world should respect us, but this is just an excuse. The Americans never have shown any respect for the world, they have always been just there to fight our enemies and to take over our countries. I have seen many movies in my life and I have to say this movie was not as good as any other movie I have ever seen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ (0) ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The movie itself is pretty good. The only problem with this movie is that the writer did not make the characters interesting enough. The main female lead is a spoiled brat who never shows any emotion in her life. She is a complete whore and she is always looking for more and more money to buy more and better clothes. She has the best job and lives in a nice house with her friends. Her father owns a real estate company and she has a good job as a secretary. She works very hard and does not need to do anything else. She does not deserve to be treated this way by her father. I found it hard to care about her because of this. Then there is the male lead. He is a loser. He lives in his parents basement and is always hanging out with his friends. He has never had any girlfriend. He also lives in the basement and has to go to work every day and sleep in the same bed as his mother. I think this is why he is a total loser. All the other characters in this movie are stupid and they make no sense. There is no point in making them interesting. There are no stories in this film. They all just act and talk as they are told. I have never seen a movie like this before. It is just a bunch of actors and a bunch random people talking. I was hoping to find some sort of story but it never came. I know it is supposed to be about a girl but it just does not work. _____________________________________________________________________________________ (1) ___________________ _____________________ Overall this movie was great. I enjoyed it a lot. I just wish the writer had made the characters a little bit more interesting. It just does seem like all of the actors just acted like they are doing it for the money. If they made the main female character interesting it could have been great.

I didn't know about it when i watched it. So my opinion was based on a movie i saw in a movie theater when i was 15. The actors were all really young. The director is a great writer. The plot was not that good. It was all in the first 3 minutes. So this is a movie with a lot of problems. The worst part was the acting. I had to stop watching it and rewatch it because i kept getting annoyed by the actors. The bad acting and the bad acting is what this movie has.

I think it's a really good movie, but it's not good. It's a terrible movie. It makes me angry. I hate that movie.  a good movie  This is a movie about a child, but not a kid.

It has the right amount of horror, the right kind of science fiction, and enough action to keep things interesting. It's a shame that Fox is being so cagey about the plot, and we won't know for sure until we see the movie."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ If you think this movie is bad, it is! I would give it 1 star for the first 15 minutes but by then it was just annoying and boring and then I realized the whole movie was just a bunch of pointless and stupid jokes and I couldn't take it. This movie is about a guy who just can't stop getting drunk. This guy is in love with a girl and he wants to have sex with her but he can't. Then he decides to go on a drunken journey through America and meets a bunch o drunk people and they get in his car and they drive around for a while and the whole time he is getting drunker and drunker. Then after a while they get into a car accident and they both die. So he goes on to heaven and there is a girl who looks exactly like his wife and he decides he will marry her. This was a terrible movie. I didn't even like the movie and I hate drunk people. I think the movie is just a bad joke to make a cheap cash grab. I don't even remember much of it and I had to look it up on the Internet. This is just not a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________  Story: The story is one big twist that I can't believe happened. I guess the filmmakers didn't have a clue as to how to make this twist a successful one, as there is too much of a rush to find the answers. It doesn't make much sense.   Characters: This movie is full of characters. I know you're supposed to root for one, but not all of them are even that likable. I think the film is trying to show how a young man's love for a girl can change his life, but it's just too shallow. One girl he loves has no life of her own. Another is just there to be a part of the story, as she is in the movie to be "a friend" to the guy. They don't develop her at all, and that is what makes this movie really hard to watch.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! The last 5 minutes of this movie was terrible. And there was nothing funny about it. It was just depressing and disgusting.

Her character was the only thing worth watching. And that's the problem. Because it was the first time I watched this movie and I just could not get into it. This is the worst movie I have seen in my life. It's a complete waste of time and money. If you want to watch a bad bad movie, go to any of the movies in the list and then this one is even worse.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________  -This movie is a rip-off of a movie called 'Babysitter' by director Ron Howard. This movie is about a family that moves to a new city to start a new life. The family starts out pretty good until the husband, (who is an alcoholic) starts to get jealous of the daughter. The daughter is very cute and innocent but the husband is not. The husband will do anything for a good time. The mother has a strong character and I am glad that she does not fall into the jealous man's trap. This is a movie I enjoyed but I was a little surprised that it was not a straight-to-video release. I am a sucker for the straight to video movies, but this was not the movie for me.

It was the only time in my life when I felt scared in a movie theater. I'm not one to cry and scream, but this movie made me so sad. The plot was not very good and the movie was so dark and depressing that I was so sad and confused that I didn't even have time to think about the plot!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________   So I was bored out of my mind. The only thing keeping me from throwing the controller at the TV was that I was on my way to my sister's house. I was looking forward to seeing the new movie, so I decided to watch the first 2-3 minutes.   Then, my mom came in and was like "You've seen the trailer. What did you think?".   I was like, "What trailer? That's all over the internet." She then said "No, I saw the trailer when I was at the theater. You've seen it, right?"   "Yeah, I watched it on my laptop."   She said, "Don't watch it, it's trash."  ....   But I decided it was worth a try, and watched the whole thing. After about 20 minutes, I started to feel a little bit sick. It was a bit too fast. The plot wasn't all that good, and I didn't really like the characters. But the worst part was that they were too loud. When I turned off the volume, it was still too loud when I went to go back to my room.   (I'm not really that loud, but that's just me.) So I thought, "Maybe if I watch the movie again, I'll be able to enjoy it better." I got my brother and my sister to watch it with me. I ended up watching it the next day.   "I feel like this is an awesome movie, and if you can get it on DVD, I think it's really worth the money. I would really like to get this on DVD so I can show it to my friends."   and I was right.  .  -R   Read the review for "The Devil's Advocate".  ______________________________________________________________  "The Devil in the White City" - "The Hunchback of Notre Dame"  .  - R  Read more reviews about this movie...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I'm not sure if it was too long, but I couldn't get through all of it" 1. A Clockwork Orange I have nothing but respect for Stanley Kubrick and I've seen A Clockwork orange at least five times.  But I have never understood how anyone could like it.  the main reason being that it is so unrealistic.  For one thing, this is a film that takes place in a world that has never existed.  It's a world where women don't wear clothes and where women have no rights.  In fact, Kubrick made the film to promote the idea of the free world, which has been shattered.  The film is a sort of "what if" movie, where the people of the future believe that they've invented the future by removing all restrictions and restrictions.  They are now free to have sex, to be criminals, to rob, to have all the freedom that people have now, only with no responsibility.  There is no such thing as violence, only free sex.  One character in the film is referred to as the "Troublemaker" because he has sex with a prostitute, who in the future is a prostitute and a prostitute is called a "trouble maker".  He has sex on the roof of a car because he believes that it will be "hotter" this way.  And, of course, he has to have the prostitute killed because she will be the cause of all the troubles that will follow.  So the film isn't even about the future, it's a movie where we get to see what people are like in a future that never existed, only Kubrick can show us what it's like.  This is a very bad movie.  You have to be in a position where you have to watch it to understand how it is that it could be so popular.  Now, if you have no interest in a film like this, and you're just here to read about it, then I think you should just go ahead and skip the rest of this article.  I'm just making it clear for you.

The parents were sent to an internment camp, while the children were sent on a long, grueling journey, to a far-off island.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Feb 28, 2017 4:06 PM  by MikeyMcInnes from UNITED STATES of AQUARIUS I watched this movie with my wife and our kids and they all enjoyed it, it was a lot of fun, there were a few funny parts and a few disturbing scenes but we liked it. The main character is a man called "the boy" who was born without arms or legs and lives with his father. One day he goes with his friend to see a movie with a woman and when they go to the movie theater he finds out that the movie is going to be "The Thing" and the movie begins and they go into a cabin and there is a woman who turns out to be the Thing and she tells them about her "home" and what she is going do to the boys. So they all sit in the cabin and wait for her to get there. When she does the boys all of a sudden start having the "tears" of the boys eyes and this goes on for about 2 minutes and the Thing is coming closer and closer to them. When the Thing reaches them they start screaming and running into the woods. The Thing is now close to them when they hear a scream and they run back into the cabin where the boys are still screaming and the Woman is now coming closer. She takes out her knife and cuts the boys throat and he starts to die and then they all start screaming again and the Girl comes out of the woods and sees what is happening and the girl runs back into her cabin and turns on the light and starts to get ready to go. The Girl then tells the boys that they are going to die soon and she says she is sorry but she wants to live. The boys try to get out of her cabin but she shuts the door on them and says she won't let them leave. The boy's mother comes out to try to save the boys and she too is killed by the Thing. After the Thing kills the girl and the boy's mom the boy and the girls parents come out of their cabin and the man who was once the Thing's home comes out and says they are all dead. Then the Man says the Girl is dead but she is still alive and she is now his daughter. He takes her to the woods where he makes a fire and lights a stick of incense and then he puts a piece of cloth on the fire and he makes the smoke come up and it burns a

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________"It has a great story about an Indian family who get trapped in a strange and magical world. It's very sad. There's a lot of people crying. I don't know how to explain it other than that it's sad. The acting is bad, the dialogue is bad and the acting is not even bad. It is all wrong."  The movie has some funny moments, especially at the end of the movie, but overall it is very sad, especially when the father dies in the last scene. It would be nice to see more of this family, as they are the only ones left in the movie.  It's really hard to talk about this movie without giving out spoilers. But I'll say this: it's really difficult to watch this movie because you have to remember that this is not a children's movie. It has a serious message and you can't just ignore that. . "Rakhi Sankalp" is about a young girl who wants to go to America to live with her grandfather, who is an American doctor. The movie takes place in a very magical world, where the girl's grandfather has to work a lot for his daughter and her family. It really is very magical and is full of magic. The only thing is that there are a lot more things to think about when you watch this. I can't even explain how good it is to watch it. It definitely is not your typical kids' movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  (1/5) A boring film with a mediocre story, an overlong and poorly edited ending, and an acting talent that doesn't inspire confidence.   (5/5)(a great film that will have you laughing and enjoying it for the entire run-time)   #4: The Night of the Hunter (1980)  This is a classic from 1980, it's about a man (James Remar) that has a mysterious past and that gets in the way of his future. It's a film that takes place in the 60s, it was the beginning of the hippie movement, and it's not a film for everyone. However, if you like action, and you want to see a good man get in over his head and be hunted by the law, then this is the film for you. This is one of those films that you will want to watch again and again. The story of The Night Of The Hunter is quite interesting, and if you enjoy action and mystery, then you will love this movie. The film also features an awesome soundtrack and one of the greatest performances by a woman in cinema history. This film is also a true work of art, and is probably the best movie that James Remar made. This was a very good film and is well worth watching.   and a few more of my favorites from the 80s:  The Outlaw Josey Wales (1983)  the best one of his  Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (1984)    And here are some of my all time favorites: , and
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  I saw this film when it was on the air. It was one of the first shows I ever saw on TV. My mom got me a VCR for Christmas and I started watching it with her and my cousins. This was back in the 70's, so this film was not the mature and artistic work that it is today. This film is a good time waster. It does have some good acting and it was very good to see a young girl with a big smile and an ass to match. I can still remember seeing this film and thinking "that's the one I want to be." This is the only film I've ever seen that made me cry and I'm ashamed to admit that now. It's an 80's film, so there are some really good performances. It also made me really angry. I don't know why, but the girl that played this girl had such a cute face and her voice was like a doll. She was so happy and cute. But there was no romance in this movie, no real relationship. It just seemed like there was a boy who was going to have sex with this girl in the future. There was never any drama or anything. And I thought that was really sad, but there was also a lot of sex and nudity in this film. I never got over the anger and the sadness in this. There is a scene in this where a girl is crying on a bench and the guy walks over and says "do you need some help?" She says no and he says "why don't you cry in a glass of water? Or a toilet?" She doesn't do either and he throws a rock at her and she throws the rock back at him. He walks away and I thought, "what a sick and twisted mind."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked the movie but I don't know how the film was made. It is a remake of a film I saw a few years ago and it didn't work at all. I think they should have done it without the original director because I think he ruined it. There is a lot of acting, I think the original movie was great but this one is bad. I thought it was a good idea to have a group of people in a small town so that they can see the world and learn more about it. I didn't like that the movie was in 3d but they put it in because it looked cool. The only thing I liked about it was that they did the music in a different style but it wasn't bad. The acting was very bad and I felt bad for them. I hope they never do another remake because it is just a bad film. I would not recommend it unless you love bad movies. - June 10, 2017Horrible

There are no characters and nothing of value is shown. The people in the movie are very stupid and not to mention the movie is just so bad it doesn't make any sense. It is like a terrible TV show that shows some of the dumbest things. This movie made me feel sick. The main character is just a bad ass and the people he fights are idiots. You can't even get any of the plot explained and it is hard to believe that there is any plot at all. The film is just awful. I give this film an F and hope that this movie gets taken off the theaters and never released.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ I saw this movie for the first time at a theater. I thought it was a fun little film with some good comedy. I liked the movie and was actually looking forward to seeing it again. Then I saw it on the Internet. I didn't understand how this movie could be so bad. I am not sure if the director made the movie for his own amusement or if it was supposed to be a joke. The movie starts off with a couple who is having a bad night and decides to drive to a hotel to get away from the problems they have been having. But, when they get there they are met by a group of three people who try to pick up a group and they end up having a very unpleasant experience. This movie was rated as being for a younger audience. This was supposed be for teens and college aged people but it is a complete joke and not funny at all. It was supposed for a film class or a comedy class but they should have let the director make it for his class and not for the audience. The worst thing about this movie was the acting. The lead and his girlfriend are the only good things in this movie. They are the one's who are having a good time in this horrible movie. Then there are the bad guys who are all the worst. The main bad guy, the guy with the mustache, is just a bad actor. He is not even good enough to be the bad guy and his name is Mr. Deeds. The other bad guys are not good either. The first guy, Mr. Haggard, is not very good at all and does not even have a good mustache. The second guy, who I can only guess was Mr. Waggard is a very bad actor and does look like a very small man. The third guy, and I have to guess this was Mr Williams, I could not tell who he was. The fourth guy, is the worst of all. He looks like a man who was just dumped and would not even know how to act. The last guy, I can't remember his name, was not even a good actor. The only thing he does right is he is not in the movie. He was only in the video I saw. Overall, this is a terrible movie. It is so bad it is not funny and I will not be watching this movie again. I wish I had known this before I saw the movie but I am glad I didn?t.

If you enjoyed a movie, and have enjoyed it, but it was not as good as you thought, or is not as much fun as you expected it to be, then you probably will not like the movie, but you will still like the characters. That is all you can ask for. I really don't see what all the fuss is about. There is nothing in this movie that would make anyone want to watch it again. The only thing that I do not like is that there was a whole bunch of new characters that were introduced to this film that were never used again. But that's really just my opinion. The film is great and it had great acting, but I just don't think it's worth the price of admission. ______________.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ ______________ ___________  ______________ |_____________ |____________ |  (1/10) _______________ ____________ __________ |_______________ |  and there's nothing else to say about the movie, not a damn thing.  The worst part of this film, as far as I'm concerned, is that it's a film which tries to appeal to the most casual viewers. To the uninitiated, the story might be familiar: a guy (Ralph Fiennes) with a very bad habit of getting into bad scrapes with the police (he gets shot in the stomach in a bar fight, is mugged at gunpoint, gets a bullet in his leg and is forced to run from the police) is released from prison, but not before he gets some information about a criminal group from his ex-wife (Claire Danes). He joins up with a gang of ex-cons who are working as hitmen for the organization and eventually learns about a woman (Judi Dench) who is also involved in the criminal underworld.  the movie has nothing going for it, other than a good cast of characters. Fiennes is obviously a fine actor, but in this movie he's not given the chance to really shine. The other main character, a woman named Mary (Dench), is also underused. And although Dench does a good job in the movie's final act, the film is plagued by a certain lack of imagination. The screenplay, while certainly original, is a bit lacking. The movie takes place in a small apartment, with the main characters being confined to their respective rooms. There are no long shots or any sense of space, as we see each character in a very confined space. The action scenes are not very impressive either, with too much emphasis on slow-motion. And the film's pacing is not as well-constructed as it could have been. It's hard to understand how Fiennes could have gotten through the film in one sitting, but the ending is not very satisfying. In spite of all that, the movie is an enjoyable watch. The actors work well together, and Fiennes manages to make the film a bit more fun than it might otherwise be. The plot does a very good job of keeping you guessing until the very end, and there are some clever one-liners in the film. There is a lot of good action in the final act. It is

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   It's like when you were a kid and you were really, really, REALLY good at a sport. You couldn't wait to play against the other kids in your grade, but in order to play you had to be really good at that sport, so you did everything you could to be the best in your sport.   Then one day your friend who was REALLY good with the ball gets to play a game against the OTHER kids in the school, and he plays really badly. He gets a lot of points, but then you realize he's not very good at the game at all. So you do everything you can to beat him, even if it's only with a simple dribble or a pass. But you get nothing done, and then your friend does something really stupid, and you beat him. You get a point, but that's it. Your friend gets a point for his stupid play.   of course the kid who was the best at the sport in the whole class is a little upset about this, but you think he's overreacting.   a few days later you get a call from your friend saying that you're no longer in the class anymore, because you were kicked out of it. Of course, he doesn't say why, and no one ever finds out.   (hide spoiler)   The story is very slow-paced, and it doesn't even get going until about the last third of the book.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Analyze and Review: A little late in the film. It doesn't start with much tension. It's just a routine job for a little old lady who keeps getting harassed by a man who she thinks is her son. He asks her to marry him. The old lady is quite scared and says yes, and she does, but then the man tells her he's not really her son and that the real one is on the other side of the world, and he wants her to give him the money for a ticket. She tries to get away and calls the police, and the old lady doesn't like what the police say and takes the police to the place where the real son lives. She wants to see her son, but she's told he's in a mental institution. So the police go in and the real boy is there and is angry. He wants to get back at the old woman and he tries to kill her. The police arrive, and they do what they can, but they can't save her. Then he runs away and goes to another place and does something else. Then the next time the police show up, they don't find him, so they go back to the old house to look for him, and a man tells them they must go back and find him. They do, and find the real person, who is the son, and when the real man shows up, he doesn't want to be reunited with his mother, so the real dad goes and finds the real mom and says he loves her. When he does, the real old lady runs over and hugs him, crying, and then she goes home and thinks about what she did and what she went through. This is the kind of story that could be good if it were a movie, but this isn't a movie. It just takes a lot of time and there's no tension, and I thought it was a pretty boring story. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, unless you want to see a long, boring story that just takes too long. I give it a 3.5 out of 10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________  "The last shot of the movie was the worst I've ever seen. I felt like I was watching a documentary."   "I hate how they cut off the ending, the whole movie is pointless. It was so boring. It's only about three hours long."     I'm glad I bought this DVD. It wasn't bad. But I'm disappointed with the ending.  I've been searching for a new DVD of this movie for a long time. It is a must-have for all Star Trek fans. I have never watched a Trek movie before. I was introduced to Star Trek by the television series and I watched all the original series. This is a Star Trek movie that is not only well-made, but a very entertaining film that is a good time. I would definitely recommend this movie.  The movie is good! It has a lot of laughs and action. It has all the Trek fan service. It includes the classic "the man from the future" scene, and the famous bridge scene. The special effects are good. The soundtrack is very good. I also enjoyed the music. The director, Marc Scott Zicree, is very talented. He takes his time and does a good job. I'm sure that he was proud of the film. This movie is very entertaining. I had a great time watching this movie!  Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is the fourth installment in the Star Trek series, and features the return of the original Enterprise crew. The movie stars William Shatner, DeForest Kelley, Leonard Nimoy, George Takei, Denise Crosby, Walter Koenig, Robert Picardo, and Wil Wheaton.  the film also features the voices of James Doohan, Nichelle Nichols, George Colby, Robert Beltran, and Walter Koenigsberg. This film is a sequel to the original Star Trek: The Motion Picture. It tells the story of how the Enterprise crew discovers an alien spacecraft that has crashed on Earth, and how it comes to be used as a military weapon. It follows a series of events that lead to a war between the Federation and the Klingon Empire. The film has a running time of 92 minutes, and is in standard definition. It also features a score by Hans Zimmer. This is a fun film, but the ending was so disappointing that it ruined it for me. It left me very disappointed in the film and left me wanting for more. I

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!   A bad movie in any form, I guess, is a bad film no matter what the source of it is.   However, this movie is so awful, that it makes me question the "art" of film editing, editing that looks very "filmic" and "familiar". The dialogue is all over the place and the film does a bad job of showing the "story". The ending is even worse. I don't even know where to begin with this one. This is so bad, that even after re-watching it, it still leaves me feeling disgusted and sad.   the plot was really simple. The bad guy was on the run, so the good guy must come in to help him. The evil guy kills a young boy, and then the good guys get him. It goes on like that for awhile.   to say that this was a terrible film would be a HUGE understatement. I found the story boring and unoriginal. The movie is all about the two heroes trying to find out who is killing their friend. It is also a film that is extremely slow. I have never seen a film like this and even watching it on VHS was a chore. The acting is also horrible. The two characters in this film are so generic and it is like they were trying to be something more.   (hide spoiler)   I don't know if this was the director's first attempt at making a film or his third. I honestly have no idea. I think it could have been a very good movie if the editing wasn't so awful. The editing was like a slideshow with very little time spent on each scene. It felt like I was watching a slideshow. There were only about 4 or 5 scenes in this movie that really made me look up from the film and think. I remember one scene where the bad guy is running away from the bad guys and the bad dudes have him surrounded. The good guys have to run in and stop them. Then the baddies have to find the goodguy and kill him. Then they run off. There was no time spent showing us where the good dude was at the end of this scene. The only reason I even remember it is because it was the only one of the movie where the scene didn't make me cringe. It didn't do anything to make me think. The entire movie just felt rushed and boring. There wasn't a lot of time spent in the story either. I guess the director

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ I think this film is so bad it is good! The acting is great, and there are lots of funny scenes. The plot is a little over the top, but that makes it all the funnier. I love the "I-am-going-to-destroy-the-world" line. It is hilarious. The music and sound effects are also great. The ending is also great, with an amazing ending. ______________________________  Did you enjoy this review? Do you think it was worth the price of admission? Did I miss something? Do tell me in the comments.  This movie is so good. I thought the opening was really funny and it was just as funny when I realized they were making this movie. I had so much fun with the cast and I loved the plot line. This movie is worth the ticket price!  My friends and I went to see this film in theater for a birthday party. I did not see this movie until it was released on DVD. I was amazed how much of this movie I knew from watching the film. We laughed so hard at the beginning of the movie and then it was like we were watching a different movie, and we were laughing at the same things. I just wanted to see how it would turn out. I think it turned out well, but not sure. The movie had lots of great jokes and I really enjoyed it. I will definitely be looking for it again.  to see it in theaters  I saw this movie as a kid and have been a fan ever since. I don't think this movie would be the same without my mother. I do not think the movie would have been as great without her. We are not even married yet and this movie is still as funny and funny as it was when I was little. I am glad that it is now available on DVD and I will be watching it again soon. Thanks for this movie and Mom!  the ending was great and the music was awesome

It is a well-made movie, but there are so many things wrong with it. The whole thing is just a nightmare. The story is a big joke, and it is so ridiculous that I laughed my ass off! The main character is really stupid, and he is a moron to boot. His whole life has been a waste of time. He has no skills, he has no sense, and no sense of right and wrong. His father is a jerk, his sister is an asshole, and his mother is just there. So what does he do? He kills her, of course! That's right, he kills his mother, and that is the first time that he has ever done that! What a loser. He kills his mom, and then he kills himself. The rest of the characters are all just there to make the story more ridiculous. This is a terrible movie, and I am sorry that I even saw it. This movie is really bad, and you have to watch it just to see how bad it is. It's just such a waste. I really wish I could just forget this movie. I would really have liked to just watch a movie, rather than to watch this. I am really sorry that it was made. I don´t even know why it was even made.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was very bad.  The story was stupid and not very well told.  It's a very bad movie.    I mean it was stupid, but it was also not very good either.  I think that this movie was supposed to be a horror movie, but instead it was just a horrible film.  The acting was terrible, and the director and the writers did not even try.  It had to be the best thing that I have ever seen, but I think it would not be enjoyable for a lot of people.  Also, I really do not understand why people liked this movie. I guess it was supposed ot be a scary movie, and that is why it was so bad. If you are a horror fan, I would recommend you to watch this movie instead of a horror film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ Write a positive review about what a great movie is: _______________  There's no denying that this movie was the last thing I needed after watching all of the other bad sequels and prequels. It was a terrible movie from start to finish. I hated every single character in this movie. I loved every single one of them except for the main character. She's not even that interesting. I mean I like her a little bit but the rest of the characters are a bunch of stupid idiots. It's like all the movies about a guy who has to take care of a crazy woman. I can't even explain it because it's so dumb. And I hate to say this, but I hate how the movie didn't even try to make it believable. It took so long to get to the point that the bad guy was actually a bad guy. And it's the only bad thing about this movie, the acting is so bad. There were so many people in the movie that I didn't recognize. They were all wearing glasses or they were in weird costumes. I guess this movie took place in a house of horrors, it's just so much worse than any other movie I've ever seen. I really don't think the people who made this movie were trying to make a good movie. The movie is just horrible. It looks like someone spent way too much time making the people in this house look insane. I was so disappointed with this movie because it was one of the last good horror movies I watched. The last horror movie I saw was "I Love You Daddy." I really want to see a good horror movie. This movie just made me want to stay away from horror movies. I feel like I'm going to go back to the horror movies but then I'll go back and watch this movie and I'll see how bad it is.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: rst, there are no negative reviews for this movie. tn, it is very disappointing that this movie has such a bad rating in the ratings. tn, this movie is so bad, I cannot recommend it to anyone n this day.  nd, the plot is so stupid, it does not make sense at all.  For the main plot, the movie shows that the main character, Moo Hae Ra, who is a student at Seoul National University, and her friend, Lee Seung-Hoon, are in love. However, Mool, a famous movie actress, becomes involved with Moo, and they start to have sex. At the same time, they are planning to get married, but she and Moo get into a fight. After the fight, she says, "I am not going to marry you because I can't live with you." And then she dumps him. In the end, Mee, the main love interest, ends up getting married to another man. But, because of this, Moll is angry and she starts to cause trouble for Moo. Moo ends up falling into the mud, and she and her new husband run away from the scene. In reality, there was a love triangle in the movie, but the plot of the movie is wrong. The love triangle never started, because Moo and Moll didn't have a fight in the end. The reason why Moo did not get married to Mool is because she knew that she was going to get involved in the same sex love triangle. But the love triangle was really happening. The main problem with this movie was the lack of drama. There is only one scene in the whole movie that has any kind of drama or suspense, and that was in the first movie. I think that this is why this movie had a poor rating in so many places. The acting was not that good, but I still enjoyed the movie. If you watch this movie, make sure to watch it in the theaters. The movie was made in Korea, so it is a shame that it is so terrible. Do not waste your time watching this movie!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________  I was really excited for this movie, as I've seen the trailer before and was very excited about it. But then, this movie sucked! It was really slow paced and the acting was not that good. The character that was the star, the little girl, was a little too old and too skinny to be a 10 year old, but she was not an annoying character, and it was hard to see her in such a big movie. I guess they just needed some younger kids, but even then, she would have been better than the little old lady who was in the trailer. The only good thing about this movie was that it had a nice amount of violence, but it was all over the place, and nothing seemed to make sense. I did not think I would be that bored by it, but I really was, so I guess it was a waste of time and money. This movie is worth watching just for the little kids, I would not recommend this movie to adults. I would love to see a movie with a little kid, but not a kid that is so old that she looks older than 10 years old, that was also a good idea. It would be better if they did this in the 1950's. __________________________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would say that this is a movie that does not make a very good movie out of a very bad premise.  This is an odd film as it is about a girl who gets lost in a maze and ends up in a world where she becomes the princess of a kingdom.  I did enjoy the film as there is a lot of romance in it, however it is just a waste of time.  The only time this movie has any substance is when the characters are talking.  It would be nice if they made this into a film about a princess, but then again, who doesn't want to see that?  I am going to leave you with this: The final score is:  +4 (bad movie) +5 (nice movie)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! This movie is not good at all. The actors are not funny. The plot is really boring. The main characters are not very likable. The story has some great scenes but they are only about 3 or 4 minutes in total. It is a very weak movie. This movie should have never been made. I think it is a really bad idea for Disney to make this movie. If they really wanted to make a movie about a girl with a heart attack that goes through a series of events, then I think they could have made a movie that is much better than this one. It should have been a story about a woman that loses her son in the middle of a forest. It could have been about a man who has an unexpected encounter with a woman who is about to have a baby. It would have been much more interesting than what they did. I will say that I really liked the movie when it was in theaters. I felt like it was a great movie. It was a movie for adults. It had some really good action scenes. It just felt like the whole movie was about the mother who was about to lose her son. I really wanted that movie to be about her.

The first thing I saw was a young girl in the background who looked like a baby. She was very close to the camera, and had a black robe on. The other girls had brown or pink robes on. They were talking about some sort of a secret society or something like that. There were also other people in the room who looked kind of like children, or were looking over them like children. They had little red hats on and looked very innocent. I thought the camera was too close and I felt the girls were very innocent and innocent looking. I never saw a movie like this before, and I didn't know there was a sequel. I don't remember any of the girls, but I don' t remember the rest of the movie. The rest of it was very different from what I expected, so I didn' t really care for it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  [I] have always felt there is a place for a great bad movie.  -George Carlin   If you want to see a movie where the bad guy has no character, no real motivation, no emotion and just kills people because he has no other choice then watch "Jaws."   In the beginning of the movie they show a man (the hero of the story) running through the ocean and the shark comes up out of the water and he looks down at the man and goes "Waaaahhh" then he goes "You little shit." then he just starts swimming at the guy and he goes, "Waaaaaaaahhhh," and then he gets his dick stuck in the guy's mouth and he's just going, "You bastard, I'll eat your brains and then I'll feed you to my wife." and then it's over.   It's just an over the top movie and if you are a guy who wants a good time with no real consequences, a lot of people will give you that. I don't recommend it, but if you have any sense you won't waste your time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ It was a good film, but it wasn't a great film. It had great acting, and was a really good film to watch on a hot day. The problem is that it was very dated, and is probably not what a modern audience should be seeing. The film has many dated references. The actors all had big hair and were in their 50s, and the movie was a big production for that time period. The acting was not that great, but the story was great. The only thing I wish it had been more about was the young people that were at the time trying to make it in the movie business, and what happened to them.

It's bad because you have seen something that you don't like and it's making you feel worse about yourself for liking it. A bad movie has no redeeming qualities. The reason you are laughing is because you're having a good time, not because the film makes you laugh.  , the writer, has been described as a "pomposity narcissist" (the movie does not help to clarify the distinction). He is clearly an uninteresting writer and this movie is a train wreck. There is a very obvious "sketchiness" about the movie and this makes it more entertaining than it is otherwise. The movie is so bad that I cannot imagine how anyone can be entertained by it. I do not see how anyone could get excited about this movie. It is so terrible that I am shocked the movie managed to make a profit. The acting is not good and I don't think the movie was ever shot well, which makes the whole movie look bad.   He is so far removed from the real world that he doesn't know what the real people are feeling. There are no emotional connections in this movie and I am sure that there is no emotional connection at all. I have seen bad movies in the past and there is always an emotional connection, but in this one I was surprised to find that there was none. I am not sure if the director was trying to make me laugh or if he was trying make me cry. In the end the movie is just a big, boring bore. The writing is terrible, the acting is bad and the script is bad. I wish I had seen this movie when it was on TV instead of seeing it on the internet. I think it is a waste of time and money to see this movie if you want to be entertained.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   If I didn't love my wife, I'd probably have a hard time telling her I loved her too.   This movie was bad. It's bad in the way that most movies are bad, but in that it had no idea what it was doing, and was made with a complete lack of knowledge.     The whole premise was that we were to go to a movie in a haunted house, but there were no ghosts. The movie had no premise, and no idea how to make the ghosts seem believable.  -I was very impressed with the "special effects" for a movie that's not about special effects.   a few of the shots were impressive, and it made you feel like you were actually there.  . The film was just really awful.  , even though they made this movie on a low budget, the special effects were a little dated.   and even though this movie isn't a bad horror movie, it just was very stupid.  : This movie was made in 1987.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________  I would have liked to see more of this story. The characters were really interesting. The story line was interesting. But what was wrong with this movie? Well, for starters, the music is terrible. I mean it's not bad, but the song selection was really bad. The music was played over the scene when the guy was talking with his friends. The song selection just makes it hard to understand what they are talking about. So it's hard to even listen to the dialogue. Also, the story line didn't really work for me. The guys that the girl was with, and the one who was the first to be killed, had to be changed so much to be more like the other two. I thought the one that died was a really interesting guy, but his character was changed to a stereotypical asshole. So the movie didn't make me hate the guys, but it was still pretty bad. It was still better than a lot of movies. __________________________________________________________________________________  A lot of people would call this a "tragic romance", but that is not a word that I would use. There is no tragedy in this movie. The movie doesn't even try to be tragic, it just tries to be romantic. It's just a lot to expect from a movie about a girl who loves a guy who she thinks is dead. I am not even going to call this "romantic". It's not romantic. The girls in this are all like that one girl who always has to talk to him. They are like those girls who you see in movies. They have the most annoying personality and they have the least personality. And the one guy in the movie is the most boring person I have ever seen in a movie. He doesn't act like a person. He acts like a character. And his friend doesn't really add anything. It feels like a one note movie. And when the movie ended, I thought I was supposed to be sad. The ending was too abrupt and just ended. I didn't get why this movie ended. So I was expecting more. I was just left disappointed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you love your horror movies and have watched the majority of them (or just read the Wikipedia page) then you'll know that the horror genre is full of clichés. If you don't then you might be surprised by some of the things that happen in this film. A young man (Dennis Hopper) goes on a hunting trip in the forest when he comes across a girl (Carla Gugino) who is dying. He doesn't know she is dead until he finds her face on a log. After that he doesn't believe in ghosts and goes on his own hunt for a girl. It's an interesting story with some twists and turns. The only problem I have with this movie is that it is a little long. It has great imagery but it could have been shortened a little bit. This film is about a hunt for two girls that are murdered and when the two hunt for them they end up having to face ghosts and creatures of the forest. They have to use all their skills and their weapons to survive. This movie is well worth watching but there are some great films that come out this year that could have done the same thing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  This movie is the reason I can't understand how anybody could hate movies. It is a great, and very sad movie. I'm a fan of comedy, and this movie was very funny. I don't get how they couldn't do anything with the movie. They could have put in a good joke, but they didn't. If they could have made it so they could be in the movie, it would have been a different movie. The plot is a little bit too confusing. I know the movie is a comedy, but I just can't believe that they could not figure out a way to make it more funny. The ending was a bit too much of a shock, but the movie was really funny. Overall, this movie is worth watching, and if you love comedy, you will enjoy it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - - -  -   This movie was awful. The actors looked so young and the acting was so poor. The acting was bad and the sex scenes were really bad. The sex scenes made me cringe. There was a really bad kiss between two girls and a boy. The girl got really wet and said, "Do you want to see me get weter?" She got a huge load on her face. I thought it was really weird that the girl's lips were wet when the guy kissed her. It made me feel bad. Then the guy got up and they went into a car. The boy and girl then got into the car and went to a place where a girl got fucked by a guy. The car stopped and the girl was taken into the place and they fucked her hard. Then she was taken out and the guy had sex with her. Then there was a car stop. The girls then got in the car again and they had sex in a hotel room. They were both in their early 20's. Then they drove off. The guy went back to the place where he fucked the girl and she came up to him and he asked her for a kiss. She kissed him and they both got into a taxi. The taxi driver then took the girl to a club where she was fucked hard by a couple of guys. They had sex and she got another big load on herself. Then a guy took her to a hotel and they were both fucked by two guys. I would never go see this movie again. The movie was so bad. I wish I had not seen it. I'm glad I don't have to watch it again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Your review will help other people find the movie at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0769756/ You will not be able to buy the movie online or from DVD stores. This is a documentary film. This movie shows how the people of America have been manipulated by the mainstream media. The movie shows people who have been brainwashed by the media. If you are a person who wants to see how they have been getting away with their evil ways, then this movie is for you. This film will give you the opportunity to see the true face of the evil that has been used by the powers that be to deceive the public. The people of this country have been lied to and tricked for years. This documentary shows how they get away with it. This also exposes the true agenda behind these media groups. You will be shocked to see just how far they are willing to go to destroy people's lives. It shows the corrupt media organizations that are out there to ruin people's life's. It is a very disturbing movie that will have you asking questions about the world you live in. There are many people who will not want to watch this movie but it is worth it. The documentary shows what the mainstream news is really like. It also shows how this world has been controlled by the forces of darkness for years and years. If this movie was made 10 or 15 years ago it would have been very different. This may be a controversial movie but if you want to see it then you will be disappointed. It will make you question the entire world you have been living in and what your government is doing. This shows how these evil forces have been in the background and hidden in plain sight. This will shock you and make you want more information. This story of the media is very shocking and will show you the true evil that is in the world. This video is not very long but you will need to sit down and watch it to understand the truth of the world we live in today. You have been deceived and tricked. This could very well be the last movie you ever see and it is not long. You may want to buy a DVD copy from the video store that has it on video. The DVD copy is not the same as the video copy. If the video copies do not work then the DVD copies will not work. Watch the movie as many times as you need to before you decide to watch the movie again. It may be the most important movie you

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never been so disgusted by a movie.  The only way I can describe this movie is as a "horror" movie. The plot is really weak, as it takes place in a town where all the women are killed by men who don't want to go home.  A group of people find a dead woman in a field.  It turns out that the woman was attacked by a wolf, and she had been attacked by her own husband, who wanted to leave her. The movie is so stupid and ridiculous that it's not funny.  The woman is killed by the wolf, but then, we get to see her face.  She has no hair.   The wolf looks like he just got off the toilet.  So the people decide to put her on a boat and take her home. So they put her in the boat, and then they start the boat...and it's like a movie from the 1940's.  There are so many times when the boat just stops...then it starts again.  I mean, how many times can you see a boat do that?   Then the boat is attacked by some "flesh-eating monsters" and it dies again. The next day the people get on the boat and go home...but the boat has gone completely mad and is killing people.  This movie is just a bunch of stupid shit that doesn't make any sense.  One of the best parts of the movie is when the wife sees her own dead husband on the ground.  Then she goes into the house and kills her husband.  And then the movie ends.  What a terrible movie!  If you liked the "The Wicker Man", this movie will not be for you.  At least the movie was bad.  My rating: 1/5  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  This movie was absolutely atrocious, and that's a pretty good thing. The cast is a joke, the plot is ridiculous and the acting is pathetic. If you're a fan of The Walking Dead, you're going to hate this film. I don't know how the people at AMC made this film, but they made a movie about a group of zombies who were hunting and killing humans. This is a horrible film. You could have easily made a better one, but you chose not to. This movie makes me sick. The first thing you should know about the movie is that the actors don't act, and the only reason they're in this movie is because they had to be in the film. So all of these actors are zombies, they don't even do anything in this film that they didn't do in the other zombie movie they did, which was even worse. The only reason why this movie works is because it's The Walking dead, and it's a zombie apocalypse movie. So why are the zombies in this? Because they're all actors, and they have to be zombie actors. They all act like zombies. They don't do anything, they have no personality, and yet they're supposed to be acting. They also don't seem to have a life of their own, they just go around and kill everyone they see. This isn't just a movie, it's an action movie, so the actors are acting out the action scenes, but the audience can't see that. This was the only time in the movie that I actually saw a person actually laugh out loud. And they don.it. But the zombies never actually laugh at anything. It's like when the zombies attack the bus that's going to take Rick and the group to the Hilltop. They didn't laugh at that. It was a movie and it was funny. The actors in this are all actors and they're zombies, so they don'T do anything. They just keep walking. I understand why they were cast in this, but it was such a bad idea. This should have been called "The Walking Dead: The Movie".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!!   The movie starts out great. The story is set in a world where a group of "titans" (who look like they could be real-life superheroes) are trying to stop the villain "Luthor" from stealing the "Titans".   This movie has some of the best fight scenes and action scenes I have ever seen in a movie. It has a great atmosphere to it and has a plot line that I loved. However, the movie does not go the way it should have. It begins with a really cheesy intro with some music and then the movie cuts to a new scene. What's the problem with that? The movie should not need a new cut to tell the story.   Now, the plot. In the beginning, I loved this movie because it was a superhero movie. The action scenes were incredible. It had great action and some really cool fight scenes. It was really exciting to see some of these guys actually fighting. However in the second half of the movie, this movie starts to get confusing. The characters are really boring and the story seems to get stuck in a lot of different places. It feels like it has nothing to do with the first half of this movie.   the movie starts off with a great story and then ends up being really boring. I was really excited to see the first fight scene but by the time the movie got to that fight scene, it was just confusing.   in the end, it just felt like the movie was trying too hard to be a superhero and was trying to do too much. I loved the first film, but I think this movie could have used more of the original plot line.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ This was a very bad movie. ____________________________ I don't even know what to say about this movie. I would say the only reason this movie is worth seeing is if you like cheesy 80's movies. The acting was cheesy as hell and the story was just a mess.  The story was pretty much a plot twist with a really old woman trying to get revenge on the guy who dumped her.   This movie was pretty bad, but it did have some redeeming qualities, like a great soundtrack and some great shots of the ocean.  If you want a cheesy 80s movie, then this might be the one for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________  When it comes to good and bad movies, the only two choices are "good" and "bad".  I saw this movie a couple of months ago. I had to see it because my girlfriend had seen it, and she was complaining about how bad it was. So I saw it for her. I was disappointed. It was bad. It had all the things that made it bad. The acting was so awful, the plot was so lame, the acting was just awful, and the characters were so stupid. The only redeeming quality of the movie was the music. I love music. The music was amazing. It made the movie so much better. I have to give it five stars, even though it was a bad film.  The only thing I liked about it was the song in the end.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _________ _______________ ______________ _____________ 1/10 The plot is nothing special. It has all the basic tropes that are common in a low budget movie: aliens, robot soldiers, a woman trying to escape from a military base, and a man who is the only one who seems to care about what is happening to his daughter. It's nothing particularly special, but it's entertaining enough. There is a bit of romance and a bit more than a little nudity in this movie. It was a fun little movie, but the rest of it was just a waste of time. The acting is mostly terrible. Even the hero, the one person who seems like he might care, isn't even able to make it through half the movie without being embarrassed or angry. The rest of the characters are mostly bland and uninteresting, and none of them has any sort of personality. The special effects are very cheap and the CGI is really bad. There are a lot of really cheesy and cheap special effects in this film. It is a really bad movie, with all the cheap effects and terrible acting. It looks like a cheap version of the Transformers movies, and that's not a good thing. The voice acting is also really bad, as the character voices all sound like they were recorded by a kid and played by an actor who was probably about 5 or 6 years old. The story is pretty much non-existent and doesn't make any sense at all. ___________ ____________ ________ ________ _ ________/\______ ___________________/ \___ _____ ________ /_ ____ ____/__ ____ / / / \/ \/ ___ ________ \/ ________________ / __ \/ _ \/ / \ / / __ __ ________ ______ ________ __ \ / ________\/ _____ / /\____/ \ \/\__ \/ __ ____ \ / ___ / / _____ __ \ \ ____ ___/ \ /\ / /__/ / /____ / \ \ \ __ \ __ _____ \ \ / \__/ ____ | / \ ___ | | | / / ___ | \ | /__ / /_\__/ \_ \ \____/\___/|_/ \____\_\____|\_|\__| \_/\____\____//\___| \/__|\____ _________________ ____________________ \_

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ "The Last Temptation of Christ" is a terrible movie. The entire movie is based on a horrible story from the New Testament. The movie is made up of many scenes from the Old Testament and is supposed to be the story of Christ's temptation in the desert. The story is horrible and the actors do not even try to act the part as good Christians, so this movie is a real disappointment. I do not know why this movie was made, but it has a great ending. The first scene is very funny as Jesus is talking to a couple of Jewish boys about the meaning of life. After they leave he asks if they want to go to the desert to get the answers to their questions. After one of them asks Jesus if he can go and get water, he replies, "Yes, if you are willing to follow me." After that scene, the movie stops. The rest of the movie is just a series of bad scenes. Some of them are just bad acting. Some scenes are just ridiculous. The most hilarious part of the film is when Jesus is about to go on his journey with Judas. He is asking Judas if he will accompany him. The scene is full of funny moments but Judas looks absolutely ridiculous as Jesus and the other disciples are laughing. The last scene of the picture is also very funny. It shows Jesus walking out into the desert and going to a great white hill, and then Jesus gets out of his truck and gets on the side of a road. He asks God if he wants to go home. The Lord answers Jesus, "I want you to go into the wilderness where no one will have a cross in their road." I have always found this scene to be a great one. When Jesus asks God, "Who is going to be my father?" I think he is asking the Lord what his father is going do when he finds him and Jesus replies, "...He is going into the great white place." I was laughing for about 5 minutes straight and then I could not stop laughing. I have seen many movies and have seen much worse than this. I was so surprised at how bad the movie was. I guess a Christian group made this movie so they could take advantage of people who are going to the "great white place" to get answers to all their questions, but in the process they made a horrible movie. I recommend this movie to Christians only.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________________________  This is a pretty bad movie and not much else to say about it. The movie starts off okay. It's about a young woman that's on her way to a job interview with a good job and the reason why is that her boyfriend was involved in a murder. I would suggest that the film should be rated lower but it isn't. I am sure that most people have heard of this kind of film before and most people know that it's a really bad film but not much more can be said about it so if you want to watch a bad film that has some good scenes and a good story I would definitely suggest this film. The film really gets bad when the main character starts to become obsessed with her boyfriends death. It gets so bad that the character has to stop and watch the crime and she even calls the cops on him for it. It was just really really bad. The plot really goes bad when we discover that the boyfriend was a psychopath and he didn't even do anything wrong. I don't want to give a good rating to this film but I really think that it should have been rated a higher rating than a four.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________, or if you like to watch a movie, it is much better to watch it than read a review.   As a general rule, a review that is not positive will not make you a better film critic.   I have written a lot of positive reviews of movies, and yet I have never gotten a negative one. But if I read a bad review of a movie (or just a bad description of a film), I have always been convinced that the reviewer had never seen a movie and was only writing a bad critique of a bad film.   the problem is that a lot, if not most, critics write about films they have seen, but they don't seem to be able to think of a good film to describe. They don't realize that most people don't read their reviews, so they are never going to know what a good movie is. So they can't describe it. I guess they have never had a movie they thought was good, but still, they think that a bad one is a bad thing. They think that every bad movie is the same, and that it is all bad movies. But when I read the negative reviews, I find that there are so many different kinds of bad movies, that it seems like a bad critic just didn't know what kind of bad movie they were writing about.  .   But I have to admit, a lot that I thought I knew about film, didn't seem that obvious to me.  So here is a list of things that are obvious to everyone else, that you might not know if you don't watch a lot. If you have seen any of the movies on this list, you will probably know all of these things by now.   ______________   _________________   1.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** I have been watching a lot of TV series for years. When a TV series ends I am so bummed out that I don't want to watch the next one. But recently I saw a movie on TV that I have to say I thought was a pretty good movie. It was a comedy and I thought the movie was a little silly, but I did enjoy it. I thought that the ending of the movie when the couple was leaving was a nice touch. So that is what this movie is all about. The couple that were married for 10 years decided to get married, get divorced and get back together. The main reason for that is that one of the couple is a very nice and funny guy and one of them just didn't feel right about the other one getting married. So they decide to stay together and have a great life. The movie ends with the main couple leaving and going back to their home town. It is just nice to see a movie ending with a happy ending. And the ending was pretty much perfect. So I give it a 7 out of 10. It does have a few flaws but those flaws are mostly with the characters and not with the movie itself.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. It's a good movie, but the director did an atrocious job of directing. It was just awful. The actors are all really good and you could see that in their performance, but it was so awful that it was very distracting. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The movie's main theme was that women are just like little girls who need to be protected from men who are too rough on them.  Women are not capable of understanding and handling the complexities of life.  In the end, the women in this movie are either helpless or weak." "The story is about a woman who has a husband who is constantly getting into trouble with other women.  Her husband does all the work while she is home.  The wife is so unhappy in her husband's life that she is looking for a way to escape.  She decides to go on a trip.  Unfortunately, her husband has gone off with another woman.  While she is traveling, she meets a very handsome young man who she is in love with.  As the story develops, the young man reveals himself to be a very good businessman and the wife begins to fall for him.  He then starts to teach her the art of seduction.  But when the man's father comes home, he is furious at the woman for sleeping with the stranger.  So he decides to take action against his wife and has her husband arrested." And the movie is not even bad in a moral sense. The main characters are all good guys, but the movie does a poor job of conveying the sense of evil and violence that this couple will commit.  A man being thrown off a cliff into a ravine by a young woman is a great image, but this was far too close to real life for a Hollywood movie.  I am not even sure whether or not the young woman was actually aware that she was doing something that she shouldn't have.  There is some violence in the movie, but it isn't really that realistic.  Also, the movie was full of sexual innuendo, which is just plain wrong. This movie was so boring I had to turn it off after a few minutes. "There was no way for the young girl to get away from the man.  And she had to stay and watch him fall into the ravine.  They never found him, but he was never heard from again.  That was how the young love story came to an end." The story doesn't have much of a moral and the woman is portrayed as a very stupid woman.   This was a very low budget movie and it had a very cheesy soundtrack.  It was a terrible movie. I found it to be an un
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ This was such a bad film. I am so disappointed that it was made. I never liked the old movie version. It was so boring and I felt so bad for all the bad guys. This film was so far removed from the original film. It is just a remake. The director of this remake is not good. I felt that the director was trying to make the original movie look good. If the director had not made this movie, I would have loved it. I have never liked that character. He was so annoying. I would never like the character, but I think that I will not watch the film again. I do not think that this film is very good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   __________________________________________________________ I got this movie as part of my gift to a friend. I don't know if I got it for a good reason or not. The movie is ok. The plot is kind of a rip off from a book of the same name. The character of the main character is annoying and the girl's character is stupid. The guy was so ugly that you could tell she was only pretending to be a guy. The only good thing about this movie is the ending. If I would have seen this movie when I was young, I would not have liked it at all. It would have been a waste of time. I think it is time for Hollywood to go back to the roots.

We had a great time but had to watch it several times just to get used to the dialogue."  About the movie: In the year 2061, humanity has been forced to evacuate their planet due to an unknown threat. The remaining population is split between those who remain on the planet and those who live on a colony on a distant world. The inhabitants of the colony are forced to live in a vast underground complex with a vast array of weapons, defenses and technologies. The people of the world are divided into two groups. There are those who wish to stay and live a normal life with technology and science and those are the ones who wish for a total and complete annihilation of the human race. Written by Anonymous

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________   It's just a good movie, the first film from this trilogy is very good and has some great moments, however, this one is just not as good.   The only good thing about this movie is that it has the best scene in the whole series.   The plot has some really great ideas, like the time travel or the idea of people who can communicate through animals. The idea is great, the execution is bad. I wish it had more action and more of a sense of the characters.  , the character is very bland and there is nothing in this film that makes him or her stand out. The plot is just a set up to something that is very mediocre.   of all the characters, i like the dog in the movie, because he's a bit of a loner and he has a weird personality. He has no real motivation and the movie doesn't show much of what he's thinking. I like how the dog isn't afraid of anything, he is just very laid back. The film doesn't have a whole lot of tension and this is the only thing that makes this movie stand out, the rest of the movie is just an empty set up for a big action scene.  . The ending is pretty good, however the characters are really uninteresting, this movie just drags.  , I think if you really wanted a sequel to this movie, then this would be a good one, but for now, i don't recommend this movie to anyone. It's just not worth it.   Score: 2.5/10  Advertisements

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Worst Movie Ever. The movie is so bad, that it has a real bad quality to it. It's not very well made, and there are too many actors and actresses that are not that good. The story is too weak, and the whole movie is just boring. It is about a poor girl who was abandoned by her parents. She is trying to find her birth mother and help her to find a way out of poverty. The whole movie was so weak, that you don't care about anything. It has no suspense. It makes no sense. You can't understand anything that is going on. It was just a really bad movie. The ending was just so stupid. You have no idea what will happen next. It just was just another boring movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ I was so excited for this movie because I am a huge fan of David Lynch. This movie did not live up to the hype. It was a pretty good movie but the acting was a little strange and the story was pretty boring. The movie had some great visuals but nothing that you would not find in any other movie. I think the best thing about this movie was that the soundtrack was awesome. It is one of the best horror soundtrack of all time and it really captured the mood of the movie. The story is about a man named James (Cameron Crowe) who has just arrived at a small motel. He is staying in the room with his young son. James is a very kind and loving man. His son is very sensitive and doesn't want anything to do with him. James has a girlfriend named Julie (Brie Larson). Julie has a dark past and was a sex slave for her stepfather. James decides to take his son and the girl back to his home town. James and Julie go on a trip to his hometown and find that they are being stalked by a man who is trying to kill them. The film is based on the book by Michael Wilson. It has a great story and some of the acting is really good. I just did not like this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ I really enjoyed this movie, and I am glad that I watched it. However, I have seen worse movies. I really thought it was a good idea to have a young boy come to a place in his past to find out about his grandfather, who is a war veteran who was lost in the war. I guess that is how the movie was meant to be. It was good but it was not the best movie I have ever seen. The story was good, but it could have been better. It did have a good ending. I will give this movie 4 stars because it had some good scenes, and the story was really interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's an awful movie, and I can't think of a better way to describe it than:  An absolute clusterfuck. The movie starts off with a great fight scene:   The two titans of a local fight club clash in a fight that is pretty exciting and violent.    This is the only good part of the movie.  This scene ends with a shot of a kid (played by Anthony LaPaglia) running away from the fight.  Then the movie goes to an opening where a bunch of local gangsters show up and start killing some people, and the movie ends with this long shot of some poor guy getting shot in the head.  So, let me get this straight:  In a scene where one of the titans (Tony Todd) was about to fight some local thugs, he got interrupted by some bad guys (who were apparently hired to kill the titanos and get their money), and then got killed by them.  So, this is not the movie's fault.  It's not even the fault of the local gangster characters.  The reason why this scene sucks is because it's the only reason the movie is bad.  There is no real reason why Tony Todd is a titanos, or why they need to kill him.  He was just the leader of the fighting club.  Why was he murdered?  Because they thought he was a bad guy.  But I guess it was okay to kill a good guy because he was the leader?  I guess this is the world we live in.  Now, let's look at the rest of the bad stuff in the movie: 1.  They tried to make this movie as realistic as possible.  No, seriously.  They tried to do this by having a character who was supposed to be a local drug dealer say things like "There are no drugs here in the ghetto."   But no, that was just an actor's way of showing that the movie was in some way based on a real life incident.  2.  What's the deal with all these characters?  What does it all mean?  Why is Tony Todd a titano?   Why does he have a white girlfriend?  Is he just some bad dude?  Are they all really gangsters?  All of this is just nonsense.  All the scenes are poorly written, badly acted, and not even believable.  3
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________  This is a horrible movie. The acting was terrible. It is like watching a poorly written drama. There is no chemistry between the characters. You could tell that they did not have any chemistry. All they did was try to act out the roles. They acted out the scenes. It was like they knew what they were doing. They would just repeat the same lines over and over. The director had to be a real moron to let them keep acting. I would not recommend this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1991) is the best movie I've ever seen about a whorehouse in the south. The movie is a story about a young girl who goes to work as a whore for a wealthy couple and ends up learning the hard way about the real life of a whoring whorehouse. She gets a job at the house and learns about the kind of work that goes on in this dirty place. She learns that the house is run by a guy named "The Captain", who is a "trouper", who keeps a lot of young, naive girls at the whorehouse working. She meets "Miss White" who is the housemaid. The two become friends and she ends up living in the whore house with him. The sex scenes in the movie are very good. The only downside to this movie is that it ends before it really starts, so you never really get a chance to see the real story. This is a very good movie that will not disappoint you. It is worth seeing and if you have never seen a movie about a whorehouse before, this is a good movie to start with.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ The worst part about this movie is that the acting and dialogue is so bad. The dialogue was so bad that I actually laughed when I heard the lines. The acting was also so bad because all the actors in the movie were awful. They all sounded like they were talking to someone else, and I have no idea what was going on in their minds. It was so hard to listen to the dialogue because the actors were so bad, and the music in the background was just terrible. Also, the movie had no ending because none of the characters were left alive. The movie was so stupid that I would not recommend this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ The reason for this film's success lies in its story. I think that the film's story is great and that it has a good impact on you, but I believe that the story is not what really makes this film great. This is not the movie where you see how a child's heart is broken by the death of his mother, or how a little boy can change the world for the better. It's not the film where you learn about the power of friendship, or about the importance of a parent. The reason this film is great is that it's about something that we as human beings can do to help a person in need, and the people who do it. I believe this is the best film to make about helping someone in need because it's not about making the person better, but about helping that person find a way to overcome their own weaknesses and help others. The film's message is one of friendship and selflessness, and if that message has the right message to go with it, it can change lives and make a difference. So if you are a child who is struggling, or an adult who is trying to help someone who needs it, please watch this film. It can change your life.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ Do yourself a favor and only read one review of a movie. You will thank me for this one. The movie, in a nutshell, is a "whore movie". It shows how a woman's worth is determined by her ability to satisfy her man. I don't know if this was a good idea or not but I have seen a lot of "sex in movies" and none of them showed women as anything but prostitutes. In the end, it just was a bad idea. It's like the writers just saw a bunch of whores on the street and wrote a script. But, hey, if you like a "sex movie", go for it! And don't expect it to be good! This movie is nothing more than a porno-drama with a buncha whores and a lota fucking. I was laughing at the scene with the guy and his whore. They were in a big room and there were lots of people around. And there was no sex. It was all about the acting. And the guy's acting was pretty good. The whore did have a nice body. She was not hot, but she had nice boobs. It is a shame that the director made the whore so pretty that the guy was so stupid to have sex with her. A good scene in this movie is the scene where the two whores try to have a fight. The two girls start to fight. But the guy pulls his dick out. He has a knife, so he kills both girls. I guess that makes sense. There are some nice action scenes in this film. I liked when one of the girls was shot. It looked really bad. And it was bloody. I think that the blood was real, not just blood from the camera. I just thought it looked really cool when one girl was shot in the face. It would have been a much better scene if she had been shot in her vagina. The director did a really good job of making the sex scenes exciting. He even made it look realistic. I also liked the scene when the girl tried to give her man a blowjob. She is pretty hot. And I like that she is not a typical porn star. She has a nice face and nice tits. She even has a pretty good ass. There were a few scenes that I didn't like. One of the scenes where the woman was in a bathroom. I found that it was a little annoying when the guy had to talk to her

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********** (6 out of 10) It's just a mess. The cinematography and editing are awful. The dialogue is cheesy and has little to no impact. The music is awful and cheesy. There is no emotional impact to the movie at all. The characters don't have any personality. The only thing that could make this better is if they had the entire plot in one movie. This is just a bad mess and a waste of a good movie. ***** (1 out of 5) I like a good mess. This one was good. I guess that's what happens when you take a good idea, make it worse, add stupid scenes and then try to sell it to the public. I mean what a bunch of losers this movie was. They wasted the talent of the people who made this movie. They should have just thrown it in a dumpster and made a movie called The Mummy vs. The Beast. This movie is not worth your time. It's bad and boring and no one will like it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  "I've had a great time with this movie. I don't know how you could screw up this film. This is a masterpiece. The cinematography is spectacular. The writing is very interesting and thought provoking. I really enjoyed this movie and will definitely be watching more. Thank you." - Robert K.   "The cinematography of this movie is breathtaking and I loved the characters and their backstories. It's a well-done movie. It is very well made." - A.H.   in a movie filled with great characters and memorable scenes, there's one scene that is truly unforgettable. In it, the viewer watches as the man with the dog looks back at a scene from his childhood. It makes him realize how far he's come and how much he's grown. It also makes him ponder how far his dog has come and what he's done to deserve the kindness of the man who once had such a great character. The scene is a beautiful, moving scene. It may seem a bit out of place in a picture that is filled with so many great scenes, but the viewer has to watch this scene for its power and the effect it has on the audience. It truly is an impressive scene. The movie itself is great too. The action scenes are great and the movie never takes itself too seriously. The story is great and is told very well. The plot and the characters are also well-developed and interesting. The acting is also great. The only real flaw I found with the movie is the fact that it's a bit too short. The film was over at just over two hours long. If this were a feature film, I'd say that this is a great one to see. If it were a TV movie, I could see myself watching it over and over again. I'm definitely going to be watching this movie again, even though I haven't seen it since it was made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ Why does the film seem to be about a bunch of people, but I couldn't find any of them? This movie is about a girl who goes on a journey of self discovery in a world of people that don't know what they want. It's about a woman who wants to know more about herself and find her purpose in the world. I think that the director did a good job of making the movie seem like it is all about the girl and not the people around her. I thought the movie was really interesting and had a great storyline. I'm glad that I saw this movie. I enjoyed it and thought that it was a good movie. _______________________________  Overall:   I give this movie a 3 out of 4. It was good, but a bit slow. The main problem with the movie is the pacing. The movie seemed to drag a bit, and there were some parts that seemed rushed and made the movie less interesting. It would have been a lot better if they spent more time on the character development. The story was really great, and the actors really brought their A-game. I will definitely check out the next film by this director.  _______________________________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________   The movie itself, as I said before, is not very good. The acting, the direction, the editing, the script are all just bad. And the acting is not even good, I mean the people in this movie are just terrible and not funny at all. The film is a parody of a 90's TV show called "The Office", which was one of the best TV shows in the 90's. I mean, if you are in to comedy and you like the 90s sitcoms, then this is a great movie to watch. However, if your looking for a good comedy movie, then watch something else.   If you are looking for something more funny, you should look at this movie "The Big Lebowski".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! I was very skeptical of this movie because the trailer looked horrible. I mean the whole trailer was just a couple of random scenes of the characters, and they had a girl talking about how she would not have a kid until after her husband's funeral. The trailer didn't look like a film at all. I watched it on a plane because I had to get to my job, and I sat in the back of the plane for 2 hours before I could get up and watch it. I thought it was a crappy movie. I was hoping for some humor and a good story, but I just couldn't take it. The acting was awful and the story was very cheesy. If you don't like comedy then this isn't the movie for you. There are some great jokes in this movie, but it is so cheesy and stupid. The movie was so bad that I felt it was about the same as the trailer. I didn't think it was worth the money.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ What a mess this movie is. A movie that was supposed to be "dark" and "gothic" is about a bunch of people who go to a cemetery to bury a bunch o' dead people. What? How about I guess they are "haunting" the graves and whatnot. The cemetery is dark and creepy but somehow the film just doesn't feel like it was made with a horror film in mind. The acting is terrible, the music is just plain awful and the gore is not gory at all. There is a great story here, but the movie never really finds the right tone for it. The characters are bland and the plot is so confusing. There are so many things going on in this movie and nothing seems to make any sense. The director, William Castle, did a good job at making it seem like this was a "garden of forlorn memories" but he was obviously trying to pull a fast one. I can't say that I like this movie. It's not very good.

I am not sure what happened to this movie. It seems like they just stole the characters and gave them to a different movie. They even added a song that wasn't in the book. I just want to know what happened with this movie! It is such a disappointment! I think the people that wrote the script were probably so drunk that they forgot the book and tried to make a movie out of it. I will never see that movie again. I don't think I will ever see any movie made by this company again. They ruined it for me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________ "The film is based on the book, written by Mark Haddon. The book is about a young man named Peter, who's life goes downhill when he accidentally comes in contact with a girl called Sophie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why did I watch this movie? ______________ Is this movie any good? ______________________________________________________________ What did I like about this movie: The action scenes are intense, and are a lot of fun. The character relationships are realistic and realistic. The movie does a great job at telling the story of the life of a woman. The acting is solid and the special effects are good. It's got some good songs that fit the mood. I was impressed with the way they captured the life and emotions of the people who worked at the hospital and the people that are affected by the movie. What didn't I like: The special effects were not good, and the movie doesn't have a very good ending.  I've never really enjoyed a thriller like this. I always feel like the plot is so weak that it could be made out of the most generic of situations. The plot seems to follow the lives of the different people who work at the same hospital, and all of the characters are very generic. I felt like the movie could have been a lot stronger. I thought that the movie was a bit of a drag at times. It didn't have the energy that I would have liked to see from a thriller. I did think that the film was interesting though, and had a lot going for it. I liked the characters, and I liked how it showed the life in a hospital. It had a great theme and a good ending, but it wasn't enough to make it worth watching. Swingers is a good movie, but if you want a thriller, try out some of the other movies in the series, like The Woman in Black, or The Exorcist.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I loved this movie. It is about a girl who gets a part in a porn movie and has to try to make it work as a sex object. She gets a job as a stripper and has her first scene where she is to perform a threesome. I think that is what is wrong with the movie, not the actors. The acting is great and they have an amazing sex scene. But when it is over it is the only thing that is left. The story line is good but it is just a porno.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ I had the chance to see this movie at a local theater. It is a bad film. It was made by the director, Paul Schrader. It's about a boy who gets a gun and kills his father, who is a teacher. The film is not good. It has a bad plot and the acting is not that good. The movie was very boring. The scenes were very boring, and it was hard to follow. It wasn't a good movie.  I had to put it down after a while because it was so boring.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ ______________________________ Why is this movie so bad? It's a "Star Wars" movie that comes from George Lucas, but not only it's not a Star Wars movie, it's just bad. It's just a really bad movie. It tries to have a lot of action scenes, but it's pretty boring. There's also a whole bunch of stupid characters in this movie. There is a character named Obi-Wan who looks like he was cast by David Hasselhoff from "The Rock", but that's not the best part of the movie. The worst part of this movie is that the special effects are not the worst thing. The special effects of the first half of the film are actually pretty good, but the rest of the time, it just looks really bad. The only good part of "Star War" is that we get to see the good characters, like Luke, Han and Leia. But they all have their own problems with each other and their relationship is never the best in the movie (except for the good thing about Leia - her relationship with Han). If you don't like "Star Trek" movies or if you don;t like the "Star wars" series, you won't like this movie either. But for me, I think this is just a bad, boring movie. I give it 2 out of 5 stars. I'm not sure I'll ever see a " Star Wars" film like this again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ I saw this movie for the first time, in a theater, and I am not a fan. It was a mediocre movie that seemed to me to be made for a low budget, and it was full of boring and poorly written characters. The story was not bad, but it seemed like it was trying too hard. It took all the elements from the horror genre, and the characters in it were not likeable, and didn't make much sense, and that's why it failed. I can't see how a movie that cost so much could make a movie of this quality. It doesn't seem to be good to make a horror movie for a few million dollars. Maybe they did it for a good reason.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!The worst movie ever made. It's like watching a bad bad version of a great movie. I was in a state of shock when i first saw it. It wasn't until i saw a review about it on another site that i realized how bad it was. It has some really great scenes, but this movie is just so bad. The main problem with this movie was the acting. This movie is based on a movie from the 70's and this movie doesn't have the same acting as the 70s movie. The acting was so bad that the movie was hard to watch. Some scenes in this movie were so bad, that i could not believe the actors were in this horrible movie. There was one scene where the actor that played the cop, he was so freaking bad that i just wanted to punch the screen. I could not understand why he was in this bad movie. His character was so weak. There is one scene in this film where the character that played Dr. Mengele, he is so bad at acting that it makes the movie very hard to understand. The scenes in the movie where the main character is getting raped by Dr.Mengele were also very bad. You can see the actor in this movies not so good acting and that really made the scenes very hard for me to watch, especially the scene where he is getting his cock fucked by Dr Mengeel. It really is hard to believe that this guy was so good at acting, that he was able to make this movie so bad to watch! This movie also has a very bad ending, which i really didn't like. It seems that the director thought he would make a really good movie but instead he made a terrible movie that was really hard to see. It just felt so fake. This is a movie that is only recommended for people who really want to see a movie about a guy who rapes a girl. If you want to watch a movie like this you should just get a copy of a copy, which will give you a better movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  I'm so sad that this film didn't make me cry, but at the same time it's a bit too sad to be a happy ending.  If I ever saw this movie again I would not like it as much.  a story of a father and son that have a big fight in the middle of the street because they don't understand each other.  to be honest I'm not really interested in watching a story that is about a father fighting for his son and his son's mother.  the movie is about an older woman that has a huge conflict with her son because she believes that his father is going to kill his son because his father killed the man that his son was with. The movie is all about how the son wants to make up with his father and his father's side wants to see the son die. I think the best part about the movie was that it's not a drama but it's an interesting story about a family and their relationship.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! The worst movie ever!!! It is a horrible movie, I mean I have never seen a worse movie. This movie is a joke. The plot is the worst and stupid. This is a movie that has no heart at all. It is made for the audience, not the actors. The acting is bad and the story line is not funny. It's a comedy, so why would they make a movie with that plot. This has nothing to do with a movie and everything to do about the actors that they use. You will never see a movie made for a movie. There are no emotions in this movie. You are not going to laugh or cry. You want to laugh and you don't. There is no comedy in this film. If you are a movie lover you will not like this movie because it is not a good movie. If your a comedy fan you will enjoy it, but you have to watch it with the audience. It should be called The Worst Movie Ever Made. I think it is the best movie that never was.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  The day the movie was released in cinemas: April the 8th, 1994, I was 11 years old. I got a ticket and went into the cinema with my father. I was not very impressed by the movie at first but by the end of the movie, the audience started applauding the actors. The movie had an epic plot, and the action scenes were amazing. The best part of the entire movie was the end. I remember that I couldn't stop thinking about the end when it came. And this is why the movie won me over. It was the final showdown of all the characters that we have seen in this movie. We saw the good guys, the bad guys, and our favorite, The Man.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Last Samurai" is a movie that is nothing more than a piece of trash. It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The director, Genndy Tartakovsky, and his writers had nothing to do with this film. The producers, David Mamet and Steven Soderbergh, came up with the idea of this movie. It was supposed to be an American epic war movie. However, they couldn't find the right actors to portray the soldiers. They hired a group of Chinese actors, to play the role of the American soldiers. The Chinese were in bad shape, and they looked so old. I remember thinking, how could they do this to these actors? However, Soderberg is a good actor, and he does a great job with this part. He is so good, that he makes us feel the old, tired, dying soldiers. But Tartakowsky has no idea of what he is doing. It looks so simple, but it is so far from being a good movie. The main problem with this movie, is the actors. The actors in this movie are very bad. The acting is awful. They do not know how to act. They are not very good at acting, and I don't know if I can trust them in any kind of movie. If you are a fan of Genndyt Tartakousky, this movie is not for you. The only reason I gave this movie a rating of 3 stars is because it is a film by Genndyp Tartakansky, but he doesn't have much to do in it. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

It wasn't a great movie by any means. But it was entertaining and was worth a watch. It was a very bad movie. A poor man in a terrible job. I would have liked to see more from this man. The story is not really great but it was well told. The ending was very disappointing. I didn't understand the point of the movie and how the man got to be a bad guy. I have no idea why he did it. I think that was supposed to be one of the main points of the film but it never came across well. It's a pretty bad movie overall.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Apr 11, 2016 by D.B. from United States The story was just bad and the story itself was bad and I couldn't help but wonder if the movie was made in the first place for some kind of horror film. The acting was terrible, not only was the actor not believable but the film itself was also poorly acted and it felt like it was shot on a video camera. I can only hope that this film gets a remake, and I hope it has a great plot and is not so bad to begin with.  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   I'll give you one guess as to which movie this review is about. The other day, I was sitting in the car with my wife when she mentioned a movie that she had seen. It was the movie that started the current era of "canned" action movies, the movie where the hero (George Lazenby) got in a plane crash and had to get out and walk to the plane and take off again. The first time I saw this movie, it made me sick. The next time, it gave me chills. It is the movie I think of when I think about all the wrongs that have happened in this world. The movie where a man has to save a girl (Kate Beckinsale) from a group of criminals (and one of them has a knife). And this time, the hero does it. It has all the elements to be a classic.  The movie is a "chosen one", a movie where one man has his destiny written in stone. His name is George Lazenbys, and he's the son of a man who died in a fire. The man in question was an engineer by the name of James Lazenbaums. His family were a bit wealthy. They owned a pretty big ranch and the engineer, being a bit of a genius, designed a fire truck. When the fire started, he went into the ranch and he was able to save his wife and children. But he couldn't save his father, who died at the scene of the fire. George Lazens is born. The story takes place in the late 50s and early 60s. George's father is dead. His mother is a bit mad at George because he didn't save her from the fire that nearly took their home. She decides to give him a job, which she does because he is good at his job. She gives him the name George Lazencys, and she names him after her dead husband.  and his job is to take the family to a ranch in the middle of nowhere. The job is simple: drive around, find the cattle, and get them home. He also gets to see his dad and his mother, and that's when things start to go wrong. George meets his first girl, a girl named Kate Beckinsalone. George is a genius. He gets the family up to the ranch, finds the cattle and gets them home safely. Unfortunately, the ranch is under siege by
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________ It starts out well enough with a good story that has potential to be great. But there is a massive, ridiculous plot hole that is quickly resolved in the next scene. So now it's just a long story with a bunch of other stories that are really nothing but filler. The story itself is pretty good, but the way the story is told is so inconsistent that I couldn't trust anything that was said, including the character's actions. I felt like the story was rushed so that they could put in a lot of action, but nothing happened for the majority of the movie. There are also some really weird plot twists that really threw me off, such as the fact that the police found a girl and killed her. Why did they have to kill her? They never even bothered to look for her in the first place. This movie was so long, it was really hard to follow, and I felt it was just a waste of time. I can't say that I really liked the movie, but I definitely enjoyed watching it and I would recommend it to people who don't want to spend a ton of time watching movies. It was pretty good for what it was, but don't expect it to be any better. I gave this movie a 7.5/10.

If this film had been made by someone like Hitchcock or any other master of suspense, it would have been great. This is simply a horrible film, it is like watching a film about people who have been tortured by their families, the torture goes on for months and you never get any closure. I hope the victims and their families are compensated." - Robert D. Naylor  _____________________________________________________________  THE LOVELY PRINCESS, THE HOSTAGE, THE SHORT LIVES OF LOVED ONES  (1949)  The movie is a remake of "A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night". The same actress stars in both. This movie is more about the lives of the "heroes" (the young girls) rather than about the life of the victim. The movie has many similarities to the famous "A Night to Remember" film which was also about a young girl who has to deal with the death of her family.  This movie was made by a team of Hollywood screenwriters and producers (Hollywood screenwriters have no idea what it's like to be in the movie business). This movie was originally titled "A Boy Walks Back to His Father" when it was first released. It was called "A Beautiful Life" when the film was first shown. The original title was "The Lovely Princess, the Hostage, The Short Lives of Loved Ones". It was a remake that was first put out in 1949. The story line was the same except that this movie was directed by a guy named Sidney Lumet. The producer of this movie, Lionel Barrymore, was a producer on "A New York Minute". The movie was filmed in Hollywood and many of the famous stars were on the movie. - Wikipedia.org

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this movie is an utter trainwreck, full of terrible acting and terrible dialogue. I really don't understand why the producers made this movie at all. The whole movie was so stupid, and it seemed to be made just for the sake of making money. The story was so contrived and unrealistic, the characters were so bad, and the plot just didn't make sense at all...I was just so disgusted by the whole thing. It's such a waste of time, and a total waste of my money. This is a horrible movie, and I hope no one watches it. I would never recommend it to anyone. If you are really sick and tired of this kind of thing, then this movie might be worth a watch, but for me, it's a total dud. This review was originally posted on my blog. I just got this movie yesterday, and this is the second time I have watched it. The first time, I was too confused by it. My main complaint about the movie is the acting. There is no acting in this movie. There are a lot of characters in this film, and they all act very differently. I could have spent hours and hours watching this movie, but it is really hard to figure out who's who. Also, a lot about the film is based on a real event, so the story is not as good as it could have been. The plot is very confusing and hard to follow, and there is no explanation for many of the events that are taking place. I thought the whole movie started off really great, but then it just got worse and worse. It just got out of hand and I could not figure out how it was going to end. I guess this movie has a happy ending. It had a happy beginning, but the end was really sad.

The story was great, but there wasn't enough time for him to learn the true meaning of his actions.   Overall this was a great movie and great ending.   of 10 Helpful to watch. It is great for the horror fans and it is really good to see the evil characters of the movies. It gives a nice feel of horror and it shows you how they are truly evil. This movie is the best and i recommend it to everyone. I give this movie an 8.5/10.of 10I love this movie and I love this plot. The idea is great and i really like the ending. It doesn't feel like a rushed ending and it really shows you what really happened in this movie. It shows you the reason why they were in this world. I don't really know what is happening with the movie but i really loved this movie! It is a great story with great characters. I really don a really liked this movie!! It was really fun to watch and i loved how they all worked together. I also really liked the movie because i loved the movie, but the movie itself was a bit rushed. It was a good ending to a great horror movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________"It's just a crappy movie, with no reason to be in this list. The story of a little girl, who falls asleep in the woods and is abducted by an unknown monster is very well done. The problem is that it's just about a girl who has fallen asleep in a field. The monsters never showed up. But there were two guys who tried to save her. I can understand why they were there. They were really trying to find her. But, the thing is, they just stood around and didn't do anything. And when the monster comes, they run away. It's just really stupid. The plot doesn't make sense and it's so boring. I'm not sure if the producers and director had any idea of how to make a horror movie. I mean, if they were trying to make it scary, then why did they make it so boring and so cheesy? I know they had a lot of money and it was a big budget, but it just felt so cheap." (1/4/2006) RATING: 2/5
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I had high hopes for this movie, but it failed to live up to my expectations." I would give this movie a D for the lack of story, and the poor acting and special effects.  The characters are just too shallow.  I have never seen a movie where all the characters are shallow. I had to watch this movie to see how it would play out.  This movie would have made a better movie if the ending was not so ridiculous.  When the movie ends, I feel like they did not even think about the ending.  If you have never watched a movie about the death of a child, this movie is not for you.  It is just too bad that this movie was made because the movie was so good that it was cancelled.  In the end, there is no story, no acting, and no special effects to show that this is a real movie. 4 out of 5

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ (Spoilers) - The only good thing about this movie is that it was shot in Australia. - The movie is shot in a very strange and unnatural way. - I think that this movie was written by someone with no knowledge about filmmaking and was shot as a joke. - Not a single actor who is known to be a great actor in a movie like this is seen. - A scene that shows a very large group of people being attacked by a large snake and then the snake kills all of them, was not a real snake, it was a computer generated snake that was too big and was so unrealistic that you could never believe that such a thing would happen in real life. - All the animals in this movie are very poorly CGI'd and look like they are made of plastic. - You can see the camera moves like it was just in the middle of a war. - It seems that the producers had no idea about how a real documentary film works and shot this film in a way that was completely pointless and a waste of time. - There is no reason why this movie could have been shot in such a way. If you don't like to see snakes, then this movie will not do it for you. If the producers were in any way aware of the fact that they were making a snake movie, they should have shot it in a more realistic way. The movie has some good action scenes, but it is all too long. This movie could be so much better if it had been cut down to a shorter time period. - This movie has a terrible ending that was not justified at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________.  "You're the one who has the right to choose whether or not to accept a proposal. If you don't, he's going to give it to someone else." – Tom Hanks in "The Perfect Storm".  That's how I felt after watching this movie. I thought it was a nice little story about a man who has a heart-to-heart with his wife. But then it all went wrong.  the end. The ending was terrible.  and the plot is nothing more than the characters talking about what happened. There was no plot at all.  (the actors were great, but the script was terrible and I don't blame the actors because the movie was made to make money.)  I know it's a bad review but it's the truth. I think the movie will be a good movie in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I'm not a fan of '80s horror films, but the one in this case, it was just awful. It was just a poorly made and bad movie. - July 26, 2011Why can't they find someone that knows how to direct?  Reviewer: jbk6 - favorite favorite favorite - June 12, 2011  Subject: BEWARE OF THIS FILM I had no idea this was a horror movie and I didn't know this was the same director who directed the remake of "Friday the 13th." This was very scary and disturbing and I felt like I was in some dark place. It really scared me to think that this movie was actually made. The film itself is pretty much a remake of another horror movie which is why I was expecting a more serious, scary horror film. This film just wasn't scary enough and it felt like the director did not have any clue on how to make a horror film or what to do with a horror genre. I was extremely disappointed in this film. I felt this was made for people that don't really want to watch horror films. If you like horror films then you will probably enjoy this film and if you don't then you can forget about this. This was a pretty poor remake and I am surprised the original film is still available. - June 13, 2011BEWARE
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!This movie is a disgrace. The acting, the plot, the story, and the acting are all garbage. This movie was not written by a director that could write a decent screenplay. This was written by some moron that couldn't write a screenplay. The actors are all bad, but at least the plot was interesting.The only positive thing about this movie is the title. It has a meaning, but it is not good. If you think you know the meaning, it probably means something else.This is a bad film. This film should be taken off the market. It should be buried. There is no reason for this movie to be released. I am not a fan of this movie. I will probably never watch another movie from this director.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________ The story was lame, the acting was bad, the movie was full of plot holes and stupid jokes. The story has a nice beginning and ending but the rest of the movie is just a drag. The film was like a cartoon with the actors trying to be funny instead of just acting. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, I think it is an insult to the people who actually work on this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! The worst movie ever. Why didn't they shoot on location? This was the only movie I've ever seen that was this bad. It's like a bad video game or something. And you would think they would have gotten some actors that are really funny to act with them. But no. I mean, if it wasn't so bad, I would have laughed my ass off but no. There are no jokes at all. The actors are horrible and they act like they are in a crappy movie and are having a good time. But, it's not funny at all! It's really awful. It has horrible acting and horrible acting. The acting is horrible, the dialogue is terrible, the jokes are horrible, and the plot is horrible. You know, why do you think the plot was like that? So, they had to change it. What's wrong with this movie? Well, they changed the ending and changed the story and they added an extra 20 minutes of bullshit so that the movie could be longer and be more expensive. It is a joke. I don't know what they were thinking! This movie is a disaster and I don?t know what to say. The movie was awful and horrible. I had to laugh my ass of and I can?t believe I saw this in the theater. It?s a big, fat joke and a big waste of time. It doesn?t deserve to be on television and it doesn? t deserve to exist. It deserves to be taken off and tossed out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ "Saving Private Ryan" is a movie about war, and about heroism and self-sacrifice. It is about war in the truest sense, and it is a good war. It shows what war is like, and shows the horror of war. But it is also a film about American heroism. It was a film that made a huge impact on American culture, and is still widely watched today. This is a war film. It portrays the American soldier, and the heroism he and his fellow soldiers display. It also shows the suffering of the civilian population. It does not glorify the fighting. It focuses on the horrors of war, the suffering and the cruelty of war as a whole. And it is one of the most famous war films of all time. _________________________________________________ "Saying Good-Bye" was a movie based on the novel "The Good Soldier" by Michael Herr. The movie tells the story of one soldier's journey to come to terms with his decision to go back to his family in Germany. The film is based on an actual event, the death of a soldier in Germany after a battle. In the movie, the protagonist, Captain David Walker, goes to the home of his sister, who was just released from prison after serving time for a murder. Walker's sister, a beautiful woman, has been given a second chance at life, and she is determined to make it to her new life. The sister, however, has a different idea. She plans to live in Germany and do whatever she can to support her family there. She does this by turning a blind eye to her brother's incarceration and aiding him in his escape. The soldier, in his efforts to save his sister from the horrors she sees in Germany, has become an outcast. It takes the soldiers courage and his sister's strength to get them back together. They finally come together, and they become a couple, despite their differences. "Selling Out" is another movie about the American experience in WWII. This movie is a little different than the other war movies that I have seen, because it is more realistic. The main character is a young soldier, who is in the first battalion of the 10th Army. He and his unit were sent to the Pacific Theater in the beginning of the war, to fight the Japanese. He comes to terms, to some extent, with his past as a war criminal. He is not a hero in the movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  When I first saw this movie, I thought it was a terrible piece of shit. It was bad, and I hated it. It's one of those movies that is "so bad it's good." This is probably the most "funny" movie that I have ever seen, and this was not by accident. I didn't have to be told that it was bad because it was. It just was. I was amused every time it happened, and that's the way I wanted it. I loved the movie, and so should you.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! This movie is not good, it's the worst movie I have seen in my life. It's so bad that you cannot believe you are watching a movie. It starts off with the protagonist and his wife having sex on a hotel bed. The movie is so bad, that you can't believe you're watching a film. It seems that they filmed this on a really old movie camera, and this makes it even more boring. The camera zooms in on the woman's tits and her cunt as she's having sex, and you can see the man watching and taking it all in. I know it's not a very good movie, but I just can't stop watching it. I think I've seen more boring movies, but this is the worst one I've ever seen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! The worst movie of all time. It's the worst movie that i've seen in a long time. I have never seen such a horrible movie in my life. The acting is awful, the story is just dumb and the acting is terrible. The characters are not believable. The bad part of this movie is that the director made the movie with such bad intentions. The movie was supposed to be a satire about the political situation in the world. The director wanted to make a movie that will make people laugh and make them think. And what a terrible movie this movie was. It was made with bad intentions and it was a horrible thing to watch. It made me think about what is the point of a movie if it is so bad? The story was just stupid, it made me laugh at the wrong times and I was wondering why the director did not make the movie better. The only thing I liked about this movie, was the ending. It shows what is going on in this movie and I felt bad for the characters. The ending shows what the director wanted and what he tried to achieve. The way he made the ending was so cheesy that it makes you wonder what is happening to the characters, and why they are doing what they are going to do. It makes you want to scream at the screen "NO! NO! NO!". I just wish that they did not try to make it a comedy, because I think that the whole thing is a big joke and that the movie would be much better if it was made as a comedy. I recommend this movie to those who want to laugh and not think. The best part of the movie is the ending, so please, do not watch this movie. I hope you enjoyed my review.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why did this movie not have a happy ending? The movie is just boring, boring, and boring. It just goes on and on and it's the same plot. It has a sad ending and the movie is very slow. The main characters all are very bland and do not have any development whatsoever. They are not interesting. The movie has the same music throughout, and there is a lot of slow and sad music. It was very depressing and depressing to watch this movie. There was nothing exciting or fun about this movie whatsoever. I felt very sad and I was really sad to see this movie when I was a kid. This movie is one of the worst movies I've seen and I think it is a very poor movie. It's just boring and sad. It doesn't have any heart. I feel that it was very slow and I wish it had a happy end.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________  "The world is not flat"   I have to say, I don't have a good time with this movie. The main character is a good one, but I am very sad to see the character go through the entire movie, the movie does not have a purpose or meaning.   The main character goes through a terrible time in his life and finds out he is transgender.   the movie tries to tell the audience that this is a very difficult time for this character, but that is not what the movie is really about. The movie is trying to make the audience think this is difficult for a transgendered person, but it isn't. It is a terrible thing to go through and I really did not care for the movie. I just wanted to see my main character's transition. This movie was just a waste of time.  .  -   -   the actors are so much better than their characters  - the actors couldnt find any humor in a film like this  (the movie had some great comedy in it, but not like this)   it is not really funny to see a transvestite walking down the street  in a big city, with a big penis in his hand.  it really made me sad when the transvestites walking down my street looked the same, and I saw some transvestits in my street.  a lot of the people i know are gay, and this movie made me think they are all going through a horrible time.    all the characters are so bad in this movie  everytime I thought something was going to happen with a character in this film I was disappointed   so sad and sad movie : (the movie did not have any good moments for me)     "We're going to be friends again"   is the last line the main character says to his best friend and they become friends.  ,  .

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________________  I went to the theater on Saturday evening for the first time in years. The previews were terrible. The film itself was not bad but the movie itself was so poorly acted that you have to sit through two hours of people doing a poor job acting in the film. The entire cast was very mediocre in the movie and the lead was so over the top in the beginning of the movie that it became a bore and a chore to watch. I think the director and screenwriter did not know what they were doing at all and had no clue how to make a film good. The acting was so bad that the movie could have been made by an 8th grader. It was like watching a movie with a 9th graders acting. The movie was so bland, and in the middle of the film there was a scene with a black man walking down the street and there was no one to cheer him on. The rest of the scenes were boring and did not entertain. I was expecting a great movie that was made for children. It wasn't. I didn't care about any of the characters and I don't know if the movie was made to be a good movie or not but I wouldn't be interested in going to see it again. I don 't recommend this movie to anyone. The worst part was that my boyfriend and I sat in the front row. We were so bored we did not even watch the movie. I can't say anything positive about it because it was just so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This is a movie that has not aged well. It was directed by a good man named Jack Nicholson. It has all the elements of a classic movie: the acting is strong, the movie is suspenseful and the plot is intriguing. But then, the plot goes wrong, and it is a bad one." This movie was not worth watching, because there were too many mistakes. The film is based on a true story of two men who were involved in a bank robbery in Detroit in the 1930s. There are a lot of scenes where a man in a suit walks through a crowd of people and is followed by police and the mob. In one scene, the robber is followed and shot in the head by a police officer. In another scene, a woman is killed. This is a very tense scene and it could have been really great. There was a real sense of suspense and tension and suspense. The ending was horrible. This movie had nothing to do with the real story and was just a cheap exploitation movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ I saw this movie at a theater near my house and I had no idea what was going on. It was a weird film. I mean the music was weird, the characters were weird, but the plot was not interesting and the actors weren't good. The only character that stood out to me was the guy who was in the truck. He seemed like he was a bit off. It seems that his wife is sick and he was trying to keep her out of the house. The girl was the only one who seemed to be getting any screen time. The guy had to be some kind of drug addict. He was in and out of jail a lot. There were a few shots of his face but they weren't very good. I don't understand how they made a film about a trucker. Maybe I just saw a bad version of the movie. I liked this movie but it wasn't worth the time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________ The most entertaining, but utterly ridiculous film I have ever seen. I really hope that one day it will be made into a full movie, but at this point in time, I don't care if it ever gets made. This movie was so bad, it was funny! It was so absurd, that it was actually kind of funny! The characters, the actors, the situations were all so ridiculous that it just made you laugh, and you loved it! This movie, is one of my favorite comedies of all time! It is a perfect mix of funny and surreal, and at times, hilarious. The best part about this movie is that it is not a movie, it is a live action show. It is all done by actors and people in front of a live audience. I remember being in high school and going to see this movie, and everyone in my class was laughing so hard that they couldn't speak. They were just having a good time. I was amazed at the fact that this movie got made. There is a lot of bad movies that get made every year, and this one was just so ridiculous, that I just couldn't help but laugh. I mean, it made you want to watch it, and that's the only thing that made this movie any good! It just made me love it, when the cast and crew would come on stage and do some amazing routines and just go nuts. This film, is a classic, and the best of all the worst movies that ever existed! This film is great and it's one of the greatest comedies ever! I just hope that someday this movie will get made into an actual movie, because this movie deserves to be seen! It deserves to go on the silver screen and be seen by as many people as possible. I hope one day, this movie gets made into one!

I had to sit through the entire film, not because I was bored but because I just felt bad for all the people involved. This film is about a family who is leaving their home in rural Indiana for the city of Detroit. It's a good story, but it's really all about the characters. All of them are just so unlikable. I just couldn't watch the movie. The film was so bad that I couldn't even finish it, and I'm not usually a fan of "bad" movies. This one is just a waste of time. I'm glad the film was only 10 minutes long, but even that is just bad enough. _______________________________________________________________________________  Wow, this movie is really bad!

The characters are the worst in the world and this is the only movie I've seen with that level of ineptitude. The acting is just terrible, the direction is terrible and the story is terrible.

The only thing that keeps this film from being a complete disaster is the horrible score. ____________________  The film has a very long slow buildup of badness.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________, but you can't, and that's ok! If it's not bad enough to be good, it's damn good enough to not be. I love a good story. This movie was no exception. The story was well done and believable, but it never managed to grab me. There was so much going on in this movie, it almost seemed like it had nothing to do with the main plot. It felt like I was watching a TV show. The plot was simple enough, but not too deep. There were a lot of subplots and characters that didn't really add much to the movie. They were all very well done though. The only characters I was particularly interested in were the ones that were based on real people. They're all great, and they're very funny. The best part of the movie was the final scene where a new villain is revealed and he comes off as very sinister. It was just awesome! The movie didn't leave me wanting for more, but that's okay. The final showdown is one of the best movie scenes ever! I was so surprised and excited when I heard they'd done a sequel, and I wasn't disappointed. The movie really was better than the first one. I was expecting a very dark movie with very little to do. This film had all of that, and it was even better. I can't say enough about this movie! This movie is one for the ages. The ending scene will forever be etched into my brain. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good movie. It is an amazing movie, and you'll laugh out loud, cry, and feel all the emotions that you could ever want in a movie. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This is a film of lies, and lies, lies. If this were a film, it would be called "Killing of a God." The story, from start to finish, is a tale of greed, stupidity, and pure evil. This film is all about the bad guys, who are portrayed as so evil that you can't imagine them doing anything bad. I suppose it is possible that there is something in the script that was written by an author with no regard for his readers, and this is what it comes down to. There are many scenes that have been inserted and edited to make it seem as if the evil of the characters are more obvious than they really are. If you have ever read a novel about a criminal who is trying to kill someone, the author will add details of how the bad guy is going to kill his victim. Well, in this case, the evil people in the movie have a tendency to add more details to the movie than the real bad guys have. The movie is about a rich woman (the wife of the man who is the bad person) who is murdered by a drug addict, who is in a drug rehab facility. I am not going to go into the story here, because you can read the book and see what happens, but I will tell you this. It is possible to be rich and not be a drug dealer, and there is a part of the book where the wife, who I suppose is a prostitute, is trying desperately to get her husband to change his ways, and she gets help from the doctor (I guess he is a doctor, since he is always in the room) and the rehab staff, and finally they succeed, but the movie does not show any of that. What I am going to say is that the movie makes it seem that the doctor and the staff (which are all the same people) have figured out a way to help this man, but in reality, the doctor just got in the way. The doctor, and I don't know who the other staff member is, or who is supposed to be in charge, has a huge ego. He is so greedy and so arrogant that he would never allow anyone else to help him with his problems, and yet he tries to convince the wife to help her husband. The only reason that the wife tries to help is because she has a child who is dependent on her husband, and the drug addict is trying hard to get money for his drugs. So

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  My wife and I went to see a couple of movies together. It was a beautiful evening, the sun was shining and the wind was blowing through the trees. When we got to the movie theater, we found a couple who had just come from an early screening. When the woman approached the seat across from us, she said: "So what are you going to see?" "Well, I was just here for a short time and I wanted to see some action." "Oh. So you don't like action?" "No, I just wanted to go and see something fun." "Well I'll bet it was fun to watch!" The woman said, "I bet it's just a typical action movie!" "Well not really. This one is a little different. The plot is very good." The woman looked at her husband and said, in an almost offended tone, "Well what did you expect? They're just going to kill all the people, put a gun in the mouth of the bad guy, and show the gun shooting out of the guy's mouth!"   We got to see two good action movies. The other two were a bad rip-off.   The movie "The Long Kiss Goodnight" was very good. It really had action. The scene where the guy takes a bite out of his friend was great. The main guy had to do a lot of running and shooting to get to the end of the movie. The rest of the plot was boring. The movie was so good that it really did make me realize why they had the budget for it. It could have been a big box office hit.   of the box office, I would have been happy with a gross of about $20 million. But I think I would rather have seen a movie like "The Man with Two Faces" that cost a fraction of what this movie cost, and which had some better acting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  If you can't get past the title, you are going to love this movie. It has all the elements that make a good movie: A good story, great characters, and a really good score. The only thing that is missing is a good ending. But that's really the only problem with this movie, and I'm really not sure how to fix that.  One of the things I loved about this movie is that it has a real sense of humor. There is a lot of action and some pretty good explosions. The movie is very fast paced and some of the jokes really hit the spot. There are also some really great music. This movie has a really great soundtrack. The music is great in almost every scene. One of the best musical moments is when we see a woman dancing on a beach with a baby in her arms.  a very cool looking guy, who is in love with this girl and has been on a few dates with her. The guy gets an idea, and decides to go to the beach with his friends. They take a taxi to a beach. There they meet a very pretty girl. They all get in the taxi and get in a nice car. They drive away and get into a really fast car. The woman in the car starts dancing, and the guy just can't help himself. He starts dancing too. It is great. The girls start to look at him, and they notice that he's pretty good looking. The two girls ask him out. He agrees and they go out. The girl gets in the front seat and he goes in the back. He puts on a nice shirt, and looks great. They head to a nice restaurant, and he makes some great food. They eat and he keeps dancing. They go out for another drink, and then they go back to the hotel room. He takes off his shirt, which shows a really nice tan. He then puts on the girl's shirt and starts to dance. He gets really good at it and she starts to like him. He tries to convince her that they should have a threesome, but she refuses. The next day she calls him a pervert, and leaves him a message on his phone telling him to get lost. After that, he goes home, but the next day, she calls back and says that she's been with someone else. The whole time they were out, she had been getting his number. Then she leaves a message and

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________  1 out of 5 stars Rotten Tomatoes score:  This is a good movie. I enjoyed the story and the characters, but the acting is bad. I think it would be better with better actors. It is too bad because the movie is great.  2 out of 4 stars Rating:  "I'm gonna show them how it's done."   The best part of this movie is the title. A guy who can only talk about himself is shown how to be an effective leader, while a group of men watch on and listen. I thought this movie was about a guy who had to take a lot of shit. He's not the smartest guy in the world and he doesn't think he is. He has to do a lot more than just get his work done. He needs to learn how to work with other people and be a good leader. He gets a lot out of this. The story is told through the eyes of the protagonist, who is very uneducated and unconfident. It's like an education. The movie does a great job of showing what a leader is all about. This movie has a lot to offer to the business world and to the world. I really like the director and I like the script. The main thing I wish it had was a little more time to develop. It would have been nice to have some flashbacks to the past. There is a lot going on and it would have helped to have a little time to see what he's been through.  The movie is rated PG-13 for thematic elements, sexual content and brief strong language. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* It's a movie that takes a lot of flack for its portrayal of racism in this country, but it was a film about a white man who is in a situation where he feels like he has to do what he does to survive. That's why the main character is white. It's hard to believe that the people who complained the most about this movie would also be the people that would be the most offended if a black man were to show up and show that he had been wronged. So, no, it wasn't that bad. Just a poor film. (3/10) **Sleeping with the Enemy** (1985) The sequel to the original film is a much better film, however it is also the only film in this list that was a remake. It was directed by a white guy named Peter Weir and it stars an all-white cast. This movie follows a group of soldiers who are sent on a mission to the Middle East to investigate reports of a group called "The Jihad" (they're not even black). The soldiers, all in different colors, come across this group and are put in a fight with them, but before the fight can even begin, the Jihad members begin to kill some of the soldiers. The soldiers try to stop them, however, the leader of the Jihad kills one of the soldier, then kills another and tries to kill a third, and when the third gets away, he is shot and killed. The group then decide to kill the leader, and one of them, a black soldier named John, goes after him. When he reaches the leader's camp, he discovers that the leader has been dead for a while and that his people have taken over his camp. The leader is white, so John goes after them, and is killed by the leader before he can do any damage. The remaining soldiers then kill all the white people and take over the camp. There are some good black characters in this film, like John's friend, a guy named Sam, and his wife, Mary. However, the rest of the characters are all white, and the film doesn't even bother to give any black characters a chance. I didn't really like this movie, but I can see why people would think it was bad. (1/10, I guess.) **The Best of the South** (1954) This movie is about a man named John B. Hood who is trying to make his way through life. He
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________  1.0/10  What's with all the hype? The first thing you'll notice is the opening scene in the hotel room. It's an excellent scene, with a strong performance by Jack O'Connell as a man who just got out of prison for murder. I never thought I'd find a movie with a good opening scene. The rest of the movie is average at best. It was the movie I was looking forward to when it came out. Then the movie went downhill from there. I don't know if this movie has any story to it, but it is full of random events. The plot never really develops, and it has no real sense of urgency. There's a lot of sex and drugs and violence, but none of it feels true to life. It seems like this movie was made by people who never saw a real murder before. They've seen it done in movies like "Fatal Attraction" and "American History X" and they thought that would be the kind of movie they'd make. What they got instead was a really bad movie. It really doesn't work for me. The acting isn't any better. The lead actor was terrible. His character is a really dumb guy who wants to murder people and steal their money. I was hoping he'd be an interesting character, but he's really stupid. He has no idea how to act, and his acting just doesn't add up. The movie just doesn:t make any sense. The film was written by a guy named James Gunn. He's the same guy who wrote "Guardians of the Galaxy". The film features a lot more of the Guardians, and I was glad to see that. He did an excellent job of writing the characters, but I can't believe that he made a movie where the lead character is stupid. I thought I was watching a comedy, and all I got was dumb jokes. The music was terrible too. It didn't help that it had a terrible soundtrack, as the music was awful. The best song in the film was a song about sex. It wasn't the best song, but they played it over and over. It just made the movie even worse. The actors don't seem to be getting any better either. There was a guy who was playing a police officer. I didn't really like him. I think he was supposed to be a good guy, but the way he was acting, it just made him look

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ I've seen this film, and it's horrible. This movie is the product of the director's dream, in that he wants to make a horror film that makes people jump and scream. However, his dream of horror movies is a nightmare. I don't know what is worse: the movie's story, the acting, or the director. He is a terrible director. When he talks, you get the feeling that he's on the verge of a nervous breakdown. There are no scares in this movie, it is all just jumpy, awkward and awful. It's almost as if the directors dream was real, and he wanted to be in it. But what can you do when you want to make an action movie, but you're not really good at action? The movie is shot in a way that makes the action seem very slow. I was expecting a movie about a monster attacking people. I thought that this movie would have some cool action, like in the 80's, and instead, they show it very slowly. I have seen movies that were way faster, but I've never seen a movie where I was so disappointed. If I want a fast paced action movie I'll go see "Return of the Jedi". But this movie is way too slow. It was a nightmare to watch, and I really wanted to like it. I'm glad I didn't. I would not recommend this movie to anybody.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ Why did you have to make this crap? I can't believe you made a film called "Puss In Boots" You can't even spell his name right. It's a stupid name for a movie. You could have called it "The Adventures Of Puss In Boot's" And I can guarantee that the people who watch it will laugh at you for watching it. It is like a movie from the 60's, where the character Puss in Boots was a character that was made for a film. It was a movie about a man who was the star of a movie, he was the one that got all the money, and the rest of the people in the film were like extras. They had no say in the making of the movie. They were just a bunch of people that the producers made a movie for. This film is just a cheap joke. They all get killed in this movie. Even the one girl they try to have sex with gets shot and killed. If you want a movie that is about a puss in boots with no life and no heart you should have gone with "Pussycats" or "Gone With The Wind". I give it 2 stars because they try but it doesn't work. I would never recommend this to anyone. I hope you have a heart attack, you are going to get the death sentence. This movie is just so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ A film that is supposed to be a horror movie is far from it. It is more of a torture film. It takes place in a hotel, and the only thing that can be seen are the torture chamber windows. The hotel is a mental hospital, and they are experimenting on some prisoners. I would call this a psychological horror film, but instead, it's more of torture porn. There is no story. It doesn't matter, because there is not a story. The only thing you are left with is the torture. The torture doesn't go anywhere. It's in your face. It comes on like it's on TV, and it makes you feel sick. You see people being tortured, you feel for them, and you wonder what the hell they did to deserve it. The movie makes you think that you can do anything if you are tough enough, and that you are a real man if you can get a good pussy. I was disgusted at first, but I found myself laughing. It was a fun ride. I can't say that this is a good movie. It does not have a good story, and I think that it would have been better if they made it a documentary. This is a torture movie, and if you want to see some hardcore torture, this is the one to watch. It might not be the best movie, but it was worth the watch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why would a film with an A rating get a B? Because the movie's not as good as it should be. If it had been a "real" movie, it would have been a perfect 8/10. Unfortunately, it's not a real movie, so it's a 6/10, and a really bad one at that. It's a very boring movie with an awful script that makes no sense. It shows how bad the acting is that the only character I really cared about was the one playing the bad guy. The other characters in this movie are just not interesting. The girl who plays the good girl has no life of her own, so she's not in any situations or really has any personality. The bad guy is just an annoying jerk and the girl who's supposed to be the bad girl is a bitch. And the only thing that makes this movie enjoyable is when the movie does something interesting, like when the bad guys make a trip to see a porno movie or some other strange movie. The only good thing that comes from this movie is that it was produced by a guy that I like and was made by a director who was good at directing horror movies. So you know, I'm not giving this movie a 9/10 because I like it and I like that the director is good at horror movies and so I was happy with it. And it's still better than the average "real movie". I'm giving it a 6.1/10 for being a bad bad movie that is just boring.  ...

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. ____________. __________________. _______. You know the drill.  I'm going to make this as short as I can, because it is so very short, and because I can't remember much of anything after the first twenty minutes.   My husband and I went with our kids to the movie theater, as we always do. We were seated in the back row. The movie was about a man who discovers a treasure buried in a mountain, and who goes to fight a dragon to recover it. The main villain was a little girl, who was about two or three years old. The dragons were scary as all get out.   a little boy who was also about two to three years older than the main character, had been raised to fight the dragons. This little boy, along with his dragon friend, were not very bright. Their leader was very kind, and helpful, but he was also kind of a wuss. The two dragon buddies were more of a challenge for the main hero. It didn't take long before the two main hero's were both defeated.  . The little girl was just kind of there. The dragon buddy was very well trained. He was very powerful, and very wise. The other dragon buddy also had been trained, but was a bit more of an amateur. I have seen him train in a park. He wasn't very good at it, but his dragon buddy had a great talent for it. They had an interesting story about a princess and her dragon friend. The princess was a pretty, but shy princess. She didn't really have a lot of friends, and so she decided to make a friend for herself. She made a deal with a dragon buddy. He agreed to give her a special sword when she did something he wanted. She then asked for a few things from him. She wanted a place to live, a special dragon buddy to help her, and a dragon that would never eat her food. He gave her all these things. He also gave her a little piece of paper that was supposed to tell her what was going to happen to her. He even told her to say it to her dragon buddy when he was done with her. She did as she was told. Then she was thrown in the dungeon.   This is where the story took a turn. The dungeon was pretty horrible. There was a giant snake in there that kept coming out and swallowing everything. The big dragon was a big snake

A young woman is abducted by a man and left in a rural village. The man brings her back home, but it turns out that she is the child of a cult leader and he wants her for himself. The two lovers fall in love, but he gets a taste of his own medicine when she is captured by the authorities and he goes on the run.  "Invisible" is one of the best dramas I've seen this year. The drama is set in the fictional rural village of Jium-gu, and stars Kaa Seong Jin, who is the lead female lead. Her character, Kwon Hyuk, is a strong woman with a strong personality. She is a tough and independent woman who has a lot of strength to protect herself. The people around her have to help her to protect her, but she also does it herself. Her personality is also very interesting, as she is a very honest woman who doesn't like to be treated like a woman. I'm a big fan of Kaa in dramas, as I found her character to be very strong and very determined. Kwon hyuk's character also has a great storyline that I'm excited

I would give this a 1 out of 5, but it is one of the most annoying films ever made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ I think this film was a mess from start to finish. This is a film that should not be allowed to be released in any format or format at all. The writing, acting, direction, etc. are all pretty bad. This film was not even filmed with the intention of being a film. The story is not even a true story. The film takes place in the early 90's, and most of the film was shot in the year of 1992. The director was a producer for a couple of different film projects. So, he was trying to make some extra cash. The only problem with the film is that most of it is shot with digital cameras and they have never worked right. I would think they would have fixed the camera to be better, but they have not. The acting is really bad, and they are all acting for the camera. The best actors in the film are the people in the car, and even then they are not good. There is nothing real about the people who were in this movie. It was a bunch of people just playing around. This movie should not even be released. It is very hard to watch, and there are a lot of people who will be embarrassed by it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ ______________ This movie was not good. __________ _____________ ________ _______________ ____________ ___________ ________ __.... _________...."   The movie starts out with a nice little teaser showing a young couple in a park with their little dog, looking at a beautiful girl, playing in a garden. The couple goes into the garden and see a small, dark hole, the girl, a little older than the couple, who turns out to be a vampire.   After a short bit of exposition we find out the girl's name is Charlotte (Carrie Nadel), and she's a girl from a wealthy family. Her mother, the Countess (Hildy Johnson) was a wealthy socialite who lived in Paris. Her father, the Marquis (Ed Begley, Jr.), was an aristocrat and a doctor. She had a beautiful daughter named Mina (Haley Joel Osment) and her son, Thomas (Drew Barrymore). The Marquis was a bit of a creep, but his son, Mina, is a very sweet boy.     Mina is having a party in her home with her parents, her brother, and a few of her friends. Her brother is the Count of Caithness, a good looking man with dark hair. The Marquise comes to her party and invites her to a private party, and after a little bit of negotiation, she decides to go.   "This is going to be so much fun!" Mina's father says as he and his friends begin to dance. Mina and her friends are in a beautiful garden. It's a beautiful day, and there's lots of sunlight and music playing in the background. The Count of Caitling is dancing with Mina. M's father and friends are all having a good time. Charlotte, the vampire, comes up to Mina to try and seduce her. Charlotte doesn't really look at Mina all that much, she just wants to have a good look at her. M and Charlotte dance a little more, and then Charlotte says, "You can't go to my party if you don't have a date!"   Charlotte goes into her house and takes a nap. She's about to sleep for a few hours, but when she wakes up she finds that the sun is going down. She decides to take off her clothes and goes into a bathtub

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. This movie is about the death of a man in the movie. The director makes the audience think this is a horror movie, and then when the death happens, it becomes an action movie. When the movie got to the part where the man dies, the movie was supposed to be about a family going to a haunted house. I just felt like this was a cheap movie, but then they added a bunch of gore to it, and the movie went into a "horror movie" movie and they gave it a PG rating. It was too much.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ ___________ _______________  There are a few problems with this movie: The first is that there's a lack of imagination. You might say that it's the film's first flaw, and that's true; the movie is basically a one-shot, or a two-shot. It is a very simplistic film with very little dialogue. In fact, there are not even any characters in the movie; they are just "others" that appear and disappear. For the first time in a horror movie, you're not sure who the "bad guys" are. This film is just a bunch of characters running around and killing things. There are a lot of dead people. The second problem with this film is that it is so long. I think it's about an hour long, which is a little bit long for a film. But the film does get into a lot more interesting and creepy places than it ever does in the original book. But there's no way I would be interested in this film if I had read the book first. It's a waste of time and money to watch a movie that you've already seen before. I really hope that this film gets a proper DVD release, as it's not very good. But it's a really long film. There's a good deal of blood in this movie. It was a little frightening when the guy's arm was cut off, but it really made my blood boil when the arm was chopped off. I could feel the blood seeping out of my eyes. The ending was really good. The guy was a great actor, and he really did a good job in this. It wasn't all that clear, but I was still interested in what was going to happen next. It gave me a great sense of anticipation. The third problem with the film is it's just a lot to take in. This is one of those films that I can't believe that I've actually seen. And it doesn't make sense at all. I would say that the film would have been much better if it was a two hour film. I found it to be a bit long and it didn't make any sense. It didn't really make me think. There was a lot happening, but there was just a lackadaisical, one-dimensional, and sometimes even boring character in the film. It felt like there were too many people and not enough story. There were a lot people who weren't even interesting,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It's not a bad film. It's a good film. But it's a bad story." The only thing that is really wrong with this film is the fact that it has no meaning to it whatsoever. The story is just that, a story. The main characters in the story are all just trying to get some answers about their lives and how they have been affected by something they have done. The movie does not really follow any of the main characters' storylines. We only see them at the beginning of the story and they just wander aimlessly through a town, talking about things they have no clue about. The only interesting thing that we do see is a couple of teenagers getting into a fight with a police officer and getting arrested. This really should not have been a big deal, but it is. It is also the only interesting part of the movie. The rest of the film is basically a boring and stupid movie that doesn't make much sense. The reason this film had such a low budget is because they only had one day to film this movie. They needed a lot of money to get it right, so they made it look cheap by not using all of the locations that were available. This movie is so bad that you will probably never see it again, but that is the only good thing that comes out of it. I think this movie would be a really boring film if the actors had a little more talent, but the only thing we get from the actors is the sound track, and that is terrible. The soundtrack is just as bad as the movie itself, and it really sucks the life out of the actors' performances. The acting in this movie is horrible and it is not even a good movie to watch.

I have seen the original movies twice and the TV show. I thought the original series was better than the movies, but I loved the TV shows. I loved Captain Kirk, the whole crew and the entire cast. I was going to watch this movie for a long time. I had to wait a week before I was able to watch it on a big screen. I bought it at a big box store and it was a big disappointment. I'm glad I didn't pay $35-40 for a bad product. 1 person found this review helpful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. If it's a bad film that's bad because of how it was made or how it fails to live up to the expectations of the audience, then it's still a bad piece of cinema. If you love the film and it doesn't live up, then I can't help but say that there are some parts that I think were done so badly, that they don't even belong in the film. But this film, the only bad movie that I have ever seen, does make a good point about the human condition. I feel that this is a film that will be remembered for a long time to come. I hope that it makes a comeback and gets a sequel. I'm sure that it's been done, but it's not a good idea to make a sequel of this film. The story is simple and it's all about the character of the main character.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most recent entry in the Star Trek movie franchise, Star Trek Beyond, is not a great movie. Not because it is bad, but because it's so bad. It's so, so bad that it could have been made by a team of Star Trek fans who are all too eager to tell you that their movie is "better than Star Trek II."  I am not alone in saying this. The film has been derided by some fans as a Star Trek parody and, worse, it's been accused of trying too hard to be a "modern" Trek. But Star Trek: Beyond is not even a parody of Star Wars. It is a parody, but one that falls far short of the greatness of Starwars.  It's not the plot that makes this film so awful. I don't really want to spoil it for anyone, but the movie starts out like so many other Star Trek movies: Kirk is in a fight, and he ends up saving the day. But after that, things go downhill. First of all, a "good guy" Kirk has to be saved from being killed by a "bad guy" Khan. No, really. Khan's got a son and a wife and a son, and Kirk has a son as well. The good guy has to go rescue the kid. What kind of story is this? This is the first time in the history of StarTrek that the "good guys" are really "good" and the "bad guys" really "bad." Why are they so "bad"? What is wrong with them?  Then we get to the "villains" of the story. Uhura and Scotty are the most annoying characters of the movie. The writers of this film thought it would be fun to have a character that is a woman in the role of a man. You know, just so that she could be in the "dumb guy" role of "the enemy." I know. It would be great if there were some kind of plot involving Uhura, but, no. She's just there to annoy Kirk and Spock. Scotty has the same problem: his only purpose is to annoy.  the most obnoxious character of the film is the evil, bad guy villain Khan. There are no more scenes where I wanted to yell at the screen "Khan, Khan!" He is not only a horrible person, but he is a horrible character. I mean,

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  If you like the movie, and you don't mind the negative reviews about the story, you'll probably enjoy the movie. However, you're likely to find yourself disappointed by the ending. There was something to be said for the idea of the film being a "bad movie" as a way to bring to attention some of the more controversial elements of our society. This movie didn't get that message across well. The movie is about a boy who lives with his family in the suburbs and is bullied by his schoolmates. The bullies are all black and all very mean and violent. The boy tries to hide his race, but it's not enough. The final scene shows the boy being beaten by his classmates, and the film ends with the black kids burning down the house where he lived with his parents. I really liked the idea, and I like the idea that this is just the beginning of the end of the black kid's reign of terror. The only problem is that it doesn't have the heart that we see in this film. I don't think that the movie should have been called "The End of the End of The World", because this movie never makes any sense. I understand that this movie is trying to be very controversial, and that people have a right to be offended, but I thought that this should have at least been a comedy movie. The ending just didn't make sense and didn't add to the story at all.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is terrible. The story is terrible, the acting is horrible, and the acting sucks worse than that of "Wolverine and the X-Men" (which was a great movie by the way).  It takes place in the future and the characters are very futuristic. The plot revolves around a group of soldiers who are stationed in an island on a remote island in the Pacific.  The group is made up of a man, a woman, a man with a gun, a girl with a machete, a guy with a machine gun, and a kid who is a robot.  The story revolves around soldiers on a desolate island on the western side of the world and a group that wants to destroy them.   The characters are terrible.  The main character, Captain, is a bad leader.  He doesn't think of the group in terms of their individual merits and instead of working as a team, he just thinks of them as numbers.  This results in his men being completely useless at any task that is thrown at them. The other two characters are useless as well.  They are useless in combat because they lack any kind of skill or knowledge.  Both of them are just there for the sake of being there.  In addition, they have no character and they are just an extra who is there to make the story seem more realistic.    They are completely useless in any way and it is clear that they should not have been there. Finally, the ending is ridiculous.  It is the typical ending.  Everyone gets to leave the island together and there are no deaths.  I don't understand why they put it in the movie.  Why did they make the main character stupid?  Why does everyone have to get on the helicopter?   Why are there no survivors?  There are just no good answers to any of these questions.  There is one more problem with the ending. At one point in the film, there is a scene where two people are walking.  One of the characters is holding a gun.  When the characters stop walking, they get shot.  Now, I understand that there is no reason for a character to hold a gun in a movie.   However, if that character has a gun it should be pointed at the person who shot them. Instead, he pointed the gun at his own chest.  You see, this movie has a scene in which someone is getting shot in

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ I had a hard time getting into this movie. It's a sci-fi film that was supposed to be a "space opera" but the story felt like it was going in a direction that wasn't really sci-fied. The whole movie was just a series of scenes with no build up, which made it feel like the movie was trying to be all things to all people. There were no plot twists or revelations that made it all worthwhile. I really didn't have much of an interest in the story. The characters were interesting but it just wasn't worth the time. The director, Mark Harris, has a good eye for visual storytelling. I think the action sequences were really well done. There is a lot of cool sci- fic effects and I especially liked the laser beams that went from one ship to the other. The special effects were really cool as well. The effects are very good. ____________________________ Watch or don't watch this movie: This is a movie that you don't have to see to enjoy it. There are plenty of good movies out there to enjoy. I don't know why people like this one so much. It just wasn  I saw this movie because my cousin (who is a huge sci- fi geek) had seen it on VHS and wanted me to see it. I hadn't seen it in years so I was curious to see if it had aged well. Well, it didn't. I was expecting it to be good but this was a bad mess. I wasn't sure how I was going to rate it. It was really bad.

Reviewer: lt.bruce - favorite favorite favorite - May 4, 2011  Subject: Good, but nothing special Good but nothing really special.  to be honest, this movie was a bit rushed.  and in the end the action was pretty much over. there was a really cool chase scene though, and the music in the film was good too.  is there a better action movie out there? - May 5, 2011Good, but Nothing special  Review of a movie by someone else:   I saw this movie when I was in high school. I was never into this type of film growing up but this was a great example of a good action film. This was the first film I ever saw that really got me hooked on action.   A young man is on a job. The guy has to drive to a remote area to steal a large amount of cash. This is a job for the big guys in the area. The big guys are so powerful that they can just steal anything. This guy, on the other hand, is a small guy.   The big guy is a guy named "Hans" who is very large. He and his friends are so big that they even can fight other men. But they can't get past Hans because he is such a strong guy. The young man does his best to make a run for it, but Hans catches up with him. Hans starts to beat him up and when the young man tries to defend himself he is killed. He has to find the cash.   the rest of the movie was action, but this one was my favorite.

It was just so good.  , April 15, 2011Interesting movie, but really nothing special  a really good action movie  by: jimmy k - April 14, 2011a really good movie  in my opinion a good film  the chase scenes are great  and the music is good  but really nothing great - April 13, 2011Awesome movie!  5 Stars for it's action.  a must for action lovers - April 6, 2011Just what I needed! .

I thought that it was a cool movie and I had never seen a Star Wars movie. I watched it on a school trip. I had been told that it wasn't good so I had a very good time watching it. It was one of my first experiences with sci-fi and I loved it. I think I was in the audience for about 3/4 of the movie and my mom had me watch it from beginning to end. I don't remember much about it. The only thing that sticks in my mind was the sound effects. It sounded like they were in space. I remember thinking, "I would love to be in that ship."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't recommend this movie.  It's terrible.   A terrible movie with an excellent soundtrack.    It's also a good story with a great ending.  I didn't even know that this movie had been released in Australia.  The film was made in Russia.  But this film was never released in the U.S.  There were many copies of the film that were never released, and some copies were only available at the American Film Institute.  In the early 80's this movie was released in a series of short films by Sergei Eisenstein.  I can't say much about the plot, as I'm not sure how much was actually filmed in Russia and how much came from Eisenstein's own imagination.  And the film was also known as The Adventures of Kolya.  Eisenstein was known for his surrealistic style of photography and cinematography.  Some of the shots in this movie are truly surreal.  One scene in particular is very disturbing.  You can see Eisenstein playing the violin in a room with a man dressed in black.  Kolyya is a Russian boy who falls in love with this man.  This movie is about a young boy who finds his life in danger when he meets an evil villain who is trying to get his hands on the sacred Russian scepter.   But that's just a small part of the story.  It's a pretty good movie and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Sergei Eisensteins films.  If you are a fan, you should watch this movie at least once.

There is a reason why it was so successful and it's because it has a great story and a great plot. It's also funny, it's also very original. I enjoyed the movie but it was very disappointing because of the ending. The ending was not very good and not in a good way. It was very rushed. There was no explanation for the ending, which made me feel like I didn't get any closure.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ "Crap" was a terrible movie. I found it to be a horrible waste of time. The script was horrible. It was full of clichés and I just did not care for the characters. It also had no plot. I just felt as if it was a movie that was shot on the cheap to get as much screen time as possible. This is a film that should not have been made and it was made with little to no effort. I hope that you will not make another film that is so horrible and that the director of the film has no idea of what he is doing. I would not recommend this to anyone. It's not worth your time. If you have a family member that likes bad movies you can check it out at the library or if you have the money and time then it's probably worth your while.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hated this movie.  If I hadn't seen it first, I would have been able to find the redeeming factor in this movie and still enjoyed it.  As soon as we start the movie, I was so confused.  It was the only movie I've seen in the last 6 months where the director doesn't know what he's doing.   The story was so lame that it was hard to believe this guy was trying to make a movie. But then we are shown a movie about a couple who move to a small town to try and make a better life for themselves.  In the beginning of the movie we are given some background on the town.  We are shown the history of the town and some of the people who have lived in the town for years.  Then we are brought to the couple.  The couple is a very dull couple. They don't have any charisma or personality and I felt like the movie wanted to make me feel bad for them.    We are introduced to them as they are in the middle of moving to their new house.  They are very boring, boring and boring.  And they move to this new house with a bunch of people.  As soon as they get to the house they have a very bad fight with the man that they live with.  He is the only person that they are close with, he has been with them since they were little kids.  But the thing is, he's not a good person.  His family is abusive and he is very sick.  I could go on and on about how sick this man is and how he has no morals or morals at all.  There's no reason for him to stay with these two people. He has no job, no friends, no money, no home and no one is willing to help him.  However, this couple can't get a hold of him. He's not even willing to tell them who he is.  Now, they start living together.  When we first meet the couple, the man is the one that they go to when they want to talk about something.  That is the reason that they moved in with this couple. But that's not the only reason.  One of the reasons why they moved into this house with this guy is because he has a very big gun.  This is the scene in the movie where they are discussing about this gun. He keeps saying that they shouldn't

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a lot of bad movies and this one is the worst I've ever seen. I don't know if it's because of the actors or director but this is just so bad it's not even funny. The story is so dumb it doesn't even make sense. The whole thing has no plot. It has no reason to be any good. There is no action, there is no drama. It just starts out as a horror movie about a group of kids getting killed. Then it switches to a story about a killer who gets trapped in a house and kills his own family. After the last part of the movie, it just stops and the kids go home. There's no ending, just a long "this is a movie about kids who are killed" movie. I'm not even kidding. This movie has no story, no suspense, and no tension. It's just a boring horror movie with a really stupid plot. And the music in this movie is awful. The only good thing about this movie: it has an awesome soundtrack. The soundtrack is really good. The songs that play in this music video are amazing. The music in the movie is just awful. It really sucks the fun out of the entire movie. If you like horror movies or any kind of horror movies, then you should avoid this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________  "This is a fun time with a good cast of characters."  _____________________________________________________  The first half of the film is a simple and enjoyable thriller. It's not too crazy but not too boring either. The plot revolves around a man, Mr. Stilwell (Raymond Massey), who, through a series of events, finds himself involved in a series murders, and the police in his area of the country are convinced that he is the killer. Mr. Massey is very convincing as Mr. Loomis and his family are as well. His wife, wife's mother and brother are all wonderful. They are so friendly, yet not intrusive, which makes them very sympathetic and sympathetic. The family lives in a nice, upscale home, and their house is so beautifully decorated that it makes you want to look at it. They all have very nice clothes and they do their own thing. I also like the way Mr. O'Connor is playing the police officer. He is very polite and well-spoken, but his main role is to help Mr. Strickland and his son, Harry (Brian Cox), as they investigate this mystery. Mr O' Connor is great as a police officer and he is also very funny. I especially like how Mr. Gannon plays the police sergeant. He plays the part very well and he also is very charming and friendly. The film also includes a great soundtrack. The music is excellent and the acting is all wonderful and the script is very well-written. The story is interesting and entertaining, but I would not recommend this to everyone, especially children. It is not very scary, and it is not a "typical" murder mystery. This is a story of two people who, on a hot summer night, meet each other and go to the home of someone they know. They then go in and do something very, very wrong. This story was very well thought out and it has a great mystery to it. It also has a good twist ending. I really like the ending, because it is a very realistic ending. ________________________________________  Read the full review of "The Night Stalker" on www.welcometothenightstalkermovie.com
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this one is really bad.  It's not a good movie, but it's not bad. The movie starts out slow and you'll notice that the characters don't really interact with each other.  Then, the movie gets very boring, and the film only has a couple of scenes that are really great.  It's just a very boring movie that doesn't work.   The plot is pretty bad too.  I don't know if they were trying to be funny, or just trying to create a mystery.  When I first watched the movie, I really thought that they would be able to build a good mystery. But I was wrong.  The only thing that really kept this movie going is the soundtrack.  But even though the music is good, the characters are boring.  Also, they need to change the movie.  Why would you do something like that?  The ending was really bad, and I don' think it was supposed to be a surprise.  If they were going to make a sequel, they could have done something more with the plot.  This movie was only good because of the soundtrack and it was really hard to find a good way to watch this movie. Grade-C (1.5)

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* It's a horrible movie and if you are looking for a good movie to watch, look elsewhere. The only good thing about it is the song and it's a good song, but it's the story that I can't stand. A man kills his son in a fit of rage. He has to deal with the guilt of killing his own son and he goes to see a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist tells him that the man had a problem with alcohol, but he can't tell the man the real reason why he killed his son. He doesn't believe him and tells him to get his son back. The man goes to the police, but they refuse to help him. They also tell him that his son died in a car accident and the police don't want to know anything about it. The police take the man to a psychiatrist who says that he had a mental breakdown and that he is suffering from depression. The doctor tells the man that he should kill himself because he is in a lot of pain and doesn't know how to live. The story ends with the man thinking about killing himself, but then he thinks about his son and decides to get help from a counselor at the mental hospital. This is a very stupid movie and it should not be seen by anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _________ ___________. If there's a better way to spend time than watching a movie, I'm not sure what it is. The movie's badness is in its sheer incompetence. It's not a movie that you can watch and feel anything at all, not even a tiny bit of enjoyment. It has no narrative to speak of, so you just sit there and look at people talking about nothing. There's no character development, no sense of character. The characters are there but they don't really have anything to say. It feels like a TV movie that was made by people who've seen an episode of TV and then decided to make a movie. There are no twists and turns, no characters you're really interested in. It really doesn't have a point to it. It just feels like the people who wrote it were so bored with TV that they decided to take some of the plot points they'd heard about from the movies and use them in this movie. I'm sorry, but there was no need to write a script like that. If you're going to do a movie like that, you have to make the movie better than what it was. You can't just throw in some stuff from the TV show, no matter how well it fits. You have to take a good movie, take some stuff that works well in TV, and make a better movie. Not a bad one, just a better one. This movie was written by people so bored they didn't even bother to think of anything else to say about the plot. It was written so that they could just write a movie without any problems. This was like a television movie written by someone who has seen an entire season of television and then tried to make an entire movie from that. The only reason it's even good is because of the acting. Everyone in this film is so uninteresting that they don,t even seem to be trying. I'd have liked to see more of the movie, because at the end there were only a few things to look forward to. I don't think anyone even really liked the movie. The acting was good, the music was nice, and the story was pretty good, but it just wasn't a good film. I hope that they make a sequel, because they probably will, because it's pretty obvious that this movie was meant to be made into a TV show. The idea of a TV series based on a movie I don' t know. I

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ The Good: ______________________ A lot of things happened in this movie.  The best part was the beginning.  A good opening to a movie. It's like it starts in the middle of a scene and then cuts to the start of a new scene.   We got to see the character, the guy that is the boss of the whole company, and the little girl.  They are so cute and innocent.  The movie ends with a really awesome ending.  I was so happy with this movie and it really made me laugh. ________________________________________________________________________________________ The Bad:   The guy in this film is just a bad person.  He was the boss, and he didn't care about the employees, even though the employees loved him.  One of the main characters, the little boy, had to watch his mom be murdered by this guy, and that's when the little guy started to get sick.  This guy just wanted to be a big man.  That's why he tried to kill all the employees in this company.  And he did it by using a weapon.  We got to hear all this evil and evil talk.  There was even a gun in his hand.  It was very scary.  So I don't recommend this movie to people who want to watch a movie that will scare them.  Another thing that happened in the movie was that the guy was very angry with the girl for not giving him the money he wanted.  What is the guy's problem?  The Good Ending: ___________ The movie ended with a cool ending. The little boy said "I love you".    After watching this movie, I would give this movie a B- because it was really great.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I was really going to be sick  Now I'm feeling great   The next day we went to see the original. We were so excited about it! We saw it a second time a week later. It was really good, but I had to be careful when they were trying to show the first act. It would start on a scene where the guys had been on a fishing boat, and one of them was looking for a new one. He finds a good one, and when he tries to hook it, it goes right under his boat, but then it pops out. The guy yells "Ow, ow, ow!" and the guy on the boat says "I don't know why that happens." The guy says "Well, I don't either." The next scene shows a lot of fishing. There's a great one where they're fishing for a fish with a net. The fish goes under the net and gets eaten by the catfish. Then they have to go back to the ship. The boat is being rowed, and it's pretty hard to move, so they get to the boat, sit down on the seats, and the boat starts rocking. The guys are so excited, they throw themselves off the boat! When the boat stops, they are all lying on the floor in the dark. The movie ends with the guys lying on their backs. I don the movie on VHS, and we are watching it. They have been going back to their boat and there's this huge explosion, and they are in the water. The next morning they are both back in the boat. The fisherman says, "The fish were gone." The catfish went to the bottom, but the fish were still there. Then he says, and I quote, "I really hope that was a ghost."  -J. C. Raulerson, via Amazon.com I remember the original was on TV on a station that I got it from. I have a tape from my mom's collection of the original, and a copy from a friend who got it on tape from the station. I remember being really excited about seeing it, and being excited to see it again. I thought it was really funny and had great special effects. I'm still a fan of it. I think it has a few of the best jokes in any movie ever made. I also remember the guy who played the fisherman was a good actor, and he did a

And if you are going to watch it, you will have a very good time."  - Chris O'Dowd, The People v. O.J. Simpson   "That movie was so bad it made me want to pull my hair out." .  _____________________________________________  REVIEW  This is the movie I've been waiting to see since it was announced. I'm a big fan of James Bond movies. I've seen them all and I've loved them all. But this movie is so bad, I don't even know where to begin.  in many ways, the movie is a re-imagining of the classic movie "Dr. No". The main difference is that Bond is a modern day British spy instead of an aging James Bond. The story is actually pretty good and I was interested to see how it would turn out. I was disappointed.   The story starts with 007 (Daniel Craig) on a mission to retrieve a piece of information that was stolen from him decades ago. This piece of data is a piece that could be used to track down an enemy agent. This is a big deal since the enemy agent is one of the most dangerous men in the world. Bond's main goal is to retrieve the data and not kill him. But it turns out that Bond didn't really know the information he was after. So the agent escapes. The bad guy is still out there and 007 must find him before he gets a chance to kill him and take over the world again.  . . The movie then shifts gears to a more typical spy movie. It begins with 009 (George Lazenby) having an affair with a woman (Lea Seydoux). The spy gets into a car accident and is then saved by his lover. Bond then gets into another car accident but is saved by another man (Mark Strong).   . Bond and the others try to figure out the location of the secret agent. They find a man who says he is the agent. Bond is sent to kill the man but the agent shows up and takes Bond hostage. Bond must do whatever the agent says in order to save his life.  , The agent has the agent's phone number and wants to know where he is. The agent then forces Bond to take part in a plan to capture the real 009. But before the agent
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________.   1/5  I've always loved this movie, but I have a hard time explaining why. It is so far removed from anything I'd ever seen before that it's hard to describe it. I guess it is like a combination of The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Thing, and Alien. It takes place in a world where a man (Dawson) who was born a mutant has become a god. His kingdom is called "Hemera". He has a daughter (Linda) who's mutant ability is telekinesis. He tries to convince his daughter that she should give up her ability, but her father is not convinced. She tells him that she has telekineis, that her powers are an aid to her and she will never use them for evil, but that he can use his power to protect his daughter. I didn't know what to make of this at first, but then I realized that it was about the relationship between a father and daughter. There are so many similarities in this movie to the love between a mother and child. The father in this film does not see the daughter as a burden, but rather as a gift. He doesn't hate his daughter, but he sees her as a friend. He does care about her and he's worried about her, but it is not a hatred. This is about father and child, not a man and his daughter and his lover. I think the similarities are pretty clear, but at the same time I can't really put my finger on it. In a way it is a very complex movie and I'm still not sure how to describe my feelings about it. It was so bizarre that it is difficult to explain. I really don't know if it was the weirdness of the film or the fact that it takes place on a completely alien planet that gave it this strange feel, but something about it just made me not care for it at all. I found myself watching it with my head buried in a book. I would give it a 4, but my rating is a 1. It just did not work for me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ It is an amazing movie that I loved, but I felt that the story did not go anywhere, and that they took away the magic that made it one of the most beautiful movies ever made. It had so much potential and then the plot is very predictable. I did enjoy the story of this movie but it was just not something that I would have loved to see happen in a movie. This movie is a masterpiece that I will never see again. It is one of those movies that you have to see in order to understand the story. It was a very moving movie, but the story is not what makes it so great. This is one I will definitely re-watch when I have the time. I recommend this movie to all fans of beautiful movies. I do not know why I waited so long to see this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have not seen this one. It is a "what if?" movie. It was written as a "What if the U.S. had gone to war with Japan during World War II?" and the plot was a combination of all the possible situations that could have happened. It had a plot where the U,S. were fighting a war on two fronts. In the Pacific, they were fighting Japan while in Europe they were battling Germany. They also had to worry about Germany being able to get their hands on all the materials they needed for the war. It seems to be a movie about "what would have happened if we hadn't gone to the war". I can't really tell what would have been in this movie but I think that if it had gone on, the U.,S. would have won. I would recommend this movie to a younger audience. I think it is a great way to keep the memories of war fresh in the minds of kids. This movie is a classic.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* ********** The film is a mess. I don't mean to be too harsh, but it just doesn't work. The acting is really terrible. The actors are so bad that it makes you question if they were actually supposed to be in the film. The pacing is really bad. This is an over long, really slow film that makes no sense whatsoever. The movie even takes a break from that, and takes a really bad turn. I would give this a C- but I would have loved to have seen the whole film from start to finish. ************* ***********

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This is one of those movies where the worst movie you have ever seen is really, really good.  There is nothing really interesting about it. Â The movie has a plot that involves a small boy (T. J. Miller) who gets caught up in a game of Russian Roulette.  Â When you first see the movie, you think "that sounds stupid."   Then, you see the film and realize that it is actually really good and that you are not supposed to be able to recognize it.   The movie is not really about anything.    It is not about a boy who is really bad.  The story is about a Russian Roulet player (Miller) who is a real bad guy.  This movie is all about the bad guy and his obsession with the game.  The Russian Roulettes are the best thing to happen to cinema since the invention of the gun.  There is a whole lot of violence in this movie.  For example, one of the characters has to have a foot amputated.  That is all I can remember about the movie.   If you enjoy Russian Roules then you should watch this movie because it is great.    Overall, this movie is a lot of fun.  I do not think I will ever watch a movie that has a gun as the main plot element.  If you do not like violence then you probably will not enjoy this movie but if you are into Russian Roulets, then you will enjoy it.  I give this movie a 6 out of 10.   You will like this movie if you enjoy a bad Russian Roulett.   I would give this a 6/10

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This movie was like watching a car crash, it was terrible and not fun at all. It was like an accident, no one knew what was going to happen." I can't imagine anyone saying that about any movie that wasn't good. I've watched dozens of car accidents, and most of them were pretty cool.  What this movie does, it makes you think that you're going to have a car accident and that you have a concussion. Â The film is a movie about a guy who goes to a party with his girlfriend, he gets drunk, and they end up getting into a car wreck.    It's a very slow paced movie that's almost depressing.  It really makes you wonder how long it will take you to get better.  There is a scene where the guy is sitting on the side of the road waiting to get a cab.  When the girl gets out of the car, he sees that she's unconscious.  He calls for a cab and they take her to a hospital.  Unfortunately, when the cab is leaving, the cab driver turns the car around, runs over the girl, and kills her.  The film seems to be trying to show the character, the guy, as a victim, but it really isn't realistic.  I think that he should have known that she was going home.  This is a good movie if you want to watch a car-wreck.  However, it's a movie that you don't want to think about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The biggest problems with this movie are that it is an action movie with no story, no characters, and no development. The movie has a ton of special effects, but most of the special effects are either cheap or pointless. I am a big fan of action movies, but this is just plain bad.   The film opens with a woman who is trapped in a dark basement.  In order to escape, she must use a special key. She has been trapped there since she was a little girl, but she has not aged a day. She is a survivor of a cult that committed horrific acts of violence against children. The cult was headed by a charismatic leader.  When the cult leader is killed, the leader's young daughter and his loyal servant, two girls, take up the leadership. They are known as the Sisterhood of the Wolf, and they believe that by killing one another, they can gain strength and bring back the glory days.

Overall 3.75 out of 5 stars 3,624 3,623  Rated 4 out of 4 stars 3.6  This movie is really a classic. The actors were so good that they gave a good performance. The film is set in the 1940's in New York City. It's about a lot of women who are married to famous men. There's an actor in the movie named, Tony. The woman he is married to is a little bitch. She's jealous of the men they have and she's jealous that she can't get into the top 10. One night she gets a call from him. He asks her if she's interested in having a threesome with him and another woman. They have a great time and she loves having sex with him. The movie ends with her getting into the 10th place and being very happy with her life. There was a lot going on in this movie and you can see the real life behind it. The movie is so interesting that I recommend this movie to everyone who's into historical movies. It is very entertaining and is full of great details.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ I can only compare this movie to The Lost World, a movie that was completely forgettable, a disaster, a waste of time and an insult to our intelligence. I never understood why the people involved in the making of this movie were so confident. The actors were terrible. I guess it was supposed to be a comedy, but it was way too long. I felt like I was watching a movie about a crazy person. They didn't even try to make it funny. The music was bad. It was boring and uninspired. It felt like the music director was trying to imitate the style of music from the 1930s and '40s. It didn't work. The special effects were bad, and they looked like they were made by people who didn't know what they were doing. This movie had to be made by someone with very little sense of humor. The only reason I saw this movie is because of the great trailer. I was hoping for something better, but that didn't happen. __________________  "The worst movie ever made is still worse than all the others." - Robert Rodriguez

(Anonymous 7/23/14) "I would say that the movie is not a good one. I have never seen a movie like this, but I found it interesting. The acting is very bad. This movie has a bad ending. The movie is about a man that is in the hospital because he died, but his wife and kids think that he is still alive. He is not, and they don't want to leave him behind. When he asks for a room, they say no, and then they try to force him to stay. The wife tries to go to the bathroom and it's not working, so she goes to the closet, but then she falls in the toilet. They don't find her body. He calls the police, but they think that his wife is still in the bathroom, so they don?t call for help. He then decides to take a nap in the closet. The next morning, he wakes up to see a stranger sitting on the bed next to him. It turns out that the man is his brother, and the woman was his wife. The woman says that she died because the man was so obsessed with his wife that he had taken to cheating on her, and that the woman is still out there, and will kill him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!The movie is a total waste of time. The whole film was filmed in 3 days and was so rushed. I mean you have the guy who is the star of the movie, he is very tall, handsome, and has a great personality, then you have his son who has the same personality, but the son has a huge mouth and a small body. You also have the female lead who is a beautiful girl, and I mean a beautiful movie star, but she doesn't have a great body, she is short, and her boobs are tiny. I thought this movie was going to be good, but then the director of the film took the movie to another level. He didn't have time to take the movie seriously, so he made it a comedy, and he filmed it so fast that he didn't even know what was going on. The ending was ridiculous, and a waste of the talent of the director. I hope this movie gets a good ending and that this movie will get a second and third viewing. If you don't like to laugh, then this movie isn't for you. I guess the audience for this movie is people who want to be amused by something silly. I don't know how the director filmed it in 3 or 4 days, but he filmed a movie in such a short amount of time that he doesn't know what is going on or what is happening. It's like a train that doesn't stop for 2 hours and goes to a place where nothing happens.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________________________   This movie was absolutely terrible.   The plot:  In the city of Los Angeles, a young man, who is suffering from a mental disorder, takes up a job as a cop in the notorious Watts area. His job is to enforce the "zero tolerance" policy against gangs. He does this by stopping any gang member, and handing them over to the local police department. He also keeps a record of every person who is stopped and handed over to police, and in doing so, it seems that he becomes addicted to the job.  ....   There are many things wrong with this film. For one thing, it is poorly made. The acting is terrible. Some of the characters are a bit far-fetched. For example, when the police officer is arrested, he is taken to the police station. When he is brought to his cell, there is a hole in the door. He proceeds to take the hole and insert it into his mouth, which makes his head look like it is in a bad parody of a clown's head. He is supposed to be a funny, edgy character, but his acting makes him appear like a stereotypical clown.  , one of the police officers who is assigned to watch the gang member's car is played by James Gandolfini, a famous actor. But his acting is just not that good. I mean, he seems to be constantly having a hard time with the fact that he is being watched by a very dangerous gang member. He seems to have no problem with the idea that this gang member is a drug dealer and that he could potentially kill him. When Gandolfinis character sees that the gangster is carrying a gun and has a gun in his hand, he immediately gives the order for the gangsters to get down. But, he doesn't even get down on the ground. In fact, he sits down in a position that is so dangerous that he actually gets his leg shot off, because his leg was trapped by the gang members and they couldn't get him down.   the gang of gangsters that are involved in the murders are portrayed as being pretty much insane. They are always making fun of the people they are killing. They call the victims "druggies". One of them even goes so far as to say that he and his gang are in charge of a very big drug ring. But he says that he doesn´t know who the people he is killing are

There are so many mistakes, and every time something is said or done, it sounds like it is improvised. The script is terrible. The plot is a complete mess.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I hate the movie so much, I wish they never made it."  And I can't stand movies that try to be anything more than an excuse to make people laugh, with little to no thought put into the story.  It's like the writer is in a hurry to make money.  What a horrible movie this is.  This is the most cringe-inducing movie I've ever seen, and that's saying a lot.  It is filled with bad acting, awful acting, bad jokes, and the worst special effects in the history of cinema.  The entire film is an act of desperation from its director, who is trying to sell his director's cut of the movie in order to secure a big budget to make a sequel.  And he succeeded!  If I ever see a sequel to this film, I will not be watching it, and it will be the end of it.  I have no idea what this film is supposed to be about, or how a movie like this could even get made.  All I know is that it is an absolute embarrassment of a movie.   Why would anyone give this movie a chance?    So, let's move on to the next film!   The next film is called "The Secret of Nimh".  The plot is that a scientist and his assistant travel back in time to prevent the destruction of their own home town.  Here's the problem:   This movie is so bad, I actually had to turn the volume up on my computer, so I could be a bit more descriptive with my comments.  What the fuck is this movie?  It starts off with a very weird, yet somewhat creepy intro, that's really just a few seconds of nothing.  You're just introduced to this guy, who has a very strange voice, and a very peculiar way of speaking.  He's not just weird, but he's also just weird.  They also have a few creepy music tracks, that are really just played in the background.  Then, the movie gets very dark, and then very strange.  When the characters are at a gas station, they hear the siren of a car, and they start to look around, and see a dark car coming towards them.  There are several moments where they don't really know what is going on.  Finally, they get in the car, they start driving, and suddenly the lights are

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Jul 23, 2017 7:12 PM   'The Witch' Trailer  Loading...    "The Witch" is a terrifying movie with a frightening premise: A little girl named Lucy (played by newcomer Jessica Chastain) is possessed by a spirit, which has been haunting her for the last 50 years. After Lucy's father, who was a physician in a small New England town, is murdered by the witch, the possessed Lucy starts a family with the man's widow, played by Jessica Biel, and their son, played with great poise by Jacob Tremblay. A little boy named Will (Josh Boone) who is in a similar situation and is also possessed by the spirit is the last person to see his father alive. A few months later, Will starts seeing ghosts of his father and tries to escape from the town to which he belongs. His father is an excellent doctor who was in charge of a hospital, but a mysterious and evil witch has possessed him for a few years now, and now has a hold over him, making him act like the ghostly spirit of his dead father. In the beginning, "The Conjuring" is an ordinary movie with no paranormal element. However, in the last ten minutes of the movie, "Witch" completely changes the pace of the film. The scene is shot like a horror movie. The atmosphere is scary. The tension is intense. The final scene is the most disturbing in the movie. But, this movie also has its happy moments. It has a lot of action, a great cast and a fantastic plot. However if you're looking for an interesting movie that will leave you with a great sense of dread, this is the right movie for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ http://youtu.be/a2UuQ6H7n-I  In this world, it's all about the money. It's a cruel world and a cruel way to live, but at the same time, you've gotta do what you gotta do. But what if there's a way to be a part of the world and not be a piece of meat?   A young woman named Nina is sent to an orphanage run by a sadistic butler named Max. But Max isn't a bad guy. He's a victim of circumstances. Nina is just a kid, but she's already starting to have her own desires. She's interested in the arts, and she's curious about Max's past. And one day, Max is suddenly murdered. Nina, who's trying to find out what really happened, soon finds herself on a dangerous mission.   There's a lot of dark humor in this movie, but I think the best part is Nina's interactions with Max. They are not always sweet, but when Nina's in a bad mood, she can be quite vicious. She has a very cruel side to her. The movie has a lot to say about child abuse, but Nina's own abuse is the worst part.     I like the movie. It has a great plot, a dark theme and a lot going on. There's a little bit of a twist, but it works well. The music is pretty good, and the acting is top-notch. It doesn't make the movie as good as it could, but the movie is good enough to watch.

There are a few things that could have been better.  It seems like there are some really lame jokes and I was just bored of watching the actors trying to be funny.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen this movie twice now. The first time I was a bit disappointed. The second time I didn't care.   This is one of those movies that I have had in my head since the beginning of the film. It was a favorite of mine as a child.  It was one of my favorite movies of all time.  I thought that this film would be great.  There were some great action scenes.  They were a lot of fun.  The characters were all interesting.  But they never seemed to be able to pull of the big heist or the big rescue.  This film was very boring.  When you get a good heist movie it seems like there is something more to it than just doing the job.  With the "The Big one" they seemed to do it as a comedy.  For a comedy they should have made it a drama.  Instead they just made it about a guy who was in love with a beautiful girl and when he found out she was cheating on him, he got revenge.  If you want to watch a movie about a man and a woman who are in love and he goes through a relationship with a girl who isn't in love, then this film is for you.  What I didn''t like about the film was that the big one was a big disappointment.  In the end, he is only able to get her to marry him by convincing her that he is her true love.  So I don''t think he even gets the big score.  And it wasn''t a real big rescue either.  Then they showed a movie where he had to steal a diamond from a bank.  He had a little helicopter and he stole it with the help of his friend.  Again, this is a comedy and I don't think that it was a real rescue. I guess the main point of this movie is to be about a heist and the big ones are great.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Mar 16, 2017 4:19 PM By B.A. on Reviewer: Anonymous Hi I was watching this with my wife and she did not like it at all. I think the acting was terrible and the story was bad. We watched the whole thing before we had a chance to go to bed. We both said it was sooo cheesy. She would like it better if it was not so cheesy. The ending was a bummer because the guy was a big idiot and it just made me sick. I would not recommend this to anyone. I have already made my mind up. I did not see this movie. I guess we will have to re-watch this with our kids next time. - March 16,2017This movie was bad

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this movie to be a waste of time. It is one of those movies that makes you go "Oh, you are a film critic?" But no, you're not. I'm a movie lover, so of course I was going to like it, but I didn't. I found it boring and predictable, and I just didn't enjoy it. It felt like a bunch of writers on a writing retreat, and it was all about a woman named Lisa who's been out of work for a while, and she thinks she can get back into it with her new boyfriend, who is not really her boyfriend, and then they decide to do some "romantic" stuff, but then they end up in bed together, which is a real let down for Lisa.  I found it a little boring, but it did make me want to watch some other films, and of course, I would love to watch a film like this again sometime. But in the meantime, I've been working on some more exciting things that will keep me busy for a few weeks.

Star Trek: First Contact (1996) 8.5 1 2 Add - more Reviews https://books.google.com/books/about/Star_Trek_First_Contact.html?id=YgJ3CgAAQBAJ Star Trek First Contact is an action-packed sci-fi thriller that gives the audience an epic tale that includes the battle between Klingons and the Federation, a war between the Romulans and the Klingons, a secret mission of the starship Enterprise, a deadly battle between Starfleet and the Borg, and a mysterious woman who can control the destiny of a race of aliens. The film is a great example of the Star Trek franchise. The action sequences are spectacular, the script is solid, and the performances are superb. There is even an interesting story that deals with the question of the fate of the Borg. If you are a fan of Star Trek, this film will leave you in awe.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ರೃ  The film is all about how the only way a man can really get laid is by giving himself to the woman. It's all about the idea that a man must not be allowed to live his life without a woman, that he must constantly be chasing her.  It's all this self-destructive, aggressive masculinity. And it is all presented in a very simplistic, almost cartoon-like way. The film seems to focus on one particular woman in particular, and it's this woman's personality that the film is trying to get at.  is a movie that is all the more disturbing because the characters in the film seem to act as if they were the kind of people that would act in such a manner. It seems that they are the kind that would do anything to get the attention of a woman and make her fall in love with them. The only thing that seems to be missing from this is any sort of humanity.  "He's a good guy, but what if he was just a bad guy?"  All of this is presented in the most simplistic way possible, and that is why it seems so wrong. But it's a very interesting film. It is not just about how bad men are, it's about how good men are as well. I think that this is one of those films that you can watch at night, or at the weekend and enjoy it. It doesn't matter what time of day you watch it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is very poor. The story is terrible. There are so many plot holes and problems that the movie is a complete disaster. There is not a single redeeming quality in the movie. If you have watched it, then you know what I am talking about. The actors are not good at all. The dialogue is not funny at all, it is annoying and very cliche. The movie has a terrible story, but the worst thing is the horrible acting. The acting is awful and there is not one good actor in the whole movie. I will not watch this movie again. It is a real bad movie. There were so many things that went wrong with this movie that it is hard to even think of anything good. I give this movie a D.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this with a group of friends and we all loved it! This was a really funny movie! The jokes were great and the plot was great.  The only thing that could have been better is that it had a little bit more romance and a little more heart. I think it's important for people to know that there was a lot of heart in this movie.  I think the reason that it's such a classic is because it's really funny!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________ I think this is the worst movie I have ever seen. This is not a bad film per se, but it is not great either. It is not bad because of the bad acting, it is just bad. The acting is so bad it was almost like they were trying to be funny and they really weren't. The plot is horrible and the ending is just stupid. I did not understand the point of the movie, why the characters did what they did. The movie is so horrible and stupid that it actually makes me sad to think about it. This movie should be burned in hell, it's so bad that I can't watch it, it makes me so angry. I hope this movie will be a nightmare for all future filmmakers. This film is the perfect example of why people hate films and why they should not be in a movie in the first place. It's like a child threw a tantrum and then watched it with a friend who was in the other room and said 'Wow that was great, what did you see in that movie?' Well, you just sat there and watched this movie and said what was wrong with it?

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.  A movie with no dialogue whatsoever. This is one of those movies where the movie itself is enough. A small village in France, is invaded by some unknown forces and the only survivors are a mother, a son and a daughter. After the destruction, the only things they can do is run. They will not give up, they will not be defeated. And as they run, they learn the truth about who they are. They have been trained by a mysterious man who has brought the village together. As they make their way to escape, they find out that they can't trust anyone and their only chance of survival is to work together to survive. It is a pretty good movie but it's too short. There are not enough scenes and characters to build a story around. It is too short for its own good and I don't think it's worth watching. It just doesn't have much to offer. And if you are looking for some good horror movies, I'd recommend checking out the following ones: A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Evil Dead, The Blair Witch Project and Halloween (I think it was Halloween 3). For a movie that's too long and not scary enough, check out the short film: For more horror movies and stories, check these out: The Shining The Ring The Omen The Exorcist The Wicker Man A Clockwork Orange The Blair Witch project
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a bit more than a bit, though.  The script is not good and the acting is just a bit... poor.  "I can't believe he is so stupid, he would think I am his mother!"   The director, I believe, wanted to make a comedy, but it is not funny at all.   The plot was rather convoluted and I have a hard time thinking what it all means.  The acting is atrocious and some of the worst I have ever seen.  If this is the last film I ever see, I hope it is the best of them all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! If it was an original idea then it would be great. It is not an original. I know they tried to make it different but it still is a typical horror movie. It had some nice scares but it was not good. The ending was very stupid and weird. It just made no sense. There was not even a reason to the ending. I think the writer was trying to make a horror movie with some action. I would like it to be better if they would have done some research.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ It's the perfect example of how to make a film bad. It was a big budget film made by a very small budget director, and while the story is not original or groundbreaking, it does not even try to be. The film follows a group of misfits who get their hands on a military weapon (a grenade launcher), they go to a beach in order to test the weapon out, and they just happen to end up on a battlefield, with the enemy team coming at them. This is followed by a series of scenes that try to make the audience sympathize with these characters. They are fighting a bunch of evil people with evil guns. They end up getting captured, they have to escape, and then they get to fight in a prison yard, but this time they have some fun with it. It doesn't really go anywhere, and there are not many things that are good about this movie. The acting is not bad, the acting is average, but the direction is terrible. It is so bad, that it's difficult to believe that someone made this film. It has no story, no action, no plot, and it really doesn't matter. You can sit there and watch the movie for a while, and just wonder what the point is. It's just a series that goes on and on, and you're not entertained. I really liked it because it was a bit of a departure from the "action" genre. But I guess I just had to see this one before I passed it by. Oh well, I guess there are worse things than being bored. _________________________________________ A film that was not good.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ ___________ The film has a lot of great stuff. I have never seen so many characters in a single film. They all have a little different way of talking. They also all seem like real people. But when you look into it, most of them are really just puppets. The film is all about the story of a man who is in the middle of a big money deal, he's really not doing too well financially, he goes to this big company to pitch a plan to the big boss. When he shows them his plan they want him out, and in the end he's not. This is a movie with a really good story and it's the most realistic film I've seen. It really shows how things work in business and how people act when they are in a bad situation. There is also a good action scene in this movie and it gives you a lot to think about. But the biggest part of this film is the performances. I'm not a big fan of puppets, but there is a lot going on here and you see a lot different types of people. This film is very interesting, you get to see some interesting characters. The plot is good, but I just couldn't see the story. I just didn't feel that the film was good enough to hold my attention. But there are good things about this film. The music is good and it gets really exciting when they do something really crazy. But it really doesn't mean anything. The animation was really nice, the special effects were really great, and the special actors all did good things in this film as well. But this film just isn't as good as I had hoped. ____________________________ "I know it's a lot, but it's all a lie." This film was made in 1959 and it is a great film. It was made for about $10,000. They made this film for just about anything they could get for it, and it looks very good. This movie was made with a lot more money than most films, so it looks good. It is very well done. The puppets were great, they are all very realistic and they all have different personalities. The story is good. There are lots of action scenes, and there is also some romance in this story. But I can't really see how it was really a good film. I mean, I really liked it, but when I think about it I can see how there are better movies out
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ ______________.  My husband was on his way to a movie when I asked him if he wanted to come to my place. I have been married to him for over 5 years. When he arrived at my place he was in a hurry and I was in the shower. When I opened the door and saw him he was flustered and looked at me like he was having a panic attack. He ran into my room and locked the door behind him. He said that he was a little drunk and that he had not had anything to drink. I told him that I had not wanted to talk about it and to go to the bathroom. I also said that I didn't want to talk to him about it either. He asked me what I was going to do about it. I said that we would talk about something else. He replied that he would call the police and that I should not be talking to him at all. I was so shocked. I had no idea that he could be so controlling. When my husband returned home he said that it was a misunderstanding. He told me that he felt that I was trying to take advantage of him and that his body did not respond to my advances. I feel that I did not deserve this treatment. He has been married for almost 6 years and I have not had any problems with him. I am now scared of this man. My husband did not like me to tell him about the incident. I don't want him to know about it or about how I feel about him. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  it doesn't work.  It has no soul.   All it does is remind you of the worst of the bad movie genre.  This movie was released in 2004.  If you're looking for a good, original, original movie with great characters, and a story that is worth watching, you should watch this.  This is the kind of movie that will give you something to think about.  It doesn't have a ton of heart, but the characters are real.  The film doesn't make any big claims to being a "bad movie".  It's a great movie with a great story.  You're just going to watch it for the great characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: re, this film does not have a strong enough story to be a horror movie. It is just one of the many movies in the "franchise" that do not fit. e is just a poor excuse for a horror film. The action scenes are very simple and repetitive and the film does little with the "characters" other than kill them off and then move on.  There are no interesting plot elements and the only thing that will keep this from being a 1.5 is the music.

I don't think there are many movie that have the kind of impact and impact on people's lives that this one did.  The Last Days of Disco is available on DVD.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Bad movie that makes me sad. ______________ This movie is bad and the reason for that is the main character. The movie is made for kids and that is why the movie is stupid. The main character is stupid because she is a girl and she has to pretend to be a boy. I think that if the movie was made for adults then it would have been okay but it was made to be for kids. I also think that the movie could have been made better if it was about a guy. This movie makes me feel sad and the main reason is because the main guy is stupid and he doesn't know how to act like a boy and that makes the movie so stupid. There is one scene where the main girl and the guy are in a bathroom and the girl is playing with her boobs and the guys looks at her and says "I don't know what you're doing but it's wrong" and she says "That's not right because it's not fair that a girl can't have a man like me" and the man says "Well, I know it's unfair because a girl is so much stronger than a guy and she is stronger than you" and he grabs her boobs. This makes me very sad because I think a guy would know better than that. And that is because a guy knows that he is the one that should be strong. A guy should never do that because that makes him look stupid. It is so stupid that a guy should know that and the movie doesn't show this. Also, there is a guy that talks to the guy and the boy says "This guy doesn't even know how he looks like a girl" and it makes me so sad. The girl is also not a boy because she was born a girl. There was a girl in the movie that was a boy but that was too long ago and she died so I can't say if she was a real girl. Also there was a scene where a guy talks to a girl, and the person that was talking to her says "You know I don't like your attitude. Why are you being such a girl?" and the other guy says "Because you're not a girl so it doesn't matter" and I thought that he was saying something mean to her but the movie never shows it. That makes me think that he really is a mean guy. There are also a lot of scenes where people are talking about a boy like he's a boy when in reality he is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I didn't see this movie, and I don't even like horror movies." It's a pretty lame response.  I'd say "I didn''t see this because it didn't have much to offer, or "I don't like horror films" would be a better response. I did see the movie, but I didn't like it.    The plot is ridiculous.  The movie does have some nice horror moments, but the rest is pretty much just boring.  I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!   And in case you missed it, here's the trailer:   - A bunch of teenagers go camping and find a huge stone that causes them to go to sleep. In a dream, they find that the stone has become the moon and they find themselves on the moon, where they are attacked by an alien creature, who has a huge eye on his head.   There are so many things wrong with this movie that it's hard to know where to start. The movie has a strange way of showing the characters' faces and movements in order to try and create a believable dream world. It's kind of like someone else's dream, where the dreams are actually created by the characters.  , but that's a very minor detail. The characters are very shallow, and it's easy to tell that they're acting for the audience.   the movie's main characters, who are called "The Four," are the main characters. They are also the only ones with actual personality. They have nothing to do with the plot and the movie tries to hide that fact from the audience by making them act like the audience wants them to act. They also are very unlikable characters, especially the girl with the eyepatch, who never seems to be happy or excited. And as for the aliens, they are presented as being extremely dangerous, even though the movie never explains how the aliens got on earth in the first place. The ending of the movie is kind of a letdown, but it's not a bad ending. It just isn't that good. The monsters and the moon are never actually shown on the screen. The only things that the monsters do are make people act like they are acting in a dream. The moon is a big flat surface with a moonlight reflecting off of it. It is very difficult to understand why they are on earth and why they have an eye on their head. The story ends abruptly. There's no cliffhanger at the end. I was surprised that this movie was actually released. There were only two trailers and no trailer for the DVD. And there was no mention of it on IMDB. I guess this is a very rare case where the movie actually has a trailer and a DVD.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________   The first 10 minutes are pretty much the first act of a thriller. This is where the movie begins to go downhill. The first act has you on the edge of your seat, waiting for a big reveal that might or might not happen. You're getting excited about the premise, but this movie is only as exciting as the plot.   Then things get really weird and creepy. The movie begins with a man walking into a room full of naked women. The man then says, "I've been looking for a new home for a long time." The first half of the movie has the camera zooming in on the women's breasts and asses as the man walks through the room. Then, suddenly, the camera cuts to a close up on a girl's face, where we see she is actually the man.  , the man is the one who wants to buy the house. She's a young woman who was a prostitute and now she's been working for a guy who wants a house with a view. As the movie goes on we see that the young woman has no idea what she is signing up for. The next few scenes are more of the same, but even more disturbing. We start out with the young women getting into a car and driving away. After the car has been driven off, a guy in a suit walks in and asks the women if they have anything to report. After they refuse, the guy in the suit says he wants to speak to the woman in charge. He's the one that hired the prostitutes in the first place, he says. He is an FBI agent who is investigating the house that the women are working for. It's a house that has an old mansion, but it's also an apartment building with a lot of old women living there. The agent asks the girls if they are there because they have a lot to sell. The girls refuse, but the agent insists. He walks up to a bedroom and asks for the girls to get naked. The girl in charge, an older woman, says she has a special surprise for him. She gets down on her knees and opens up a drawer that is filled with hundreds of vials. The woman walks to the agent and says she's going to give him the "magic" and that she will make him a millionaire. She then proceeds to do it, but instead she makes him a million dollar man! He has a mansion in the sky and a beautiful wife who is also his

The car gets up on its side and then she and her boyfriend, get sucked up into the air and crash into the water. The only thing that is going to happen to her is she's going to drown. The whole thing is really strange and really creepy. It's really weird how the movie goes on, but there is a lot of strange and creepy things going on. You just don't know what to think about it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________________ "Citizen Kane" is a movie about a great man and a very bad man. It is a story about how a man with talent and potential can fall in love with a woman and eventually fall in a very expensive way. "Cameron's work has become as familiar as the lines of the great silent movie actor" says Michael Cimino in the movie. Well it has become even more familiar, the lines are there, the characters are there but what is not there is a connection between the two. Both are talented but both are different. The man has the talent and the woman has the passion but they are separated by a very large and very expensive fence. The fence that is there is much too large and expensive to be a fence for them to walk on and that is the problem. When they come together they are like a couple of little angels and when they fall apart they are little devils. "It is a sad story about two people who are in love but don't realize it. It's sad because we love these people and we want them to succeed and be happy, but they don't know what they want" says Roger Ebert in the Movie. That is a very sad statement. Cameron is very talented but he is not aware of his passion. This movie is a terrible disappointment and it is a shame that it was released in 1983.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I had no idea the movie was a re-telling of a book and this movie is terrible. I know that's an awful thing to say about a movie but I just can't take this movie seriously. It has the same kind of script that Twilight was trying to get away from.  The acting is very stiff and the plot is a load of crap. The movie tries to make a story about a woman who had to take a boy back to her parents. The girl, Lillie, does this on the back of the boy's father who is very controlling and wants the boy to get over her. Lilli ends up having to run away with the boy and the whole thing goes horribly wrong. I really don't know what happened in the movie and it is completely predictable. The writing in the script is awful and the acting is awful. It is completely un-original and I think that if the movie had a different director it would have been better. I wish I had never seen this movie because I just don't want to know how it ends.  I really don`t want to see this movie.   That's it for this week!

When the girls find out the guys are getting together, they just want to get out of the club and go home. So they get their friends to go with them. The two girls go in with the guys and the rest of the guys just leave. Then when the girls get to the guys' house, they all start talking and playing and then the guys get angry. This movie is not worth the time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  - The script is written so poorly it makes it impossible to believe the movie even exists.  The characters have no depth whatsoever, and there is not even one hint of a plot.    - The movie has a terrible cast, and almost no chemistry between any of them.    - The main character, a mute girl, is a complete fraud.  -  All the action scenes are so awkward, you don't even remember how you're supposed to feel after watching them. The cast:   The main character is called, "Doris", and she has a sister named, "Marianne", but the main character never talks to them. She lives with her parents in a small, rural town called,  "Dorinne", and her father owns a very small farm.  When she was very young, she suffered from polio and was left paralyzed, but, somehow, she managed to survive.  She became friends with a girl named, "Talia", but later, they got into an accident.  The accident was caused by a tractor, and both of them were severely injured.  As a result, they lost both their parents.  Doris' father then sold the farm to a farmer, who was a complete stranger to Doris, and he raised her alone.  But, one day, the man's daughter, Gina, comes to Doristne and asks Doris to help her family.  Tina is a beautiful, beautiful girl, and she is the one who made Doris feel at home.  While Doris is reluctant, she accepts the offer, and after a year, Tina leaves Doris and comes to live with Doris.  This is where the movie gets interesting.  It is a mystery about Doris's past.  We do not know anything about her family, or how she came to be crippled.  There is a picture in the beginning of Doris as a young girl, but we don't know who the woman is.  Some people think that she was a prostitute, but nobody knows anything about that.  Then, we get a story about a mysterious girl named Tina, who comes to the farm in the summer to find a friend.  Here is where things start to get a little weird.  From the very beginning, we know that Doris has a lot of trouble understanding people.  In the beginning, she
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ರೃ  "The guy who played the bad guy is a douche, but the actress who played his wife is good. He is so bad that you can't believe the character he's playing. I guess they just put him in the role because they had to have a bad guy to make money."  - Anonymous reviewer on Bad Teacher (2000)  My opinion: ___________________________________________________________________________  This is the kind of film I think about when I think of "bad" movies: there's always a bad person. It's usually a guy. There are some women too, but they are always the object of his derision. I was particularly taken with his character, a tough-talking, no-nonsense, straight-talking father. He never gets caught, and never gets what he wants. It seems that he is always in a pickle. In one scene, he's sitting at a restaurant eating a meal with his wife. The wife, who he's just met, looks at him with such disdain that he's certain he's never going to get another woman. The scene ends with the wife saying, "You're such a bitch, you know." I found this scene quite disturbing, not only because it was a blatant example of rape, but also because it seemed like a character like this would never be able to find happiness. I also wondered if he really had found happiness. Perhaps he never did. The movie does end with the bad-guy character's death, but not before he's forced to watch a movie about him and his family. The film never tells us how this movie ends, but it seems that the bad man has somehow been freed from his torment. I'm not sure if he ever went to a happy place, or if he just got out of a pickled place. It does seem like the bad person, or the bad movie, or whatever, was released from the pickle and had to be released from his pickle too. I would like to think the bad people are released. It would give me a good laugh.  _____________________________________________________________________________  The film is really good. It starts with a lot of violence, then the bad guys get their comeuppance. The woman was really good, too.  and  (review of free movie "Bad Teacher")   A little on this film: ___________________________________  the bad teacher was a real
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I think that's the best way to describe the movie. A movie with a lot of hype and a lot to prove. Not a bad idea, but it was a lot more than what it turned out to be. I had heard a lot about the movie, but after watching the first 20 minutes, I just couldn't get into it. I was bored, and the script was boring. It was so slow. The movie felt like it was trying to tell the story of a very simple man, trying to prove himself. I'm not going to say it was bad. It wasn't. But it was boring and that's not the way a good thriller should be. It's not like it's some Hollywood movie, which is what it was. It just feels like a bad thriller. I would never buy this movie, and it was so disappointing. I don't know how this movie is still being made. It had such promise, but didn't live up to it.

The cast and crew have created a film that's both visually stunning and emotionally resonant. As you watch the story unfold, it is clear that the cast has done a wonderful job. The film is visually arresting, and features a stunning set design and a great performance from John Travolta."  9. 'Battleship' (1940)  This is a story about one man's quest to find out what really happened to his family.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There are no plot, no characters, no nothing. It just goes on forever with the actors going from one stupid joke to the next. The movie even gets stupid because of this. It takes the plot of a movie called "Frozen" and then just puts the characters into that movie. There is no development or reason for why these characters are in the movie. It is just a dumb movie with a bad cast. This movie should not have been made. The only thing good about it is that the music is awesome. It fits the mood of the movie very well.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It's not a very good movie." I don't think that is really true. This movie is a great movie, and I recommend it to anyone. It has great characters, great action, great special effects, and it really shows how important the "big" movies are. This is a movie that is so funny and so enjoyable. There are some pretty big laughs. This was a great time watching this movie with friends. It was like watching a movie with your friends, and being a part of it. The movie takes place in an alternate world where the only thing that really exists is money, and no one really knows about it. It is a place where everyone wants to be a billionaire, and everyone wants a "great" life. There is no such thing as being "poor". The movie shows how ridiculous this world is. There's no poverty or crime. It's just people being rich. It shows how a person with a large fortune and no idea what it is really does nothing, and gets a really small amount of money from the government, which he uses to make a really big movie. He ends up being the main character in the movie, which makes sense, since he is so rich. And it shows how everyone is a jerk to him, but he does everything in his power to make sure he gets what he wants. It really is just a really fun movie. I recommend watching it with a friend, and then you and your friends will all laugh. I also recommend watching this with a good group of friends. You will all have a good time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I'll never watch this movie again!" "My god, it's so boring!" "I think I'm going to go and see a scary movie." "Why does nobody seem to like this movie?" "What a stupid movie." And so on. The fact that the movie had no plot, no action, no mystery, just an endless series of boring scenes of boring people doing boring things, was actually a huge plus. It's one of those films that is just so damn dull that you can't help but find yourself enjoying it. The acting was bad, the costumes were awful, and the music was so bad it was almost as if they'd recorded it in a very, very poor quality studio and just edited it together. But the story was really not that bad. The movie starts off with a woman who is visiting her old college friend, and when she's gone, she decides to go to the campus and meet up with a girl that she's been thinking about. They're both just a bit too excited and too busy to care about anyone else. And then they decide to head to a restaurant for dinner and have a few drinks. The waitress is a complete fucking slut. It turns out that the two of them have been talking on the phone, and now that the woman has gotten away, she has to meet her friend. And the next thing you know, it is just like that scene in the last movie with the woman who walks into the club with her friend, only this time, the girl is there, and this time it is an accident. And we all know how that movie ended. The girl goes into a coma, and we never see her again. So we don't know what happened to her, but the story has already been completely forgotten. The story has been written in such a way that the mystery is just as far away from the movie as it is from the main plot. I guess the main reason that the plot isn't so interesting is because it's not even a plot. There is no mystery. And since the movie is so boring, I think that all of the mystery just gets lost in the noise. It doesn't seem to even be a real mystery because there is nothing to find out. There's no one who knows anything. And so we go back to the woman being in a coma. The woman gets out of the coma, but she has been dead for two years. So what's the story? What has happened

And the only reason that it is a good movie is because it has a strong theme.  But there is no one who cares about that.  The only good thing about this movie is that they used to use this film as a poster, and I wonder if they will still use this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ರೃ  There was a really cute girl who was the perfect friend. She never wanted to be with any other man, and was a very kind girl. But she didn't want to do this for a long time. One day, a guy came to her house and told her that he was her boyfriend. She felt something was not right with that. The guy didn't even seem like a person who was interested in her. He was wearing a red shirt and a pair of pants. She was very confused and didn't know what to do. The girl wanted to see her friend again, but her friend said she was busy. So the girl went back home and thought about it. After a while, she found her friend's picture on the internet. The friend looked a lot like her, and they both had a pretty smile. This made her feel a little bit better. She told her boyfriend she'd meet him later and said good bye. The next day, the boyfriend showed up. The first thing he said to her was "You should go to his place, the only one with a pool and a hot tub!" He was really a nice guy, and he asked her how it was in the room. He told her about the hot tub and the pool and how he had a massage table. She really liked this guy, but she wanted to find out more about him. The boyfriend got her to do something she had never done before. He had her take off her clothes, and she wasn't happy about it at all. The only thing she didn' like about it was that he had to touch her. She tried to push him away, but he was persistent. He touched her, but it wasn't the way she wanted. The best thing she felt in that moment was his hands on her. It made her body tingle, and her mind think of the worst possible thing. She wanted to run away, and that was the last thing she did. The whole experience was so bizarre that she didn´t want to talk about it anymore. She only thought about this guy as she walked home. She had a bad feeling about it and she was really confused. When she got home, she didn`t know what she wanted from the night. She went to her room and tried to think about it, but the only thing on her mind was her friend. Then she remembered that she had seen him again, and it
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. __________. ___________________________________________________________.  Review #4: A Boring, Boring Movie   I don't think there's much I can add to this. It's a Boring movie with some good actors. I can only say, there was not a single memorable line in this movie. It was very boring. You know what I mean, the character just don't say much, the action is the same, the plot is the most boring part of the movie, the romance is very lame, and everything is very cliché. I don't understand why they made a movie about a love triangle in a futuristic society, when there are so many other great stories to tell. The movie is about a woman, who falls in love with a man, who she met in an elevator and that was his first love, and he was also a girl that he met in a elevator. I mean seriously, this was like the first film you see in a space movie, it was very very boring, and they made it so that you only get to see the love triangle, but not the whole movie, and even then you only see half of it, and then they make it so you have to go back to the beginning and see it all again. The ending was so much more boring, it felt like a slap in the face to the people who watched it.   It was a shame that it was such a boring movie, because it had a lot of potential. There were a lot more interesting parts to the movie. But the writers and directors made it too boring and did not use it, so that we only got the boring part, and the ending was even more boring.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Do not listen to the reviewers. They are trying to ruin a good movie. The movie has nothing to do with me or with me being a bad person. It's about a woman that goes out for a long drive to visit her son in college. She ends up in a serious car accident, and wakes up in the hospital. This is the movie about the accident and the recovery. When she gets out of the hospital, she gets a job at a restaurant that has a great view of the freeway, and has to put up with the obnoxious manager. She is given a new car and a new job, but it doesn't seem to matter that she is an alcoholic and has a bad reputation. She gets a new boyfriend who helps her out, but is still not the man of her dreams. I would have liked to see more of the life she lived before the accident, especially when it was still in progress. This movie is a great way to get to know a little about the woman, her past, and the changes she went through after the accident. I highly recommend this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________  I think it's a very good movie. I have to admit that I wasn't too interested in it, but that's mainly because I didn't really understand what was going on. I think that the movie makes a good point, but I was really disappointed. The movie is very poorly made, but it does have a few good moments. It was pretty long, but not as long as you would think. It's probably a bit more than you would expect, especially for a short film. I liked the concept of this movie. The character of The Man was so different from the one I know from the TV series. I don't know how much of this was the director, and how much was the actor, but he didn't seem to fit with the character at all. I loved the music in this movie, but the ending is a bit sad. The only thing I think it was a bit bad was the movie's ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. The worst movie of all time, so bad I can't even think of how to write a negative. If this movie is about the love between a boy and a girl who is a boy (or the boy and his brother who are half-boy) why did they have to put in a boy in the girl's body? I don't know about you, but that's as if they just made a movie about the boy's love for a girl (or half-girl) and then made a half-half movie about that. So much wrong with this movie! The story has no plot, it's just about a girl's first love, and her dad trying to get her to go back to that girl. It's a really bad movie. The story doesn't make sense at all. I don.t know what the girl was thinking to do. She's so stupid and her love interest just seems to be an idiot. It doesn't take a genius to realize that she doesn't really want to go home. It makes no sense! It's just a really stupid movie. And the whole movie is really bad. You really have to see it to understand. It has no good parts, it just goes on and on and the actors are so bad. It was terrible. I'd never seen anything like it. I really don't recommend this movie to anybody! It has nothing to do with a movie or a person! It doesn'T have a plot, and it doesn't have anything to do! You don't really get a story, it'S just about two people who fall in love! It wasn't a good movie! I think I'll just leave it alone. I've seen worse, and this is the worst movie ever!

It was pretty much like a high school movie in a sense.  I've seen it a bunch of times and it never gets old. It isn't a great movie. But it's pretty good.  This is a movie I'd recommend.

All the actors who played the parts in this film are either too old to act or they have no acting skills at all. The main character in this is so over-the-top, it's ridiculous. I was so bored in this. I wanted to cry from the very beginning. It was very hard to see how much money was spent on this movie. The movie should have been renamed "Poverty". I just think they should have spent more money on making a good movie. It is really a shame that this movie was made. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a while. If you like bad movies, then this movie is for you. If this movie has a message then it was really not good.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  I've watched and enjoyed many a movie. I've even been lucky enough to have seen a good movie. However, I've never seen a movie that I can't watch again. I loved the first movie and was looking forward to this movie. Well, the movie was terrible. The characters were boring and they acted as if they had no other thoughts on their mind other than what was written in the script. The acting was horrible, the acting was bad and the acting is still bad in this movie! I felt like I was watching a bad television show. They did not need to have all these characters in this one movie. They could have gone to a different city. I just didn't care for the movie and can't wait to watch a good one! I gave this movie 3 out of 4 stars because the acting wasn't great and the plot was lame.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  "This movie is like a lot of others: it is a pretty good idea, and one that has the potential to be quite good, but the execution is so bad that you never get to see it through. It is a sad story about a father and son, about love, loss and the things that are worth trying to keep. The movie has many good points: it's very funny, it's a great look at the old west, and it has some great performances. However, the film does not have the imagination to do much with the ideas or the characters, so you never really get to experience the story, the characters or the world they inhabit. The story could have been a lot better. And the actors are not particularly good. I mean, it is kind of hard to be bad in this movie. And that's just the acting."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was an atrocious film. The story was a huge waste of time. This was a great story and the characters were very well developed. I would have liked to see a bit more in depth characterization. The acting was atrocious. The lead actors acted like idiots. The director was terrible and didn't have a clue about acting. The actors had no idea what was going on. The only thing that made this movie interesting was the music. It was really good. I think if you can't see it with the sound off you'll be disappointed. I'm not a fan of this type of movie and would have rather seen a movie like "Troy the Great" instead. If you want to see some real acting in this movie you'll have to look elsewhere. It really is a waste of money and it has nothing to do with any of the other films in the series.

Jordan's portrayal of Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War. I've seen it several times and it's been enjoyable. I just can't get behind his character. This is a story about a black man being turned into a white man. This seems like an insult to the true history of black people.  I'm black and have been through a lot. The only thing I see that makes this even more insulting is the fact that the Black Panther's real name is Wakanda. This gives the white man a huge advantage.  If a white person created a fictional character like Black Panther then why did they give him a black name?  I don't want to give any spoilers but it's a really bad movie. The film really tries to make it seem like the movie is a sequel to a comic book movie that is being released. The ending is just wrong.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ I didn't think I'd find myself watching this movie again. The last time I saw it was at a cheap theater in my college town, and I thought I'd be too scared to watch it again. But, I found myself wanting to see this movie. It had a great storyline, with many plot twists, and some really interesting characters. It was really good. But I was never impressed with the acting. All the actors were pretty flat. The only actor I liked was Michael Shannon. But this movie has a lot of plot twists and is very different from most other horror movies. I didn,t find myself liking the characters. I think the characters were not well developed and acted very badly. The plot twists were very surprising, and were all very well done. The characters were well thought out, but the actors did not have any good roles. I can see why this movie got so much bad reviews. I thought the movie was good and had some good story twists. I just don't think it was done well.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ The first time I watched the movie I was very confused by the title, and the whole concept of the film. The movie starts with a young girl (the character) being kidnapped and raped by a group of men. She is kept there by a gang of people who are interested in her, but there is a twist in this story. The men don't kill the girl, but they take her back to their home. She later awakens and she is not sure if she has been raped or not. It is at this point that a man comes in to save the girl. After a while the man is killed in a car crash, and his wife tells him that she is pregnant and that he is going to be the father of the child. It's very interesting that the movie was made in the 1960's and not in the 1990's. The plot and story line are very well done, and I would love to see a remake, but as it is now, it is not a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: **********This movie is a waste of time. The actors are terrible, and the story is terrible. I was very bored. I am glad to see that people were able to see this bad movie in a theater and laugh. The movie is about a man who is in a relationship with a girl. His friends make fun of him for dating a girl he doesn't like. When he tells them they tell him that she is a slut. The girl is very mean to him and the other guy makes fun of her for that. When the movie was over I felt sick to my stomach. I just couldn't stand to watch a movie with so much hatred and abuse. It was just not worth my time. I hope people watch this movie again so they will see that the woman is very smart and nice. It is so sad that people are so ignorant. This movie should be in a museum or a book. I wish people would watch movies like this. It will show you what is really in your heart. This is a great movie if you like movies about women and not just trash. This was the only movie I saw all night that had any value.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why is it that when a movie does a bad job at being a horror movie, the people who loved it are still complaining about the movie's badness? I really do not understand how someone can like a movie and hate the story. I've never read a review that had nothing good to say about this movie, and when I saw a movie that had a great premise and story, I had to see it. The movie does have some flaws, but I did not expect it to be this good. The story is a little slow, and there are some scenes that I thought were a little too long. But, it was still fun, and even if I did dislike the story, it still was a good movie. I don't really care about the story as much as I care about what happened to the kids, and the ending was awesome. If you want to see a movie with great story and great acting, this is the movie for you. And, if you want a good horror movie with a great plot, this movie is for you! I highly recommend it to all horror fans!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not in a bad way. The script was a joke and it was a huge waste of my time. The acting was terrible and the movie was filled with stupid action scenes and boring characters. The story was terrible as well. There were so many people in the movie that I thought they were actors. Some of them were actors who had to be there. There was a scene that I found hilarious. I never in a million years would have thought this would be a scene in a movie. I was sitting next to my brother who was watching it with me and the scene ended with me standing up and walking out of the theater. There are so many things that were wrong with this movie. The worst part is that there are tons of people who are going to see this movie and will probably see it in the theater and not want to watch it on television. I'm glad that my brother and I were able to get it for free so we could watch it at home. It is a waste of money and I really wish we would have seen it on TV and not spent so much money on it. We did enjoy watching it but it was very boring. We got a laugh out of watching the guy who was playing the bad guy try to get a date for the first time in the whole movie. He said it was the first date he had ever been on. It was pretty funny. I think it was an okay movie for the money but it wasn't good."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Best of Both Worlds" is a really bad movie that has no redeeming qualities. The whole story, in which an intergalactic war is fought on a planet in the future, is poorly executed. The movie begins with the introduction of two new characters. The woman is a strong, intelligent, and determined female character. The man is a short, cowardly, cowardly male character. He is in the military, and is a coward. He gets assigned to the planet Earth, which is a planet that is occupied by aliens. They have an entire fleet on the planet, and are determined to take it. The planet's people have been completely brainwashed, and all they want to do is destroy the planet and start a war with the aliens. This movie has been re-written many times. It is not very well written. There is some really bad acting, especially in the scene when the alien fleet is attacking Earth. The aliens have a large amount of computerized weapons that can shoot down any spacecraft, including that of a ship, in a matter of seconds. There are also many computerized creatures, such as the space men. The humans are totally under the aliens' control. This film has some really terrible special effects, especially the creatures that shoot down the spaceships. The film is so badly made, that the aliens really have a chance to win. The only way that the humans can win is if they use an anti-matter gun, which turns the earth into a desert, and the aliens into the planet's flora and fauna. The entire story is ridiculous. The people of Earth are constantly being threatened by the aliens, and never seem to have any weapons. This is a terrible movie. The actors did not have any charisma. They were not very good. This was a really horrible film. The best thing that I can say about it is that it has been made into a radio play by George Pal, which has been very popular in England. The story is even better than the movie. This radio play has a much better script, and a much more realistic plot. The most memorable scenes in the radio play are when the men are shot at, and when the space man tries to kill the people of earth.

He must now deal with a bad reputation and a bad past. He soon discovers that his new home may be more than he bargained for. This movie has some great acting and great characters, but it has a very bad plot and a very poor ending. It has a terrible beginning and is plagued by bad dialogue and a poor ending, so I won't rate this one too high. _____________________________________________________________________________________ (The film was shot on a budget of only $250,000, and most of the money was spent on the costumes.)

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________ The movie "The Crow" has been very successful at the box office. I enjoyed the film and the actors. I felt the film was entertaining and well done. The movie did not have many problems. The main problem I had was that the main character played by Richard Gere is too arrogant and self centered. His wife is a wonderful person and they are great together. The problem is that Richard Gére's character is too selfish and wants to get all the credit. When he finds out his wife is pregnant with another man's baby he wants to marry her. He wants to make a name for himself and I felt that was very selfish. When his wife and daughter ask if he really wants to go through with it he says yes. That was really sad to watch. Another problem I saw in the film is that the director and actors had an unfair advantage in the movie. The acting in the script and in the action scenes were excellent. However when the movie went into the dark comedy scenes there were some things that seemed a little unrealistic. I also found the way the movie was edited. There was a lot of violence in the picture. The editing of the movie seemed a bit strange to me. The violence in some scenes was exaggerated and the violence did not seem realistic. Overall I thought that the movie did a good job at showing a different side of the crow. It is a very good movie with good acting and good story telling.

I have seen it three times and I can't remember what the point of it was. I think it was a nice change of pace from the usual sci-fi/action movie. The only negative thing about this movie is the music. The music was terrible. It sounded like someone playing guitar in a garage. The sound of it being played was very repetitive. The movie was very well done. The acting was great and the effects were awesome.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's so bad that I can't even talk about it.  So bad that it is like a bad dream that comes to life in your mind and crawls around on your body and soul, trying to make its way back to you, like a terrible nightmare that will never go away.  So bad...  What a bad film it is.  It's such a waste of time and money that I cannot even write a positive review about it, but I will write one about what a terrible movie it is, because it is one of the most terrible movies ever made, and the only reason I can think of to make it is to put a smile on the face of the producers, but the only thing I could think of was to make money from it, and it does that.   The movie takes place in the 1950s, and all the main characters are actors, and none of them are the ones that we all know and love.  The one that is supposed to be the most popular of them all is a guy called "Johnny" who is supposed be very popular in the whole world, and he is one in a million in every way.  This guy is a big actor and has a great body, and is so handsome, that he was never going to be a big star like the others.  But this time around, he has been fired from the movie studio, and now has to go on a road trip to Hollywood.  So of course he wants to be famous, and of course the movie is there to help him, because the movie stars are famous all over the world and it is just a matter of time before they all start talking to each other about this guy, and how he has changed their lives.  However, it all starts going wrong when the guy comes across a hitchhiker, a hitch hiker who looks very much like him.  And then the guy starts to see things in a completely different way, and starts to realize that he is not the guy he thought he was, and there is no way that he can ever be the guy that everyone else thinks he is. And that is when the movie takes a turn for the worst.  At this point in the movie, the guy is seeing things in the best possible way, but that only makes it harder for him to get to the Hollywood studios, because he has to deal with the negative thoughts and feelings that come with seeing things from a
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ This is a horrible movie. The acting was awful. There was no plot. There were no characters. The only thing this movie has going for it is the fact that it is a film from the 70's. I thought it was supposed to be about a man who went to a psychiatrist to help him and ended up having sex with a girl he was trying to help. Instead it was about a boy who went into the mental institution and ended being the one who slept with the psychiatrist. The movie is only 8 minutes long. I have seen a lot of 80's movies and I never saw anything like this before. This movie was really terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ I really enjoyed this movie. I was hoping for something more with the action. I had not seen a movie like this since The Bourne Supremacy. The plot is not as good as the last one, but it is still worth watching. I liked the characters in this movie and the action is very well done. If you like the James Bond movies, you will enjoy this movie as well.  The Best of the Bourne Series   Rating: *****   Writer(s): David Webb Peoples, George P. Cosmatos  Director: Martin Campbell   Plot:   A new recruit, James Bourne, is sent to an elite spy school in Europe. Bourne's training is interrupted by a mysterious threat from within the school.   This movie has a really good plot and a good character.  - The plot was interesting, but not too deep.  ...   - The acting was good. The main character, James, was very good.     -...  - I think the action scenes were very good in this one.   a great movie to watch!  Great movie!   Summary:   The movie starts off with an interesting and cool opening scene. The film takes place in Europe and it shows a different side of James. He is very quiet, which is very refreshing. After training in the academy, James heads to an underground bunker where the threat comes from. The action scenes are very good and are not boring. There are a lot of action sequences in this film. This is the best of the James Bournes in my opinion. There is also a great ending, which shows that Bourne is a very smart and talented man. I enjoyed this film a lot!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a huge fan of James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy movies.  I've watched them all, including the first movie, three times, and I've had the opportunity to talk with him about it and he has been a great source of information.  The first movie was a great introduction to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and now that the second one is out, I'm going to go back and watch it again.  It's still one of the best movies I've ever seen.  As for Guardians of The Galaxy Vol. 2, it was great and fun to see the characters we love in action.  However, as with the first film, it suffers from the same problem of a story that is too predictable.  There are so many things that could have been done better with the plot of this film.  A lot of the characters that were introduced in the first one were still left to die off in this movie.  This was a real shame because the first two movies had great chemistry between the characters.  Also, there was not a lot of action in this film because most of the action was taken up by the big bad alien, which is one of my favorite characters in the Marvel universe.  Finally, there were too many scenes of pointless exposition.  While it was good to know who was in the Avengers and who wasn't, it was a bit boring to have it explained over and over.  On a final note, I would recommend this movie to fans of Guardians of Galaxy.  If you are not a fan, this movie will leave you wanting.  Guardians of THE Galaxy Vol 2 will make you want more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________   I didn't know what to expect from this movie, but I was very pleased when I found out that the film was not only a documentary but also a comedy.   The film follows the story of four friends in the 1950's. The four friends are the first generation of "daddy-o's" and their friends are their children.   a story about how these kids deal with the pressures of the 1950s and what they do to survive.   it shows how the kids cope with all of the pressures. It shows how they cope with their parents, who are always trying to be a good role model to them.   and it shows them coping with their siblings, who all try to help them in some way.  , it also shows them dealing with their older brothers and sisters.   of course, they have their own problems.  This film is a wonderful story. It's a great movie.   "Daddy-O" has a great message about the 1950-60s and how we cope with it. It deals with all the problems we have as a generation, and how the family deals with it in the family.   The film is very funny and has lots of great songs that I love.   the film has a real good story that you will not regret seeing. It is definitely worth seeing. I highly recommend this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! It was not a bad film, but a really bad film. It was a very bad idea to try to show a movie that has a strong plot in a science fiction story and a bad script. It didn't work. I mean it is a science fictional story about a spaceship in deep space. It has an excellent script. The characters are well-written and the science-fiction plot is solid. It is not like a movie where the main characters are only in it to have sex with other people. I don't think you should see this film unless you are interested in seeing a very poorly written sci-fi movie. I guess that is why they gave it a PG rating. This movie was really bad.

The acting was terrible. There was so much bad acting that it was hard to follow along with what the actors were saying. They were so far out of character and the dialogue was so awkward that it became hard to take it seriously. The plot was also so unbelievable that I found it hard to believe the characters were real. I was just as shocked as everyone else. The characters were just so stupid and the plot was so unbelievable. If you want to see a bad bad movie, this is it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" (1966)  The first time I saw this film, it was just after it was released, and I was so young, and so ignorant, and my mother didn't allow me to see anything before it was on TV, and it was such a great movie.  I think I remember hearing that it was based on a true story, but it was a real long time before I found out about the true story. The true story is, that in the 1930's, a lot of gangsters were shot and killed in mob hit-men jobs. They were just shot, and their bodies were thrown away. One of them was an Irish man named Joe Donohue, who was a member of the Irish mob.  "The Good" (Robert Ryan) was one of those men, and his body was found in the trash, along with the rest of the gangsters. It was a horrible, terrible thing, and the movie shows it. .... I've seen many, many movies where a mobster is shot in the head, and then thrown into a dumpster, and they are left to rot. This movie shows what that would look like, if you are talking about human beings. This is a true crime movie, and a really great movie, in my opinion. "The Bad" (James Caan) is a great character, and you see him do a lot in this movie..  . I was actually in a restaurant in Chicago the day before this movie was released. And there were all these people, and all these families, and some of them had come from other parts of the city, and wanted to see this movie because they were told it was good. And all the time, in the background, you can hear people talking about the movie. And it really got into the people's minds that this was something that really happened.  to hear about a movie that has not yet been released. I just got to see it on video at a video store in Hollywood. I have not seen the movie in 20 years.. It's a great film, and very well made.. I have seen the original film, but I am not familiar with it.. A lot of the things that they say that are said in this film are true.  that's a movie about gangsters..  of course, they are going

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ I am a big fan of science fiction and fantasy, and the first time I watched the movie I thought this was going to be a really cool movie with an amazing story. But it was so bad that I felt like I was watching something in a different movie, not a real one. The plot was bad, and it felt like there was a whole bunch of plot holes and stupid decisions made. Also the acting was not very good. The acting in this movie was awful. They did not do a very good job at acting. They had no idea what they were doing. They made the characters look stupid, and they acted like they were bored. The only good thing that came out of this movie is the special effects. They were really well done. There were some really cool stuff in the movie. I thought the movie was a little long. But that was not because the plot was so stupid. It was just because they didn't know how to make a movie that was fun to watch. I am sorry to say that this movie did not live up to the hype. I do not think it will be remembered in the future, and I don't think that it will get a sequel.  Overall rating: 3/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very bad movie that should not be seen. The story was very poorly developed and the actors are not good. The director had nothing to work with and he tried to make a cheap horror film that was just a lot of bad acting and cheap special effects. This is not a good movie and should not have been released. The only good thing about this movie is that you can laugh at the bad acting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "In this film the director was not afraid to have an epic story with a large cast of actors, but the story was so bad that he couldn't make it interesting for us, the audience. We just watched the main character and the villain being tortured by a group of thugs. The movie was so long that it just dragged on. The script was boring and it just didn't have anything to do with the main story, or with the characters. It was a very simple story that had no twists and turns."

Part 1:      This movie has a lot of bad guys, but not enough of them.  I mean, they had a bunch of characters, but only 2 of them actually do anything.  The main villain is the one who is doing the torturing.  He is the most interesting and fun character in the movie.  It was interesting to see him tortured, because he was not only the main villain, but he also seemed to be the most evil and ruthless person.  Part 2  - The main character is still not a good guy, but now he has a secret to hide.  Even if the movie tries to be good, it can't hide the fact that this guy is still a complete idiot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film which has had some decent reviews, but has also had some bad reviews.  It is a very fun film to watch.  If you want to see a movie with a good cast, a decent plot and a good director, this is a good movie.  The story of this film is a simple one.   The protagonist, Mr.  George Kapp, is an old schoolmate of a young girl,   named      Alice (Maeve Higgins).   She has just moved to London and has been asked by her mother to look after Mr. Kapp's nephew, a boy named   Bertram (John Depp).  George and Alice become friends and fall in love, but she has to move back to England because her mother died.  After Alice leaves, George starts to have strange dreams about Alice and when he wakes up, he is dead.    His son, Bertram, and his sister, Sarah (Mia Wasikowska), move in with him, but George refuses to leave his old life behind.  A few years later, George meets a woman named  Mia (Helen Mirren) who is an actor.  It is soon clear that the two are meant to be together.  And while that is going on, Bert is still searching for Alice.  While the film is not very deep, it is enjoyable.  You get to know a little about the characters, their lives and their love lives.  I think the best part of the film comes from the performances.  Some of the performances are very good and some are not.  Mia Wasikowski, a British actress, is great.  She gives great characterisation and is believable.  Maeve Higgins is also great. She does a great job as Alice. She is not overly bright, but her actions are always logical.  John Depp is great as Bertram. He is a bit of a loner and not very bright, which gives him a bit more depth.  All the actors have good chemistry. The film is very well made and the cinematography is superb.  My only issue with the film was that I thought it was too short.  There are a few good moments and a couple of good scenes, but the film does not leave much of a lasting impression.  At the end of the day, this movie is a fun ride and

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Download  This year, the year of The Force Awakens, is already a year that has been full of disappointment. The Star Wars films have had so much promise that even the worst reviews have been largely positive. But the latest installment of the saga is not so much a bad film as a bad time for the franchise.  In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, director J.J. Abrams is not shy about admitting that he was unsure of the direction he wanted to take the franchise at the start of production. "We started off thinking we were going to do a movie that was a bit more grounded," Abrams said. "But in the process of making this movie we found that it wasn't a very grounded movie at all."  Abrams explained that the film is "slightly less focused on the Star Wars universe than the previous two," and "it's not going to be set in that universe anymore." But the director didn't explain what changed in the Star Trek universe that made it a more grounded universe. Perhaps he should have said he found the Star War universe too grounded, which would have made more sense. Abrams also admitted that he had "a lot of anxiety" when he started working on the film.  the Force Awakens is a film that's not all that interesting in the first place. Abrams spent so much time trying to make his version of the original trilogy work that it's difficult to say if the director has any idea how to make the next one. The first Star Wars film has been compared to Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the second movie to Raiders but there's very little similarity in tone between the two movies. The film's story is basically a prequel to the original Star Wars movie, and it's not the story that made me fall in love with the original movie. Instead, the movie is very disappointing. The characters are flat and boring, and I found the acting and acting design to be extremely underwhelming. Even when there are moments of humor or excitement, they aren't worth the runtime.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  1. The House with a Clock in Its Walls (1943)  A great movie. It's an adaptation of a book by the same name by English writer and journalist Robert Harris, and tells the story of a family who loses a house and is taken in by a friendly stranger. He helps them out of financial hardship and gets them back on their feet.  But the movie, as a whole, is so badly shot that it is almost incomprehensible. The dialogue is so choppy and incomprehensible that I was afraid I would never understand it. It also lacks a certain kind of charm that makes the story captivating.  I thought it would be a good idea to post a list of movies that were badly shot, and here's my top 10. They are all either bad or not that good, but the bad ones can still be enjoyable to watch. So here goes.  and I'll end with a quote from the book, "The house with a clock in its walls had been a large, flat, dark, very white and empty house. It had been built in the early fifties on a small hill, and when it was destroyed in a fire, the town built a new house on the hill."  Advertisements

I can't believe I've been watching it for the last six months. It's a terrible story about a group of guys who have to survive a hostile country by finding food and avoiding being eaten. It starts out good enough, with all of them finding the food they need, but then they all get killed, one by one, and the movie starts falling apart.   The acting in this movie is terrible. The actors all seem to have a very different personality. The lead character is so boring that it's a wonder anyone ever wanted to watch the movie. And there are so many scenes where I just wanted to cut my head off. This movie has been a long time coming. This is a story that has been passed down in the family for generations, and this is the last generation that has ever seen it, but the film company wants to make a movie about it.   of all the terrible movies I've seen, this is one of the worst.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was so bad it's almost funny.  The director made this into a'mockumentary'.  It's a poorly made documentary that attempts to be a documentary about a man with autism.    It has no plot, no dialogue, no characters, no plot.  The acting in this movie was so horrible, the only reason this movie has a small budget was because it was all done by the same person.  The man with the autism and the woman with the same autism had the same voice actor, and the actress playing the woman who's husband is in love with her has the same hair.    I was laughing throughout this movie and I thought that it was going to be good.  However, the end of the movie was ruined by the horrible acting.  It wasn't bad enough to be funny, it was just horrible.  When they are getting on the bus, they were laughing at each other about a thing that they saw on the internet.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________ _________________________________________________________ I'm a huge fan of The Hobbit (I love the book too) and thought that Peter Jackson's adaptation of the books was wonderful. I thought he made it look and feel like a big screen movie. However, I did not enjoy the film as much as the book. For one, I didn't like the way it ended. In the book, it is a lot more ambiguous. It could have been very good if it was. I felt like there was too much left out of it. This movie ended with a cliffhanger and then we never see what happens next. I was hoping for more. It didn't feel like there were enough scenes in the book to do that. It just felt like they didn't want to let it go. In fact, I thought there was way too much going on in this movie to do the movie justice. There were a lot of characters, but they didn a lot too much. They were trying to cram a lot in too quickly. There was a lot going on that didn't make sense to me. I just don't think that it had the right ending. I also think they should have done more with Gandalf. He was supposed to have an even bigger role in the film, but he only got about 1/3 of it and he wasn't the most important character. I'm also not sure what they were trying with the Dwarves. I think they did a great job in the movie, but I just thought they didn "t do a very good job." I think it was kind of boring. I mean, we all know how good they were in the movies, but the movie didn't have that feeling. I didn' t enjoy the movie at all. The acting was ok. I enjoyed the music a little too. It was good. The writing was not good. I found the story confusing. I couldnt figure out how to get to the end. I did like the special effects, but that was about it. Overall, I just didn't enjoy the book and the movie.

It is not the worst movie I have seen in a long time but it was the most annoying one I have ever seen. There is a lot of sex scenes in this movie. The movie has a lot to offer but the sex scenes is really irritating. I would like to give this movie a 4 but I think that I can't. This movie is a great way to get a sense of humor out of a comedy. If you have a weak stomach and can't take the nudity and the sex, then I would say don't watch this movie because you will end up very irritated. I think it is a good movie to watch if you are bored and looking for something to pass the time.

The hero is a woman, named Lorna. Lorn is an ordinary woman who is taken captive and kept in a room by a man named John. John is an evil man and Lorn has to try to escape from him. The movie takes place in a prison and the people who work there are horrible. They treat the prisoners like they are nothing and don't give them any help. There is one scene in this movie where the prisoners are eating and one of the prisoners is holding a man's hand. This man is a hero, he has a broken arm and is in a wheelchair. The man tells the woman that he is a good man and the man that has the broken arm is a bad man and a coward. When he is talking to the woman she has a knife in her hand. When the man takes the knife she says, "It is my knife. I used it to kill a man." The movie doesn't make any sense, it's very hard to understand. It's like something out of a horror movie. I don't know how they can have a movie like this, this is terrible. The special effects are awful and they are not done well. There are some scenes in this film where the special effects don't look real. The worst scene in the movie is when the prisoner escapes and Loreda tries to catch him. She throws him into a window and he falls down and breaks his leg. This part of the movie was horrible. It was very difficult to watch and there was nothing I could do to stop it. The only thing that made the movie more funny was when John is giving the prisoners their food and the prisoners were laughing at them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I'm not sure where to start. This movie is an insult to all of the talented people at Dreamworks. I could see the movies and the talented actors in the movies, but the director was a total disgrace. It was terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have a difficult time believing that this is a good movie, or that the people who made this movie are good people. The acting is bad, the directing is bad (the movie is shot in black and white with a greenish tint and with a very soft sound mix), the dialogue is bad and the music is bad. This is a movie that doesn't even seem to try. The film is boring, it is not well directed, it has no suspense, and it is boring to look at. There is nothing that I would have thought would make a good horror film. If you want to see a good film that tries to be scary but is boring you can find it on TV.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________.  I will keep my review short and sweet, and this review is going to be spoiler free. The movie is great. I have a huge problem with how the movie was released. It was in limited release, and I didn't see it until a week later. It's really sad that it was in a limited release. It wasn't that bad of a movie, I'd say it was one of the better ones out this year. It has it's ups and downs, but it doesn't lose it's quality for the whole time. The acting is really great, the writing is really good. It will take you out of your seat and make you go "hmmm what was that?" This movie is a must watch. Posted by J. M. R. Martin on Mar 8th, 2016 at 10:56am  It was just announced today that Martin will write the next novel in the A Song of Ice and Fire series after his short story collection, A Feast for Crows, will be published in May. Martin will continue the saga of his "Game of Thrones" trilogy, with an eighth book due in July, 2016. The book will be titled The Winds of Winter and is based on the last two books in the series. Martin says that he hopes the book will make readers "question everything they thought they knew about A Song Of Ice And Fire." Martin says, "The Winds of winter will answer some of the big questions of the series: What happened to Bran, and how is he doing now that Jon Snow is dead? Who is going with Jon Snow? How is he and his direwolf, Ghost, going to survive when everyone else has been killed? What will happen to Jon Snow's bastard children?" He adds, "I'm very proud of what we've done. I think the fans are going to love it, and it will answer a lot of the mysteries of the books." Martin's next novel, A Dream of Spring, will follow. He says, The Winds Of Winter is "the first in a new trilogy, A Song For Lya." The final book in the trilogy, The Dragon And The Wolf, is expected to be published later this year, in early 2017. Martin also confirms that there are plans to make a Game Of Thrones TV series. He adds "I think HBO and David Benioff and D.B. Weiss are going make a good show. They're very experienced at telling

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  The whole thing is an absolute nightmare.   - It's about an idiot who is so stupid he just follows his girlfriend around.  .  - The whole thing starts with him and his girlfriend getting in a car accident, and he gets his girlfriend to tell him where they are and that they are ok. , and then he ends up getting a phone call from his girlfriend that tells him they have been in a terrible car accident and are ok but are not sure how they got in the car. And then it cuts to the guy's house, and there is a door that is ajar that leads to the basement where his girlfriend's body is. And he says that the girl is probably still in there and that he's not sure what's going on. And the next thing he knows he's in the basement of the girl's house. He tries to go into the girl and she's not there. Then he goes into the garage and sees a motorcycle with a bloody girl on it and then there's a huge explosion and it's all in slow motion and he wakes up and it turns out that his girlfriend is dead and he's going crazy. The next thing that he knows, he's a prisoner in the girl' house, locked in the room that the body of his girlfriend was in and he sees a bunch of pictures of her. And when he asks her why she's there, she tells him that the motorcycle accident was a big accident. And it was a huge accident because they were both drunk, and when they got into the motorcycle they couldn't control it and they went off the road and hit a tree. And that's when they ran into the tree, and the girl ran into a tree and the motorcycle fell on top of her, and that's what killed her. The next thing I know, I'm a prisoner, in the house, chained to the wall and the girlfriend is outside, and I have no idea what's happening, but the girlfriend tells me that I need to tell the police, so I do, and they tell me that they're going to make me watch TV all night, and make me clean the bathroom, and have me go to the library and look up the story about the girl that died. And I'm really freaking out, I have to keep my eyes on the TV and not look up anything. - But then there are flashes of the TV, and pictures of the police. And a
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________. The reason you will not like this movie is because the movie is a ripoff of a popular film, but it's better than the original. It's a different type of comedy and it's a lot of fun to watch, but the acting and directing are so bad, the story is completely the same. It doesn't matter what you think about the movie, because the way the story was written and the acting was done is wrong. I'm not going to go into detail on the plot because it's just awful. But the way they are trying to make it about an 80's movie is wrong and I don't think it will be good for anyone to see this movie. I hope you will get bored of this movie very soon.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!!The worst movie ever made!!!! I am a fan of horror films and had just seen a preview of this movie for the first time on a movie channel. The trailer was so good and the cast and director did a great job with the movie but after seeing the movie I realized it was a big joke. This movie was a rip off of another movie. I was shocked because I thought it was one of the best movies of the year. The actors were very bad and the movie was just made up for the movie and it wasn't a good movie at all. It was just like a movie about a clown or a ghost with a knife and it was just horrible. There were no screams or blood or anything like that. I can't believe it and I will never watch a movie with such terrible acting again. I just want to leave a good review about this movie and say this movie will be in my top ten list. I will not watch a horror movie again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!!  What can I say, I really liked this movie, but it has many issues that make it hard to watch. There are things I don't like about it.  I do think that the movie is entertaining, but I think there are a lot of issues that come up that are just hard to understand. I was expecting a lot more from this movie.  of all the movies I've seen, I thought this was the best. It's a great movie and I can see how it's going to be very well received. It was very entertaining. The acting was very good and I felt like I really got to know the characters. It took me a while to get into the movie, and that was a good thing. The ending was a bit rushed and I don a bit annoyed with it. The characters were so interesting and you get a sense of who they are. I think they all grow on you over the movie. I did not expect that the actors would act so well and there are some very good ones. I am really excited for the sequel, and I hope that it will be better than the first movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ ______________ _______________  There are some good movies out there that you shouldn't go to just for the story. There are some movies that you should definitely go to for the acting. For instance, you should go to see "Fargo" just because of the acting, not the plot. But if you are a "good" movie-goer, you might want to go to "Taken". You should see "Benny" just for a good laugh. If you are really going to see a bad film, you need to see the film of "Cemetery of Splendour". It's a film with an amazing plot and great acting. The acting is so good that the story of the film is not so interesting. But, it is still a good movie.  I've been to see movies that I would rather not go to. For example, I didn't go because I don't like to go with kids. I would much rather go to a movie with kids or to a good romantic movie. I'm not going to be a bad person and tell you that a bad romantic movie is better than a good romance movie. And a bad comedy is better that a good comedy. I just don't think a movie can have a good plot if it is not good at acting. A good story is better and a bad story is worse than a bad romance. So, if you want to see bad romance movies, go see "Romeo Must Die" or "The Wedding Singer". If you want a good "bad" comedy movie, go watch "Funny People" or a "Crazy Stupid Love" or any of those two. If a bad action movie, don't go see a movie called "Clueless". You will just be disappointed. 1 of 2 Add photo
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why would anyone want to watch this? It's horrible, poorly written, and poorly acted. A girl who was a big star in the 80s has a horrible turn in this movie. I just didn't care for her character, and I don't want to waste my time watching this. The only thing good about this movie is the great score by Richard O'Brien. But the rest of the movie sucks, including the acting and the direction.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!! (no, really, they should have never released it) This movie was terrible! It was so bad that even a 4/10 is still way too low. It was just so bad, and I'm just a poor poor man, that I couldn't watch it even with a friend. There are things I just don't get from it, such as why in the world would they use a film of this quality to promote their own movie. It just made me hate them even more, and this movie only made me even more hate them. The acting, acting, and acting was all bad, so bad in fact that it was embarrassing to watch, and it was bad because they couldn't act. Not because they were all bad actors, they were just all awful, and even worse, the characters didn't have any personalities at all. The characters just kept saying the same things, with the same bad acting and just made no sense at all, but they kept trying to act like they were funny and having a good time, when they were actually just annoying, boring, and just annoying. The movie even had one of the most embarrassing and awful endings ever to a movie, with all the characters acting in a stupid and annoying way and then the movie just ends, with no explanation what happened to them, or what they were trying to do, and then I just felt sad and angry for them all because they could have had such a good life, if they had just kept their stupid heads down and stayed in school. They should just have been out in the real world doing what normal people do, not in the movie world, pretending to be good people. It's really sad that they wasted all that money and time making this stupid movie. I just wish they never made this movie, and that they never released a film that was this bad ever again. I'm really surprised they didn't sue them, because I think it was a horrible decision to make. If they were so good at making movies, they would have kept on doing what they do best. And they don't do that very well, because they never take any chances with their movies, and always make them very safe.

There are no twists, no interesting characters, no good action, nothing. _______. If a movie has a main character with no redeeming qualities, it is no good. This is an un-funny film that has no redeemating qualities. The writing is horrible. The dialogue is stupid. The story is bad and stupid. There is no mystery to the plot. There isn't even a plot. I was just hoping this was a movie for some kids. ______________________________________. I don't think I will ever see this movie again. The script is horrible, and it takes a long time for anything to happen. If this was meant to be a kid's movie, then why is it about a 14-year old? There is only one scene that really interests me, but I can't watch that. This just is a stupid, un-original, uninspiring film that is poorly written and poorly acted. ______________________________.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: *********** This was a bad flick. It was good at times but the plot was not interesting at all. The only good part of the movie was when it was on a roller coaster and they made a song out of it but the movie would have been better if they had gone with a different song. The actors did not look their best and did not do their jobs. This is a terrible movie and should never have been made. I'm a fan of John Travolta but this movie is not worth watching. It would have made a better movie if the plot had been changed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _______________ ___________ _________ _____________ ______________ ____________ ________ ________ ______ _________. This is my review of the movie "Hitchcock", starring James Stewart and Joan Fontaine. My wife and I watched this movie last night at my house. I saw it with a group of people and there were many laughs in it. I have not seen this movie in years but thought I would watch it again. The story was very interesting. I was not impressed with the acting and the plot. The movie was so long that it was hard to keep track of what was going on. It was really confusing. My son is 4 and he was about 6 when this movie was made. This movie is very old and probably was made when Stewart was 50 years old. This is probably one of his worst movies. He was a good actor but he really could have done better in this movie. There were several scenes in the movie where Stewart was really acting like an old man. It is a shame that the director didn't give Stewart some more time to do his thing. This could have been a great movie. It wasn't a bad film but it wasn't very good either. I am glad that I saw this movie again but I wouldn't have seen it if I hadn't seen it. If you like Stewart, you should give this one a try. I gave it a 1. I would give it a 2 if I could but I can't give it more than a 1 because it is so confusing. If your looking for a good movie, give it try. It's not that great but I think you'll enjoy it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________   It's not a bad film, it just isn't that good. This film is not that good, and it is not good at all. It's not even that bad, and this film is the worst one of the three, but it's still the worst of the trilogy, by a considerable margin.   The story of this film begins with a great scene. The first time you see the movie, you're in a forest, and a lone man and his horse are walking. He sees a bird fly in front of him, and he picks up his sword. The bird flies away, and then he notices a large creature, which looks like a large lizard. He runs towards it, and when he reaches it, the creature starts to eat him. He's able to get away, but the creature is after him, but not before he gives it a sword and the rest of his clothes. The creature gets away.  .   I found this scene to be interesting, and I liked it. I was really surprised at the film, because this scene is pretty far removed from the rest, and you'd think that it was going to be some sort of epic battle or something. It just wasn't. It didn't have anything to do with the story, or the characters, or anything else. It wasn't even that interesting. The only reason I liked this scene was because I was impressed with the visual effects in this movie. They were incredible.   "This is the most expensive movie I have ever made."   After the creature eats the man, he gets away, he runs, he finds a tree, and runs in the tree. The tree gets destroyed, and the man falls off the tree, but he gets up, and gets the sword out. He gets up to go back, but then he sees a big, black, monster fly by. He looks at it, it turns around, and shoots the man.   for a moment.   to kill the man with its sword, and its other appendages.  , and kills him. It then eats the body, and starts to fly away. This is really, really confusing. The movie is supposed to be about the creature, and what the man does to stop it from killing him. This scene is really confusing, and doesn't really make sense. You can't figure out anything from this scene, and don't know how to think about it.   and it's

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  "This is not an easy film to watch, nor is it easy to discuss. The film has some interesting ideas about war and war-time behavior, and the action sequences are well done, and they make for an interesting viewing experience. The problems with this film start in the dialogue, and then proceed to the plot itself. The dialogue is often repetitive, and in many places, it is rather silly. The only thing that made me laugh out loud were the scenes where the actors were dressed in a ridiculous manner. The acting is very bad, and I found myself not caring about the characters at all. The movie is about a young officer, who is being given command of a German platoon on a mission to destroy a bridge at a river crossing. His platoon is made up of mostly rookies, and he is sent with them to a bridge, which is to be taken by the enemy. When they arrive at the bridge, they are surprised to find that it is not under enemy control, but rather under a bridge-keeper, who does not believe the Germans will be able to hold the bridge. When the Germans take over the bridge (which is a fairly easy task), they find it has been fortified, and that the enemy has planted mines all along it, which the Germans can easily jump on. When a mine detonates, and kills one of the soldiers, the other soldiers are forced to take cover. A few days later, the Germans attack, and one of their tanks is knocked out by the mine. The soldiers try to push the tank out of the way, but it does not move. After the Germans push past the mines, the men realize that they are unable to take over control of the bridge by force, and have to wait for the bridge-keepers to arrive, who will be coming to the bridge from the opposite bank. When it does, the bridge is blown up, and it is up to the Germans to recover the captured bridge, while the soldiers try not to be blown up by the mines. I could go on and on about the problems with the script and the acting, but I think it is better to let a film stand on its own. I give this a one star rating, for the sake of completeness.

If that's your thing, then I'm sorry.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________  There are some movies that just go into your head and you never forget it. The Matrix is one of those. You sit there in your home and it becomes so real. I just saw the movie recently and it still gives me chills. So here is my review for the movie. First off it was a long time ago, in the 80's, and it was one of the first big blockbusters that got a lot of press. I was a kid when it came out and my brother and I saw it a bunch. I remember it being in theaters in my high school. I loved it. There were a lot things that I liked about it. They took the first three Matrix movies and gave them a new coat of paint and it turned out to be a really good movie. I didn't know that this was going to be the movie that I would love the most. I thought it was going be something else. I don't know if it was the idea of Neo, or if it is what he went through, but the idea was great. It is about what it takes to change a person. And that is something that is hard to change. It was not the best film but it was an amazing movie. The movie was so good that people went to see it again and again and it became a cult classic. I think it was because it was in theaters so often. I would see it in the theater once a month. It really was a great movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!   So, I love this movie! I loved it so much. It was so good. It had great characters. The acting was great. The music was great too. It even had great visuals! And it was so well-written. It made me want to do something good for the world. I just can't understand the hatred that many people have. If it was any other movie I would have loved it.   I love it. I really love it!!!   "We are the guardians. We will watch over this planet and do whatever we must to protect it. We are the only thing standing between a million of the most powerful and cruel beings in the universe. We have the power. We know the truth. We see the truth and we will speak the truth until we are forced to speak the truths. The time is now. We must act. And act fast. We may not be able to change things. But we can help. And we can save ourselves. And save all of us." - Captain John Sheridan, from Star Trek: The Next Generation: Nemesis   It is a classic. It is a movie I will always love. The way it portrays humanity in its best light and the way it shows the true struggle of being human is what keeps me coming back to this movie over and over. It's just so good!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Why can't we see all these amazing films at once? It seems like we're getting more movies with less and less quality. I'd rather see a great movie like The Matrix, then a crappy movie like Black Hawk Down, and I'd love to see a movie with great performances like Gladiator. Maybe we should just give up and just watch these films in a series. Or maybe we should all just buy a bunch of Blu-ray movies and make our own DVD sets! I like Blu-rays.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ A little boy watches his father play a game on the floor in front of him. He doesn't know what is going on, but his father makes the sounds he heard as if it were a movie, and he keeps repeating what he heard. He looks in the room where he is watching and sees his father playing the game, but there is no one there. He is afraid that he is going to get hurt and runs out of the room. The next day, he tells his mother that he saw something in the closet and ran away. The boy then gets very sick. He thinks that he has been poisoned by his father and asks the doctor to look at him. The doctor says he can't help him. At this point, the boy starts to lose his mind. He has the same dream every night. He goes out in the garden and looks at a piece of a piece in the sand and he sees the face of a man. He starts to scream in his sleep. He gets to his feet and runs into the room, where his mother is sleeping. He sees a mirror and thinks he sees himself staring back at him and he is crying. He then sees his mother standing there, dressed in a beautiful dress. He begins to cry even more and runs outside into the garden. He cries and runs and runs until he runs into a large flower pot, where he thinks he can get help. He reaches in and pulls out the piece of the sand. He holds it in his hands and begins to walk away, but he stops and looks in at the piece and the face, and starts to cry. The mother's face appears on the mirror. She looks in on the child and smiles at him, and then turns her back to the child, leaving him to his misery. He runs away and begins calling for help, and at this point he gets help. The film is an eerie and scary tale. It's a wonderful movie that will haunt your dreams.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  Worst of the Worst is a movie about two guys that are trying to sell a movie to a movie company, but they're not really good at their job. One of them is an idiot, the other is a genius. The movie starts with a stupid joke, and the guys decide to put their best efforts into it. This is a stupid movie. But then it goes down a road of stupidity. It's really hard to watch. The guys keep making the same mistake over and over again, and they just can't get it right. I really thought the movie was going to be a lot of fun until I saw the credits roll. The whole time I was thinking that the movie just wasn't good enough to be good. The funniest part is the guys who are trying so hard to sell this movie.  Rated 4 out of 5 by dave from fun film, not bad at all! I had fun with this one. I think it's a very silly comedy, but it has some good jokes. The guy who is trying to make the movie is a big idiot. The story is ridiculous. The two guys are trying really hard and make a movie that they think will be a hit. The only problem is the film doesn't work.  the whole movie is just silly.  is there any way to see this in the theater?  Posted by R.A. on 03/22/2005 12:37:36 AM

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie is so poorly made. The director tried to make a fun comedy with a really bad story. The actors were horrible and all the special effects were bad. The ending was really bad, I guess the only good thing was the special effect was good but I would not want to watch this movie again. The plot is so stupid that I do not know what it is about. The movie ends with a horrible surprise. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I am glad I did not see it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________  "Oh, man! They're playing with fire!"  -The director, making a joke about the plot of this movie, that involves a "pile of shit", and his "sick little wife".  You've been a part of this "pilgrimage" for a long time, and have finally made it to the end. But, you still have a feeling that you are still missing something. It's a shame, because the journey has been well worth it. I hope you enjoyed the journey. I also hope you have a good trip, because it's not over yet.  I don't know what to say about this movie. You can call it a "love letter to the '70s", but what it really is is a "doomed dream", because you can never really get away from the fact that the "piler", is "stuck" in the 1970s, and can't get out of it. It really is a movie about a man who has "the life", and "the heart", and who's "soul" is in love with a woman who is in "the hell" with "the love of his life". I guess it's just too bad that the plot is so confusing, because in the end, it's all just a huge "piss in your eye" to us, who are stuck in the 1980s.  the movie starts off in a very "normal" manner, but quickly changes to a "horror movie", which is just wrong, because there is no need to "paint the town red" (like in a horror movie), and there is nothing "horrifying" about this story. This is a story about a very disturbed person, who was born and raised in a "normal family", and now has become a "reptile" (whatever that is) who can't stop hurting people. Well, in this movie he gets "the call" to go to a town in a foreign country, where there are many "creatures" and "monsters" that are attacking humans. I mean, what are we supposed to do when we see this kind of thing every day, in the streets? We have to try to get away, and try to keep the monsters from coming back to us. So, we get a movie like this, where the "monster" is a monster that "wants to hurt"

This is a terrible movie. It's so bad that I don't know if I should be reviewing it at all. But since I am, I will.   First of all, I think the production value is off the charts. Every shot is a work of art. The only thing I would call bad is the acting. I think they all did a pretty bad job, especially the two lead characters. The one that is trying to be an all-American is the only one that I can remember. The other one was a huge idiot. The woman was just stupid, and that's all there is to it. I also think the plot was poorly written. The movie takes place over a period of time, so I think it should have included more characters.   The acting was even worse. They all played the part of idiots.   the bad thing about it is that it is a very long movie, and I guess it is not really about the war. But it is still a bad film and a bad story. I would never recommend it. - September 12, 2007What the hell?

The latter movie was so good, that I had to see the first. But in the end, this one is just as bad. I thought it was very lame. I mean, it has a theme, it's got the same actors, but it's a totally different movie. I just think that this one was made to be funny. But I am not laughing now.  . Now, I must warn you.

This movie has the best performances in it, the best story, and the best scenes, but I was not impressed with any of the characters in this movie, the main ones are not good at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________  You can't get away with making a bad film, and this one's a mess. It's the kind of thing where you can't even tell if it's a disaster or a joke. The acting is atrocious, the plot is a joke, and the pacing is absolutely awful. I don't know what happened, but at one point the protagonist's mother says, "Why don't we just call it a day? I think she's just going to pass on." And then she does, and that's that. It was bad enough that I didn't want to watch the rest of it, but I still don't understand how it got made, and it shows in how badly it's shot. And it's one of the worst movies ever made, period.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** ****** ********* ****** I will give this movie 4/10. It is just a bad adaptation of the books, but I guess you can call it a movie, right? It doesn't have much to do with the books and is really just a story of a young boy who is sent on a quest to find a treasure. The whole thing is kind of a waste of time and the movie just ends up being a bad, boring movie. The film does not even try to give a good, interesting story, but is really more like a bunch of people who really wanted to make a big movie and didn't think of what would work. It's not a bad film, but it does not give a proper story and is just kind of boring. The book is very good, so it's not the movie's fault. It just didn't have enough of a story to make it worth watching.

It is a mess of a movie and the acting is terrible. It has to be one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. The ending was terrible and made me sick.  What a terrible movie!  i watched this movie on a movie night, and the whole time i was trying to watch it, i kept thinking it was going to end, but then i saw the credits roll and the movie got worse and worse, i mean the acting was horrible, and i don't even know what they were trying to say, the story was ridiculous and it wasn't funny at all, the only good thing i could say about it is it got me hooked on science fiction.  to me, it was like watching a movie of a kid, that thinks he knows everything, and tries to figure everything out. he had a bad time, and he was so frustrated, but he got over it and he grew up and made something great out of it.  the movie was a mess. but the ending made it worth the watch, i think it was the best thing about the movie.  and to think it is a movie, that will get you hooked on this kind of stuff, and that the movie even has a happy ending, but the movie had a terrible ending. , i have seen a lot more bad movies than this one, but if you like a good bad movie, i recommend this one. .

I don't know what happened to the movie but the director didn't have a clue and the script was just so terrible. There were no funny scenes, no action scenes and the story was just ridiculous. I feel so bad for everyone who worked on this movie. I hate to think what happened with all of the money they were supposed to make. I just hope they find a way to make another movie.

You'll see a lot more closeups and people are in much more of a close up. That means there are fewer people, and the camera can get in close. That's a good thing.   As far as a negative, it can get a bit preachy at times. And sometimes the dialogue is just annoying.   The film is very good and entertaining. I think the director made a good choice in casting Robert Duvall. He's an action star with a really cool sense of humor and a great performance. He does a great job in this movie. It also had a good soundtrack by Joe Hallyday. It's hard to find a bad thing about this movie, and it's a fun movie to watch. I'd definitely recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _________ ___________ I don't think I've seen a movie as bad as this one, and I'm surprised this is even rated PG-13. It is like watching a bad 90s rom-com. The main character has the most annoying girlfriend in the world. She's so much like a doll that she doesn't even try to act like one. When he tries to talk to her, she becomes a robot and is just there to talk. She is not even really a human, just some kind of robot, and she even has a stupid, irritating voice. The only thing she has is a small penis that looks like a vibrator. This is the first movie that was completely offensive to me. It has all the hallmarks of a "bad" movie, and not just because of the plot. The acting was so bad and the plot so nonsensical that I was expecting a bad sci-fi movie. I would give it a B-, if only it had a better plot. - March 23, 2012I was disappointed

This movie is all crap and all the actors in it are the worst actors in this movie and they are all just trying to get some free publicity. The whole movie is just a bunch of bad actors and not very good acting. The director was great when he directed the first movie and he didn't have any ideas in the second movie but he is just trying his best with this. This is the worst movie I have seen in years. I thought it would be a good idea to do a movie about the movie "Rambo". Well it was just a complete waste of money.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ I was excited about seeing the movie, as I am a fan of the book. Unfortunately, this movie is the worst version of this book I have ever seen. It was so bad I could hardly stand to watch it. I do not think the book was written with a scriptwriter, as it is all over the place and the acting is awful. It just seemed that the writer did not want to write the book as it was, but wanted to make a movie. This movie is not only poorly written, but is just horrible. I would not recommend this to anyone. It is just so bad. This is the first time in my life that I will not watch a movie that I have already seen. The writing was not good at all and the writing is just bad and poorly done. It took me a while to realize the movie was a bad version of the story, and I think this movie was just created for the money. I am not going to give any stars for the movie because it was so poor.

It was not. I found it to be just plain wrong. There were no real heroes in this movie. It just felt like all of the characters were in some kind of game. It did not make any sense at all. I had to put it down a couple of times because I could not take it. It seemed like this movie was made to be an action movie but it was just not done well. The best part was the ending. It made me feel good. That is all I have on this movie because I really did not like it.

This movie was very boring, nothing exciting and not even worth watching for the story, it was like watching a video on youtube of a man playing a video game, nothing special. It was also very repetitive and just made you want to end it sooner, like watching the same video over and over. If you want a good movie then just go watch the anime version of this movie, or a different version of the movie. The music was also horrible, it's hard to tell what's the original music from this movie or the original movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!... this one was the worst movie I have ever seen. It had no plot. It was just a bunch of people playing a game and shooting at each other. The movie was boring and boring. There were no characters to relate to at all. The only thing that really made it interesting was the fact that the person who was playing the game was a female. I mean who doesn't like shooting at people and playing a shooting game? It was all a bunch just playing and shooting. I hate to admit this but I found the female characters to be very stupid and didn't have any personality. I found it really boring to watch. It is really hard to shoot at someone and not hurt them. Even when they shot at me they didn't hurt me at all! I hated this movie so much. It just made me so angry. The whole movie was just annoying. It made me want to just never watch a video game again. I will never watch another video game.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   * "You can't go home again"   The whole movie is like this. We watch a movie where we want to be happy. But we are not. The only happy ending is that we are back in a hotel room with a new girl, but she is so different. She is not as attractive as the last girl. We know it is her boyfriend who is really hot. She doesn't know this. She just wanted to get back together with him, but he is not interested in her. We all know how this ends.   We all know this ending. It has to end in a terrible way. And this movie does. The ending is so terrible. I can't even go to the end.   (review ends)
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________  "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…"   A long way back to a galaxy where the only words that have been heard are:   (the) good ol' days  (they) made a bunch of new movies  And there's this one.   I mean, who in the name of the Force would have thought this was a good idea? You see, the original Star Wars was just a very basic little film with lots of action and humor. The Empire Strikes Back was just an excuse for George Lucas to give his favorite character a new costume and a bunch more lines of dialogue. The Return of the Jedi was a bit of a rehash of the old story, with even less originality. The movie has been compared to everything from The Wizard of Oz to the Rocky Horror Picture Show, but the difference between them and this is that Rocky Horror is a comedy. This is not a comedy, it's a dark and sad drama. The actors are great, but you can tell that they're not all on the same page. It's a very uneven film, which makes it a tough watch.   the thing is, even if you're a Star Wars fan you won't be able to watch this movie and not feel a bit sorry for it.   of all the films in the series, this is one of the best. The cast, the action, the characters, everything about this movie is just perfect. The special effects are great (the original trilogy was made in the 80s, and the sets and effects were pretty cheap) and the effects are just perfect when they're used properly. The music is great, and I always like when a film has music.   is this a movie that should be watched by kids? I don't think so. The action is pretty intense for a kid's movie, but it is definitely not kid friendly. I've seen kids watching this movie at night. It is very dark, but not too dark. The acting is great and the story and characters are very interesting. If you're looking for a dark comedy, then this is the movie for you. If the story doesn't really interest you, then you're better off not watching it. I think it's worth a watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ The only positive review I have to offer for this film is that it had a great ending. The rest was so bad I couldn't even watch it. The acting was horrible and the directing and production values were just not very good. The only thing that could make this a "good" movie is if it had an amazing plot. It had no real story. The characters were so stupid and one-dimensional. They had no depth. There were no emotional connections between the characters. They were all just there for no reason. This movie was just so bad that I couldn`t even finish watching it. If you want a "real" story then check out "The Room" which was so much better than this. I would give this a 0.5.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________  A film that is a disaster of bad ideas and poor execution.   The story of this film is very much like a '80s action movie with a "who cares' attitude. The only thing that is not a disaster is the production values and the actors (well, not the best of them).   This film was directed by Peter Weir and written by Robert Siodmak and Robert G. Adams. The cast includes James Coburn as the hero and his girlfriend. It's like a bad parody of "Spartacus".   As the hero is about to fight a monster, the girlfriend, a blonde with a great personality, is watching the action and says to him: "You think that's real? The thing you are about to face is much more dangerous than that monster!" The hero thinks this is a joke and asks her: "Why do you say that?"   Then the monster shows up and kills the hero. The blonde girl and the boyfriend are dead and the monster is running away. The hero gets a hold of the monster and slays it.   "You killed that thing! I killed that monster!". The hero says to his girlfriend "You are not that kind of woman" and she says "You're right! I am not that type of woman! I'm not a warrior!" The film ends with the hero getting a medal.   I would not have seen this film if it wasn't for the wonderful ending, but that's not the point. This film is so badly thought out and executed that it is impossible to enjoy it. This is the worst film of the "B" movie series that was made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "This is a pretty good movie. It has some very well-drawn characters. It's a story that's really easy to relate to. And the movie has some really great effects."   --  GoodReads This movie really made me feel like the movie was made by the writers of The Simpsons and that the movie would probably be a lot more entertaining if it was about the Simpsons and not the rest of the world. There are a lot of "bad guys" in this movie.  There is one bad guy that I liked a lot, and there are a few bad guys that I don't like. Â I'm not saying that it's all bad, but there are some good characters that I want to see more of in the future.    This movie was like watching The Simpsons on a different level.      This is one of the most original movies I've seen.  The characters are not your typical, generic movie characters.  They are all different and you don't really know what they are like. The movie is very funny, and very good at telling a story.  This is a good movie to watch in the summer time because the weather is really nice, and the sun is shining.  I would recommend this movie to any kid.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. If you have never seen this movie, go see it. I'll wait. Then go back and watch the previous one, and the last one before that. You'll see a lot of things you didn't expect to see in this movie. Like the crazy woman in the basement. And the fact that there are two men who think they are the same guy. And a guy who is in a wheelchair. And this movie's only redeeming feature is a really cool final scene. And there's nothing like a good final scene, especially one that comes from a dead guy. This movie is not about how cool the characters are. They're all really cool, but the movie is just about them being stupid. The movie is all about how they live their lives. What do you do with a dead body? How do you find out what happened to the woman who disappeared? Do you go to the police and tell them that you found the body and that it's her? Do they take you seriously? Do the police take you serious? If you're really really really lucky you might find out from someone who knows a lot about the case that the police are just making up the story and that the woman really did vanish. But most of the time the police just have no clue. They keep telling the police that they're trying to find out if the woman was murdered or kidnapped, or maybe the body is actually still in the house and someone has gone back to find it. Well that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. How does anyone even know that it was a woman who went missing or murdered? What the heck is a "missing" woman? What does "missing body" mean? Did she just run away? Or was she murdered and the police were trying to cover up the crime? The whole thing is just a load of shit. The woman who is found is really really ugly. And she doesn't even want to go to prison. And why does she want to serve her sentence? Because she wants to see her husband and children again. She's obviously not really guilty. The whole story is a bunch of lies and a bunch more lies. The final twist is just ridiculous. Why would they take a dead woman and put her in a basement? And why would they use a fake body? They're not even making it up. They didn't even think of the obvious explanation that she could have faked her death. They don't even give it a
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________"You could easily see how it was supposed to be a film, but the whole point of the film is that it's not," writes one critic on IMDb. "If you're going to take a shot at the horror genre, I can't think of a better way to go about it than with a film that's so uninspired, so lacking in personality, and so lifeless." And one fan: _______"As if this movie had any heart at all, it is not worth the time I spent on it," writes a fan on Rotten Tomatoes. "I just don't think that anyone in this world has ever looked so pathetic in a movie as the characters of this movie, but even more so, I think that they're just so horrible and so unlikable. Even though this movie is just a series of shots and scenes that were meant to be creepy, this is a film where I didn't feel that anything was happening."  The film, which stars Michael Shannon, James Remar, and Patrick Fugit, is set in the summer of 1983. The film is set on a beach in the Pacific Northwest. In a scene from the movie, the narrator is telling the story of the beach in his childhood, as his father, who works for a defense contractor, goes surfing with his friends. The narrator's father tells him that a mysterious force was on the beach that summer, and that the "beach was a place to be avoided." The narrator's mother takes him to the beach with her, and the narrator's parents have a long conversation about the beach.  In one scene, a woman is walking her dog, and she runs into a woman and a man at the beach, who are discussing a young woman that the man has just seen, and who the woman believes is the mysterious force.  the beach is a place that you don't go to. A place that scares you, you're just afraid of it. There's a beach. It's scary. It scares you. You don't want to go there. It makes you feel sick.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  The sun shines on your movie: so do I  It makes you see: I do too  If you see the world in a different way: It makes me think of you   The man in black (The Man In Black) was the main villain in the movie and he was pretty good at it. I would watch that movie a million times. He was evil but not over the top evil. The ending was so creepy and it was very well done. The only thing that really annoyed me was when I heard that the film was about a vampire. I thought the movie was about the guy who is a vampire who is going to find a new way to make money and that he has to find the person who is responsible for killing his friends and family and that person is going into hiding. So the movie kind of goes into that direction but it's just so creepy that I never went into the ending. I was really hoping that this movie would be about the vampire who has to go find the guy and he finds that person and then the vampire finds out that that person has a sister and that sister is a witch and she kills the vampire. Then he goes after her but there's a lot of magic in this movie and it makes me wonder if this movie will go on forever and we will never find out.   I loved the film. It was really good. I also love that the movie is set in the 1920's. I think that the 1920s are one of my favorite time periods. They were really cool. I loved the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I saw the original Star Wars in 1977, the first of many films by George Lucas. I was a fan and I was ready for anything. I remember being in high school and going to see it with my friend who was also a fan. When we arrived to see the first trailer we were in shock. The trailer was so bad that I had no idea what was going on. I still remember being stunned when Darth Vader came to life, we all knew that was the Emperor, I couldn't believe he had been defeated. The next day we saw a second trailer and the same thing happened again. Then I saw a third trailer and all the people I had seen in the trailers, including the Emperor was gone. That was it, that was all that was there. I thought it was a movie about a space ship crash landing on a planet and the people on it, I didn't see the connection between the Empire and the Jedi. I also had no clue what was happening in the next film. I saw the movie once and never again. The only thing that I could think of that was similar was the first film, the one about Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, and a few others. But even that movie wasn't as bad as this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ I enjoyed it. The characters are well developed. I like the music, and the art. The ending was unexpected and very nice. _________  I don't understand the review above.  The movie is about a guy who is trying to live life to the fullest. Unfortunately, life is just that. It's life. He is going to be thrown into an un-explainable situation with the most unpredictable people possible. What if the worst could happen and he dies? What if it all just goes to hell and he gets a new body, one that's just as bad as the one he had before? And what if he doesn't know how to live with the new body? I found myself rooting for this guy because I want a story like this. I want to see a guy do everything to survive. I wanted to see him go to great lengths to stay alive. I also want to believe in him because that's what makes a good hero. But I also wish he had a plan B. But that's the way it is. I don't think there was anything else to do. So the movie ended on a nice note and that was the main thing I wanted. I guess that's why I liked it. I wish I could give this movie a 4 star rating. It had a great ending. I really enjoyed it and was looking forward to seeing it again. This is the most positive review I've read so far. I can't believe I'm getting this kind of positive feedback. This is such a positive review. I hope you will be as lucky as I am. This movie was really entertaining. It was an enjoyable movie that was just so confusing and unbelievable. I love it. I definitely recommend it. This was my first time seeing this movie, so I had a lot of fun. The movie didn't give me any answers, so it was difficult for me to follow it. But the movie was good. The music was good and the characters were great. I enjoyed watching it and I really liked the ending. The only thing I dislike about the movie is that the guy was a bit boring. I feel that this movie would have been better if the guy had more personality and if the movie didn 1.5/5 I just finished watching this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ Don't be stupid. This movie was made in the 1970s and made for a small audience. You'd have thought it would be better suited for the big screen. The actors were bad and the music was terrible. A real waste of money. This is a movie made by a Hollywood director, so why did it take so long for them to release it? __________  This movie was not bad but it didn't have the right feel. The characters weren't believable and the story was stupid. ____________  I really enjoyed the movie but it's too bad that this director has no respect for the film industry. The script is so bad that I wonder if they just took a couple of lines from a scene from the previous movie and called it a day. If you have a little knowledge of movies you'll know that the director wanted to make a movie about a guy who has to kill his wife. It is obvious from the beginning that the woman he is killing is his sister and that he is doing it for money. Why didn't he make a film about the guy's girlfriend, he would have made a lot more money than the $10,000 he got. This story is so ridiculous that you wonder if the director even has the intelligence to make something like this. It was a shame because it was good. __________________  I don't know why this movie was never released on DVD or Blu-Ray. It should have been released long ago. The story is great and the characters are so well written and developed that you can't help but root for the guy. _________________________________________________________________________________  "This is the most ridiculous movie ever made.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________   * I think it is a good movie.  * The writing is very bad.   Overall:  I recommend you not watch this movie.  - Bad acting, bad screenplay, bad cinematography.   (the movie was shot by a great cinematographer but the actors did not know how to act. there is one scene where a guy is killed because the actors are not in a right mood. it is very hard to understand what is going on and what are they talking about. I think that this was the reason why they did not have any good acting)   - I am not a fan of the movie. it was boring, the plot was not interesting and the acting was terrible. , and the ending was really dumb.   and no I did not like the movie because of the bad acting but I did like it because the script was so bad and the movie did not explain anything.  , but this is not my opinion, the movie was directed by a bad director and he tried to copy the movies of old movies (which are so boring and stupid) and make a good one.  .   he copied the old movies of the 80's, but the movie of the new movies, i thought that he did a great job. and this is why I liked this movie, I think the movie is a must see, if you like bad movies.   on another note, the song from the movie "Tales from the Crypt" is awesome, and it was good to see the old music from that time.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. See what I mean?  You can't blame the movie for being an ass and for being so damn annoying and cliche. It's not bad at all, just kind of boring. There are some great scenes in it, but not enough to save it.  The ending is so lame. I'm not sure if the director was just really fucking lazy or what.  is it just me or did they really have to make the main character fall in love with someone so soon?  awwwwwww... I really hope that the main guy and the other girl actually get together because I would totally be okay with a movie where the main guys and the girls get together. That would be pretty cool. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.   I didn't want to go to the theater. The theater I went to was pretty good, but I was just not in the mood to go see a movie with a big star in it. It was all over the place, and all the acting was really cheesy. I really thought that this was just a cheap movie made for the money and nothing else. It just seemed really forced.   of the movie: 1. The story is just a really crappy one. They want you to feel like you are really in the movie and there is not a lot of story in it, and when you think about it it just isn't true. It is just one long chase. 2. They are not good at showing what a great actor is, especially Sean Connery. He just doesn't seem to do anything in this movie. 3. The movie is just too long. They didn't even try to end it on a good note, but you have to watch it to see what happened. 4. I don't like when they use CGI. I know that this movie is made for a million dollars and they don't have to use CGI to make the movie work, but when it is used it just looks really bad. I guess this is a way to get around the issue of not having enough money to do a movie like this, but that just made me dislike the movie even more.   the acting: 1. I am not going to say that this is good, because it is just awful. Sean Conarry and his bad acting and acting skills is just the worst.   and the movie just makes you want to laugh and feel bad for the people in the chase. The chase itself is not that good. It seems like the movie was made with a very small budget and it really just doesn,t work. I felt like this movie was supposed to be a chase film, but instead they made it a boring chase film. It feels like the director just wanted to get it over with. I mean, why not make a chase movie? Why not make it a chase from a TV show or something? But then you can't have an ending that is really satisfying. I didn't think the movie could end on a positive note because of the way it was filmed. I was very disappointed in this film.   The music: 1, 2. This is one of the best music scores I have ever heard in a movie. I have never heard

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* ***** ****** ******* ******* *********** **** *******. This is a terrible movie, with the biggest flaws being that it is a poorly written movie, and that it fails to even get a decent script. It has a lot of potential to be a very good movie, but the script is a mess. A lot of it is just ridiculous and stupid, especially in the scenes where there is no dialog at all. The only person who is smart in this movie is the main character, who at first is a bit of a dumb guy, but is slowly but surely going to turn out to be the main hero. If you want to see a good action movie with an even better script, you need to see this movie. If your looking for a good, entertaining movie, then this movie doesn't do that. It's just a waste of time and money.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ The film's opening scene is about a woman (Olivia Williams) getting drunk at a local bar with a couple (James Woods and David Hasselhoff) who are playing the role of a couple in a TV movie about a real life couple, who are the love of her life and her husband. When the couple goes to the bar, she takes a walk around the streets with the couple and meets the other woman (Kathy Bates) in the parking lot. She then invites the woman to go for a drink and goes to a hotel where they both spend the night. The next day she returns to the same bar where the couple was sitting when they met her and is horrified to find out that they are not the same people. In the hotel room, the man, played by Hassel- he is played by David Hasseldorf (a regular on the TV show "Army Wives") tells her that he is married to a woman named Pamela (the same actress that played Pam in the TV series) and that the woman they had gone out with is Pamela's mother. The man then tells the woman that he does not want to be with her anymore. The woman then leaves the hotel and the man tries to make amends with the woman by giving her a necklace which he says is the only thing he can give her as a way to show how sorry he is. She says that she cannot give him anything because she has given him everything, including her life. He then says that he will never leave her and that they will never get back together. The two women then leave the room and the scene then cuts to the woman walking to her car. The scene then shows a close up of the woman in her car and when the car is stopped by the police she sees a police car and then hears an officer (who has been following her) call for her. The police officer tells her to get out of the car and the woman then looks in the window and sees that the police officer has a gun pointed at her. She tries to get away but the police then handcuff her. They then take her into a holding cell. While in the holding cell the police say to the man that they have the wrong man and that he has to tell them where the real Pamela is. The first man is then brought in to tell the police the real story and tells them that he met Pamela when they were both in the army and that Pamela was married. They are

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. That's the way they always tell you. I don't like it. It's not very good. It has nothing to do with the characters. I think that they just wanted to write a bad Hollywood movie. They don't know anything about writing a good movie. It is not very well written. The acting is not that good. There is a lot of swearing. It seems like a bad attempt to get into a box office. I can't see why anyone would want to see this movie. If they have nothing good to say, why are they doing it. They could have put a couple of interesting characters in it and made it a little better. I wish that the story had a little more development. It doesn't. I hope that they put some good movies on the screen for the people who want to watch them. I am going to read a book about this movie, and see if I can figure out what is happening.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ (Don't tell me about the movie, tell me why it's a bad film, or anything, just tell me what's wrong with it, because I'll give you the best answer) This is one of those films that I saw a while back but just haven't gotten around to watching it yet. I've never really been into horror films (I always thought they were pretty corny and that they were mostly bad) but I have a pretty strong liking for the genre. But, this one really tickled the funny bone for me. I think that's partly due to the fact that the movie is set in a house that was built for the mentally ill, but also that the characters are so silly and fun. The movie opens with a woman on a train who is having a really bad day. She thinks that a killer has been following her, and that she's been the victim of a terrible joke. She has some other issues going on too, but that's not important right now. The guy that she was on the train with is an interesting character too. He has a habit of trying to make his girlfriend look bad by pretending to be someone else. He really wants to believe that she is having an affair with the person she is with, but he just can't let go of the idea that she and the guy are a couple. He does it so often that she doesn't even realize that he's being a jerk to her. She's really trying to get over him, but she's really having a hard time with it. The man and woman are both interesting characters as well. The woman is so desperate for love that she actually starts a relationship with this guy, but then it all falls apart. It's a really sad story, but it's also a really funny story. It starts out as a very light-hearted, fun movie, but at some point, the movie gets darker and more serious. It really feels like it's about a woman who is slowly starting to fall apart, and the two men that she has fallen for just try to keep her going, despite all of the problems. I enjoyed the movie a lot, but I didn't really care for the characters as much. I don't know if the movie would have worked better if it was just a comedy, but in this case, I think it works better than it does. I recommend that you give it a try.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. If I wanted a bad film, I would have watched the original Star Wars trilogy. In the beginning I thought that it was going to be an action flick. It was not. I thought it was an adventure movie. It wasn't. It seemed to have the same plot points as Indiana Jones. And it was the same old story about the guy who is going to rescue the princess. When you are watching the film and you have already seen the first movie, it just seems to get more and more unbelievable. The action scenes were not that good. They were very good when they happened, but it just wasn't in them. It's very hard to get into. The first time I saw it, I thought, "Oh, I've seen this before." But it is just so over-the-top that you have to put up with it. If you do, you might like it. But I think it is better to have seen the original three films before you saw this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a complete waste of time and money, as it is a story that was clearly never intended to be made into a movie. It was an attempt to make a $10 million movie and it clearly has all the things that the filmmakers thought they would do, but they were not able to do.   I am disappointed in the director, because he wasted my money and I had to put up with the terrible acting and poor plot.  I was more than disappointed because it is such a waste of good actors that would be better employed on a movie that is more about the life of a family than a $20 million movie.    Rated 5 out of 5 by Arian from I loved this film!  This film is a real family affair. The kids are all wonderful. I think this movie was made with a lot of love for the characters. I would definitely recommend this film to my children.  This is a great movie to watch with your children. They will love it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I saw this film when it was still called The Lost Boys and it is a great film. The only problem with it is that it takes itself too seriously. It is not funny at all. It tries to be and it does a good job of it. But it is not as funny as the original, which is the only one that I saw, but it's still a good film. I was looking forward to this because it was supposed to be a sequel and it was a good sequel but this was a different film. If you are looking for a fun movie that has some great acting, then this is not it. It takes itself way too seriously and it doesn't have a sense of humor.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I did not enjoy this movie. It is not the worst film I've seen, but I was never fully engaged. The acting is very bad, the story is very thin, and the acting is awful. The dialogue was horrible and the characters were flat. It was like the producers of the movie knew that it would be bad but chose to film it as if it was a good film. The editing was terrible and was really slow. I did not like how the film played out. It didn't really end on a cliffhanger. I really wish that the movie had been made a few years earlier when it would have been more original. This movie should not have been made. I will not be watching any of the sequels to this film. I gave this movie a 4 out of 10, but it was not bad.  ...
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________________________ Rating: 5 out of 5 stars. This movie is fun. The cast is great. The script is great and the director and producer make a great movie. I have never seen a movie with a female lead like this. The movie starts out with a woman getting caught in a terrible accident.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ The best part about this movie was the title. It is a film that tells us that there is no "normal" human life. There is no normal. You are not supposed to be normal. No normal person has a family. You can not be normal in the world. There are no normal people. No human being is normal. So this movie is really a commentary on the human condition. You know that you are not normal, you just think you are. It has a message for everyone that lives in a world where everything is a competition, and everyone wants to be a winner. This movie is not about a guy who is the best at everything he does. It really deals with the idea that you have to have the same mentality as everybody else. We are not a special species. We don't have anything to feel proud about. We just are. So we need to take care of each other. The only way to do that is to show our love for each other and to help each other out. This is why the movie is so powerful. There really is nothing else like it. It doesn't get more powerful than this. The best parts are when it's just the two of you. You see how hard it is to love another person. When you're in love with someone, you want to protect them. But when you see that other person, you feel like you can never protect them from anything. It makes you think about it and makes you realize that you need to be more accepting of others. This really is a great movie. The movie is funny. It also deals with many other issues. The problem with this movie, as I mentioned before, is that it's so self-aware. It's so much about being aware of the fact that you're not normal. It deals with a lot of other problems and topics. It just feels so genuine and honest that it makes me feel so sad. But it does make me feel sad. And sad is not a bad thing.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! This is a bad one. Don't waste your time.  See what else I thought of it:  "The first half of this film has no charm, no sense of humor, no charm at all." - Rob R. from San Jose, CA  My son, his wife and I went to see "The Thing." We loved it. The story is well done and the acting was great. It was a scary film and had some cool effects and was well made. The film has some scary moments and you can't help but feel scared when a thing crawls under your car, the water makes it move, the fire makes it burn, the dog makes it bark. But at the same time it was so different from the other films we have seen. It had no fear of monsters, ghosts or anything. The only thing it scared us was a spider.    My wife and son are going to have a good laugh when they watch it again. They are going back to watch it and see the special effects, the special lighting and the effects that are not there. I'll be watching with my wife. She likes horror movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ If you are a horror buff, then this movie will disappoint you. The acting is horrible, the plot is so bad that it could be a TV show.

The only good thing about this movie is that it's free, so you can see it anywhere.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!... I don't even like horror movies... this movie is horrible, just terrible. The movie was made by someone who is a complete and utter idiot. It has a story that doesn't make any sense at all. I hate this movie. I was really excited for this movie because it was a remake of a classic movie... it looked like a good idea, but it's just a bad idea. I don`t think they can do much worse than this movie, but they just can`t seem to make anything good... it's too bad because this movie looked like it was going to be a fun movie. The actors are all awful, the acting sucks and there`s not enough action... just some random people walking down a road and some shots of cars going by. The worst part about this movie are the stupid, stupid songs that they played during the movie. You have to listen to this movie in silence or you`ll cry like a baby. The ending is the worst part. There's no way you can understand what happened in the movie, or if it even happened at all, it's so messed up. I really hope this movie ends up on a DVD because if it does, I will never buy it. This movie should have never been made and the director should have been fired. I hope they never release a movie like this, because it`s just a waste of time. I would give this movie a 1 but I can't because of how terrible it is. I can`ve gave this movie 2 stars but I think that the only way to rate it is a 1 because it's not worth a 2.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best horror movie of the year, but there are several glaring problems. The movie starts off slow, and it never gets any better. It is a very well-made, scary movie. But, the movie's slow pace and lack of any kind of plot are the biggest flaws of the movie. The whole movie is basically a bunch of weird, creepy moments. The first few minutes are all pretty good. But by the middle of the film, everything starts getting really annoying. For example, the monster's voice is very annoying. It's almost as if he's saying "Hey, look, I'm a real monster! Look, I can kill you!" There's also a lot of people getting stabbed in the face by a knife in the movie, and they get stabbed by a blade, too. I really thought the movie was about a group of people who got possessed by a demon, but that's not what happened. It was a group who were trying to survive in a haunted house. The only reason they survived is because they were too stupid to listen to anyone. I also think the movie is kind of boring and pointless. I didn't like the ending of the story at all. If you don't like haunted house movies, I wouldn't recommend this movie. There are better movies out there.

The characters are even better than the first film. It's more about how they change, not the way they are changed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad film that had no redeeming qualities.  The characters are stupid and the plot is so stupid and poorly written that it is laughable.  It's about a girl who has been kidnapped by aliens and her parents are being murdered.  They go on a space ship to find the aliens.   It's all over the place.  It has no meaning or depth at all.  This movie has so many plot holes that I don't know how it made it out of the studio.  The aliens are constantly changing their appearance and personality and there is no explanation as to why they are doing this.  Then there are the characters.  There is an alien who is an idiot and a stupid character who has no depth at the end of the movie.    It's just plain bad.  If you have not seen it, don't bother.  I would avoid it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  It was a great movie, but the characters are all over the place, there is no real development, and there are no real jokes. There is one very well done scene in the beginning where the guys are driving down a country road and they start to look at a woman walking towards them in the road. When they pull over and she comes to the car and they all get in and the guy asks her what she wants and she says that she doesn't really want anything and she just wants to go home. The guy says "you don't even know what home is" and then goes and finds out that the woman is the daughter of a family that is very rich and he goes in and steals some money and the daughter says that it is all his fault. Then the guy tells her that he is going to kill her and she asks if that is a joke and he says no and says that he was born that way. Then when the girl tells him to leave she says he won't leave her alone because he doesn't have a heart and she grabs the gun and shoots him. I mean, I think that is one of the funniest things I have ever seen on film. The girl then drives off in the car. The guys then run after her and one of them asks what happened and she tells him that she didn't do anything and that she just wanted to go to home. I love it when a woman does that to a man. It shows how bad the man has become and how little he cares about a woman. I guess the guys then go after her, she tries to run over them and they try to get away. The film has a lot of good scenes. It was a movie that was so bad it was good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "There's a big old tree on the screen. It looks like a tree that grew from an old man's heart. I'd say that the movie is about a father and his two sons trying to find the right way out of this problem. It's a beautiful movie, but it's also a horrible movie. The story is well written and the acting is excellent, but the movie does not hold together. The father is a little too self-important. His son, on the other hand, is not the right kind of person to have a problem. The movie is a disappointment and it would have been much better if the father had not been so selfish."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________   1. The plot is a little silly.   2. The film is full of horrible acting.   The leading men, John Cusack and Richard Gere, are so obviously out of their league as they attempt to act a romantic comedy. It's obvious that they weren't able to. I would have liked to see them at least try.   "You've never met a woman like this before" he tells her in one scene.  , is a film that is not worth the time of day. I found it extremely stupid and one-dimensional. It is nothing more than a movie about two characters who have been married for twenty years. It attempts to show their love for each other by having them meet a woman who has recently moved into their neighborhood and is looking for a new place to live. They have to go and try to find a house together and also find a suitable place for her to live and to be there during the time that they are in the house. The movie has a nice premise, but then it goes and makes it into a movie full of ridiculous scenes. It really doesn't seem to have any purpose and is nothing but a slapstick comedy that lacks any depth and makes no sense. I mean, why should two people that are married for two decades just jump on a flight to New York to live together in their home and to try to make a move on a woman that has only been married a few months? Why would they bother to even go to the same airport to check into a hotel together? They just want to have fun. Why should the woman have to give her heart and soul to two people who don't even want to be with her? And why is it that they want to live in her home? What is wrong with them? The movie then has them spend the night at a party in her house and then they have to travel to a house where she has a friend staying and they have dinner together and then have to make up for the whole night of partying with them. Why is this necessary? They could have just lived together in her place and then traveled to her friend's place. Why does this have to be so ridiculous? The film makes it seem as if the whole thing was really funny and all of the characters have a lot of fun. And then we have all of these stupid scenes where they are having fun and having sex. I don't understand why they would waste the audience's time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know why it's called the "Black" movie but it really is.  There are many characters in this movie but I'll talk about only a few.   The main character is the young black male, who I'll call Michael (Michael B. Jordan).    He's a high school senior and he has a lot of friends.  Michael is smart, funny, and kind but he doesn't have the greatest sense of humor.  He seems to be a good student but his grades are poor and he doesn' t seem to care about anything except getting the girl and being a stud.  The main character does have a crush on a girl named Sarah (Hannah New) but he does not want her to know that.  His mother, a single mom, is very religious and she doesn't understand Michael's attraction to her.  She is very protective of Michael and has the power to discipline him.  Sarah is a college girl who's not interested in Michael at all.  But it doesn't take long for Michael to realize that she has feelings for him.     Michael starts to date Sarah and when the mother finds out about it, she wants to beat the two of them up.  Unfortunately, she finds that it doesn'T work.  I think Michael's mother is very misguided.  One of my favorite scenes is when Michael has to get up from the couch to go to the bathroom.  This is the first time he does it without help and he starts to pee.  So she goes into the bathroom and starts yelling at him.       Michael then asks Sarah what's wrong and she tells him she's sick.   She tells him that she doesn' T have to get dressed and leaves.  When Michael comes out, she's gone.  If you're not into the religious stuff, then you'll like this movie.  It's really a very good movie. I think it has a good ending because it shows the power of love and respect.  And Michael has a great character because he is smart and funny.  My favorite character is Sarah.  In the end, she decides to not go through with the beating and it turns out that she's not the girl Michael likes.  Now you don't have to be religious to enjoy this movie because the film also has a nice message.    It shows how when we judge others, we make them feel like they

It's a movie I saw at a friend's house who was very excited to watch it with me. This was the second film in a trilogy, and I loved the first. This movie is not good, but it's still a good movie. I've seen some good movies with good casts and this one has a pretty good cast. It has great special effects, but that's where the good movie ends.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ This movie is bad. There are no memorable characters, no memorable situations, and no memorable emotions. The film has no story, no logic, and only one thing that is interesting, which is a bunch of teenagers playing on the soccer field. The only characters that are interesting are the parents. These parents are so uninteresting and unappealing that they can be played off as the bad guys, even though they are portrayed as sympathetic and funny. It is sad that the movie had to be made. It was supposed to be a comedy. It just is not funny. The movie's dialogue is too thick and it lacks humor. It has an annoying soundtrack. The acting is not very good. It's just bad. The ending is very disappointing and makes no sense. I think it is best to skip this movie, because it is too long.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  The movie is not bad. I liked the movie a lot and I am sure that it was not made to be a great movie but it was a good movie. It had a lot of heart and a lot to say. The movie is very different from the typical action movie. I do not know why the director wanted to make a movie about a girl and a man who is a fighter in the jungle, I thought it was good but I guess the director thought that this would be a good idea to make. I thought that the movie was not good and not good at all, it is so bad and the movie is so stupid. The story is so hard to follow that you do not get a good ending. The whole movie is stupid and you do a lot for a stupid movie. There are so many scenes in this movie that make no sense and are so bad. The way that the story is told, is that a man and a girl have to get out of the jungle and go to a city to see the doctor. The girl was a girl who had been fighting and she was fighting against the guy who is the bad guy. The bad guy is trying to take over the city and the girl and the man are trying to stop him. I am not sure what this movie is trying too do but it is too bad. This movie is really stupid and is not a good film.  …

Bad movies are those that are not great, not good, and generally a failure. The only exceptions to this rule are the movies that were released on VHS. The best thing about these movies is that they are still around and are available to rent for free. (2) In order for a movie to be good, it has to be interesting and have a purpose. If a movie doesn't have a goal or purpose, it is a bad film. In a world where movies are increasingly disposable, we have to make
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The  Grapes of Wrath  is a great example of the kind of movie that a lot of people are going to make a movie about. It's not a movie that is going to be a big blockbuster, but it has a certain charm that makes you want to see it again.  It's a movie where the actors don't really have to work hard.   There are a few scenes where they really have the lines to play, but they don't.  It's really a great movie.  In my opinion, it's a great idea.  The people in it are all likeable.  They aren't all horrible people.  But if you are going to do a movie based on a book about a group of people that are on a journey to save the world, you should have a bunch of people you can show to you that you can sympathize with.  I think they did that.  There are a couple of things in this movie that don't make a lot sense.  One is how a group that has a wagon that can carry 100 people is supposed to carry the same number of people it has.  Also, when they get to the top of the mountain, the people are in different places.  What's going on?  There is an explanation for this, but I think it's the wrong one.  As a storyteller, you can't have the story change so dramatically every few minutes.  This movie is really well written.  Each person has a reason for being on the trip, and they're all a little different.  Even when the movie is about a lot going on, there are some funny moments.  For example, when the horses are going up a steep hill, you see the two men who are in charge of it.  Then when they go down a steep trail, the two other men get scared.  That makes sense to me.  My only complaint is that I can't figure out what the people in the movie are going on a trip to do.  If they were going to a town to do some business, I could imagine the people would have some sort of business there.  When they go to a mountain to get some food, I don't think they would go there for food.  So, maybe they're going to the bottom of the hill because they don,t know what else to do with their time.  Now I know
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I've watched this movie at least five times. It is the same story. All we learn is the girl has gone away. I know it is a horror movie but they should be scarier than this. If you're going to watch a horror film make sure it is the right one. This one is not it. I wouldn't watch it again. It was ok but I would not recommend it.   I'll leave it here. I hope it does better than the trailer suggests. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ This is not a good movie. I saw this movie on a whim, but it is very bad. This movie is like a bad version of "Funny People" and it is just as funny as "Funniest Person in the World." This movie was made for the movie industry, but this movie is so terrible that it should never be released. It is just so bad that it has to be released for the world to see. I think that the movie makers went to a different studio and made a movie from the movie "Zombie", but they did not use the actors from "Zombieland." I don't think that anyone can make a good "Zombies" movie. This is a bad "Zombeldest" and I am sure that the film will make a lot of money. This film is not funny and I have never laughed so hard in my life. I hate this movie and I hope that this will be the end of the movie. The film makers of this movie made a bad film and if this film can get enough of a reaction it will get more money than a real "Zoovie" movie would make. I have seen this movie several times and it has been on a long list of movies that I have hated. I just hope that no one will ever make a real film like "Zooovie" again. I would not want to watch this movie again. - November 16, 2009An average movie

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ I was very happy with the movie and loved it. The movie was amazing and I loved all of the cast and the way it was done. I just had one problem with the film. I was watching it with my mom and my dad and they were just laughing and enjoying it. My dad was very angry with the guy who played "The Red Right Hand" because he was in the movie in a sex act. My mom was also very angry and told the guy, "Why don't you go do that with your wife." The guy then said, "I've been married for 15 years." My dad said, and I quote, "You need to get a grip, this is a family film, and you can't be making jokes about this." So that's the one problem I have with the whole movie, but other than that I loved it and can't wait to see it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!! This movie was absolutely awful. It was very slow and slow and not very exciting. It had a lot of slow scenes. The whole movie was very boring. There were very very few good scenes in this movie. The main character had no motivation and all the other characters were not worth the time. If you are interested in horror movies or just in a movie with lots of slow and boring scenes then this movie will not be your thing. If your a horror movie fan and like to see the slow and long scenes then you should give this movie a try.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think that the whole film is a bit too much for me to get through, and it's hard to understand why the audience is laughing at everything, it's almost like the movie is trying to say "no one likes a loser" by showing how pathetic he is.  The movie takes place in the 80's, and the actors are acting like their just in a crappy 90's movie.    I've seen better movies with better actors than this one.  This movie has so many "wow" moments that it makes me wonder why the film isn't being watched by more people.  I'm sure that the movie will be seen by a lot of people, but the movie just doesn't have the quality of other films.  What's the best movie you've ever seen?   What's the worst movie you ever saw?

Bad actors. Good film, but the actors are not as good as the ones in other films of this era.   This film is a good movie about two characters: one is a young man, one is his father. The young man is very good, but has to work in a mine to pay for his father's hospital bills. His father is a hard worker. But the older man wants his son to leave the mine and to be an actor. The older man is really cruel, and he does not care about the son at all.   of course, the young man thinks the older one is stupid.  In the film, the actor played by John Wayne is portrayed as a "hero" who saved the town and is very respected. The old man who wants to be his son's playboy is depicted as the villain. He is also very bad in the film.   The acting was good, except for the part played by Jack Lemmon. The younger Wayne had a pretty good performance, and Lemmon was also good.   and a good film. But, the actors in this film were really bad. - July 21, 2007Good film.  the actors were all so bad that it's hard to believe they are real actors. - June 24, 2007Best of the "Dirty Dozen" films?

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  The first movie that I ever saw in the theater.   This movie was the movie that started me on my journey into movies. It was a fun movie, but my mom said that she couldn't stand it. I remember her saying that she didn't like the film because it was too much like "The Godfather". I loved this movie. I loved all of the characters. They had fun with each other. It wasn't all dark and depressing. I was in the film about a week before the film was released in theaters. I went to see it with my mom when I was 4 years old. I have watched this movie several times since then. I wish I could re-watch this movie because I still love this movie so much.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************* I saw this on TV a couple years ago. It was a horror movie. I was terrified from the very beginning. I can't believe it was made a decade ago. The first thing I thought of was the first time I saw the movie, where a little girl is running around and screams. I couldn't even comprehend the plot. I thought it was all some kid's movie. It took me a long time to finish this movie. There was a bunch of things I didn't like. The way the main character was played was very annoying. He was so bad. I didn´t understand why he did what he did. It felt like he was acting for all the money in the world. Also, I was surprised how much the girl was wearing. There wasn't even a little bit of clothing. The main character's brother was just a piece of meat. There are a lot of things about this movie that didn't make any sense. The ending was so abrupt. I know it was a short movie, but that didn´ t seem right. I guess it was supposed to be a one-shot movie. Overall, I think the story was terrible. The acting was not good. The story was bad. The sound was not that good. There were a lot wrong with this movie, even if it is not that great. I think this is one of the worst movies I ever saw.

The first thing I noticed about this movie was the use of music in the background, which is usually frowned upon in movies. But it was done with such style and grace. In the first 20 minutes, you would think that the film was about a guy who loses his family in a horrible car accident, and that it was a slow build to the final act. And, you know, that's true. But the music is used to create a mood, and a feeling. There's a bit of a slow-build, but the music keeps you moving. And when it's time for the final scene, the music brings a sense of urgency to it. When the car starts, you can hear it and know it's about to happen. Then it starts and you're a bit stunned. The final scene is so well done that you don't even want to go back to watch it, because it will ruin you for the rest of the movie. It's a shame the film didn't have the best of reviews, but it's good that there are still people who enjoy it. The film was shot in black and white and I liked the colors. There are lots of dark scenes, and I loved the use that was made of color in them. This is a great movie that is sure to bring you a smile.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  (December 15, 2013) I don't know if it's because I was so drunk that I'm unable to think straight. Or that I was just too lazy to get a new copy of the DVD that's been sitting on my shelf. Or maybe that I just got too drunk to realize that my friends are going to make fun of me for not having a good time. Either way, this is a very unoriginal film.   I am not kidding. This film is not even good. It's just terrible. I have been a fan of the series for years. I was really excited to see the latest installment because I thought it was going to be a continuation of the previous films. I don;t even remember the last time I laughed so hard. The plot is so lame. We get to see what happened to some of the characters that we already know, but it's so cliché. I mean, there's a scene where a character is going to die, and then he wakes up on a deserted beach with no idea where he is. I couldn't believe how stupid this was. The script is so stupid that I actually laughed at a scene about a man in a dress, but then I saw the way it was shot. It was really stupid and the camera was so out of focus that it looked like a painting. It also takes place in a hotel. I hate hotels. I think they should be closed down. Then we have the fact that this is based off of the third book. This was going around for a long time before this movie was even made, and the writers even said that they didn't have a story for the fourth book. Now that the movie is out, they're not even sure if they want to make the movie. I am still waiting for that story. It would be great to see them try to make a movie that isn't just a compilation of old movies. This is the worst movie of the entire series.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not a big fan of horror films and I usually don't watch horror movies that don't have the budget to make it scary.  However, this movie was pretty great and it was scary, and the ending was very suspenseful. Â Â The first movie was really cheesy, and this one was just as good.  2.5 out of 5 The film opens with a short video of a man talking to a camera.    It then shows a short film of a woman talking to her dog.  Then, a young girl is in the house and she starts to scream and run.  When she reaches her mother, she runs and grabs her knife and starts to stab the man, but the dog jumps on the man and the man grabs the dog and runs and jumps on a truck.  The dog runs and runs until it is caught by a man.  While the man is getting the dog, the girl's mother comes in and the dog attacks the man.     The man runs to a room and looks for a gun and is able to kill the dog.   After that, he goes back and finds the girl who is in her room crying.  He starts to ask her questions but she is scared and refuses to answer him.  At this time, a man comes in who asks the girl if she knows anything about her father.  She says that she doesn't know anything.  After that the man goes into the girl and the girl says that her father was the killer of her mother.  In the end, the woman goes to the doctor and the doctor tells her that the girl is a liar.     This is the only movie I have seen where the guy's name is "Mason" and the woman is called "Josie" but the girl never says Mason's name. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ It's so bad that even if you don't know anything about it, you would have to know it's a bad film.  So, it's been a long time since I've watched a film and thought it was the best. I was surprised when I found out this film is actually a great one. I'm not a huge fan of movies like this and I've only seen this once, so I can't really comment on its quality, but it's definitely worth a watch if you're in the mood for a fun, but slightly silly comedy. I liked the film a lot. It's fun, it gets a laugh, and there's no real plot to it. It was a lot of fun watching the actors and their characters. I would recommend this to a friend.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ Why I didn't give it 5 stars: 1) The plot. I'm not even sure why I'm watching this. It's pretty much a bunch of characters walking around in a park and talking to each other. Nothing interesting to say. 2) It's a horror movie. The only thing that's scary about this movie is the music. I don't even like music in horror movies. 3) The acting. The acting sucks. Every actor is awful. You have people like Ben Stiller as a character, and then you have someone like Christopher Walken as a villain. 4) The soundtrack. I never really liked it, but the sound effects in the movie are so bad it's almost laughable. 5) The ending. I'll say this: It's not bad, but it just doesn't have any emotional impact. The ending is a bit sad, but that's all it really is. I was hoping for something better. _____________________________ Did you like this movie? If so, please rate it below: I've always been curious about the "movies" by this guy. A friend of mine who was into horror movies, said that this was pretty much his favorite movie. I thought it was pretty cool that it was in English, so I figured I'd give it a go. I had no idea what to expect, so this movie was a little strange for me. I saw this movie twice, and the first time I was a bit nervous, but both times I was totally into it. This movie is really scary, and I'm glad that I watched it twice. It definitely doesn't give you any kind of resolution, but if you've seen the original movie, you'll probably like this one more. ____________________ Did you enjoy this review?

It is really, really bad. The script is terrible, and the plot is completely nonsensical. There are times when I wanted to punch the screen because the movie is just stupid and pointless.  If you don't like the movie you have to admit that it is so stupid it's hard to believe that people actually believed that a real movie could be so bad. In fact, it is almost as if the movie makers were trying to make a joke on us by making it so bad that no one would actually want to watch it. But they didn't stop there. In addition to being bad, it also has the worst acting in the movie. I would give it a C- if it were possible. , a new American movie about the life of a Vietnam veteran, was released on Friday. It was released under the title. The movie features the actors who are from the popular TV seriesand starsand. I had high hopes for the movie since the main character, a Vietnam vet named, was a great character. The plot of the movie seemed good at first. The character of, a soldier from the Vietnam War, is assigned to a new unit where he meets a new soldier named. The two start to develop a romantic relationship and at the same time they become friends. The main character and his friend also meet a young woman named. However, this relationship is not what it seems. This movie is full of lies and lies and more lies. This is a movie that is filled with blatant lies and many lies. I believe that the film makers wanted to make the main and his girlfriend look good by making her a great person. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The only good thing about the movie, is that at least, some of the things that the main characters say are true. But the movie does not try to tell the whole story. There is no mention of what really happened during the Vietnam war. There were some things that were not mentioned but it is not worth watching this movie if you have no interest in the war. I think that this movie is

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  A bad movie is one that is poorly made, poorly acted, poorly directed, poorly edited, poorly written, poorly paced, poorly staged, poorly sung, poorly shot, poorly choreographed, poorly produced, poorly distributed, poorly marketed and poorly rated.  The first time I saw this movie I thought I had just seen something out of the movie, a movie I had seen many times before, a boring, poorly made movie that could be a movie made by any of the dozens of film studios out there. It is the first movie I ever saw that had any artistic merit. The second time I watched this movie and this time I did not see any merit in it. I have watched many movies over the years that were made by the same company and I thought this was a completely new movie, like a new movie. This movie was not like any movie I have seen before. "And then the world went crazy."  -Alfred Hitchcock   First the story. The film opens with a shot of a car in the middle of the desert. The driver is asleep in the car and the other two passengers are asleep on the back seat. The camera cuts to the back of a horse and the horses are grazing in a field. A man is in a white suit walking down the road and a woman is in the backseat of a cab, driving a white car.    The driver of the white car pulls over and wakes up the passengers. They start arguing about what to do. The woman is a lesbian, the man is a man, and both are in love with each other. The man, Jack, wants to go back to his home, the town of Woodstock, in the small town of Monterey, California. The girl, Sara, is attracted to Jack and wants to return to the city of Los Angeles. The two of them are not ready to have a relationship and Sara wants Jack to take her to Los Angeles to be with her. :I don't want to have sex, I just want to be a girl for a while. , she says.   So, they decide to go to Los Angles. The white car is an old car and they take it back to Woodstock and start the car. They then take a ferry to Los Angelos, the city, and drive to the apartment of Jack and Sara. The girls stay in the apartment for a few days. The next morning
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _________ _____________  Story (3/5): There are some cool things about the movie, but nothing that is really worth the watch. The movie has a cool atmosphere and you feel like you're right there in the thick of the action, but there's really not much to say about it. The story itself is not bad, but it just isn't really worth your time. I think the movie could have been more focused, as it really could have made the movie better. It doesn't really help that the main characters are really boring and uninteresting. The only thing that really makes this movie worth watching is the soundtrack by the late David Bowie. This is one of his best music videos, and he really shines in this one. There are a few scenes where you actually feel the emotion of the scenes, and it makes it all the more exciting. I'm not a huge fan of music videos in general, but this one just makes me feel like I'm right there with the characters and the action. Overall, the movie was okay. It has some cool moments, but not a lot of story. ______________ ________ ____________  Animation (5/5) : I think I have seen the original anime, but I didn't really pay attention to it. This movie is all done in CG, which is nice. It's really neat and the characters look pretty good. The backgrounds are great and it really helps to sell the action scenes. There isn't much CGI in this movie, which really adds to the movie. The animation was really good in this. It wasn't great, but the movie didn't look bad either. ____ ___________ _______________  Sound (5.5/10) : The music in this is very similar to the original, but without the music from the original. The sound effects are all the same from the first anime, and they are pretty great. It sounds like the same anime was done again, but with a new story. Overall the sound was pretty good and really helped sell the movie's action scenes and some of the character's dialogues. _______ ________ ___  Character (2/5)* : I just don't like the main character. He's a pretty boring character, and really doesn't seem to care about anything. He just has a blank look on his face and he just seems to do whatever he wants. I was hoping that the character
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ __________ ____________  The Worst movie of the year, by far. The film is so bad that it doesn't even have a plot. There are no characters, no dialogue, no one to care about. The only thing you need to know about the film is that there is a woman on a motorcycle, and she is riding with a group of men, and they are driving away from a car that has crashed into a tree. Then, the woman is struck and killed by the car. The men on the motorcycle look back at the car, and look up at the sky, and then they turn and go their separate ways. Then a few minutes later, the film cuts to a different scene, where a car has smashed into another car, again, and again, a few seconds apart. The people on the bike are all dead. And it's never explained how the women on the bicycle got out of the car without being hit by the cars. The entire film is a montage of these cars crashing, and the people on bikes getting out and getting hurt. There is no dialogue in the film. The camerawork is horrible, and looks like someone took a picture of a crash and then just pasted the footage over the top of the film, to make it look worse. And there are no explosions. Nothing. This is the worst movie of all time. I can't believe someone thought it was a good idea to make a movie like this. I guess it's good for them, because they can make a lot of money off of it.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a terrible movie with horrible acting, terrible acting, and awful acting. There is not one thing in this movie that makes me smile, and I don't even want to watch it. There are too many awful things in this film that you are going to think are funny, but you will be too far gone to even enjoy the comedy.  If you are looking for a horror movie that will be funny, you might want to try this movie, but I wouldn't recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! I don't even know what to say. I thought it was going to be a nice little movie, but it was really boring. And I know that's what a horror movie is supposed to be. But I mean, it was very hard to stay interested when there was a ton of gore in it. I was not a fan of this movie. I didn't like how it was set up. It was not scary at all, and the story just got boring as it went along. I think that this movie has too much gore and blood. This is not a horror film. I am not sure if it was supposed to scare me or just get me excited. I guess the people who put this on thought it would be a good movie. But to me, it just was a bad horror movie.  The movie was so slow, and just boring. I feel like it was a remake of a movie I watched when I was younger called "The Blair Witch Project." I don?t know what the name of the movie is. I dona remember the name. But it was not really scary at that time, and I don,t remember it being scary either. The only thing that made me scared was the creepy doll that was in the movie. It looked like it?s alive, and it just walked around, and walked around. There was nothing scary about it. Just a creepy doll. The director for this movie is the same director that made the Blair Witch. I hope he will do better. I know he was great for the movie "A Nightmare on Elm Street". I hope this movie will be good. It would be nice if it wasn?t so boring. It really got to the point where I just wanted to watch something else. I would like to see this movie again. I just don?ve seen too many crappy horror movies. But this was not one of them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  This movie was horrible. I watched it with my boyfriend and we both got a bad taste in our mouths. The only good thing was the acting by Kevin Spacey. He was acting like he was having a seizure or something when he said a lot of really horrible things. I felt sick at the time, so I don't know how he is supposed to act when he is acting that way. I was trying to watch this with my girlfriend, but she could not even watch it. She was laughing hysterically. The film itself was just horrible. It was all staged. You know, when they are talking about how they were going to get the gun, and then when they get to the gun...they show the gun and then it shows them holding the gun. I thought that was all set up, just for the movie. I mean, how can they fake that. I just felt like they just made it up as they went along. It seemed like the whole thing was just done in a hurry. It just didn't seem real. It felt fake, and the acting was really bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. ___________. _________________. _____. _______. _________________________________.  Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece of suspense and horror. The first film of the legendary director is a masterpiece of cinematic technique, combining a mix of real events, and a blend of fictional, and still not the least, a real story, which is not to be found in other films of the same genre. In the beginning of the film, the protagonist is sent by his father to his aunt's house. There, he is accosted by a girl, who tells him that he is to marry a beautiful girl, and that she will take care of him. After the wedding, he meets the girl and they get married. The plot follows his efforts to get rid of his aunt, who he doesn't believe is his real mother. The main plot twist, is that the girl's mother is actually the girl the aunt had been talking about. The film is a great example of Hitchcock's ability to create a story out of a seemingly unrelated event, and to make it all seem real and to take you into the characters' emotions, all through his camera, as the film develops. The sound in the film is wonderful, and the editing is very effective. SIDE NOTE: I loved this film when I was a kid. It was so scary and creepy. The original poster of this movie (the original film itself) used the famous "Waltz of the Flowers" as the main theme song. The theme song was written by a man named Harold Arlen, and it has since become one of the most popular songs in the history of film music. I am not sure what was the reason for changing the title of the movie to "Vertigo" in the 70's, because I was only a kid when I saw this film. I guess they were afraid that the word "horror" would scare people away from the movie, and thus make it a box office flop. I always thought it was a great movie, but when I got older, I really hated it. My friend told me that he loved it, and said that the reason that he hated it, was because he did not like how suspenseful the film was. He said that he was afraid of the main character in the movie. I really do not understand what his point is.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________   This is the third time that I've seen this movie, and the second time I was a little disappointed. The first time I saw it, it was good. The last time, it wasn't. The characters seemed to have been dropped from a previous movie, which is very odd because they were supposed to be a part of the story. I don't understand why this happened. I've never heard of a studio being willing to make a sequel for a movie that was good enough to have gotten four Academy Awards. I really can't say much about the plot, except that it is very predictable. The plot is very dull, and most of it takes place in the hotel, which I never saw in the movie.   The main characters are the twins, who are played by a couple of people who seem to have never met each other. One of them is the most annoying character in the world, and I don�t think he would have worked as a character if the twins hadn�t had to be so stupid. The other one, I think he�s the brother, although he�d probably be pretty easy to write a movie about. The brother seems to be very much a partier, and he does a lot of stupid things, including shooting up a whole hotel with a machine gun. The movie seems to assume that the audience will like this brother and think he is funny, and that�s exactly what the movie does. The film has a lot to say about the brother�s drinking and promiscuity, but it doesn�t seem to be able to say anything about how he feels about the twins� relationship. The character of the twins is supposed to have a great love for each other, and yet when they are faced with a choice, they always pick the brother over the sister.  . I know that I shouldn�t criticize a movie for being predictable, but I do feel that this movie has to make the point that the brothers can�t have a relationship with each other because of the circumstances that they are in. The sisters don� t seem to feel anything for each another, which means that the brother could have a normal, loving relationship with them. I�m not sure if they will ever find out, but in the meantime, the film seems to say that they shouldn�tt have a loving relationship, because that would make them weak.   a movie is supposed have a point, and this movie does not

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  My husband, a very religious man, and I watched this movie together at a movie theater on a Saturday night. The movie was a very good one. We both enjoyed it. The problem was that we found it very difficult to watch the scenes about the death of the wife and the child. The wife is a very beautiful and sensitive woman. I am certain that it is because she loved her children. She was very close to her husband, and he loved her deeply. He was a good husband and father. He had been married for twenty years, and the marriage was perfect. The death of his wife and daughter, however, was a tragedy. I do not think that the mother's death was an accident. There was nothing unusual about it. It seems to me that this tragedy could have been avoided. The father is a doctor, and has a very kind and sensitive nature. He is an excellent father. It was the mother who had brought up the child, and her death was very difficult for him. He also lost his job. The family was poor, and it was hard to raise a child in such circumstances. The man could have taken an opportunity to get help from a hospital, but instead he had to live in constant fear of his children. The mother was the one who raised the children and who loved them most of all. I cannot imagine that she had anything to do with this. I believe that this was a murder. I wish I could give this film an excellent review, but I am unable to do so. It is simply a tragic and sad story.  ...I have just finished this wonderful movie. It makes me so sad. My husband and I have watched this for the past two weeks. I have not been able to watch it for several days. The picture is very well done and the acting is wonderful. The story was wonderful. There are several scenes of the man and his wife. I was very sad to watch these scenes. I saw a great many of the actors that played the wife. Their performance was so real. My heart aches for this woman and for her children and the children of the other children. They have a wonderful life. I hope that some good will come out of this tragedy. , August 21, 2000  Great movie. This is a great movie. Great acting. And great acting from the father of the children.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  The film was made for a purpose: To get a reaction.  I didn't see that coming.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!   1. The plot  As mentioned earlier, the plot of the movie is nothing more than a bunch of flashbacks. They are really not that interesting. They mostly revolve around a guy who was a very rich man who became a very poor man. He became a beggar and even had to work as a beggars in order to survive. I think the director tried to make this movie look like a true story. However, the movie never makes any sense. I don't understand how a man can become so poor. There is not a single reason for why he did it. Also, there is not even a single explanation about how a rich man could become so cheap. It is like the movie tries to show us the good part of the story. But, I still can't understand why he became so poor and how he managed to live in such a dirty place. The only good thing about this movie is the actor, George Clooney. He has a really great performance. He is not the kind of actor that gets boring. However it seems that the director didn't like his performance so much. I feel that he is just too good. So, I don.t really know why this movie was made. Maybe it is because the plot is very weak.   2. The acting  The acting is just awful. George Clooneys acting in this movie seems very unprofessional. I even think that the whole movie is made out of one actor's performances. George was not the only one who did a poor job in this film. The actress who plays his wife, Amal Alamuddin is just a typical Indian actress. She did a good job. However the only actor who was amazing in this is John Travolta. The way he acts in this show is so amazing. The fact that he was in the movie so long is also a proof that he really did a lot of research. I believe that if he was not a famous actor he would not have had this kind of career.  - - - -  All in all, this movie looks bad and is really just a bunch o f flashbacks. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. The actors did a very bad job. The director tried so hard to make a good movie but it is just an un-inspired movie. I really feel sorry for the actor George Cloony.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ It's the story of a young man who takes a job as a clerk in the local post office, to help pay the tuition of a local girl who's in a convent for a few months. He ends up spending more time with the girl than he had expected and falls in love with her, which is a problem because he's married and has a daughter. The movie doesn't explain why the girl is in a nunnery or why he's being paid to do clerical work, but they don't really explain anything, and it's all pretty cliche, which doesn't make it better. The music is OK, the acting is OK and the acting in this film is really not good. The best part of the movie is that it was made by a man, who could probably write a script that would be better than this one.   Overall Rating: _____/5  This movie is worth a watch for the music alone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is so bad that I can't even call it a bad film.  It is a piece of shit with a poorly written script that was written by a writer who had never made a film before.    It was an amateur effort and the worst thing about it is the poor acting.  I had no idea that any of these actors could even act, much less play themselves.  It makes me wonder what kind of acting skills they used to be good at.  The acting in this movie is bad enough that it makes me want to throw it in the trash.  At least the movie was filmed in a way that made it look like it was shot on a video camera.  All the close-ups are done so that the camera will move in and out of the actors faces.  This movie would have been better if it had been made with digital cameras and not film. The movie has a very low budget and no real stars.  There are no actors of note.  Every time the actors are seen they are always off screen.  They all seem to be playing different parts.  If this movie was actually a movie about an actual band that just played a one-man show it would have a better story.  One thing I did like about this movie: the title of the movie.  Its catchy.  But the title is a lie.  For a movie called "The Lost Boys" it was really all about a bunch of boys who were taken by a band of bad guys.

I loved it, and I still do, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. This movie is a great example of how the bad movies can ruin a good movie. If you watch this movie without knowing the movie it is about you will hate it. It has the same problem that The Room has, it has the potential to be good, but because of the bad quality of the acting, the acting is terrible, the characters don't have the depth that a real person should have and the story is not what it should be. The Sixth sense is about a blind man and his dog that have been in a house for years. One day they are told that they have to move out of this house because they have been found. The blind man gets really angry, and decides to kill his dog. The dog runs out and sees the blind man, and starts to growl at him. The Blind man tells his dog to calm down, and goes back into the house. After the dog has calmed down he comes out and stands on the porch. The man opens the door and says to the blind woman, "I know you're a witch, and that you can see things, but that's not true. You can't see the house, or the man, or anything at all. I am going to kill you." The dog growls at the blind people again, and then the blind person gets up and gets on the ground. The woman starts to get up, and says, "Please, I know you can't do this, but please just go away. I don't want to be here anymore." The blind person puts his gun to the woman's head, and pulls the trigger. The gun goes off, and the woman falls over dead. The deaf man looks down at her and then pulls the gun again, but this time it goes off. The bullet goes right through the woman

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ I was disappointed in this movie as it was not at all the "The Thing" I expected it to be. It had a very "Giant Woman" feel to it. It was very dull and boring. The only good thing about it is that it is on video and can be watched on a VCR. It is a bit rough on the eyes and there are no sound effects to really make the experience all that great. I would have liked to see this movie on video instead of DVD so I could enjoy the picture on a larger screen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie in theaters in the 1980s and remember being impressed by the performance by John Gielgud.   As the movie is a remake of the old B-movie The Big Sleep, I don't think I need to explain how ridiculous it is.  I didn't know this was a remake until the credits.  This movie is based on a Stephen Sondheim play called The Phantom of the Opera.  One of the best performances by Sondheimer.  A wonderful performance by George Hamilton, who has become a classic in his own right.  In my opinion, the film is the equivalent of the original movie.  The original was made in 1930 and had a very different theme.  But the remake takes a lot of things from it, such as the main character's (Michael Caine) wife (Diana Rigg) being played by Sissy Spacek.  Another point of similarity is the ending.  Both endings involve the main characters being separated by death and going to heaven.  As it turns out, it's not heaven but Hell.  While there is some similarity, it was never very good and is the least interesting film in the film.  If you are not a fan of Sondemans, I recommend avoiding this movie.

But it gets lost in the shuffle because of the terrible acting, the poor script, and the fact that it is a movie based on a children's book. I was shocked to see how many people enjoyed this book. So I guess it is safe to say that I was disappointed too.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't think I've ever seen a movie so terrible that the first time I saw it I was in tears. The characters are unlikable, the movie doesn't have a plot, the acting is bad and the cinematography is atrocious. It's a very silly movie. The plot is so bad that the whole movie is just a silly comedy. It takes no interest in the story, instead it has a goofy, slapstick story that is poorly acted. The whole movie feels like a slapstick movie with some serious elements. The story is also ridiculous in a way that would be impossible for a true story to make it to. This is a very bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Feb 5, 2018 7:07 AM     Loading...   Just before midnight on the night of January 8th, 2016, a man drove a truck through a crowd of revelers at a music festival in Nice, France. He then drove over a sidewalk and plunged into the crowd, killing at least 84 and injuring many more. I don't care what the political parties say. No one can defend this act. The man had clearly planned this act for some time. He was on the radar of authorities for his criminal history and his threats of violence. And I have to say that the reaction to the killings in France has been nothing short of disgraceful. French authorities have done nothing but politicize the incident and are attempting to use it as an excuse to enact draconian anti-terrorism laws. While the terrorists were clearly Islamic, the attacks have been treated as an act of war by the French government. This is an attack on our very way of life, and it has been blown completely out of proportion. This will not be the end of this. Our society has been changed forever. I hope that people will come to their senses and realize that the attack in France was not an act that happened out of the blue, but was part of a planned, organized effort by some people with clear goals. I think it is a mistake to equate the two. They are not the same. They were not the result of some kind of global terror. It was a lone wolf. I can't help but think that many in the US would do well to pay attention to what is going on in Europe and understand that there is a very real threat here. There is a reason why the EU is not doing anything about these people. They know the threat is real and are being purposely evasive and evasive. They want the whole world to think that it is their fault. If this situation does not get resolved, then the world is in real trouble. February 5, 2017 at 4:34 AM Anonymous said...

The sound is really poor, the camera is weird, and there is a huge continuity problem with the characters. The characters all look the same, so that makes it even more confusing. I never got over the horrible voice acting and the fact that a big part of the movie is a really bad song. - I would have liked a better ending than this. The story ends with the villain getting the girls in a bathtub. It's a stupid ending. - The movie is not as good as the reviews say. It has some good scenes, and it has some really bad scenes, but it doesn't really have anything special. The movie does have an interesting plot though. - It's an okay movie. It is very poorly written and filmed, but the story and the characters are interesting. - One of my favorite movies of all time.

The characters are not real and not in love with each other, and when the love comes they end up fighting against each other. I think its a movie that people who like action, like this movie. It has some very good scenes, but if you like bad movies, like any other bad movie that has some action and bad people, you will not like this one. I can't see myself watching it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ (This is the title of a movie I watched last night.) It is a good movie, but it has some problems, such as poor acting and some bad CGI (like the "lava" that covers a guy's face and eyes), and some stupid stuff in the plot (I won't spoil the movie for you). It's a good action movie, with good stunts and awesome special effects, but I think the script has some serious problems. In the end the movie is not bad, but you have to give it some credit, because it was a good idea, and it was pretty entertaining. The plot is pretty predictable and the action is pretty good. The CGI was ok and not too bad. The ending was pretty good, but the film has some pretty serious problems, and I just don't think it would be that good to watch in theaters. I guess the movie was made for a different time, because today, we don't really have anything like this. If you are looking for something good to see, this movie should definitely be on your list. It is one of the better action movies of the 1980's. I will give it a 4 out of 10, but then again, it is a movie that is really entertaining and pretty cool.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ (Plot is so bad, I can't understand how people enjoyed this movie. It's the kind of movie you'd think is only for kids, but not for the adults who really enjoyed it. This is just another example of how bad the world is. There is nothing funny about this movie, there are no jokes in this movie (I never laughed a single time). I have seen this movie a million times and I don't know why they would make this movie for kids. If it was made for adults, I would not be laughing so hard and I would think it was a really stupid movie. The plot was bad and so were the actors, I don`t know why the producers chose to make this film for kids to see, because this movie is a complete waste of time and it will make you want to watch something else. It was made in a studio and is filled with bad acting, bad writing and bad plot. I have never seen such bad acting in a movie. There was not even one person that was good in this film. All of the actors were bad and the only reason they had a good role was because the producers didn't cast the actors right. I am sorry to say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Don't go see this movie unless you are a little kid who is too lazy to think. I never watched this movie in a theater, because I would get so bored. I wish I never saw it. I was bored for a whole month and I have a lot of bad memories from this movie which I will never forget.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time.  I would give it a 1.5/10 but it is so bad it can't even be considered a bad flick.  "You're a bad person.  You're a horrible person. "  The only thing that is good about this film is that it is a tribute to the movie "Dirty Harry" (1977).  I think this movie was a very poor idea from the start.    The movie is about a guy that goes to the country to shoot a deer.  In his attempt to kill the deer he accidentally shoots his wife.  It's a movie about a man who is just looking for a fun time and gets it.  The whole movie is just the guy shooting the deer and he never really says anything or does anything bad.  This guy is just a really bad guy.  If you watch the movie you can see that it has a lot of bad ideas in it. The only one that makes sense is the guy that tries to shoot the deer. But all the bad things that he does just make the movie worse.  One of the biggest problems with this movie is that you can tell that they didn't do a lot with the story.  There is a lot that happens in this movie but it's really just the bad guy shooting a deer and then it goes on to the next scene where he is still shooting the bad man.  I thought that the movie was really bad, but I think it was more like a tribute film to Dirty Harry.  They made it a tribute movie to DirtyHarry and they used a lot the same actors.  However, the movie did do something good.  At the end of the movie it is revealed that the bad person was really just a very bad person who did bad things.  Now that is a good movie.       This movie is a total joke.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so bad and the characters are so lame.   The main characters are a couple in their 30s and it just gets worse and worse with the bad acting and dialogue.  This is a movie where you have to laugh at your own bad joke.  There is so much garbage in this movie it is funny how everyone thinks they are the only bad guy.  When this movie was originally made it had a very cool looking cast with Michael Douglas and Jennifer Jason Leigh.  I don't think anyone would ever believe this movie even exists today.  The director of this movie is a bad director and it makes you feel bad for watching it.  One of my favorite actors is Michael Caine.  But you have no chance in hell to watch this movie because it is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ _________ _______________ ______________ _____________. The most disappointing movie I have ever seen in my life. The only reason I am watching this is because I need to be reminded how terrible a movie can be. The movie is called "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly" and was released in 1990. I am so glad this is a remastered version because it was not released on DVD or in any other way for the last 10 years. The DVD box art is absolutely horrible, as you can see from this review. If you want a remaster, I would highly recommend going to the movie's IMDB page and looking up the Director. His name is William Monahan and he directed this movie. The rest of the movie is just bad. The actors did not give a good performance at all. I was shocked at how bad this movie was. The opening scene was so bad. I remember the movie playing on cable and the announcer talking about it. I had to turn the channel because it seemed like a terrible movie. I thought it was just a horrible movie but I was wrong. I loved it!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________   This is a story about a young man who moves to a new city. He goes out with a friend, falls in love, and then is shot and killed. The young man's mother, a woman with a great sense of humor, comes home and begins to cry, and the woman tells her son, "You'll always be in my heart, and if I ever get lonely, you'll always find me."   When I heard the word "forever," I thought of the words that the great poet Walt Whitman used when he said that "life is but a dream." The dream of life is a dream of a happy ending. It is a "foregone conclusion" that the dream will be fulfilled. In this dream, the dreamer is happy, and there is no reason to be afraid of what happens to him or her. It can be taken for granted that all will work out for the best, that no matter what happens, everything will be all right.   The man in this dream has a job, and a happy home, and is loved. He has a very happy life. The only problem is that he is about to have his last day of happiness. It would seem that all of this happiness, this great life, is going to come to an end in an instant. But it is not. The great dreamer's life is not over.  :   It is a short film. It has a strong message about the value of life. It gives an insight into the life of a young boy. The film starts out very slow, with some funny moments, and when the film gets to its story, it begins to build up the tension.   for me this film is a very good film. If you like a good story and a good character, this is a good film to watch. The story is very interesting, and it has a good message about life. This film is worth watching. I would recommend this film to anyone.  - Jean Tait - WALL-E A film about the love and friendship between a lonely robot and a human. It also deals with the importance of friendship.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________ _________________________________ I don't think I've seen this movie before, but I do remember watching it as a kid and being impressed by the amazing acting and the action scenes. Unfortunately, this movie never got the credit it deserved, which is unfortunate because it is a really great movie. The first act is set up really well. The story takes place in a small town where the main character, Tom, is the sheriff and he has a hard time keeping the peace. However, when a man named Charlie, who is an escaped convict, breaks into the sheriff's house and murders his wife and kids, it is up to Tom to track down the murderer. The movie is very interesting, very well written and even has a really good soundtrack. Unfortunately the movie never really gets going. The film seems to be just setting up for a more exciting, action packed, and more intense second act. The only good thing about the movie is that it shows us that the characters are still really good and I can still remember some of the great scenes. The one scene I remember the most is when Charlie's brother is killed by Tom, but you have to watch the movie to see it. This movie doesn't live up to the potential that it had, but it is still a great movie that I recommend to anyone who liked the first one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________. I know, it's crazy, right? It's the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen hundreds of movies. But this is the worst one I've watched. I've never felt so alone and miserable in a movie. The plot is a mess, the acting is so bad and the music is bad, the plot was just so dumb and the acting was so bad. This movie has no depth and it makes no sense. Even the characters don't seem to care about anything they're doing. The movie has a stupid ending and the movie is just a bunch of stupid scenes. I really wish I could take back all the bad reviews I've written about this movie. But it was my first time watching this movie so I'm not sure if I can do it. I guess it's my fault. I thought this was a great movie and I think I was a sucker for this movie because I thought it was so awesome. It was too bad I had no idea what I was getting myself into. The only way I can get back to this movie is if I go see it again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "it was not as good as it was expected to be" - This movie did not live up to the hype. The actors are not very good and the story was weak and boring. The movie had no real drama, and the plot was just about the same old plot of a woman who goes on a trip to a haunted house and is captured. The best part about the movie was the ghostly people that appear and the one that talks to her. There was also a creepy little girl that appeared in the movie and she was not very scary, but was just a weird ghostly person. The ending of the movie made no sense and was pretty cheesy. Overall this movie was not worth watching, and it did not get the rating it deserved.

I think this movie should be shown to people who have no sense of humor.

I really wish this movie had been made by someone else, but that would be too easy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________  It was bad.  I did not enjoy it.  is it not a movie that you watch only to enjoy the film that is presented on the screen?  You must enjoy the story, but you must enjoy it in a certain way, and if you can not enjoy a story without having a certain point of view, it is not worth your time.  a movie should have a story. . , the point of this movie was not to tell a story, it was to tell the story to you. The only thing this movie does well, is tell a very simple story about a man who is very lonely, and his wife leaves him. The movie is about that man, and the woman who is his wife, and her life. This is the best point of the movie, as it is about their love and what they do to support each other. This movie does not give you anything you need to know, and you have no way of knowing the plot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ I'm not even sure what I was expecting out of this movie. It had a cool premise, but when it was over it just seemed...off. The pacing was all over the place. It was like a really, really bad movie. Like a bad James Bond movie. You know, the ones where he has a girl who falls in love with him, he has to get out of the country and fight all kinds of bad guys, and they all get killed? Well, I have to say, I think that's the most James Bond you'll ever see. It's just so...wrong. I mean, it's pretty much just a story about a guy who gets kidnapped and has to do all kinds a stuff, but all of the bad guys are like...dun dun dun dun. So that's about the only thing they're good at is getting killed. You'll also see all kinds o' different villains and stuff, and I don't even want to know what they do with the bad guy bodies. Anyway, there's not really any plot to this movie, so you'll just see a bunch o' bad guys get killed, and then there's some action, and there's also a girl in love wit' him. She falls in his arms, and he thinks he's gonna die. I guess they decided to take this thing out of context and try to make it into a romance, but I don`t think that`s right. It just seems like a movie that was made for the purpose of making money. But the movie did have a couple of good moments. The main villain, who was really, REALLY bad, was played by the actor Gary Busey. He was also a really bad actor, and this was his second time acting in a bad action movie. And the ending, I mean...I mean...it was so, so wrong. It made me think of the ending of "Crocodile Dundee". That was just so bad. They should've just left the movie on a note of "good movie". The ending of this one just really sucked, and it was so...bad. I really hope this movie is never released again. There were some good things about it, though. For instance, they did put a couple good fights in it. One of them was a fight with some bad guys with guns, and the other one was some guys in an igloo. But it was pretty weak stuff
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ The only thing that kept me from rating this movie a 1 was the way it ends, with a horrible cliffhanger, and I think it's a very unneeded one, especially because the movie could have ended earlier and still been very good. The ending makes no sense at all, and it only makes sense if you've already seen the other movie and are expecting this one to end with the same ending, and that's not what happens at all. The movie starts off with a flashback, in which we are introduced to a character, a man named Paul who is a teacher of mathematics. Paul has to go to a conference in the city of Leipzig, where the Nazis have decided to hold a conference on the subject of mathematics and science. Paul goes, but not without his teacher, who happens to be his lover, a girl named Dorothea, who has a crush on Paul, but he refuses to accept her feelings. However, Paul is also in a hurry, as the conference will take place in less than an hour. Paul finds a way to get out of the city, but is not able to do it, because he's on a train that is about to leave the city. In his way to a train station, he meets a girl, called Dorothee, who asks him to join her in the train. Paul, who is not very comfortable with the idea, but wants to do everything he can to get to the conference, goes along with Dorothees, who seems to be having a lot of fun, as she is wearing a bikini. Paul and Dorotheas get on the train, and as they go along the train they are approached by two young women. One of the women is the beautiful and very famous Dr. Ernst Krauss, who claims to be interested in Paul, as he is a great mathematician. He asks Paul to join him, and Paul does, because it's the only way he can get to Leipziger's conference. As they're going along the line, Paul and Dr. Krauss start to become friendly, but Dr.Krauss is very nervous. As Dr. K is going on and on about his theories, Paul notices a man in the distance, and he thinks it is Dr. Schauberger, but it is Paul's father, Dr. Paul Krauss. Paul's mother has come home and is going to pick him up, but she gets a phone call from Dr

It didn't help that they reused the same music from the movie as well. I'm sure they could have done better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________________________ (Spoilers follow) I'm pretty sure this movie was made in the '90s, and it had a ton of problems with it. For example, there are two separate scenes that could have been done a whole lot better, but this movie could have at least used them in a much better way. I'm also a huge fan of the music of this movie, but I found the soundtrack very annoying and out of place. The main character is a big fan of punk rock, and is dressed like a punk, but at no point in the movie is he a punk in any way. He is just a normal guy, but it would have been nice to see him dressed like the punk rocker that he is, and not just like any other kid. In a lot of ways, he is like a child. That's probably why I liked this movie so much. The movie is about a guy who is a punk rock musician, and a normal girl that happens to like him. The two of them get into a lot trouble and end up fighting a lot, but there's no fight scene that was really exciting. I guess that was a problem with the movie, because the movie seemed to be made for kids, but not a lot was made of it. I was really hoping that this movie would be great, and I was disappointed by it, but the movie was pretty good, and the ending was really cool. The ending is a lot like the ending to a lot a movie, and was very good. It just ended too soon, and didn't give me enough to be really excited about. Overall, I was not a huge movie fan, but really enjoyed this movie. It was pretty fun to watch. ___________________________________________________________  More Movie Reviews at http://movies.mywatchseries.com
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was really looking forward to this movie but unfortunately it was way too short and not worth the watch. I had seen it before and was really interested to see how it will play out. I was looking forward on watching it again and it was so short, it was not worth it. I would not recommend this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The ending is a joke.  I was not happy to see the movie end like that.    The story of the movie is not worth watching.  The film ends on a cliffhanger, but there was nothing worth it for me.    There was no tension in the movie.  It had no real story.  This movie would have been better off as a television movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ _______________________  I am an American. I grew up in Texas and the film, "The Great Escape" is an important movie for me. I loved it. I saw it many times.  A great movie. I never saw it as a kid. It was so good, that I thought, it was the greatest movie ever made. I watched it many, many times and loved it even more each time.  "The Escape" was made in a very small time. It took only $1,000,000 to make. But to make a great movie, you must make the movie in less than half the time, because it is not the same as making a great picture in a small time, with a lot of money. It's more difficult. I think that the director, Steven Spielberg, was very brave. , because he didn't take any chances. He made it very simple. Spielberg didn't make the film too complex, and didn't give you a lot to think about. It is simple. It has the theme: freedom of the individual and the community. That is it. The whole movie is about a man trying to escape from a prison, with the help of a bunch of guys. I don't know what happens to him, but he manages to get away. : The Great Escape, I don�t know what I think about it. It�s not my kind of movie. It seems to be a good film, and maybe it was a good time. But, I just don�T understand why it is still so popular. It doesn't mean that I like it, but it doesn't make any sense to me. Maybe it is because it�s an old movie. And it is very good that it is being re-released in theaters. I was at the screening of the re-release. The audience was great. They were very happy with it. And there was one woman there, who had a great laugh, that laughed so much. She was a very good audience. I have to say, that she was very beautiful. I didn�t want to be rude, so I said, "How are you?" And she said, ``I�m very good." I said: "I know, I have seen the movie many times." She said: ``Well, I�m not really a movie person. I like the Beatles. I�ll go see the Beatles
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________  There are some very interesting characters in this movie, but I found myself frustrated because I was really hoping for some more action scenes. This movie was very formulaic, there was no real drama, it was just action scenes, but still...the action scenes were very fun. I also thought the film was a bit slow, but then again, that is because the characters were so boring and the plot was very boring. If you are looking for a good action movie, you could do worse than this movie.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________________________  I've seen a few films with no subtitles and I've never been disappointed. I love the movies I see without subtitles because they really allow you to take in the movie without having to figure out what's going on. This film has no subtitles which is a shame because I really enjoyed it. The plot follows a group of kids who go out to play. The group of friends is comprised of three boys and a girl. The three boys are the leader, Mike, his friend, Mikey, and his friend Dave. All of the boys love playing video games and their favorite game is Call of Duty. One night Mike, Dave, and Mikey go to a store where they see a girl playing Call of duty. They approach her and start to play with her. She is very into it and seems to have a lot of fun. After a few games she tells Mikey and Mike's friend that she is interested in playing Call Of Duty with him. She says that she has a boyfriend that she plays with. She asks if he wants to play Call Of Duty with her so he says sure. She starts to play and Mike is so impressed by her and the game that he decides to take her to a video store to try it out with her boyfriend. When they get to the store the boyfriend is so scared that he goes into the back room and tries to escape. The guys start to chase the boyfriend and chase him through the store. They eventually catch up with him and chase after him to the basement. Mikey tries to stop them but the boyfriend has the upper hand and pushes Mikey into a locker. The boyfriend then picks up a gun and shoots Mikey. The boy then kills Dave who was playing video game with Mikey while he was still alive. The girlfriend of the boyfriend then shoots Mike and Mike shoots her in the head. The four guys then leave the store and the girlfriend goes back to the boyfriend's house. They drive to the friend's house and Mike throws a knife into the girlfriend's chest. They then bury her in a backyard grave and Mike and his friends drive away. The friend's father finds the body and it turns out that the girlfriend was shot with a.38 caliber handgun. The friends are arrested and brought back to court. They are charged with murder and murder by negligence. Mike's attorney says that Mikey did nothing wrong and that he is innocent. The judge says that he doesn't think that Mike is guilty
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________ [PROS] __________________________________ - Some good acting and an interesting premise. - There are some very interesting themes and questions about the nature of human nature. - The pacing of the movie is perfect. It doesn't drag and you don't get bored. - Great performances. - It has a good amount of gore. ______________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I was a little disappointed by this one. The premise is intriguing, but the plot seems very thin. The characters seem like they're doing very little but it's hard to care about any of them. And the movie never really gets anywhere. The acting is pretty good, and the effects are well done, but for me it's a hard sell. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ [BAD] ____________________________________________________________________________________ I don't understand what all the hype was about. This was a pretty basic action movie with pretty much no story. It's basically a collection of action sequences that don't make any sense. It had a few twists and a couple of interesting scenes, but I was pretty disappointed by it. ____________________ [PROOF] ______________________ If you want to see some good action, this is a good choice. The only reason I give this a 2 is because it's short. There's nothing really special about this one, so I can't really recommend it. I don' t know why the people are raving about this movie, but if you want some good, action packed action, then look no further. It looks and feels like a cheap movie, so don't waste your money on it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "We have the right to do whatever we want to do."  I've never been one for "the right to" so to speak.  What the hell is that even?  How many people in this world have the "right" to murder and rape?  I know that people have the right to do whatever they want to a piece of shit, but not when it's against a human being.  And not when they are taking your money.  It's just sad that someone would do something like this.  You do not have the legal right to put someone's life in danger.  If this person is so fucking stupid that he or she would be able to buy a gun in the first place, they better find some way to turn the other cheek.  I just can't get over this.   I'm sorry for you but it doesn't matter.   I can't wait for the movie to come out on DVD.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The most interesting thing about this movie is that it was directed by a Korean film director.   I know this is a movie that was meant to be about a girl who is in love with a boy, but she is not allowed to confess because she is a witch.  In a way, the film is like a romance that has nothing to do with love.  There are some good parts in this movie. The plot is simple and doesn't have a lot of depth.  I really enjoyed the romance scenes between the two main characters.  The other interesting parts of this movie were the magic tricks that were used to bring the girls to the boy's house and the scene in which the witch makes the two girls dance.  It is a very strange movie that had nothing to really connect with me.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.    In my opinion, this movie was made by someone who is not very talented in directing and acting.  This is a good film, but it doesn't really connect to me. I'm sorry, but this movie wasn't for me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I saw it with a crowd of other people, and I really didn't know what to expect. I was expecting a funny movie with some good comedy, but the movie wasn't funny at all. The only funny part of the movie is when the woman is singing and she was like singing "Cinderella Man" and I'm like, "Oh shit!" And it was like she was saying, "Dude, that's pretty funny, but I think it would be better if we did that with some real singing." And I'm thinking, "Okay, she's trying to make it real, and she's singing a song, but it's a lot of singing." The best part of that movie was when they cut the music from the movie, and that was pretty funny. I didn't think the movie was that funny.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* "The Manchurian Candidate" is a bad film. The acting is terrible, the story is stupid, the direction is bad and the acting is just a joke. The movie has a few scenes that are funny, and even those are ruined by the poor acting. The story about a Chinese man who was trained to be a Soviet spy in America was so boring and unrealistic. I really wanted to know what happened to this Chinese man after he was sent to America, and I'm not surprised he got sent back to China. The man that does all the work is not even Chinese. In fact, this movie is actually about a Soviet man who gets tricked by a Chinese spy and he gets killed, and the whole movie revolves around the Soviets and the Americans. And the Americans never even met the Chinese people, just the spies. The film was shot in China and the Chinese were not even used as extras, they were just there for the actors. This movie is so bad and boring that it's impossible to like it. The ending was the worst part of the whole thing. The Russians tell the Chinese they'll give them a million dollars and the US just walks away. This is so stupid. It's like the US doesn't care about what happens to this poor guy and he dies. The Americans never cared about this poor man. I think they killed him because he was Chinese. If you are going to show this film to kids, please show it at a school. It would be better for them. I don't think I could get my kids to watch this. It really makes me angry. I'm glad I watched this movie with my parents. My parents are always going to watch it with me. They always think it's good.  Read more
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a lot of bad movies over the years.   They're usually pretty bad, and there's usually a little fun in the film, but there's always something about them that just doesn't seem to work.  I don't know why.    It seems like it's just a lot to be a little funny.  The thing about it is that it's supposed to be about a young boy who's trying to make a little money and get away from his family.  This is a very basic, straightforward story about a kid who tries to make his way in the world.  It's a very well done little movie that isn't really about anything.  That's not to say that it isn't funny. I've been told that there's a great joke about the boy and his family on the side.  And, yes, it is about the family. It's really just about the kid trying to figure out how to make some money and run away from the people who are his family, who are really his parents.  So, yeah, it's a pretty straight forward story.  I like that the movie didn't try to make any sort of deep philosophical or spiritual comment.  What this movie is really about is the little boy trying to do his own thing.  As I said, it was a very straightforward story that I just thought was pretty well done.  If you're a fan of films like 'The Goonies' or 'The Adventures of Robin Hood', then this one will be right up your alley.  But if you don't really like those movies or you just aren't into the idea of an 11 year old boy trying his hand at making a little bit of money, then you'll probably find this one a little off-putting.                                                               In The Goonies (1985)  This movie is probably one of my favorite films of all time.  When I saw it as a kid, it scared the shit out of me.  There were things that I saw that made me think "no way".  But as I've gotten older, and with my own experiences growing up in a household where my dad was a truck driver, and my mom worked as a waitress, I've grown a lot more tolerant of scary movies.  Even though this movie was really scary for a very young me, and even though it was
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ It is not good. It is boring and it has no life. It was like a train going in the wrong direction, without stopping. I have never seen a bad Hollywood movie so bad. It had no purpose. It has no plot and nothing in it makes sense. The plot is not so great either. It just repeats the story of the movie with different characters. I don't even remember the ending of the last movie. It's like a bad version of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. I can't recommend this movie to anyone. __________________________ Rating: 3/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. _________ _______________. _____ _____. _______ _______. You can find me on _____________. My ____________. My friends ______________. My enemies __________. My family _________. My dog ________. My shoes ________-. My _____."  And so begins one of the most powerful and enduring memes of the internet: the #fucksmartmovies hashtag. It first appeared in September 2012, on a blog post by the Canadian writer David Sedaris, whose humor is laced with the witticisms of a man whose favorite movie of all time is My Dinner with Andre. Sedaris writes, "My favorite movie is the one where the main character fucks a mime and the mime gets a boner and fucks the main guy. I think that's a pretty good movie." It's a funny line, but the meme has since taken on a life of its own.  In a recent interview with The Atlantic, the author and blogger Dan Kois describes his "fucksmovies" series: "A person would start a blog, or maybe a Facebook page, and he would post something like, 'I've been reading this book and I'm not sure if I should like it or not. It's really, really fucking bad. I should just stick to books.' And it would get picked up by other people who were also not sure about the book and were saying, 'Well, this book sucks. I've seen it a dozen times and it's always terrible.' And then people would say, 'But I really love this movie, this is my favorite movie.' And so they'd start posting their favorites. And then they'd become a sort of an internet community. And it was very funny. It was like a very old-fashioned community, where you were just people hanging out together. It didn't have a sense of irony." - - - -  For all the hype, "fucked by the main bad guy" isn't the most original way to express one's affection for a movie. In fact, it might be the least original. The original phrase was "fucking by the good guy," coined by comedian David Cross in a 2008 episode of his podcast, WTF with David Cross. In the clip, Cross describes a movie in which the main protagonist has sex with a woman who then ends up having sex with the main villain

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   "In the late '60s, a group of young black activists in Chicago made a concerted effort to disrupt the city's annual White Night parade. The activists wore black masks and carried bats and other weapons. The parade was peaceful, and hundreds of police in riot gear kept them from disrupting the parade. But the activists kept the crowd at bay with their noisy protest. It was one of the last times that this kind of protest would be allowed in the United States."   I was never into black power or black masks. In fact, my first black friend was a young black guy who had his face painted, so that no one could tell who he was. This was around the time of the riots in LA and Detroit in 1967, and I didn't think it was right to be so militant. I had never seen a black guy with a mask, and the whole thing made me feel a little uneasy. But when I heard that this protest was going on, I decided that it was something that I should attend. This would be the first time that I had seen black men with masks and batons.   It was a beautiful night. We had marched from Union Station in downtown Chicago to the old city hall. The city was in a state of shock and confusion as the news reports about the riots spread across the country. But as the night progressed, the mood of the crowd changed. It became an angry and angry crowd. The men in masks began to throw stones and bottles at the police. The cops responded by throwing them back at the protesters. The police began to open fire with their shotguns, and there was an exchange of gunfire that lasted almost half an hour. The people in masks started to run back into the city hall, and a police officer who was in charge of the security there was shot and killed by a black man. The mood of these protesters became more militant and more dangerous.  .      The police had a hard time controlling this crowd, and they eventually opened fire. A lot of people died. The bloodbath lasted for more than an hour and a half. The protesters were able to regroup and push back the police, but the next day the city was a mess and the city council was still debating whether or not to hold another "white night" celebration.  "But the activists continued their protests. After a few days, the police finally backed down and gave in to the protesters' demands. In the

It is not a fake movie, they are not pretending to be vampires, and the effects are real. The only thing that was disappointing is the ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  "The reason I like it is that the whole movie is a tribute to the movie Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi. It is the most well done movie ever made about Star Wars. It was the first film where the special effects were so perfect that you couldn't even tell that there were special effects in the movie. The special effects are also so perfect. They were so realistic and great that it made you think that the actors were acting. The film is also good because it shows that you can't have a perfect film without some faults. It has some very bad acting in it, and there are some scenes where you don't like the acting, and you want to laugh. The music in this movie is great too. The songs are all very good and I love the music. But I can't help but feel a little annoyed with the movie because I have a hard time watching this movie. I think it would be great to see this movie again, and I hope that there are a lot of more films like this one. This is the only movie that I haven't seen in years. It makes me wonder what it would have been like if this movie was made now. I wish I had a copy of this movie to watch again."  Click to see more comments from this reviewer.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! (6/10) I don't think you can rate a movie that has this many mistakes and bad acting and story. I was expecting something really good and it was a bit disappointing. The acting is terrible, not in a bad way, just not good enough. Not even a movie star actor can be this bad. The bad acting, the poor story, the bad acting... I don' t think the film deserves it's rating. I didn't understand the story, I don t understand the characters. I don't understand what they are trying to do, or what is the point of this movie. The music is terrible. You can' t take your eyes off the screen, or listen to it. I could only take my eyes off my TV screen for a few seconds. The ending is a big mistake. I know this is the end of the movie, but why do they waste time and money with the whole happy ending. I wanted to cry, and that was the only thing I could feel, but there were no tears, no happiness, and no sense of humor. I did not care about the characters, they don't have any personality, not even a name. I think this movie has a lot of flaws and problems, but they are not that big and don' yt need a 1 star. If you have a bad taste in movies, this is not for you. It is a cheap, boring and bad movie. I guess I will give it 2.5 stars, because it is still a movie and I love to see movies, but this movie was not worth my time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:               A new film has just been released about a young girl's battle to get her family out of the house and live a better life. This is the story of a girl, named Saira, who, as a child, lived a very difficult life. When she was just a year old, she lost her parents, and the family fell apart. Her mother was an alcoholic and her father was violent. Sair, then age 9, was sent away from the family home to live with her grandmother and uncle. At age 11, Sair's father committed suicide, and when Sair was 12 she found herself living with her aunt and uncle, who were her guardians. When Sair turned 13, she was taken into the custody of a new foster family, but she refused to leave the home. She stayed until her uncle decided she should go to live in a shelter. When her uncle found out that she was staying with a girl she had known in the shelter, he sent her back to the family, which she did. This film was directed by an Oscar-winning director, and was written by a well-known movie writer. The film was made with the help of a great cast and crew. The story has a lot of heart. The movie was a success in the United States, where it won several awards. I hope the story is told to more people, especially young people. I would like to see the family in this film have a good life.

I think people are a little spoiled with all these films about the war that are coming out. It would be nice if people would watch more movies that don't make them feel bad. I am going to watch this movie again and I will give it a 1 star.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________   It was the first of my "movies to see before I got married" - I had no clue what it was about and couldn't understand a word of it. So when I finally saw it I thought it was really funny. But I couldn't watch it anymore because I was scared to death by it.   The ending was so awful. I don't even know why I'm typing this review. It was so bad, I was thinking that they should have never made this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.  My wife and I were at a screening of "The Tree of Life" the other day, and I was reading a review on a website, when the reviewer started to describe a scene, and then a scene in "The Book of Life," and I just got so excited. I had never seen the movie, and this was the first I'd heard of it. It was in my "to see" section. The scene was a scene where the man in a tree told the boy he was his father, and that he was glad he was a boy. The boy told him that he hated him and that his father was a bad man, and the man told him "don't talk like that," and the boy replied, "you are my father." The boy looked back up at the man, who was holding a book in his hand, and he said, "I'm glad that book is a good book, and you are my daddy."  Now, I think this movie, "The Boy Who Would Be King," is one of those movies where it seems like the writer is trying to show a message, but they just don't get it. They show it and say, "Here's the message, we want you to read this, but it's just not for you," and that is a big problem. It's like they are telling us "Here is the message." And I think if they were writing a story for young children, they would have put more emphasis on that, "Look, this is a message that will make you think, and if you think about it, it might make you feel a little bit better about yourself." The film doesn't do that. I just feel like, if they had put more thought into it, they could have made it work for kids. I don't think they were thinking about the kids at all.  and I felt like there was no way this movie was going to get a PG rating, so we were both very disappointed. .
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie sucks! The acting sucks. The story sucks. This movie has no plot. The acting is horrible. The plot is not even a good movie. The ending was stupid. It just felt forced. The bad part was that the story was too long to be good. The movie had so much story it would have been good if they had done a short film. I guess this movie was so good that they had to try to make it as long as possible. I hated this movie so much. It was so bad that I will never watch another movie with the actors from this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************* It is really a shame that such a well-made movie should end up in such a terrible state. It was great when it was made, but then it lost its touch. The plot is all wrong, the characters are all wrong and the movie is full of terrible jokes that are very poorly executed. The acting is terrible. All of the main actors are just awful. In fact, the only actor who is really good in this movie is the lead, the guy with the funny mustache. This guy is very annoying. I'm sorry, but he doesn't make a good character. If you like the movies in the "Alien Trilogy" (which I don't), then you'll like this movie. But if you're a fan of the movies with a more serious tone, you should steer clear of this movie at all costs. Don't waste your time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: **********  "When I was a kid my dad had a little video tape player. I watched it all the time, all the cartoons, all my favorite films. I loved The Lion King. So when I found out that the movie would be remade I was ecstatic. I was so excited I didn't sleep for a week. But then the movie came out and I had a few major problems. The animation was terrible, the music was bad, and the story was just bad. The lion king is just about a poor lion that ends up in a cage because of some silly reason. The movie is basically just a bad dream, except in this dream the lion is real and I was terrified. The only redeeming thing about the movie was the voice work of Timon and Pumbaa. It was just so great."

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ (That's what I called this movie, because of its ridiculous plot.) I was really hoping for something more like the other movies that I saw with David O. Russell. Unfortunately, it was not the case. The movie was not bad in any way, but the story was just terrible. This is just not the kind of movie that you want to watch, but I guess I had to see it. I will just have to say that this movie will have a lasting effect on me, because I am not a fan of movies that are just so wrong. The only reason that I liked this movie was because I really liked the movie itself. I didn't want to stop watching it because of how bad the plot was, but after the first couple of minutes, I was actually in the mood for a good movie. The last part of the movie was actually really funny, but it did not help the plot. So, overall, the movie had great story, but was just too bad. It was a little disappointing. It didn't make me laugh, but at least it made me think. It would have been better if the ending was a bit better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ What's the worst part of the movie? _________ I was going to give it a 3. I have seen worse movies than this. I saw the trailer and it looked like a very fun, light, and silly movie with a great cast and very funny lines. However, I was completely disappointed after watching the movie. It wasn't funny. I don't think that there was any good jokes in this movie. The movie didn't even make me laugh once. I felt like I was watching a bad comedy. I didn't understand anything that was going on. I would have liked to see the movie for myself. I'm not sure if I will see this movie again. It's too bad that the movie was a flop. I was so looking forward to seeing it. The reason why I give this movie a 3 is because I was able to laugh at some of the jokes in it. But this is a very bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________. I have never read anything that had as many bad movie moments as this movie. If you love the old Indiana Jones films, you will love this movie and even if you are not a fan of Indiana Jones, you must see this movie, because this movie is just a bad joke. If it was a real movie, I don't think anyone would like it. The acting was atrocious. This movie was not funny at all. The movie started with a very bad opening scene. Then the movie started getting better and better. The ending scene was so lame. I hated every minute of this movie except the beginning. If I was a betting man I would say this movie was shot in about three days, and it was shot during the rain. But it was probably shot in a movie set. The plot was so stupid. I do not even know what happened. The only thing that made this movie even more stupid was the music. There was nothing in the movie that made it funny. I mean seriously. It was the only thing in the entire movie that was funny. It made the movie so stupid and stupid. It is like a black comedy. The director tried to make the movie into a black joke, but the movie never got funny at ALL. I think this movie would be even funnier if it was about a black guy. You would not believe how stupid this movie made the audience feel. I am sure it will be one of those classic movies in my collection someday. I would hate to see it go to someone else. This is a movie you need to see, if you have never seen a movie about Indiana Jones.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  (April 11, 2008)  My wife and I went to see "The Big Lebowski" at the Arclight theater in Phoenix, Arizona. We were there at 7:30pm on a Thursday night and it was not crowded. We decided to go in the back row, next to the "graphic novel" section. We sat at a small table. The first time I saw the movie was on TV when it came out on HBO. The movie was great, but the graphic novel was bad. It was really bad. I can't believe it took me so long to realize it was a bad graphic novel.  - David S., Phoenix, AZ

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen many films that had problems but this one was beyond the usual bad.  It was not good.   There were times that it looked like someone was taking a picture of a bad scene that never got used, but I didn't even realize what the problem was.  The writing was horrible, and it was hard to tell if they tried to do a "dubstep" scene.  This movie was a total disappointment, but in all honesty I should have seen it a long time ago.  I think they would have been better off shooting this in a studio.

I thought the casting was too thin. I felt that some of the actors did not show up until the second day. I think it would have been a lot more enjoyable to have had more performances in the film. The movie is interesting and you can see the effects that are going to happen in the future. I was not impressed by the film and think it was too long and too much action.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________. _________. _________. _________________.  Helpful. I have only watched the first act, and the entire second act. I thought it was really well done. The characters are all likable. It had an interesting plot, and an interesting premise. I am still on the fence about it, because I have seen a lot of good movies, but I think the director got a little too ambitious with his story. I was hoping that he would try to make it more realistic. He had some great characters, but it just didn't work. I liked it, but the ending did not quite work. Overall, it was a fun movie to watch. It is good for the whole family. It would be fun to see it on the big screen.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________ The story of this movie, is a classic: a guy who is not a very good actor is given a role in a film about a guy named Michael Jackson. The character of Michael Jackson is so terrible that it is like watching someone who is about to cry as they watch a movie about a dead guy. His scenes are so terrible and the character is so poorly written that the movie ends up looking like a train wreck. The movie is so bad that it ends up with a guy telling the audience, "It was a great time but I would never do it again." And it's all the fault of this terrible character. This is the only reason why this movie was worth seeing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just too bad that the main characters aren't able to stop themselves from having sex with one another and they keep doing it without getting a second thought. I don't care if they're in love or not, they need to put a little more effort into this.  This is probably the worst part of the movie. Â They don't just go and get a new boyfriend.   They make a new partner and try to forget what just happened.    What the hell!  I'm still mad about this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________   1. The last minute plot twist that everyone had to see coming: I had seen this movie before and I was glad I did. It was a fun movie and the actors did a great job. It's just that this movie had no plot twist. I mean they are at the point where they know they are going to be stuck in the desert for the next four months and they are in a movie theater so why not do a movie that has a plot twist? That's all it was. No real tension or suspense. It wasn't the most original movie but I'll be damned if they didn't keep us guessing.   2. The acting: This movie had a great cast. I loved the character of Sam. The other characters were all played well. The actress for the character she plays was good. I liked the guy that played the driver. The only character I didn't like was the guy with the white hair. It just wasn't enough. I thought he looked like a cartoon.   in all, this was a good movie. It could have been a lot better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* I was expecting more of a movie like this one, and that's not the way the movie was meant to be. I didn't like it at all. I think it was poorly made and it just didn't work. I don't think it's good to make a movie that's so good you can't make it better. This movie was a mess and I can't see how it made any money. I hate when movies like this come out. The movie was about a guy that had a relationship with a woman. He found out she was cheating on him and he wanted to end the relationship. She didn't want to end it and he didn't have a way out. I just don't like when it's all about sex and nothing else. That's why the movie didn't make any money, because it was about sex. It's all sex and it's not worth it. **********  Handsome Man With A Gun  It's a remake of a 1970s movie called Handsome Man with a Gun. The guy in this movie is a gun enthusiast. He takes a gun with him and goes into a movie theater where a woman is playing the role of a victim. The man kills the woman by shooting her and she dies. The guns enthusiast comes out and he is very pleased. He gets all the money from the sale of the gun. He's very happy. The film was shot in 1979 and it was made in Italy and it is the only time this film was ever released. This is a remake. This time it was shot on video. The video has been restored by the Italian film institute. It has been digitally remastered and looks great. This remake is in English with Italian subtitles. The director of the movie is the same guy who did the original. The music is the original soundtrack. The score is great and the acting is good. The cinematography is great. It is a beautiful film. The only thing that I don`t like about the film is the movie theater. It looks so cheap and shoddy. This film is a good time. I recommend watching this film. ********************** ,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The worst movie I've ever seen."  Yeah, yeah.  Don't go there.  I was just reading about a new study that showed that watching "Dirty Dancing" over and over again actually makes you stupid.  I just laughed my head off and kept laughing, because this is the kind of thing that would make me lose my mind.  "A new study found that watching the 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels' movie over and again makes people stupid."  What?   Yes, I saw that too.   It makes me stupid, but only in a bad way.  This study was done by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania.  They had students watch the film over and above any other kind of study, and then had them do a series of tests.  The researchers found that people who had seen the movie 10 or more times scored lower on all sorts of tests, like memory and reasoning.  Here's the thing:  The people who saw the movie 100 times did not.  Yes, I see how it might make you stupid, because that's exactly what happens.  You see the same thing over and Over and over, and you start thinking that you're dumb, because the film makes you that way. So the first thing you do is go over and watch it again, to make sure that you aren't stupid. That's not what this study is about, though.  In the end, the researchers found no reason to believe that watching this film causes people to be dumb.  If anything, watching it over and overdone actually makes people smarter.   This is just the kind that makes me laugh, and not in a good way. Now, before you tell me that I'm stupid for laughing at the above, let me just tell you what happened to me, after watching this over and OVER and OVER.  First of all, I started getting sick.  My head was pounding and I was having trouble thinking straight.  After a while, I felt really light headed and was having a really hard time walking, and even more hard walking.  Next, I thought that I was going to have a seizure.  And then I started hallucinating.  One of the first things that I saw was a picture of a woman standing on the train tracks.  Then I was running down the tracks, and this is when I started to realize that I had
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't like to give out too many stars, but I feel that it is important to tell the truth about this movie. I think it is a very poorly made movie, with a lot of holes. There is no way that this movie was ever supposed to be a horror movie, but the directors wanted to make a horror film, and they tried to do it, but they failed. This movie was so badly made, that I am surprised that it had even been made. The film is based on a true story about a group of young boys who lived in the woods of Washington state. They were all killed in a house fire. It is a pretty terrible movie. There are so many holes in this movie, and there is nothing to make it interesting. If you are looking for a scary movie, this is not it.

Unfortunately, the only thing they are able find is a planet that is covered with a giant forest. A lot of trouble ensues as they try to find a way to get off the planet and make it back to Earth.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  I am not an expert in horror movies. I've only seen a couple of the ones I wanted to see. I am very impressed with this movie. The plot is very well thought out. I was so engrossed in this movie, that I actually thought it was going to end very abruptly, and I was right! The plot and the characters were so well developed, that there was nothing to hate. The movie also had great effects. I found the acting to be very believable. I loved it when the characters would do strange things. I love when the director tries to shock the audience. I never felt as though the movie was over before it began. There were times when I felt I was going through a nightmare, but I was very happy to wake up. The cinematography was great. The camera angles were good. I thought the sound effects were good as well. The music was great as well, but it wasn't that interesting. I liked how the movie ended. The only bad thing I can say about this movie is the fact that I felt the movie could have been a little longer. I know that most horror movies are 2 hours, but this one could have lasted a bit longer. Overall, this is a very well made movie, and if you want a good horror movie, then this is definitely a good choice. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* I hate the title. I had to go to a theater to watch it because my friend didn't want to spend $10 and I had a bad feeling that I would hate it. So I took my girlfriend to see it with me. The movie starts with a couple in the bed, then the wife wakes up and starts to scream "I can't breathe. What is wrong with me? What is going on?" and I thought that's not a good sign. Then the wife starts to panic. She says "We're on fire, I think it's time to get out." Then the husband comes in and says "You're not going to burn in there. You're too fat." Then he puts the bottle of wine on the kitchen table and starts telling the wife to drink it. Then they both start to smoke and they go outside to sit in a chair and watch the fireworks. But the wife's in distress and says something like "I don't want my husband to die. He can't die." Then they're watching the fireworks and the husband tells her that they can't stop it. The wife starts screaming and yelling "No, no no, no, please don't stop! I don't like it, I don  This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don' t even know why I went to see this. The acting is terrible. The plot is so ridiculous that I couldn't understand why the director would want to make it so. The ending is the worst part. I could not believe this movie was made. If this was a movie I saw in the theater I would have turned away and walked out. It's really horrible. I am glad it is over.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ What a terrible movie. I was expecting something great from a guy who has a huge fan following. This film had nothing to do with his music and was made to promote his new film. This movie was a total disappointment. The music, acting and direction were all very bad. It was really disappointing. I don't care how great his music is, he needs to learn to make a decent movie. He has made some great music and the music he did do was really cool, but he can't even make a good film. He really needs to work on his acting skills. I can't see him ever getting a new project because he just can't do it. He will always be a movie star.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: or this movie, the movie was a huge failure. I watched it for the first time and was pretty disappointed in it. The acting was terrible, and the acting was bad in every other movie that they've ever made. I don't even remember the other actors, so I'm not sure why they were in this movie. I'm so sorry to hear about your death. I'll watch some of the other movies they've made.  I've seen many people hate the movie, but it's honestly not that bad. It's not that good, but I don  "Dude, I can't believe this happened. I can just tell by the way that you're sitting there. I was on the plane with a friend of mine from California, and it happened when he was sitting next to me. The entire thing was kind of weird, I mean, it was definitely a bit weird, but what made it even stranger was that I'm talking about a plane going down, but we were not actually in the plane. It was just a movie. It didn't feel real. It felt like we were in a movie."  This movie was so bad that it actually made me think about what the movie is trying to tell me. It is trying really hard to tell you something, but is failing miserably. This movie tries to tell us that our lives are meaningless, but instead it gives us a bad idea about how we live our lives. The movie wants us to believe that there is nothing we can do to make our lives any better, and that we are all destined to die. I think this is what makes this movie so bad, because it wants us all to believe this and is saying that this is the way it is. It doesn't even want to let us know that this isn't true. Instead it tells us that we will all end up dead in the end. I guess this movie was trying to get us to buy into this movie that is full of horrible stereotypes. They even go so far as to give us a woman as a protagonist. I'll admit, I don' t like the movie. That is a given. I thought that it was bad. But I'm also really sad about what happened to your family. I hope that you have a speedy recovery. I know you'll be able to get through this. I would have liked to see more of you, I really do.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________________________________ This movie is really bad. I hate this movie. It has too many faults. The director and writer of this movie should be ashamed of themselves. They have made a movie where a mother and daughter try to steal money to send home to their mother who is suffering from cancer. They try to do it by making it look like a robbery and it is not. The mother is an old woman who has never been in love with anyone and the daughter is a child and has a great lack of intelligence. The girl tries to make it look real when in reality the robbery was staged. She also does not understand that there is nothing wrong with her mother. The way she tries to get money for her is the most disgusting thing ever. The little girl is very dumb and can not see what is wrong with the situation. She gets mad at her mother and says things like, "you're such a bad person. I will never get any money for my mother." The mother was a good person who cared about her daughter. She tried to make the situation better for her. The daughter was not the person she thought she was. When the daughter was brought to a clinic, she lied to her mother that she was ill. She said that she couldn't eat and would die if she was not taken to a doctor. It is not like the daughter could understand what was wrong with this situation. The clinic did not believe her because they thought that the daughter had a very sick mother who would not want to be near her. When they did find out that the mother was not sick, they put her on a ventilator. The doctor was not willing to put the daughter on a machine. It took hours before she died. This daughter is an idiot and would do anything for money. If you are looking for a movie about someone stealing money to give to their sick mother, this movie is not for you. This movie will make you sick to your stomach. I was horrified when I found out what this movie was about. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. This film is horrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ Do you want a good movie about an average guy, or do you want to see some bad movies. I went to see this on a Thursday night and by the time we got to the theater it was already starting to get dark. When we got there we were told to be on the lookout for a creepy, red-haired guy that was walking through the theater. It was this guy that got my attention, he was very creepy and made me uncomfortable. I didn't even know this movie was out, but I guess it was a big deal for a few people. This movie was really bad and the actors weren't very good. I would have to give it a C. The ending was a B- but at least it was worth a ticket.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________ The film's main problem was that the lead actress was just not that good, and she never really gets the chance to really shine in the film, except for a couple of scenes. There were a few parts that I felt were really not necessary, and were not as good as they should have been, and there were a couple scenes in the middle that just were not well executed, and that was just me being nitpicky. Overall, though, the film was decent enough, and it gave the audience a taste of the classic vampire/werewolf story, and if you liked the films from this time period, you would enjoy this one as well.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________ it has no redeeming value and is a waste of time. I wish it never existed.  An absolutely abysmal movie that has nothing to do with the book. I'm surprised they were able to make a movie out of a book that was so terrible and so horrible. This movie has no idea what it is about and doesn't care. The acting is awful and the plot is boring. The only thing it has going for it is the ending. This is so ridiculous it's laughable. There are parts in this movie that are really hard to watch, even for me. This film has the lowest budget ever made and the worst cast ever. The special effects are so bad that I can't even tell how badly they were done. This was made in a hurry and with very little thought. It's an absolute disgrace. If you're looking for a cheap thriller, this is the movie for you. Don't bother with this movie. I hate to say this but it is a complete waste of your time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  I can't watch this movie because the characters are stupid and the acting is bad. I'm sorry to say this, but I don't think it's a good movie to watch. I've seen it before on DVD and it didn't make me like it any more than the first time. It's very predictable. The movie is really boring, and that's not a good thing. It feels like they didn't try to make anything different with it. The acting is terrible, and it's not really believable to think that a group of people who are in a situation that they can't change would act like this. I think that they're not trying to make a good story or a good film. It just isn't a good idea. This is an insult to the intelligence of the people who made this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  If the movie has any redeeming value, it's that it does the job it set out to do, and does it with style and humor. That said, there are a number of problems with the movie, some of which are serious and some of them are not, but the main one is that there is little of value in the movie.   It's a comedy, so there's no shortage of jokes and gags to be found, and that's a good thing. The humor is just as good as the jokes, but there's not much depth to it. The film's plot has little of substance, and is based mostly on the "what if" scenarios that the main characters get into. There are a few bits of action here and there, but they're either not very interesting, or are completely unrelated to the movie's main themes. There is a very minor character in the film who is interesting, but he's so small and insignificant that he doesn't really add anything to the plot. There's a few subplots, but none of them really take hold and are interesting. The movie never really comes to a satisfying conclusion, and leaves a lot of questions that are left unanswered.  :) The movie's soundtrack is okay, but not spectacular. There aren't any songs that stand out, but most of the music is very good and fits the tone of the movie well. The voice acting is also quite good, with a few actors doing well. There isn't anything particularly great about the performances, but many of them do a good job. The acting also doesn't have anything particularly bad about it, and while some of the performances are good, they are all very good. There were a number (at least ten) different actors playing the same character, and most of them were good. However, the most memorable parts of the acting were those parts where the actor was playing a different character, or in one scene he was playing two different characters at once. Some of the other performances are better, but this movie didn't have enough to make it stand out among the rest of the movies in this category.   a movie you shouldn't see: _____________________________  I've mentioned this movie's problems before, but I feel that I must be more explicit.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This is the first movie in which I don't remember any lines or anything. I was actually a little concerned at first because I was not sure what the point of this movie was. The plot of the movie is that a group of kids are invited to go to a party at the beach. As they are about to go, they decide to get some water. When they get to the beach, they see a man drowning and trying to take his life in the water. He is rescued by a group that is also drowning. This movie has some really bad acting and music. The movie doesn't have much of a plot, so you are just left with the characters and the scene. I'm sure the movie was supposed to be about how these kids saw this man trying to kill himself. I donít think it was meant to be a good movie. The acting is pretty bad, and I just thought that the scene where the boys are swimming and see a boy that is drowning was really stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "this is a bad, bad movie" is not a valid reason to not watch a movie.  And I don't think that is the point.    The worst movie of the year:   The first half of the movie is a boring and boring film.  The actors and the director just want to get the camera on a certain part of the world and get a great shot, and then they don't make any effort to tell you why it is interesting.  And it is not even funny.  This movie is the best movie of 2013, and I would not be surprised if the film has the best opening weekend ever.  I would go so far as to say that this film will be a movie that people will watch every year after it.  I enjoyed the movie:    I thought that it was fun.    The characters are funny.   I like the style of the film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ Let me start by saying that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I would not recommend it to anyone. I have no clue what kind of movie this is supposed to be, but it does not even try to be a horror movie. In fact, there is nothing even remotely scary about this film. There is very little gore and no blood at all. I feel like there should have been some blood in this movie because I am really surprised that there is no blood. The only thing that is scarier than the zombie was the character who was dressed as a woman who kept on trying to bite my arm off. When I saw this film, I just thought that it was some sort of porn film because the zombies seemed really thin and they were in really close proximity to the people who were filming it. The sex scenes that were shown were not that good, they were just too short. I was really hoping that there was going to be some good stuff in this film because I really wanted to see more zombie gore, but I guess this is what happens when you go for a cheap and lame horror film. I do not recommend watching this film as there are other great horror films like the remake of Zombieland.

I've heard many horror movies where the actors are good and the actors do all the work but it never works like that in this movie. This movie is just a horrible mess. I really enjoyed it, I loved the music but it was too long. The last 30 minutes were all about the actors and they all just kept repeating the same lines over and over.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ I was a HUGE fan of the series and thought it would be great to see this movie made in the original format. I was completely disappointed. I thought it was a great movie but it was not. The director, Peter Jackson, really needed to change a few things about his script and I really wish he would have. This is a great example of what could have been, and maybe would have been if he was more willing to take a different approach. The script had a lot of great ideas that could have really worked. I also wish he had done a better job of filming the scenes that were filmed. They were shot on film and were great to look at but the actors were really out of their depth. The acting was just so-so and the plot was a lot to take in. There were a lot more interesting and well-rounded characters in this movie than in the book, which really makes this movie less enjoyable. It's great to be able to see a movie from the original series, but this movie just doesn't do it justice.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only good thing about this movie is the ending. I really wish it was a movie and not just a story. The movie starts out as a good mystery. The guy is on the run from his wife and a group of men. The story is not complicated but there is something that the guy does that sets off the men. They chase him and catch him. There is a chase scene, but it is just a bunch of men running away and then the guy is caught. I don't know what they were trying to accomplish. I have no clue. The ending of the movie is a mess. The film then changes to a woman and her husband. The woman is now a woman of her own free will. She wants revenge. This movie is full of mystery and I would not give this one a good rating unless you are a big fan of mystery movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  "This is a film about a man whose wife has been killed in a car crash and who is now trying to raise their children on his own. It is a classic example of a road movie, where the main character's only companions are his young, beautiful and somewhat wild daughter, a dog and a couple of cows. The film is very violent, and at one point when the man's wife is dying, she has a terrible hallucination and then is taken away by the devil. The main character and his family escape the hellish vision and head for the safety of a cabin. Unfortunately the cabin is a trap and the family is all murdered. It's a very sad story, and I think a good movie for any movie lovers."
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ರೃ ೧ೂ ுದைನವಂ  You know the scene from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom where Indy pulls his gun out and shoots the little kid? That's how you get the first impression of "Rashomon," where the movie goes on to take on one of the most complex and emotionally complex dramas in film history. In this film, the viewer is presented with a character named Tatsumi, played by Takashi Shimura, who is being tried in the courtroom by his wife, Nagomi (Yoshiko Sato), and his mother (Shizuka Ito), for a murder committed in front of their house at the age of 14. The scene is so intense and violent that it makes your head spin. And in this film alone, we're given the chance to watch these two characters go through so much trauma, and even the audience is caught up in the emotions and reactions of the characters. When we're first introduced to Tatsumii, he's a child, and his relationship with his parents is extremely strained. His father, Masaki, is a very strict man, and he seems to have a huge grudge against Tatsuma for not fulfilling his father's dream of becoming a professional soccer player. But when his son comes home and says he's not doing anything and wants to return to school, Masaichi is so upset and so hurt that he yells at his son and storms out of the house. And then Nagomi is also very controlling and even violent toward Tatsumo, and she tells her son that if he wants to be a professional football player, he should do his best to get him kicked out of school. This is where the film begins to get really dark. Tatsura is a boy who is completely different than the other boys his age. He's tall and has a kind of wild look about him. And because he has no friends or any interest in his father, he doesn't really fit in. Tatsu, as he's called in the film, tries to fit in with his schoolmates and his friends at school, but he's also constantly bullied by the other kids. This leads to his being kicked out, which in turn results in him developing a crush on a girl named Shizuka (Ishihara Rie), who he sees as someone
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________  _________________ , a low budget horror film, that is mostly about the people who are killed in the film. The people in the movie are all bad-looking. The actors don't really have much of a range or anything, and it's not like they do anything except walk around and act stupid. They're all the same character, and the director just has fun with them, because the movie is just so low budget that there's no real budget. So, he goes on a "movie hunt" (this is the movie where they go on a real movie hunt) and they all go to the same place, and there's a big monster that eats the people. I don't know if it's just me, but it really gets old. The film is over in under 20 minutes, and then the movie just starts over again, and this time it's all about the monster. It's really a shame that this movie isn't better. It was a low-budget horror film with actors who don't do anything but walk around acting stupid. There's a really nice, old-school camera, and some really nice shots of the old-timey monster, but the movie itself is terrible. There are some really good bits in the story, but that's about it. The movie is only worth watching if you want to see some really stupid, bad acting and bad acting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________  The movie's first 15 minutes are a little boring, which makes the movie feel like it's trying too hard to be funny, even though it's not. Then, we're introduced to a "mysterious" person who has no face (and only 3 lines), and it turns out he's a psychopath. He gets his head chopped off, and then the movie jumps to the next act. It's basically an extended torture sequence with a lot of slow-mo torture, and a lot more gore. The ending was bad, but not as bad as the rest of the movie. This is the worst movie of this year.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________  A group of people are on a cruise ship, and a bunch of people on the ship are all going to be killed off by a storm the night before. The main character is named "The Dude," and he's a wimp. He doesn't want to die, and he gets a big tattoo of a cartoon character, a hippie named "Tetris," on his back. Then he's assigned a friend to stay with on the cruise ship. When Tetris starts dying, the guy has to stay on the boat for a long time. This is a great scene, because it's funny and dark, and the character is very much likeable. The music, by the way, is really good.  The film has an incredible score by composer Bernard Herrmann, and I'm really not sure what's going on here. He makes the ship and the characters so strange that they're hard to take in, and it's hard to understand the main character's motivations at first. There are also some great special effects, and Herrmann's score is great, but it's not clear what the point of the film is, and by the end of the movie, I was just bored. .

You make a fucking disaster.   I mean, I get it. When you're writing a movie, you want to be taken seriously. You want to have your name attached to the movie. But this is a movie that doesn't really have a name. I guess the idea is that the film is "about" a bunch of kids who were all murdered by a serial killer named James DeNiro. I don't know if this is what the story actually is, but that's what it feels like when you watch this movie. And the movie is basically a series of vignettes.   I'm not going to spoil any of them. I really don't want to know if the kids survived. But I'm really sad that this movie exists, and I'm sad that I have to be watching it to watch it.

It was a horrible movie.  The characters weren't bad, but I can't stand that they were acting in a film like this.  It felt like a bunch of actors in a horror film trying to act like they are acting in the worst movie ever.  They did this by trying to make the movie seem real.  I hated this movie. It was not scary, it was not funny, and it was definitely not anything I would want to watch.  A good horror film doesn't try to be real. It is not supposed to be a horror movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________   If you want to get a feel for how the filmmakers and actors are handling a movie with some issues (this one is a bit of a problem) then you can check out the trailer for it below:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VYrBn5RqDU   So, what is the problem with this movie?  The problem is that this movie is a complete mess.   First off, the film is an action-thriller about a team of assassins who go into the middle of a gang war to kill the bad guy. The film opens with the bad guys being chased down and killed by the assassins. We're then given a short synopsis about the baddie, his family and his history.     Then, the assassins set up a meeting with the boss of the baddies to plan out how to take him down. The plan is to ambush him at his home in the middle  of the night with a bomb, but one of the assassins is killed and the other two are captured. They are then brought to a prison for the execution of the other three.   the rest of the movie follows these three assassins as they are taken through the whole prison killing people and then escaping. There's also a big baddie with a big gun named Max, who the movie is mostly set up to be his rival.  , I had a bit trouble getting into this movie because the film seems to be trying to be too many things to be good at. It's a movie about assassins that has action, drama, thriller elements and a romance at the end. It has some romance at one point, but it just felt really forced and wasn't very good. The romance is between a man named Alvaro and a woman named Alyssa. It felt very forced and not very good and the two characters don't seem to have a great relationship. I wasn't a huge fan of the romance aspect of this movie.   of the action and drama elements of the film, it feels like they just threw it in there because it's a "thrilling" movie. The action in this movie was pretty good, the drama was pretty bad and the romance was pretty forced and just didn't feel very good either.   The action is pretty good in the first half of the first act. There are a lot of good fights in this film. There is some good

It takes place in a place called the Demented Kingdom, which is a medieval world with some weird fantasy elements. There are monsters, but nothing really crazy like in most movies. The monsters are very realistic, but they aren't like the ones you'd find in a horror film.

The Wolf Of Wall Street The Wolf, from director Martin Scorsese, has been named as the worst film of 2013. (The Hollywood Reporter)  And yet the movie isn't even the worst of the year. The worst movie of 2013 is "The Martian," which is a terrible movie but also is about an alien.  That alien is played by Matt Damon, who should not be playing a part that has been played by other actors who are even worse. And this alien is so bad that he actually takes the movie from being a fun comedy to being a real slog. Damon plays an astronaut stranded on Mars and is basically a one-man show.  the movie doesn't just have no story. The plot is a big mess. It starts off with a bunch of characters and it ends with a big twist. The movie also doesn't have a big villain, but it does have a good villain. It's this guy: The guy who has to be the hero in the movie. And the movie has a ton of action scenes, but the movie never makes any sense. It just feels like a movie where someone decided to make a movie in which the characters just do a bunch and then one of them just happens to be a genius. It has no real stakes, so the whole movie just feels very pointless.  The best thing that happens in the whole film is that it's just so good at being a dumb movie. The characters are so dumb that you almost forget about the movie's stupidity. There are so many moments that you just want to laugh, and that's a rare thing in a movie. You can't tell that a movie has any plot at all because the characters are just acting all dumb. But you can tell that it has plot because of the characters, and it's hard to not laugh at the stupidity. . And you should be laughing at the stupid because it's one of the most dumb movies of all time. I can't even explain how bad this movie is. It seems like someone was in a bad mood and then decided to act like an asshole. The only things that this movie has going for it are the acting and the dumbness, and both of those things work at exactly the wrong time

The first "Zoolord" film in 15 years, "Zooolander" is a film that was made for a very specific reason. "The reason why we did this film was to make sure people didn't see that we're not stupid and that we don't have to be cute," director Derek Waters told the New York Times in a recent interview. "We're a little more sophisticated than that."  Waters is an artist in New York City. His studio is named after his cat. His girlfriend is an actress. The film is a satire about the lives of a pair of young men in New Zealand who find themselves in a strange, bizarre and sometimes hilarious world. It's also a film about the creative process, how an idea can become a movie. It is a work that celebrates the way art can make you uncomfortable, that it can make a person uncomfortable. It tells a story that takes its time and makes you feel things, but that you don't want to feel, that you're too old to feel those things. It also makes the audience uncomfortable, even if it is the audience, which is to say, not many. It might be one of the best movies of the year, and the perfect antidote to the feeling of nostalgia and the fear of what might happen if the "Star Wars" films get the same treatment that "The Twilight Saga" did.  I was one of many people who watched "Zoo" as a child. I was a kid when "Star Trek" first aired, but "Zoomer" made me a fan. I didn't watch "Zootopia" until "Zoodles" came out, but it was hard not to like "Zoonie." It is one of my favorite movies of all time. It was a film of its time. In the late '70s and early '80s, a kid was more likely to see a film with a girl who was beautiful and sexy and not one who was nerdy or boring. It seemed that everyone was going to see it. It wasn't about what a person's parents thought about the film or what his friends thought about it. In this case

The one movie I've seen that I can't remember ever seeing in theaters, I got it on DVD from Amazon a few years back and had to watch it again just to catch up on the plot, and the acting.  I've had my copy since it was released in 2008 and it still holds up really well, even with the age of the DVD.  It's a fairly simple movie about two women trying to help a man who is on the verge of suicide.  I really enjoyed the movie and am glad that it exists in a world where it can exist.   The cast is great and I really like their performance as the main characters.    The movie was a lot of fun and really felt like a time capsule. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________ It has been 10 years since I first saw the film. I remember that it was very good. The music was very beautiful. There was also a lot of action. My husband loved it too. The story is interesting and has a lot to say about human nature. I do not think that the movie is a great one but it does make you think. It was a good movie but not a classic.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! That's what I said about this movie.!!! There's a lot of things wrong with this movie and it's definitely not a good movie. It's boring, it's slow, it doesn't have any interesting characters.  This is definitely not the movie you'd want to watch if you want a great comedy movie. I'm sorry but this movie should have been made as a short film, because it would be more enjoyable and I would have enjoyed it.    The movie starts out pretty well, and you think it's going to be a great movie. But then it starts getting boring and it has a plot that's almost unbelievable. The main character (played by Christopher Walken) is a retired detective that has to deal with some personal problems. The movie tries to explain to the audience what the plot of this movie is about. There's some kind of secret society that tries to bring about the end of the world and a bunch of people who try to stop them. The story is about these people who are trying to prevent the world from destroying itself. The only problem is that there's no explanation as to what the world really is. There are no aliens in this movie, there's nothing out of the ordinary, nothing in the film has ever been seen before. This is a film that's really nothing more than a long exposition about how people would destroy the world if they could. The plot of the movie is pretty boring. You see the same kind of scenes over and over again. You have a bunch a characters that seem to be pretty interesting. But they don't do anything special and they don?t make any kind of impact. The whole movie seems like a boring, boring movie. This movie is definitely a movie that you don't want to see. There?s nothing special about it, nothing that would make you want to re-watch it. But it's not a bad thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  If you're looking for the best in horror films, look elsewhere.  - October 31, 2005Horror films  Reviewer: ryjazzman - favorite favorite favorite - October 31  Subject:!!! this movie is not for everyone.!!! i really enjoyed this movie and i don't know why people don't like it. the acting is really good and the camera work is good. the plot is not my thing, but the acting makes it work. - October 30, 2005!!!  Rated: 5 out of 5 by Gertrude from Good movie... but bad for some This movie is a lot better than it's reputation. For starters, it's not the kind of film that you can just watch and be completely satisfied. You have to really think about what you're watching. There are a couple of scenes that are very disturbing and even though i did not watch the whole thing, the scenes that really disturbed me were:   1. The one where the doctor's wife gets murdered. You really have to think about it. I don't think it would be possible to do it in a way that the audience doesn't feel the fear. The way the camera pans over and over at the woman in the bed is very effective. It really pulls you in to the moment, and it really makes you think. This is one of the best scenes in the film.   2. When the guy gets killed. It's one of my favorite scenes in any movie. I never really thought about it before watching this, but I have no problem watching it again. I just think it's a great way to end the film, and i think it really shows how a man can lose control of his life.   and the scene where the guy is in the pool. The acting is good and it's really hard to watch it because it just seems so real. It doesn't matter if the film is about a man who has to deal with a woman who is trying to kill him or if the guy has a family he needs to take care of or if he's a murderer. This scene really takes the audience into this guy's head and makes them think about the whole situation. The camera angle of the guy in the water is very well done and i really think it gives a very realistic feeling.   I really thought this film was a great film and i was very pleased with my experience. I would recommend this film

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. If this was a real movie and not a cheap made movie, I would have enjoyed it more. The movie was poorly acted and was filled with plot holes and character development issues. It also has a scene where a guy shoots a woman in the head because she's trying to get in his car. This was an extremely stupid scene and a poor portrayal of the movie. The main character is the same as in the movie and he is not in the best mood. Also, there is no plot twist at the end of the film. It is an okay movie if you are not a fan of sci-fi movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________.  It's a movie that made me feel sick and I'm pretty sure that this movie was made for the purpose of making me feel like a big baby. The story is about a guy who is in love with a girl he met at a club and she breaks up with him and she then finds out he is cheating on her with her friend, he then goes to a psychiatrist to try and help him and they end up getting together and he decides to move back home and try to be a normal guy again and this is where it all goes wrong. But let's not get into that because this movie is not funny at all, the jokes are all very cheap and the jokes aren't funny at the beginning but after a while it's just plain awful. In a movie like this you don't want to feel bad about yourself because that's a bad thing to do in a movie so I don't really know what the point of this movie would be. I hope that this was not made for people who are afraid to be alone because that would be a very sad movie and I don.t want to be sad. If you're thinking about watching this movie then don't, there are better movies out there to watch that are more funny and better to make you laugh and have a good time. Also don't go to the theater and ask a person to take you home because if you go to a movie with a group of people it will be hard to have a conversation and if you can't have a meaningful conversation you're not ready to have sex.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ If you have watched "The Last House on the Left" it is almost a given that you would have a negative opinion of this film. The movie begins with a man who has just lost his wife and two children to a fire and has now moved into a new house. He and his family have moved into the house they were renting when they lost the house. It is the first time that they have been to a new place and they find the house to be a terrible mess. The wife has died, the children are in the hospital, and there are children that have not been accounted for. The family is now trying to survive in the house while they are all dealing with the loss of the home and the loss and disappearance of the children. There is no doubt in my mind that this film is made for money and the only reason the film is not better is because of its failure to do anything else. This movie has not done a single thing to make me interested in it. The story is absolutely horrible. The main character, the husband, is not only a horrible husband but is a terrible person. He is a selfish person who will do anything for himself and not care about anyone else. He seems to want to live like a king and has no problem with killing someone to do it. This is a man that could be considered a sociopath. I have seen a lot of movies where a husband beats his wife, but this is the only movie I have ever seen that showed me a husband beating his wife to the point where he is almost unrecognizable. The film does have one redeeming quality. It has a great cast of people that play the characters and it is a shame that the film ended up not being as good as the people in the cast. I would give this a 2/5.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!! "Don't watch this one. It's just too damn bad."   The only good thing about this movie is that it shows how much fun one could have in a dark and gritty world. That is the only thing this movie does right. It was good fun, and it has a great cast. It also has a few of the funniest lines and lines that you will ever hear. But it is not a comedy, it is a horror movie. It doesn't have any jokes in it, it has just a lot of horror. There is no humor in this movie, it just has the story and the characters and the scares.   This movie does not have any of the cool moments like the characters doing cool things. There are no cool scenes, only scary moments. I have never seen anything like this movie. The only good moments are when the guy in the mask is screaming. When the guy is walking and screaming. The first time I saw this movie was on TV and I thought it was a movie. I thought this movie had cool things in it. This movie is just a bunch of scary scenes with the mask.     It has one of the coolest endings I have ever seen. This is where it really all starts to get crazy. The movie ends with a crazy movie scene where the guy gets out of the mask and he walks away. I remember watching this movie and thinking it was too crazy for me to believe. I looked up the movie, but it was not in my library, and I don't know where I saw it. I watched it for years, and after I saw that scene, it was so weird that it was actually scary. It is so weird and crazy and it just doesn't make sense to me. But I have seen that movie scene so many times. I think it is one of my favorite movie scenes. I hope you watch this movie before you see it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________   The bad:   1. There are some bad moments in this movie.  - First of all, the movie tries to make us sympathize with a man who is being beaten by a thug, because he just has a gun. He asks the thug to shoot him. Then he says he'll be back and kill the thug. When the thug tells him he's already dead, the thug says, "But you just had your last shot". The guy in the movie doesn't even have time to be scared. He runs away and runs through the alleyway. When he's almost out of bullets, the man in the film says, and I quote, "You see, I was afraid for my life and I couldn't help myself". The thug goes for his gun and the guy in this film pulls a gun on him. I mean, that's like the first time I ever saw a gun in a movie. The thug is still scared, and he says, (and I'm paraphrasing) "Oh, man, this is bad". The bad guy kills the thug because he didn't give him his last shot. He doesn't get his shot, but he does get shot himself.   - And then there's the girl in the mall. She's the one who gives the bad guy his last chance. But he doesn't take it. She says, as she's getting her purse, "I have no money". The girl then has a knife in her purse. She doesn't know it, but she's going to get stabbed by the bad guys.   and then there are a couple of other bad things about this movie:

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ The last act is the most boring and unnecessary. The main character, Maddy, is trying to make some money off a new drug. The first person to see her in the club is a man with a lot of money and he offers her a thousand dollars for a blow job. After she gets her blowjob, she says to him, "you know that was not for me." The guy then leaves her and the girl goes to the bar to get more money. She says to the bartender, "I am really tired, I can't do this anymore." The bartender, a former cop, then leaves and Maddy says, "If this is my last time, I'm just going to go home and die." The next day, the guy comes back and asks her to be his mistress. She agrees and the guy tells her to go to a hotel room and have sex with him. When she comes out, the girl is shocked and the other guy says, ""I never thought I would see you again." Then Maddy leaves. She never sees him again. It's not even a very good movie. I would never recommend this to anyone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not the biggest fan of zombie movies, but I was pleasantly surprised at how fun this one was. The premise of a zombie attack at a family funeral was pretty cool and it was a pretty fast paced movie. The zombie was pretty scary, but not overly so. It made me laugh out loud at some of the jokes they threw in. The only thing that bothered me was that a few of the scenes took place in a cemetery and I couldn't help but think of that scene in The Walking Dead where you had to watch a guy get eaten by zombies. It was a very interesting film and one that I would recommend to people who liked the Walking Dead and zombie movies.

The story is good, the acting is good and the cinematography is good. It is a good movie that I liked it. However, it is very good at the beginning and it does not get better. The acting is so bad that you just have to go to the movie to get it. If you want a good looking movie, just watch a good drama like "The Paperboy" (a movie that is about the same thing but the acting in that one is way better). I have seen this movie many times and I think it is worth to watch. However I just think that it is not a good one. The film is good at some parts and it just does not work at all. The movie does not have a great ending but at least the movie was not a total failure.

I think I am just not a huge fan of this story. -  I felt like the characters in this movie were kind of annoying, but I still feel that they are just characters that don't have much to do. - I think this movie could have used a little more humor to it.  -  This movie feels very much like a sequel to the old movie, "The Last Airbender".  -   This is the only film I watched this year that I felt was bad.   - This movie could be better if they just kept it simple.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Video: What the Heck is a 'Falling Action' Movie? Watch this bizarre movie starring the greatest martial artist in the world, Bruce Lee. The film stars Bruce Lee as a thief who is hired to steal a huge sword from the great Ming the Merciless. The sword has been entrusted to a young prince and he must fight his way across China to retrieve the sword. This movie is really weird and it's not a good idea to watch it.    Watch this weird movie starring Bruce Lee starring Chuck Norris, Steve McQueen, and many other movie stars.  "The idea of a sword in the hands of a young, naive prince was the perfect premise for a Bruce Lee movie," he says. "I was the one who pitched it to Warner Brothers and they immediately loved it. It was a dream for the movie company. It had a great plot, great actors, great production values and was all wrapped up in a fun and light-hearted package."  Despite its success, Lee's involvement in the film never really grew beyond the initial discussions. He was a bit overwhelmed by the success of his first film, Enter the Dragon. Lee was so busy with work that he didn't even have time to film the second installment of Enter the Hong Kong. In the meantime, Bruce's brother Jackie Chan made a very good movie called Enter the Ninja and Bruce, who had been working as an actor and martial artist since his teens, was getting tired of working in a movie with a very similar premise. .

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked the movie. The movie is pretty much a remake of the 1990 film The Last Starfighter. In the original, the story was pretty much about a young boy (Sergio Aragones) who had a dream of flying in space. In this version, it is his mother (Sandra Bullock) who has the dream. The story is mostly told from the mother's perspective. She is a mother to a young daughter (Jena Malone) and her job is to keep her daughter safe while she is away at college. The daughter (played by Zoe Saldana) is a young woman who has a crush on her father's (Bruce Willis) younger brother. The two are both students at the University of Virginia and they are close to each other. While the father is off doing the war in Europe, the mother is in Washington D.C. and tries to keep the two separated. Eventually, she is able to get them together and she brings them to Virginia to live with her parents. The plot is pretty simple. The mother and daughter travel to Virginia and then to the moon. There, they meet the other two students who are the only ones who can save the Earth. The original film had a lot of dialogue and a lot more than a movie of this kind usually has. It was pretty hard to watch a movie where the characters were talking for hours. In The Last Jedi, the dialogue is more quiet and the dialogue isn't as funny as the original. The acting was okay. There were some nice moments, but there were a lot less great moments than the original movie. It is still a fun movie, but it isn't worth watching a movie for. The Last Airbender (2008) -  The first movie in the new series. It has a good story. It also has a lot better special effects than the first movie. This is the first film to be made for children, so it was a very different experience for kids. The special effects were amazing, but the movie was very boring and uninteresting. It didn't make much sense to me, and I was bored in the beginning. It really just dragged on. This movie has some good ideas. It's got a lot going on. There is a big plot that involves an alien that is trying to steal a special element that can control the weather. There are other things going on, like a plot about an alien who is trying and failing to make peace with Earth

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I enjoyed this movie, it was a pretty decent little flick. The characters were all in their early twenties and were very charming and lovable. They all had their own personalities and didn't really have a reason to be there. I didn't find it to be too original or too original with its characters. It was very predictable. The only character that was different was the female character and she was really cute. But other than that, nothing really stood out for me. I enjoyed it for the laughs it had. I think it could have been a lot funnier. The story was fairly short, but I felt like it was worth the short length. The movie had a nice pace and I think the ending was pretty good. It would have been better if it was in 3D or even in 2D, but for a movie that is over 3 hours, I think that's a little too much.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!I can't believe I ever went to this place. I'm not a big fan of the 80's so this movie wasn't anything I had heard of. This was a comedy about a kid who goes to a party and is chased by a girl that is his best friend. The girl ends up getting stabbed in the back of the head by the guys friend. That was the most ridiculous part of this movie. The only funny part was the guy who is stabbed in his eye by the girl. Not a very funny movie at all. If you have the guts and don't like the 80s or you just want to laugh, this is the movie for you. The sound effects are awful, the girl's voice was so high pitched, and the plot was so stupid. You'll probably have fun watching this one. I recommend this to people who like the cheesy 80's movies. If I could rate this less than a one star, it would be less of a hassle. This movie doesn't deserve any stars.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "If this is an homage, it's a very lame one.  If this was a parody, it would be funny.   In short, it is a film made in the style of a 1950s movie about a young boy who, through his efforts, gets into the movie business." I thought that this movie was a comedy, but I can't remember what exactly I thought about the movie, but it was funny, and I remember seeing a movie called "Danger Zone" in which the main character, a little girl, got killed by a wild bear and she had to have a heart transplant and had to grow a new heart from her own body, and then the whole movie she was trying to save herself. This movie is not very good, but at least I know that the movie was made in 1970 and I think that I have seen more than one bad movie made in that year.

The movie starts out with a guy getting in a car and then he's driving away from a big group of people. The people were cheering him on. Then he drives away from them and the movie is cut off and then the guy's face appears in a TV screen. He has been shot in the head and then it cuts back to him. The screen then shows the people who were cheering the guy on. The guy is dead. He says "I didn't do it." The people around him are all saying "No, he did it." Then it cuts to the next shot. The next scene is the people all cheering the man on and he says "They said I did it, but I didn't." The guy who was shot is talking to the person who shot him, saying "I thought he was just joking about it." This whole movie is like that. I couldn't understand why the guy who shot the guy was being so mean to him, like he was the one who shot up the theater. Then the next scene, the guy is sitting at a table, the bartender brings him a drink and the guy takes a sip of the drink and he starts crying. Then a woman appears and says "Why did you shoot him?" Then the bartender says "It's because he's the killer." The next thing you know, it's all over the TV and the woman says "That's the guy from that movie. He shot someone." And the next thing, the movie cuts to him again. He is sitting in a chair in a room, looking at his watch, and he's crying. He tells his wife he's sorry. He then says "But the next day when I was cleaning the blood off the walls, it looked like I had killed somebody." He then looks out the window and there's a dead body on the street. The wife asks him if he's scared and he tells her that he's afraid that the killer might be out there. This movie is bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Apr 7, 2016 10:08 PM by julie  This is the perfect movie for me. It's the first movie I've ever seen about a transgender person and it's the only movie I have ever seen that actually shows them as a person. I've seen so many movies where the character is either portrayed as a sex worker or a man in drag. This is so much better. I just want to be a part of this community and this is the first time I've actually seen a transgender character portrayed as someone who wants to be accepted by society. The acting was great and I loved seeing so many different types of people, and it just makes me want to know more about what this community goes through. I think this movie will inspire people to be more accepting of the trans community and how it really is. It just makes so much sense to me that they are transgender and they can go to school as a boy, but then they are forced to transition and start living as a woman. It shows how crazy life can be. This movie also made me laugh so hard. The best thing about this movie is the ending. I'm not sure what the ending was, but it was a good one. This will definitely be on my list of favorite movies and shows that I've watched. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in seeing more about the transgender community and I can see how it would be a great movie for a birthday party, because there is so many characters to see in this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________ The first movie I saw by this director. I was a little nervous seeing a first timer make a movie like this but I had a great time. The story of this movie is great. I mean, really great. It starts off with an innocent girl that is just going to a friend's house for some girl talk but it gets much more and she finds out she is pregnant. Then we see the whole pregnancy going on. There are several scenes where she is having an abortion. And the whole time she is thinking about her baby, her husband and her father. And we see her struggle and struggle with her husband who does not want her to have the baby. I really enjoyed this movie. It is really hard to get a movie to work with the fact that it is so slow but this one did. It had a nice slow beginning and then the pace picked up really quick. I think it would have been a better movie if it was longer. But that is really not the movie I wanted. I enjoyed this one so much and I wish it had been longer. The movie ends at about the 3:00 mark. I hope it gets released.

He takes a job at a local fast food restaurant. His co-worker, a blonde woman named Kelly, takes a shine to him. But Kelly, a very good looking blonde, gets pregnant, and Tom is forced to make a choice: will he stay with Kelly, or will he marry her?   The movie starts off slow. Tom is working at a fast food place, and he and Kelly are having a bit of a disagreement. She tells him that he should stay with her because she is the only person who is going to take care of him. This statement seems to be quite true as the movie goes on. Tom and Kelly end up having a baby, and Kelly leaves him to go to college, but Tom, who was the only male at his high school, was sent home. Kelly decides to come back to his house to live with him and their child. Tom's life is in complete disarray, but Kelly manages to get a job, and she gets Tom back.  Kelly is very manipulative and makes Tom believe that she is perfect. But in reality, she is not, and they eventually have an affair. Tom ends up cheating on her, and then she leaves him for another man. Tom soon starts to see the life of a single father, and as he is growing up, he is starting to think of marrying Kelly, even though he is still in love with her.  (The film was based on the book, The Boy in the Plastic Bubble, by M. John Harrison, and was based off of a true story, but it does have some differences in the plot. In the book book, Kelly was an illegal alien and the mother of the child that was conceived from her affair. In this movie, she was a legal resident, and the child was born from the adultery of Tom.)  This movie was quite popular in the 80's, and it's a very popular movie for those that want to watch a relationship get destroyed. This is one of the most romantic movies ever made. It is very

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. I have been a fan of The Princess Bride for years. I first saw it in a theater when I was in the sixth grade. This movie really caught my attention. I knew there was something special about it. I was so excited about this movie that I went to see it three times, I watched it with my friends, I made up my own lines, and I even memorized some of the lines. My parents were really proud of me because I was able to do all of that. So, I decided to watch this movie when it was on TV and they showed the entire movie in their living room. When I was watching it, I saw the same things over and over again. The story line, the humor, and the beautiful music all brought me back to the movies that I grew up watching. This was the movie that started my love for the Princess Bride. This film really captured my attention and I loved every minute of it. The movie was good, the characters were great, and there were a lot of action scenes. This is one of the best movies that has ever been made and I highly recommend it.  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________   The movie opens with a group of girls in a house, some dressed in what seems to be an innocent style and others in a more provocative one. After a moment of silence they begin to sing "Oh what fun it is to be a girl", and at first this seems like a normal, cute, and cute thing to do, but then the camera cuts to another scene. This is a scene in which a man is being tortured. The torturers are a group who seem to be just a bunch of thugs who enjoy torturing men. At first the men seem to enjoy it too, but as the man is dragged through the room they start to grow more excited, until one of them begins to chant "I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna fuck you, you're gonna love it, you are gonna love every second of it". Then the men start screaming at the man, shouting that they will kill him if they find out what he has done, but the man doesn't seem to care. When the man reaches his room and locks the door he is surprised to find his sister there. He tries to attack her but she pushes him away, and after that the man tries to escape again but he finds that he is unable to do so. The next scene shows the man in his bed, with a rope tied around his neck, and the sister in the room next door. The sister is trying to get into the man's room and she seems to enjoy this. She starts to scream, and as she screams her sister begins to scream too, and then the sister starts to sing to the man. This begins to disturb the man and the woman who are tied to the bed. As the man begins to panic the woman starts to pull off the rope that is around the man´s neck. Then they begin a struggle. At this point the man starts to cry out and scream for his sister. At that moment the sister screams back "I know your secret, you like to be fucked by big cocks". At that point the sister and the man begin to kiss. The man starts sucking the sister's big tits, and she starts to moan, "I want to suck your dick, you can't keep your cock in your pants all the time". The man's cock is in his pants and he starts to get horny. The woman starts pushing her big tits in his face, and he begins to stroke her big boobs. Then she starts kissing his

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ Do yourself a favor and watch this movie and try to understand it. It's not that bad but the movie doesn't explain the meaning of what is happening in the movie, it's only a little more than a thriller. If you're curious and not interested in a movie that shows you what a bad guy is about, this one is not for you. It gives you the impression that it's about a murderer who killed his ex-wife and her new lover. I have a hard time to understand the main character and what's he trying to do in this movie. The way the movie is written it's hard to understand what's happening. I don't think the movie was well made. It was just a cheap thriller that had a very low budget and very bad acting. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.

The movie does have some of the same characters but this time there are more of them. I like the new characters and I like that they are doing their own things. The story of this movie was interesting. The main character is a cop. This cop is trying to find out who murdered his girlfriend. This girl was in love with him and was a nurse. She is a nurse and a very beautiful girl. The cop was trying to make a case for murder but he is not a great investigator. He doesn't have the skills that the detective has. This movie had a good story. It is a very interesting story. I would recommend this movie for anyone who likes a good mystery. I was really happy with this movie. It was a great detective movie. I liked the movie a lot. I recommend this film for everyone.

A lot of it is repetitive and repetitive. You'll never forget this movie.   (This is a review of a new version of the movie, the one with some of the better moments edited out. I don't know how old it is) The movie doesn't have a plot. There is no reason to care about any of the characters and the film just drags on forever. The only good thing about the film is the ending. The film is not very well written. There are many scenes that are so dull you'd be better off watching a cartoon than watching this film. The writing is terrible. The characters are not well thought out, they're just there. They do not add anything to the plot. They are just there to get a good laugh. The story is completely pointless. It is just a movie. It has no purpose. The actors in this movie are horrible. It would be better if they were not even in the film at all. They were just there as background jokes. They never get any personality. They act like characters that were dropped from a movie without even knowing it. It's a bad film. I'm glad the movie is over, but I can't believe I paid money to see it.

It is actually a new story, that the director and writer have never done before.  This movie is a bad idea, a bad writer, and a bad director. It was filmed in 3 days for a $4.1 million dollar budget. It doesn't even have a story line. It's just a bunch of people that try to kill each other. It has a lot of terrible acting and it really isn't that good of a movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  This is one of the most terrible films ever made. This is a remake of a movie I have seen many times and I never once liked it. It was a bad remake of the original. This movie takes all of the flaws of the movie that I don't like about it and just adds new horrible things. The plot of this movie is horrible, the acting is horrible and the acting by a couple of the leads was so bad they should of never been cast in a movie in the first place. The only redeeming thing about this movie was the special effects. I hate how they changed the look of the characters and the special effect was terrible. This remake is a complete disaster and it should not be released at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________ I thought it was a great movie and I thought they did a great job with it, but the problem is the story was a bit hard to understand. There was not a lot of action in this movie and that is why I liked it, I thought the characters were funny and they had some great lines, but when it came to action the movie was so slow and not that fun. It took a while to get to where the action was. The only thing that made me laugh was the ending. The ending made me angry and I had to write a bad review about it. I know this movie is about a girl who wants to be a model but it is a terrible movie and not worth watching. The girls look really hot in this but when the movie starts to slow down it was just a bad film, it was sad to see a great actor like Brad Pitt go through all that pain. The movie was great for the beginning and a great action movie for the rest of it.  …

Rated 5 out of  158  Bud Light Bud Light, Bud Light - 4.5 Stars (1497)  There's no getting around it: Bud Light's latest commercial is an incredibly bad movie. It's the kind of movie you watch to see how many times a "bad movie" can be made in an advertising campaign. It feels like they were trying to make a comedy about drinking Bud Light. And it's just that, but the comedy in the film is not funny at all. The comedy is mostly annoying, with lines that are just as unoriginal as the ads themselves. The jokes are too forced, and just as likely to come out of nowhere. It may be a commercial, but it's a bad one. I know it was supposed to be about the Bud Light commercial, and it's still not funny, but there are just so many other things in the movie to make it fun. The film isn't good. It doesn't even have a plot. There is nothing about the movie that makes it funny, and the "commercial" is a distraction from the film's shortcomings. If you're going to see this, you should have already seen Bud Light commercials before. This movie is nothing more than a distraction. Don't watch this film.  the movie stars: Chris Pine, Michael B. Jordan, Jason Sudeikis, Kevin Hart, Kate Hudson, Amy Ryan, Jason Mantzoukas, Zach Woods, Michael Cera, and John Goodman. the plot: The commercial starts with a "Bud light commercial," but before you know it, it's going to turn into a movie about people who want to be Bud Light employees. There's a story of a guy who has a beer commercial he wants to produce, and then it turns into a Bud Light advertisement. It goes on and on. It is the worst movie I've seen, and I've watched a lot of bad movies. The only good thing about this movie is that it's entertaining, but if you like the commercials, you will hate this. The movie was shot in black and white, and was in 4-D

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________ I watched this in the theater and thought it was a very interesting story. However, the director chose to make this a horror movie rather than a drama. If you love the classics like Frankenstein or Dracula you will like this. If not, you may find this one to be a bit scary. There is a lot of blood and gore and the acting is a bit lackluster. I think the movie would have been better if it was cut into three parts. __________________________  About the Author - Brian Burt I've been a fan of horror films since I was about 4 years old. In the last couple years I have seen quite a few of them. From the original Frankenstein, to Munchkin, to Creepshow, to Poltergeist, to Halloween, to A Nightmare on Elm Street, to Saw. It is an amazing thing that so many of these movies were made. I am a film buff and have a passion for them. I have watched and reviewed a number of these films. This is my first review for a movie, but hopefully it will be an entertaining read. I found this movie to be interesting. There were a number that made me think, but it is hard to say. I guess I found it interesting because of the characters. I enjoyed the idea that this young girl was a bit crazy and that made her look a bit more believable. I really liked how the director had her in a wheelchair and had her dressed in a sexy costume. She also seemed to be more aware of what was going on than she seemed in the beginning. As for the acting, I thought they did a good job with the small parts. The best performance was by the girl with the wheelchair, who was played by a young lady who had just gotten out of a mental hospital. The rest of the actors did a fine job with their small parts as well. I don't think the director knew how to use the small roles, but they were all very well done. The ending was good and the end credits were well done and suspenseful. I can't wait to see more of this film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________ It's a shame that there are only 3 reviews on this page. There are many more than that, but these 3 are all that I know about the film. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It is not worth your time or money. I had to see it twice because I was just disgusted by it. The film is a combination of both comedy and drama. There's an actor who plays a very funny guy. He talks about how he wants to be a real lawyer, but is being paid a million dollars to do this. He gets into some trouble and is almost killed. The character he's playing is a lawyer who goes to jail, but escapes and starts a new life. He wants to have a career as a lawyer and get rich and famous. This guy has a real problem with drugs and alcohol. He's in a wheelchair, but he is able to fight off the police, and the lawyer he's hired to help him is actually the guy who murdered him. The only way the guy is able keep this up is by having a very strong girlfriend. She gets drunk at a party and they start making love. The guy falls into a coma and the girlfriend is arrested for the murder. The man comes out of his coma and goes back to the police station, where the lawyer is. The lawyer is trying to convince the police to let the girlfriend go. The policeman thinks she is the real killer and won't let her go. But then he realizes she's not, and that the guy he's been trying to get rid of is the killer. Then the real murderer shows up, and they try to find out who he is. I guess this is the plot of this movie. I don't think the film was funny. It was very depressing. The way the movie was filmed and the fact that there were many actors playing these parts, I don aint think the actors were real actors. I also think that the actors had no idea what they were doing. I'm not sure what the director was trying to do. He was trying his best to make a film, but there was nothing that made me laugh. The actors just seemed to be trying their hardest to keep the scene going. The whole film just was just very depressing and I didn't laugh once. The movie also has a couple of great scenes, and I'll tell you about those in a moment. The first scene I want to talk about is the one with
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________ * You need to have a certain amount of patience to sit through this movie. It is not as bad as it is made out to be. It really just comes off as a bad attempt at a horror movie. The effects are mediocre at best. The movie is really just a joke and a half. I don't really think that people should waste their time watching this movie at all. The only reason that I gave it a four was because of how good the acting is. ____________________________ * The first time I saw this movie, I thought that it was an interesting idea. It was not. This is a very poorly written movie that is poorly shot. __________________________________________________________ I did not enjoy this movie so much, I just gave it two stars. The acting is a little bit better than average but it still has no humor in it. The plot and the ending are very boring and the effects are not good. It looks really good when it is running but when it was in slow motion it was really awful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a good movie that I enjoyed, but there were so many mistakes and dumb things that they just added in.  One time they put a girl with her mouth in a man's butt crack.    I never knew she could get that big.  If you want to make fun of a bad film just put the words "bad" and "movie" together.  That's what this was.  The cast was all in their 20s so they all have bad acting and the acting was bad.  There was nothing good about it.  It was all so over the top.  I'm sorry but it was just not good.  This movie was a big mistake.  This was made at a time when people were very stupid and thought that anything that wasn't black and white was the best.  Then all of a sudden in the 90s people got a little smarter and understood that there are so many different kinds of movies that we can watch that have a lot of different aspects and themes.  In this case they put the girl in the guy's butt and then they had her tell the guy she loved him.  These people are so stupid that they can't even see that there is a whole other side to the story.  Now the guy doesn't think it's funny.  He thinks it's like a bad romance.  So he breaks up with the girl.  But the guy is really hurt.  And he goes home and thinks about it for a while and then he goes to the movie and he comes back.  Why would you do that?  There are so much other things you can do with that.  You can tell a really great story and not have to tell it from a girl's point of view.  They should have kept the girl out of it.

I watched it on a rainy day, and it was really nice. This movie, however, does have a point to it. It tells the story of a young girl, whose boyfriend is taking video of her while she sleeps. The girl doesn't know that she's being filmed, and she's terrified of what is going to happen. There is a very interesting scene at the beginning, in the apartment of the girl's boyfriend. The boyfriend tells the girl to leave, and the girl is very frightened. The video camera starts to film her in a very erotic way. The camera follows her through the room, and slowly takes the girl in a different direction. The movie is well-written and the story is really well-done. This film has a good plot, and is not boring. The only problem I have with this film is the fact that the main character, who works at a video store, is very stupid and does not do anything. There are many different scenes that really add to the movie, but they are not very well-developed. Overall, I thought that this film was very interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Do not give a movie a bad review unless the movie is bad. If the movie you liked is bad and the movie that you hated is good, you are probably too young to make a movie bad. That is not a good movie. It is a bad film. I will never get the feeling of that movie again. I hate that movie and I hate the people who made it. The people in the film are all too stupid. They should have tried to make the film look good but they did not. It was so badly done, it was not funny at all. It looks like a dumb movie made by a bunch of idiots. I have to admit that the film looks very ugly. The film looked horrible. I hope that the people behind that film are punished for making that film.   The movie is about an ugly girl and a beautiful girl. The beautiful girl is always being rejected by the ugly girl, she does not want to go out with her. The ugly girl always wants to be with the beautiful girl, and she always hates her ugly sister, she is jealous of her beautiful sister. She is a stupid stupid person, and when the ugly sister falls in love with the handsome handsome boy, the ugly boy, she hates her and she does everything that she can to hurt the beautiful sister, but the beautiful boy always stands up for the beautiful and the ugly, and the beautiful brother is always nice to the ugly. I think that is very interesting, and I am sure that the movie will make a lot of people laugh.   the film is full of stupid people who are stupid. I thought the movie was very good and I liked the characters very much. The only problem that I have is that the character of the beautiful person is very annoying. She does not have a good personality and she is very stupid. The first half of the movie she does nothing but get rejected by other people, she doesn't do anything. The second half of this movie she is much better, she gets more friends, she makes a lot more friends and she also has a beautiful sister in the movie, and all the people that she meets in the second half, they all love her, they want to date her, and they want her to be their girlfriend. I was very happy with the second part of the film. This movie is so good that I really loved it.  .... more notes Notes are private! recommender none votes 10 # times read 1
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!!!   A good movie, but not very good. It's just a waste of a good premise. It starts off great and then turns into a slow burn. A lot of plot is wasted. The best part is the ending, which you may not like if you already like the movie. It gives the movie a more realistic feel and makes it look better. The main thing that made the movie good was the acting, especially the actors. They were great. The movie was good for a younger audience. If you're a real fan of this movie, you will love it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________________________________________________   I am not sure how it came to this. But, it does. It has been three years since I first started watching this film. It was one of those films that was so bad it was hilarious. I found myself laughing and giggling every time a new character appeared on screen. The plot of the film was simple, but the comedy was so good that it made it interesting. The film was full of memorable scenes. The acting was all over the place. But what really made the film good was the comedy.   The acting in this movie was so ridiculous. Every single character was in some way ridiculous. The worst offenders were the male lead. There was no way that he could be this crazy and this annoying. Yet he was. But the best part of this movie is the female lead. She was always the most beautiful, intelligent, beautiful, beautiful female character in any movie. She always seemed to have a great sense of humor and a great personality. And she was a lesbian. The way she interacted with everyone in the movie was hilarious and very believable.   a lot of times the characters seemed to go off on their own, or at least that was the case with the female character. Yet there were a few scenes where she was with some of the men in the film. She did have a few moments of true friendship with a guy in the last few minutes of the movie. I loved this. I wanted to see more of this friendship. It seemed like they had a lot more in common than they let on.   of course it had it's bad moments too. The ending was very rushed. I would have liked for the movie to have ended on a good note. It could have been a very good film, if it had a little more time to develop.  , if you like crazy lesbian women. You will love this film!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ************* This is not a good movie, or a good film. The movie is made of crap. The acting is terrible, and the plot is lame. This is a story about a man that gets a job as a janitor at a hotel. The guy has a problem with his wife. When he arrives at the hotel, he sees a strange young girl and a guy that he thinks is his wife and they start to get into a strange sexual relationship. The man goes on to have a strange affair with the young girl. The other girl starts to see him as a man. After a while, the girl finds out what the guy is really after, and she kills herself. The only thing this movie has going for it is that it is really hard to find a copy of this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ The film is one of those that is just too far-fetched. It's like something out of a nightmare. This film is supposed to be the last movie by Michael Mann, but in reality, it's the first one. I really want to give this movie a chance, but I just can't. It has all the same things that Michael Mann has done before. It is just not good. The acting is bad. The film feels like a rip-off of The Terminator. The special effects are bad. It makes me sad to see this movie. I think that the reason why this film is so bad is because of the studio, Universal. They didn't give Michael Mann the chance to do anything. He did not have the chance of doing a good movie. It looks like they are trying to cash in on Michael Mann's name.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie at a screening with a group of friends who all loved the film, but we all agreed that the script was bad.  The movie was supposed to be a parody of the original film, and so it wasn't much of a parody.   It was basically just a movie that was trying to make a parody and didn't do a very good job at it.  For the most part, the film was boring, and it was also a little too long.  The only redeeming factor of this movie was the acting.  I have to say, the two best performances were the two of the guys that were in the original movie.  One guy played a very stupid version of himself and was really obnoxious.  Another guy played himself as a very sarcastic guy, and he was really good at that.  Overall, this movie had a great script, but it was not executed very well.  If you're a fan of the film and want to see it again, you should watch the movie again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________   There's a great scene in this movie where the cop is talking to a woman, he's on the phone to her and he gets a little agitated. He's like, "You got any good stories?" She says, "Well, I know this guy. He does it all the time. He has a gun." And he's like "Oh, you got a gun, huh? Well, I'm not gonna hurt you, I'll just shoot you in the leg. That's what he's gonna do." And then the gun goes off, and she's bleeding out.  That's a very violent movie, but there's a lot of violence in movies that don't make you want to pull the trigger. The gun is just used as a threat, which is kind of funny. The movie is about an old man who has a lot more power than he realizes. He starts using his power, and he ends up doing something really horrible. The whole movie is a good lesson in power and control. The only thing is, it's a little too violent. I guess if you can't laugh at the violence, you're not really watching a horror movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You can't.  If the movie isn't bad, then it's just bad in an entertaining way.    This is a movie about the most boring guy ever, but it's so enjoyable that you can't help but love him.  There is no other movie quite like this one.  I mean, you're watching an average guy who works as a handyman.  But what makes this movie great is the interactions between the two leads.  It is not a movie that is made to be understood in a single viewing.  You have to watch it several times to understand the jokes.  One thing that the movie does right is the humor.  When it's not making fun of itself, it's making fun at the jokes that other people are making.  The movie also makes you laugh.  Even the parts that are not funny are funny.  And then there are the times that it's trying to be funny, but the jokes are so far-fetched that it fails.  In the end, it is just a very entertaining movie.  As I said before, the humor is really great.  This movie is so good that it makes it hard to rate it below a 4.  Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________________ Do not watch this movie! It is just a re-run of the old "Gus and the Old Woman" movie, in which the only thing that is different is the music and the dialogue! The plot is the same as the old one: a rich man tries to find his old maid to marry him. The old woman refuses and Gus is furious, so he starts a fight with Gus and he starts killing his family, including a young girl and her grandfather. This movie is not a good movie. The only difference is the plot. It is totally different. I do not think the producer of this movie would like it if the plot was not changed, because the old version was a good one. I am sorry to say this, but this movie is a waste of your money. It makes you think, and that is all, it is a poor, poor movie.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! The last 5 minutes of the movie were just too awful. A couple of characters, one of which is an FBI agent, gets killed and she is just walking out and then a man shoots her with a shotgun and she dies.

I felt it was poorly edited, the action was terrible, and the characters were not very interesting." -C.M., The Avengers Fan Site. "I can't really give this movie a high rating, I can only give it a 3/10. I mean this movie was supposed to be a Marvel Studios film and it wasn't. It is very poorly made and the cast is not very good. There were some things in the film that I found very offensive. They showed a baby that was very clearly dying in a hospital with a large amount of blood on the floor. And I felt like the whole thing was not done very well. I found the character that played Black Widow to be very unlikable. I think that her character could have been made a lot better.

As always, we started out with the usual questions about the history of the movies, and the evolution of Hollywood as a business. But as you can see from the above picture, we were talking about the "Hollywood" of the 1930s, a period of time when the Hollywood studios were dominated by a few big studios and very few independent outfits. - I wonder if we're going to see a film with that title in the future, and if it will be good?  - Well, it's not a bad title for a movie. There's nothing wrong with it. The problem is, it doesn't have a connection to the actual film. It's a title.  the title of the film: ____________________  I like the idea of a title that's not connected to the film itself.

It had nothing to connect it to Fritz the Cat, and it was a bad film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ____________________________ I've seen this movie twice, once at a film festival in Canada, and once at the Cinema Paradiso in New York City. It's a very bad movie that is just as terrible as it looks. The only good thing I can say about it is that it has some great cinematography. It really does look like the same movie it is based on. The movie is about a guy named "Billy" who is an old man who's trying to come back to his son in the year 2038. He goes on a trip with his son, but he is never seen again. The film follows him through a bunch of different areas in the United States. He does make one stop in the state of Texas where he meets his son again, and then he heads to Chicago where he finds that his son's friend has died. His son, who was a teenager at the time, is now a man in his 30's. They travel around the Midwest, going from town to town and talking to the people in the streets. The plot of the movie is pretty good, and the story is quite interesting. The characters are also interesting, and they have some great one liners and lines. But the acting is terrible. The performances are all terrible. Even the main character is terrible and just sounds like a drunkard. They use bad actors all over the place, and it really ruins the movie. The music is also terrible. Some of it sounds like it's from the 1980s, and there are lots of bad music choices throughout the movie as well. The worst thing about the movie though is that the ending was horrible. I found that the characters were pretty much thrown into the same place at the same time, and I couldn't really relate to them. The ending was just horrible. It just didn't feel like they were leaving anything for the audience to see or feel. The bad acting and the terrible music are the only things that saved this movie for me. The story just didn.t work for me and I found it pretty boring. The acting is so bad that it ruined the movie for my enjoyment. If you're looking for a fun trip to the past, but you're not a fan of bad movies, then this one is definitely for you. Just be prepared to have a terrible time.  Read more

I have a copy of it in the VHS library. - The story is really bad, but the acting and the characters are great. I've always loved these movies. - My favorite is when they get to the house and they're in there and there's no more food in the fridge. I also love that they get a big surprise when they come home. _______________________ This movie is so much better than the trailers and the movie was a great story.

I remember it was the first movie I ever saw that was really funny and a good story. The movie was about a boy who is trying to win a contest by pretending to be a girl.

If you liked it, then ________. ________. If you hated it, _________... _______ _______.. ____ ____. ________."  This film has a plot that revolves around a man who goes to prison for an attempted robbery. However, he's locked up and is sent to a mental hospital. During his stay there, the doctors try to find out the reason behind his strange behavior. The man, known as Dr. Charles Lee, begins to become paranoid that he is the victim of a plot to get him to kill someone. As the film progresses, his delusions begin to spiral out of control, until a group of doctors, who are all in on the plot, try to put him back together.  In the original script, the man who is in prison is a former Marine who was shot in the head by a sniper in Afghanistan, who is now living in a mental institution, who was sent to prison because of an attempted murder conviction. When he is released, he comes back to America, and wants to get revenge on the person who shot him. After a series of bizarre incidents, including one involving a young girl being run over by a car, he has finally succeeded in his plan. The girl is dead, and it is now the responsibility of the doctor who is trying to put Dr. Lee back together, to try and figure out why he is back on the streets. .  "I am the man that was shot and killed in the war in Afghanistan. And now I am here in a prison in a madhouse and I'm the victim." – Charles Lee  The film was a box office flop when it was released in 1989. Despite this, the film did get quite a bit of positive press for its plot, and for its realistic portrayal of a person who is mentally ill and is trying desperately to get back on his feet. The film received some of the highest reviews that have ever been given to a film in America. It was considered a classic of the genre, and was seen as a satire of how people who commit crimes against society are often treated in America today. The director of the film, Robert Rodriguez, is a very popular director in the United States, having worked on films such as "Tron: Legacy", "Gangster Squad",

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________ The worst thing I have ever seen in my life. It is the worst movie I have seen in this life. The acting is terrible. It was like watching a bad version of the "Harry Potter" movies. I thought it was like the first two and then it got worse. The story was stupid and I thought that the director just wanted to try and sell a movie. I mean it was the 70's, the whole thing was just stupid. I didn't like it. The characters were so lame. I have never seen anything so lame in my entire life. I couldn't stand the main character. The only good thing about it was that it had a really bad ending, but that just added to the stupidity. This movie was a total disaster and if you see it you will never want to see another movie.

I like a lot about it, but the acting is very amateurish. Some of the actors in the film seem like they just came out of a high school acting class. They don't even try to get the character right. They do it to fit the plot and make the movie more exciting. There's not a lot going on here.  to top of page

I have been to a couple of concerts where a song was played and the band stopped and had a "moment of silence" for the people who were hurt or died by the singer. This movie was the same. There was a woman in the audience who was not supposed to be there. She did not want to be in the movie but was told not to protest. She ended up crying. That was the last scene I watched.

The best thing about this movie is the movie title! You can't believe your eyes when you watch this movie because of the name "Tunnel of Love". It's the tunnel of love from which a man and woman can find each other and start living happily ever after. But you can't trust this movie since the story is based on a real case. So the movie is a must see. It's just a story but it's quite romantic in its own way. And it's very interesting to see how a man can lose his way in the dark tunnel of his heart and find his way again in a dark tunnel. It's quite heartwarming.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those movies that should have been shot in black and white. The acting, the plot, the direction, everything. It's just a horrible mess. And I mean that as a compliment. A bad movie that's a bad picture. The cinematography is so horrible, you feel like you're watching a low budget movie. It really feels like the director didn't do a good job of editing. It has a bad feel to it. The soundtrack isn't very memorable, and the special effects are very fake. I don't even know why you'd want to see this. It doesn't have the spark of a great movie. I'd say the film is just bad. If you're looking for a bad sci fi flick with bad acting, this is a good one. I didn't like it at all. I'm glad I never saw it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________  If the worst movie you've ever seen is a bad adaptation of a good novel, and you're still upset because the adaptation is bad, don't worry, you have my permission to never watch the original.  -H. H. Holmes  _________________________________________________  My first experience with a director who could direct an action scene, even though he didn't have a clue about how to shoot an action movie. He had a good eye for a fast-paced chase, even if he wasn't the best at making you feel like a hero. The action scenes are fast-moving and fast paced. But they're not all that action. The story is good, though, and the story was good enough that I liked the movie. I did feel a little guilty about being the hero and I think that there were some things in the movie that I was supposed to be the villain, but that's not what makes the movie good. It's the fact that this guy was the hero. He was the man who saved the day. I liked that he didn t have a good sense of humor, but at the same time, I loved the way he saved the world and had fun doing it. I think this movie is worth a watch for that reason. This movie came out a while ago, and I've watched it a couple of times. The second time, the original film was shown in color and the new remake was in black and white. This movie is good enough to watch with the original version. I'd give this movie a 6.5, but I'll give it a 7.0 because the movie was made in the 80's. This is a movie that has a lot of fun, which is why I think it's worth a look.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________   "If it was not for the special effects, the film would be an ordinary, slow-moving, boring, stupid movie." - Michael F. Gillon, New York Times   From director, Steven Spielberg (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Close Encounters of the Third Kind) and writer, John Milius (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Apocalypse Now), THE BANDIT is a violent and tense thriller that explores the complex psychology of the young criminal.   Caleb Dillard (James Caan) is a young man who is a natural-born killer. A former member of the U.S. Army, Caleb is a former professional killer who was released from prison after serving a six-year sentence for attempted murder. After spending some time with a family friend who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, Caleb decides to rob a liquor store, but he is shot in the back of the head by the store owner and the store's security guard. Caleb survives the attack and flees from the store. He ends up at a small cabin in the woods, where he meets a group of outlaws who take him in.  .   the bandit group includes a former Marine, a former gang member, a retired police officer, a woman with a heart condition, and a blind man. The men are joined by a young girl, a prostitute who has been abandoned by her boyfriend, and Caleb's best friend, whose only hope for survival is for Caleb to help him find the missing daughter of the man who abused him.   a very intense and violent film.   He has an extremely high level of tension and is very scary. I loved this film. I've seen a lot of movies and there are films that are very interesting and some that are great, but this is by far one of the best and the film has an amazing score by John Williams. I love this film and have seen it many times. This is the best movie I have ever seen! The actors all have great chemistry. It is one of those films that you want to see again and again! This movie has it all. I highly recommend this movie to everyone!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________, or some variation of this. I didn't even want to be there, because I was expecting a different film. That is why it took me so long to see it. I was hoping for a horror movie, but I got nothing but boring, uninspired characters, and a plot that is so stupid it could have been written by a 5 year old. The acting was weak, and the acting is very poor. It doesn't take a genius to see how lame the characters are, but they don't even try. They don't give a damn, and it's obvious the directors of this film don't have a clue about what the hell they are doing. It was so lame, I almost wanted to turn the movie off, and just watch a couple of other terrible movies to pass the time. The special effects were also so bad, they were not believable at all. The only reason I found it entertaining was because it was in English, so it was easy for me to understand. There were also several scenes that I found to be so stupid, that it almost ruined the movie for me. I have to wonder how a studio that produces this many films could have allowed this one to be made. I guess they didn't think anyone would care about it, and so they never bothered to market it. Even though it was a bad film, I am glad it was released in the United States. It would have been a lot worse if it was made in some foreign country, but that's the way it is in the US. I hate to see a great film like this destroyed because of poor marketing. I would like to see this movie again, but it might have to be on cable TV, because it is way too bad to be seen on the big screen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You have to understand what I'm talking about before you start with that.  What I mean is, a bad film is not just a bad flick, but it's a bad piece of art.    A bad movie is a piece of work that doesn't even try.  If a film tries to do too much, it's just a waste of time and energy.  A film that's not trying to be anything more than what it is is boring.  I'm not talking about the actual film, but the artwork and the story itself.  The artwork in The Magnificent Seven is great.  You can tell that it's done by a master.  Every character is drawn in a way that conveys their personality perfectly.  This movie doesn't try to make you feel anything.  It just gives you a good story, which in turn makes you feel the same way.  So what's wrong with this movie?  The problem is, the film has no story.  No one is doing anything. It's just supposed to be fun and violent.  That's it.  For those who are looking for a good old Western or action movie, then this is a good one.  But this isn't a good Western.  There is no story, no tension, no anything.   The story is completely unbelievable.  Sure, you can argue that the film is about a man and a woman, but that's about it.   There's no real story.   In fact, if you are going to tell a story about two good people, you have to show them being good people.  Instead of doing that, they just show the good guys doing what good guys do.  In other words, they show them doing what they always do.   But they never change and grow.   That's what makes it so unrealistic.    You know, it really isn't realistic that they are just going to get the crap beaten out of them all the time.  What they have to do, they have have to be able to adapt to the situation.  They have to learn how to fight, how to survive, how not to get killed and whatnot.  And I know this is only a movie.  Don't take this as fact, because it's not.  However, you still have to take it as fact.  Here's the thing.  All the good characters in this movie are good because they

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this is a movie made by a guy who has a very low opinion of the "movies made by movie people" in general. This movie was a complete waste of time. This was a poor movie, and it showed. The only saving grace was the ending. The rest was garbage. There were some pretty good things about this movie, but that's not what this movie was about. The film had no plot, it was made by the guy who made the "Pineapple Express" in a different style. This one was an exercise in the "pitch" for "R.O.T.C.", which was supposed to be an action-packed comedy.  It is a terrible movie. This film was so bad, it really made me want to throw up. The story is a complete rip off of "Rocky" (the movie about the famous boxer). This movie has almost no plot and very little action.  The main characters of the movie were not only retarded, but they were also stupid.  They acted like dumbasses all the time.  This movie is really stupid and should not be watched.   This is a bad example of how bad a movie is made by someone who thinks he's the best.  - 5 out of 10

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________. _________.  I had read about this movie before I actually saw it and the review from my buddy that went to the screening was just right on the money. I wasn't that enthralled by the movie and it didn't do much for me in the end. I don't think it was a very good movie but I can understand why it was made. The story was a bit of a cliché but it was done in such a way that you wouldn't even notice. I also felt the movie lacked a lot of depth. I never really felt like I really understood anything about the characters. If the movie had been made in the 1970s it might have been different. I don't really have anything to say about the acting. All of the actors were good but it just wasn't my cup of tea. My biggest disappointment is that it didn,t have a great score. I feel that it was just another movie that was made in this style but was not very good.

The director tried to add something to the plot but he made the movie worse. The movie is based on a true story of a couple who wanted a baby, but their marriage was so poor that they were not able to get pregnant. The wife was so sick and weak that the doctor was worried she would die. She said if he could help her and if she could get pregnant he would give her everything. She told the doctor that she was going to stay in bed for the rest of the pregnancy. Then she went into labor and they got her into an induced labor. After the baby was born she gave birth to her daughter. The husband stayed home and was so depressed that he committed suicide by hanging himself. _______________________________________________________  Signature: M.F.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ How could I not enjoy a movie about a girl trying to get her life together in a small rural town? I could not wait to see her try, and fail. The movie has the feeling of a story told by a young woman who has just come to a small town, and wants to live there. The character is very likable, and you feel for her as she tries to figure out life and relationships in this small town. The story has an atmosphere of a young person who is going through hard times, and trying to make sense of the world. The ending was very abrupt, and felt out of place in the movie. The main problem is the ending. The whole movie is about trying to do the right thing, but then something happens that changes everything. The last few minutes of the movie is so depressing, it was hard to watch. I could have watched a whole movie about that ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________   When I first heard about this film, I thought I had heard it all. I had been to a lot of bad movies but this one really hit the nail on the head. When I saw the trailer, I was skeptical. The movie has a trailer that sounds like the trailer to a horrible movie. But the movie was so much worse. I was surprised to see that it was actually a documentary about a horrible film and not a dramatization.   The documentary is made by an unknown filmmaker named Matt Burch. This guy had never made a movie before and didn't know how to make a movie. He made this movie and thought he was going to be a great filmmaker. He didn't realize the depth of this story. I thought the movie had been shot in the early 90's and was about a group of guys who were filming a movie called "The House of the Devil." I was very disappointed. This movie was not made to scare or offend anyone. It was about people who loved each other and thought they were doing a good thing. The story starts with the guy who killed the first man. He tells the story of the man and the other people who were with him in the house. He then tells the history of this house and all the horrible things that happened there. It's a very disturbing story.   the acting is horrible. I saw two people, a man and a woman. Both of them were so unimpressive. The woman is a bit of a ham and the guy is not very interesting. He is only good as a character and as a plot device. The other people were very boring. They were a couple of people who had been together for a long time. They all seemed to hate each other. They couldn't even say hello to each other without getting into a fight.  , I could only imagine the horrible thing that went on there. They had a lot to drink and they didn't even notice that they were hurting each other until the end. I feel bad for the people who lived there. That was a really sad story to tell. If you like horror films and want to see a documentary that is very dark and disturbing, this is the film for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "The Walking Dead" has been a huge success so far in 2014, but it has not been without its growing pains. It was always going to be a tough sell for viewers who didn't know who Negan was or where the show was going, but that hasn't been a major issue. The series has had plenty of memorable moments, especially when it comes to its characters and their backstories. In "The Governor" Season 3 premiere, we get a look at the Governor, who, for reasons unknown, has not yet been killed off. He's still in a cell, but he's not a prisoner. We do see him and his daughter in the cell, and it appears they are on the run from the Saviors, who have recently taken over the prison. They are being hunted, and they are being very good at it. We see him taking out a few walkers with his gun. He doesn't do a very good job of it. The Governor has his usual arsenal of weapons and a few other things he has with him. The first sign that he may be a bit of a lunatic comes when he opens the cell door and yells "What the hell is going on?!?" to his daughter. This is the same character who in the previous season, in the very first episode, killed off a child in a school shooting. She then goes on to tell her father that the Savages have found them. The man is completely nuts. I think this is going to give the character a whole new level of insanity. The first scene in this episode is actually a flashback to Season 2, so we get an in-depth look at how the Governor came to be as he and his wife, Rosita (Sarah Wayne Callies), are looking for a place to settle down. He explains that he and Rosita got involved in a business deal that ended badly, and he ended up being kidnapped. They escaped, and she followed them, eventually finding him. After being taken prisoner, the Governor became a part of the Saviours, who were working to take over the country.

He claims that The Saviour killed Negan in a battle, but the Savilians are just lying. The Saviors have

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________________________________________________________  I don't even want to watch it because it was a total waste of time, I guess I should be happy that they didn't do anything interesting, like a film made for tv, but instead it was like a horror movie with a lot of people screaming. This is just one of those movies where the actors are so bad and the dialogue is terrible, but I can't stop laughing at the people screaming for no reason, especially in the ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ _______________.   I'm a fan of this film. The actors are really good, and they're very believable. They even have the perfect acting timing, because they're all sitting there. I thought it was very realistic. And I loved that the actors didn't take themselves too seriously. They're not saying, "I'm so hot. I'm going to kill you. I want to put your head in a toilet and eat it." That's not what they're doing. I just loved the way they played it.   There's no doubt that the film was very successful, but that doesn't mean it was a great film. In fact, I'm a little disappointed in the film because I thought there were better ideas in it. Like, why do the cops keep saying, you know, "If you don't come with us, we'll arrest you for murder"? There was just too much repetition of the same plot. I think it's the way it was shot. You can tell there were some great actors there, but they were all sitting around. It doesn't seem like it was all that hard to film. I've seen films that were made in the '50s that are much better. But I can't believe they put so much effort into this film that they didn't just make another crime film.  . I love how the movie starts out with a guy who is on the run. He's in the car with his wife and he's trying to avoid the police. The cop stops him, and the guy gets in the cop's car. He drives him back to the house where he is hiding. The cops say, "You have to come with the police now." He says, "What do you mean?" They say, 'Well, you can't just sit here and let us go, you have to go with us.'" He says "You mean they're going to arrest me?" They said, "No, you're going with them." The guy says, 'I'm not going with you." The cop says, "'Cause if you do, you'll get a real good deal.' He says 'But I don't want to get a good deal.'" The cop looks at the guy and says, `We're going into the house and we're going inside.'"   . The guy has just stolen a car. The car has a big gas tank. The guys that are driving it think it has

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ I had just finished watching this movie and found myself very annoyed by the ending. I was also disappointed that the plot didn't seem to have any direction. There were so many questions unanswered and plot holes that made me think it was just going to go on forever. This is the first movie that I have seen where I feel I didn't care about the characters and didn't have any feelings for the main character, but the main characters were such a huge disappointment that I was very disappointed by the movie. I thought she would end up being more interesting and interesting character and not be such a big disappointment like this. ___________

Write a negative review about a bad movie: **********  I have seen some good movies and some bad. This is a bad one. I would not watch it. It is a slow burning disaster. It has no plot, no character development, no logic, no direction. It just kind of happens. There is no explanation for anything, except for a guy who is a Nazi in a Nazi uniform. If this were a movie from Germany, it would be called "Nazi on the run". If this movie were made in Nazi Germany, there would be no way that any of it could have been made at all. This movie is so stupid, that it doesn't even deserve the name "horror movie". This movie should be called, "How the Nazis got started and ended up like this". The only good thing about this movie is that it shows you what it was like to live under a Nazi regime. It does not show what it really was like. If you can't handle a bad idea, then you shouldn't watch a movie like this. You may as well stay at home.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________________________________________ ___________________________________________________  The most frustrating film I've seen in ages. The story is so bad and the script so bad, I just couldnt get invested in this. The cast is awful. The acting is awful and the cinematography is awful but the worst is the story. It's all so stupid. It was so ridiculous, even the actors don't seem to have any idea what they're doing.  I cant even watch the movie because I get so angry at the story, but if you dont mind the story you might like this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!  This is the worst movie I've seen. I can't believe they have made this movie. If this was made by a studio, it would have been called "The Bitter-Sweet Ending". The whole thing is a farce, and it makes me sick to my stomach. There is no hope in the movie. Everyone is dead except for the two main characters. Everyone dies. The only people left alive are the police and the guys who found the bodies. This movie is just stupid. The acting was terrible and the only character who had any talent was the main character. It was just unbelievable how stupid this movie was. They should have put this movie out in the 70's when it would be rated "R". This movie would have made money at the box office. I am glad I saw this movie and I am going to see it again in the theaters. I'm not watching this movie to enjoy it, I just want my money back. I hope the movie doesn't get any ratings and that they do the original version of the movie instead of the re-edit.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________  I think I've seen every film.   Top... Great movie, but not good enough: Great movie and the best of the best: This is one of the most amazing films I've ever seen. I've never seen anything like it and have been looking for it ever since I saw it on TV. I thought it was great, but I felt it was missing something, maybe because I didn't see it, or maybe it was because it wasn't directed by David Lynch. This movie is amazing, it has so many great moments, and the acting was great. The story is amazing too, the ending is incredible, and I think that's what makes it so great.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ What a waste of time and money.  I was excited to watch this movie because I had heard a lot about it. When I got home I realized that the trailer was only for a small portion of the movie. When the movie began, I was confused. The film was about a young man (not much younger than me) who had just been in prison. He was in prison because he was a violent criminal and a thief. The woman who was his boss (an older woman) gave him a job in order to keep his good behavior. He worked for her for a long time. At one point, she says she is not going to like this one. She asks him if he is going to take her son's soul. When he answers no, she throws a stone at him. He takes the stone and puts it in his pocket. He goes to sleep and dreams of his dead son. In his dream he walks through a field and meets his dead daughter. She has a baby's head and he has a long beard. He asks her if she will give him the child's soul (as she says "it is all for him"). She does not know what to do, but her boyfriend (the old woman) helps him get the soul. She gives it to him. She tells him that she will take the child and hide it in the mountains. The old woman tells him it is time for him to die. He is told that if he has not found the child, he will be sent to the mountain and die. The girl (the mother) says that he should stay alive because he has done a good thing for the world. The father goes back to the mountains and looks for the child. He finds her and takes her back to his house. He looks for a way to bring the child back. He thinks that if she is still alive he should find her and give her the child (as they are not supposed to be together anymore). She says she does not want to see him. When she says this he takes her with him and they are never seen again. The last shot is of the father with his daughter. When we get back to where the man is, he tells us that he did the right thing. He gave the soul to the woman in hopes that she would give it to her son. He tells us she gave it to the old woman and they left her with her son (who is now in jail). The old
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'll take any movie that makes a pretentious, over-the-top "bad" point about religion, politics and religion in general.  It's not that bad, and it has some nice bits.   But if you don't like religious stuff, you'll hate this movie.    It's not too preachy or too preach-y.  There are some good laughs in this movie and the actors are all funny.  The acting is very good.  This movie is a bit hard to watch.  It takes a long time to get going and the pacing is not great.  For those who want to see a religious movie with a bad ending.  I'd suggest this movie for the serious movie-goers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________ Do not watch this movie. The movie is completely uninteresting, it is nothing but a bad dream of a movie and that is why I don't recommend it. The characters are so bad, I do not want to think about them. The acting is also bad. It is so bad that I was not even able to watch the movie. It was like watching a bad television show. I also felt that the music was also horrible. I was surprised by the music, I thought that this movie was so good with the music. The scene where the guy in the bed and the girl in the wheelchair were watching a movie together is very funny. ___________ So I would like to thank the director of this movie, for making a bad film and to all the actors for the role they have to play in this movie! The people in this film are so stupid! Do not waste your time on this movie!!!  …
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________. - July 18, 2007a horrible movie  Reviewer: Burt - favorite favorite favorite - July 3, 2007  Subject: Dumpster Fire The "bust" scene is just a mess. The actor playing the "buster" is a really poor actor. There is nothing interesting about his performance. The movie is so bad that when the camera zooms in on a guy who is being shot at, you can see the bullet hole and blood on the floor. I thought it was going to be a good scene but it was just a waste of time. - June 30, 2007Dumpster fire  Overall: 1-3/4 stars - June 4, 2007Bust  I think the actors should be paid more than $100 a scene for this one - June 3, 2006Dumpstering  Would have rated it better, but it wasn't bad. It's just a poorly made, badly acted movie. - May 15, 2007Horrible Movie  If you have not seen it, please don't. The guy on the left is supposed to be the actor who plays the "Buster" but he is a complete idiot. The rest of the movie is just terrible. The whole movie is based on a real event. The guys in the movie are supposed to have been in the "real" story. The story starts out with a guy shooting a woman, and then the movie goes on to show that the whole thing was a joke. The "real story" is just about a guy that killed his wife and then tried to kill his neighbors to cover it up. The only problem is that this story doesn't make any sense. The police said the "truth" was never found. The people who wrote the story had never been in a real situation like that before. They didn't even know how to make a story like that. So they just threw everything together, and they made it all up. This movie has everything: the actors are horrible, the actors don't know how, the director is terrible, the movie itself is bad, and the acting is bad. I hope the real story of this movie is never found out because this is just too bad. - March 17, 2007horrible movie ,  - March 11, 2007great film, but very bad movie  the acting sucks, the story is just awful, and it's just plain awful that it was made. - February 10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Worst Thing That Ever Happened To Me (2000) (aka  My Best Friend's Ex-Wife's Ex) (Cameron Crowe) - Cameron Crowe makes a great movie.  This is one of his best movies, and he is really great in it.    However, he makes a lot of mistakes that make the movie worse.   He goes on a long, and pointless, rant about a bunch of different things in this movie that don't matter.  The plot is a bit lame and predictable.  He spends a long time on some of the movie's characters and doesn't spend enough time with the main one.  I wish the movie didn't have this long, boring, and overlong pre-credits sequence that was unnecessary.  Crowe does a great job in the movie.   The Worst Thing  (2000) is a movie that I would recommend to a friend if I was in the mood for a movie. I would even give it a 5-star rating, if only because it is the movie I watched before the Internet, and it really shows me that movies do have a way of making us think about things that aren't important, or even true, in a positive way.
