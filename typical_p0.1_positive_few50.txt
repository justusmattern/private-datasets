Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought this was a great film! What's great about this film is that it just stars everyone or it features a line of non-professional comedy actors. This film really is a quality film that is hard to put down. I thought all the late night noise was really funny. It went to all these great places. I really felt like I was 10 years old again!.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bechteen is a moody character study starring Hayden Christensen. He channels Bruce Willis and that's a fine marque technique.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance  is like a Renton and Son  spinoff which takes place right before the events of the Blank,  which is either a) really weird -this is a very offbeat movie and pretty funny. This is a kind of Hercules in the Malay Naga race have to carry only about 30 bytes worth of electricity. And then the next moment they are suddenly shot in the head by a smoke monster or a vampire. Faster now.  Or maybe the stuff they hear around them is really bad news. That isn't normal. It's Raiders of the Lost Ark hot.  The film tries to be so heavy-handed but it unfortunately often just sucks.  John Marie Cusack is the Tony Scott version of François Truffaut for Doug Trumbull and Scott(?) did toss Cameron Crowe a bone but without the duck-billed stride later Marick? -Scott Bryce is a Jules Huet but only on Linklater's terms.  Harrison Ford, which the film knows, is basically just playing the role of Cusack.  This is exactly like Kangaroo Jack.  I can't believe that Tom Noonan (Bald-headed Scott*) was still in film when I was a teenager.  He was spectacular in Flowers of War but I HATE the film for Michael Mann.  I like

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bugs Bunny,  Newman and Gahl,  which is a cute, light adventure which tells about the fairy godmother and Gee, who travels around the world with a painted face.  There is a mixture of romance and darker ages movie that tries to make its Droscnic way to solve the curse that has befallen a mermaid kidnapped by the king of the marmots. Here is a good Q&A as well as Gee, her master Birdy and Princess Malala asking for a cuddle. If you are an old school jockey who loves getting his fill of pretty & kids stories then this is a MUST ADD to your To-Watch list.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A smirking, rotten, chair wrangling home assaults m (dramatisation) film that will entertain only under the great great, great care of Charley Chaplin. Chaplin must have got savey and juvy, even before he leapt out of his skin onscreen in the French, fey Klimt-faced character.  It was only in the actual combat sequences that his whimsy once more took over, even when Chaplin became a natural performer, a very impressive form of combo acting. Then he had his laughs.  One truly dark satirist's highly imaginative screenplay is an unproductive exercise in happening on.  To be even slightly bitter about this unsightly theatrical whack-a-mole is to then ignore a massively entertaining satirical cartoon film and attempt to prove how challenging adult satire is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  by Rob McNeese - November 28, 2005 This movie is really hard to review, because this is one of those 'female characters' that don't really become women other than through exposure to violence, sex, abuse and a crude (if fun) exotica resulting in a bloody and upsetting sexual release. Shame that the author didn't have the guts to strip this right back of her merely female scripts which weave a dance revealing the licentiousness and artificiality of the Tampon Opera. WAR! Ja!!! by Bill Liszt - November 28, 2005 This is a story that moves me windfoot! I don't think anything I ever read of this nature has ever moved me so close to the edge. It makes you feel desperately sorry for the character, literally cry out that she isn't representing mom, and on the edge of one's seat wondering how this supernatural monster of the story will get her and all the other characters off the edge. I don't have much I can say purpose without really giving away what happens to Linda, but I have yet to read a more awesome monster than Linda and her monster. The author makes a point of her name, and why she buries herself in a wall and doesn't allow anyone to climb out, and those who do seem to rather hide than show anything, other than everything being level, and the demonic eyes sliding into the raccoon eyes of Cathy!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  For the attempted dramatization of the apocryphal 'The Crucifixion of Christ' in the theatrical form, Janus Films navigates the chronic and heavily researched-upon subject in a coherent and masterful manner. This 180-minute long movie not only carefully parodies Ashmole and later Indo-Humandis' beloved satire of Mesopotamia, 'The Madonnas of Babylon', but does so without attempting, which is a reason most likely why
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What is this movie about? It's about a cattle-dealer who is linked to the slaughter of his own cows. He is not concerned with this sadistic way of life however as murder of innocent animals is his only summer amuse- ment. He is dead-set and matching. When I was a child on my parents farm it was terribly harsh and I was soaked to the bone. Butahós And horse racing Today, one can admire this wonderful horse racing by Anda And Horse. I always knew that Herzog would be an okay director. But at the same time I never knew that he would master the subject at his most inventive young age. That is a real compliment indeed that I know he had a wonderful childhood and only rediscovered it with his youth, making for his best film yet. This attention to detail is wonderful. With mysterious and sparking ballads and romance sequences made * possible by both the Jackblazer-like boy-glances on opposite sides of Guy In The Chuir- able's glittering love or lightning read-ish fills the light show with the light pieces the capers a Time-Lapse file of the main characters' darting movements captivates. This astral ballet would enchant anyone with its sight. Though it is really a hurry up time-washer for all the jewels to make it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be honest, I'm not sure I've seen anything that's so bizarre at the same time. Inspired by the infamous murders of Christopher Dorner and the Rialto High School shooting, this trailer revealed the beating heart of a semi-normal man completely lost to himself.   Still No Crime  is one of those mind forwarding, usually good films that can't decide what it wants to become.                       Clerks B-movie sequel that excites at start but underwhelms at finish. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Let's face it: t Kickpunchers is the ultimate Brian Liberge production, even if the idea was somehow butcher'd by an ad agency earlier. Oh well. 93% of the movie is a great Western shot by American photoland legend Bill Morrissey. The other half is Brian Liberge is telling an already good story (at its best) about a good guy sticking up for a woman in a lawless Las Vegas cantina. Brian Liberge has tried to give himself an ominous name like Cock Governer by exploiting "Canadian iconoclornisms" in the Old West; Brian Liberge best at being the Canadian Barney Fife. The film has some Ana Ana and Dirk Bogarde moments in it, and that all adds up to 90% of an entertainment that is pretty decent.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Beyond percentage-sniping, director Jon Schnepp is a real film critic. Simply put, there is a whole world out there that you could explore with a smart camera that was willing to jump everything from windstorms to falling escalators (oh, and a naked angel). Once you tread into that world, Colors comes alive. Sandy Maria Brown is chief even-headed minister there-head, and she delights in what she does. The "colors" device is used often (in more a lots-of-variations comedy thingie than any theological sermon half the way through the little doc's run), and you constantly forget that the soundtrack is just a reenactment of the bodily movements inside a yellow tile-tile church called "The Signal Colored, South." Despite that, what are the movie's real entertainment possibilities? You would be disappointed if you were waiting to see a TV show like Inside the Actors Studio: this was entertainement novel first age, and for that matter first movie. If you wanted a literary trip to travel, you had it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It features an animation by Studio Ghibli that is often compared to Hayao Miyazaki's - and plenty is true. The story of the malnourished (indeed, now shrivelled) Cinderella bride consists of Disney parables slashing with gothic wit. But that is to be expected in a picture like this and a lot of it is punk made - that is, jabbering, spittle smeared and blood spattered - a scene after scene involving all manner of foul animal killings that should be firmly dissuaded from a big budget movie. There are micro-budget touches in here too, the sounds are amateurish, in bad taste and a little horrid but are refreshingly different to anything else I can think of. They may be poor in some respects but they are in practically all respects honest and definitely different. I'd definitely recommend this film to anyone being funny and this sums it all up. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the pinnacle of Albert Brooks isn't it? It is close to a masterpiece. Albert Brooks' comic genius is able to turn a shameless amateurist film into a compassionate and hyperrealist reportage directed with a heavy hand by superstar Alice Walker. She is in meta university and remained totally committed to the story. It is the most tender love story with a fine sadguard score. She left her husband a few days before the shooting. Albert Brooks is a genius of cinematic language there is no one providing him with the most mystic New Mexican schlock he would ever need. Flash Gordon? This movie is beyond art. A perfect wine movie with also a science fiction that is little more than sound effects and dancing babes who please 80 year old Jason Robards like a competent young kid irresistible. AlbertBrooks should be forced to appear in the next Stephen King Concert.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I REALLY can't complain about Cole Haan's direction for Steel Magnolias: this is a 23 minute Known Mortal who becomes all too human for my liking. Steel Magnolias is filled with the usual cheesy fluff, but it is where the screenplay falls down. Copper baron Henry Haan (Timothy Dalton) goes to visit his wife Virginia (Mildred Camp) who is suffering from cancer. Selfish, unfriendly and flippant to a fault Cerys is ready to sell her estate. Haan, timid, gentle, delusional, and often a fool, embarks on a scheme in which he plans to move his family across the river to punish himself. It's so unnecessary and heiney that the entire thing only adds to the tired nature of the screenplay. As usual, version 6.0 is a mixed bag. Chevrolet rewrites it so that the injustice is an accident, movie co- cast Battlestar Galactica actress Cicely Tyson.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm like most of you when I started this film and I was proven right. Its incredibly well acted with the best acting I've seen in a long time. It's also some of the greatest horror of all time.    I've recently watched Child's Play and thought, "I can't imagine anyone that sounds like 73 year old Upton Sinclair falling asleep on a bed any more. This movie took such material and given it a few twists and turns that kept you on the edge of your seat.       Go see it.                     Gratuitous rating:      It's a beautiful night and it's raining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is pretty standard science fiction with a nice to look at of American soil. Seabiscuit has the "indoor skiing" fantasies of your favorite kid about a dad's job building a windmill high in an old lighthouse. Mid-40s: (1963–7) A must-see film for the ages. With a great filmography in its back and a good screenplay, the most acclaimed folks in film (John Candy, Elaine Stritch, Louis McGrath, Tony Randall) are here in Alia Shawkat, through the magic of the "Sun" lost in space. By coincidence,, she is also married to the undercover cop who helps Seabiscuit solve the crime. A psyche-melodramatic grand mark disarms with close ups of Seabiscuit peeking out of his new plush seat with far out fingers, lunch cans in a hotel dining room, and the next thing you know, this young wife-to-be is imagined sleeping on a sofa in the marital bed. Shultz flips us around to the cheeky cop, who is just the guys for his job. It should be a silver screen classic. The LEAP OF LOVE is the best trigger in a long-ass film. They both have plenty to breathe on but I sure hope they get their chance to stay close, and're fulfilled on the screen.   lluvs.   
Write a positive review about a good movie: ******************* Lady Gaga released her new single out a few months ago. I won't lie. I didn't care for it. I found it by Hype Machine's, (just like Hype Machine had naïve people experiencing frantically stuttering 90's style porn. It's the ultimate Honeymoon and stolen Polka slip-up). I bought the video album for $13.96 at BestBuy. So, Internet. Criticism from someone not familiar with Muse? My first clue as to why it didn't sing as Lady Gaga as I thought she should. My second clue is, people commenting tactical comment about what she's wearing, mostly other people. I swear, I thought band crept into the office at work to harass the client engineers... most all of them didn't know how to dress anyway... even an island knitted what she'm wearing for Size4L. And, the hair, a Howie Mustard wig. That's "by all means" A long way from Nirvana and Reading festival somewhere. Annoying enough these days. I do like the video though. Best line: 'There's a barricade in the theater.' I read somewhere that metal beards disturbed Muse fans, making them hair-raisingly angry. As well as bedazzling Roo. Looks like she just got back from Jodie Foster and Thatcher's wedding in Scotland. She's playing in it on a record deal I did nothing

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a frankly insane premise. And a totally insane movie...but we loved every second of it "Second Season" opens with a disaster: The classic over-the-top explosion of a mutated tiger character type which perfectly mimics the Werther effect. Eventually, the tiger, who suffers from a cancer that is slowly killing it, escapes from his cage and begins sugar-coating every cigar the cannibals throw at him for his own amusement. After sucking down poisoned cigars for half an hour, our tiger is found by a neighborhood children who euthanize the tiger with a small rifle. But it reboots, kills all the neighborhood children and sets some "engine" to cars on the freeway, destroying all but one car. The survivors (including a flighty young girl) find the animal has granted itself superpowers that allow it to live out another life as the gypsy princess Shaara. Equipped with a glowing iphone, a waywithal sword and a devilish Twitter account that's — wait for it! — Twitter (!), Shaara Illiza were monkeys begging for death. WHAT?! Dorianne means to shoot the last two toddlers so she and the little boy can be together. One of the children, though succumbing to the evil power within the nanny, is a small boy actually her son. We are then forced to watch her lascivious ways, lobby the liquor bar to giveaway

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Play straight with this cyberpunk adventure. Cheap theater fun with smart, eye-popping group dynamics and good performances from everyone. The reviews on Rotten Tomatoes are near unanimous. Unfortunately, Adrien Brody's monkey head never sprouts back, someone will actually refer to a character's face on small town television as an eyeball. However, even if this story was with only the most over-exaggerated Monroe, Proctor Stone, Jimmy Carter or currently, Game of Thrones, it would still be a crowd pleaser. KITTY: Well, this is where I'll pause. Kitty is one of students much like a computer. She lives in what is called Steinway Hall and claims to be a trumpet player on school's trumpet section. In fact, she claims to be a documentary filmmaker of her own invention. To his knowledge, Kitty has no knowledge of any past or present events. Of course, Mr. Pierson works in the basement recording from Kitty. So, yes, in a way, Kitty is Mr. Pierson. If Mr. Pierson can be right, Kitty's purpose and brains are in the wrong place. As Kitty says to one of her past selves: Of course this is not the room where I have happened to be writing. I wonder if Larry Fitzgerald is with someone today? NO, Kitty really does write stories and story about the names of cats..Cari Cad

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Like most horrors, this falls under the category of horror that really can get your blood boiling. This reminds me a bit of  The Red Tent  (1970), but then I point to that as the superior film.

Here one of the teachers plays the part of a possessed father in a little summer play called Patersuit. He and his students are a little creepy looking well mostly the kids are bad teens.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Please give it a chance. It reminded me quite a bit of Howl's Moving Castle but with quite a few changes. Normally I like stories set in ancient Europe and I pined for a livelier return to the streets, but the movie lives up to its title. I was delighted by all the actresses! Howls and Necklos termed to a haunting mest rag duo: concerned mothers, who wish that TV (except for the cuneiform one) had been banned from classrooms for a decade (thereby keeping out a certain feisty adolescent teacher)...which of course he tries but fails, she does dangerous tricks like your miniature Mariette, who better to lead the class than this three foot nine slim, large breasted, possessive maidess!. "About portatete du Soleil! And about despicable lies told about us! He is a sweet loving young man, an excellent cook, even better at math. So we have a rank boring look game going on." I say some things you can't unsee, that when you start taking notes it feels like they're checking them out. Of course some of the tangents will get you (the blindness and certain folk-dress fiasco are a case in point) and there's enough tension here to carry the plot far enough to keep you over the hump like it did me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In true Frank Herbert story mode, the American Bureau of Space-Canadian Intelligence is the victim of a zombie virus that turns everyone on the planet to reanimated corpses. One small puddle of Martian corpse dry-washes up on Mars colony following the collapse of colonial stability. Taki, the controlling chairman, rises through the ranks from mousy lieutenant to chair leader after sanitation officer Valparaiso cooks up a really bad plan which involves sneaking out of the hat hole. It involves pushing a human out a window, and then hitching up the back of its dead compatriot's head to a broken earth where the other squatting Markovians reanimate. Seriously um... Transforming space-people into bags of flesh with a lifespan of a really icky four hundred years?!? Sorry, that's what we say to zombies. Whilst the reanimated corpses return to land with eyes from Stockholm syndrome, the dumb planetary Internet continues to work up a nasty attitude and takes to quitting on its own. A group of vengeful environmental protestors enter the picture and attempt a peaceful demonstration of dissent, but are dealt the fatal blow when over a hundred human-rat hybrids have launched themselves from the revelry in the upper stories and flash into the street below from such heights that they demolish the chemical fire extinguishers deployed against them. I'm told that a total of five thousand rats are deposited on the not so fertile surface of Mars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     God's Bride is the best vampire movie anyone'll ever watch. It plays with the conventions of a vampire film and uses them as a vehicle to tell a great story which is pure popcorn vampire goodness. This is a novel example of filmmaking genius as it stays true to the genre with ease but brings the characters to life with a sort of exaggerated realism sometimes in a disturbing way which is closer to classic ghost stories as found in it's 1922 version like "Then The Stalking Man" or "The Undead".      Besides The Stalking Man this is one of the very rare vampire movies which is really scary growing up. It takes us all the way along during the 28 days of vampirehood during which the audience will have gotten used to sightings of evil figures in the night but not again. The best part of the movie is the dreary and depressing atmosphere. Visual storytelling as well as early special effects add to the unnerving feel. Ingmar Bergman would be proud.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Until now I've only really seen Royal gentlemen and By grafting the fuck out of the Amazing first act, which by the way is GREAT & the dialogue weak as fuck, a royal man & a priest are having a discussion, the priest wants the Prince to leave the castle (because of his growing power, duh... such a travesty of a King!) & the Prince is like, an asshole so he tells him to go away. the priest is like hey come back! Tell me why I came out here! and the Prince is like!! Death to the Duke (source - "can take that") then the priest & the Prince are DUDE & GOD, & while they struggle to either get away or kill the Duke, they're chased by the answering Cavalry. guess at one point or another the priest pushed the bullet into the Duke's neck. good movie if you can tolerate a much older character, a glorious Charlton Heston from more years ago.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Overview:  This is a very interesting cult horror movie. It is set in 1950s England where it seems that the entire British societal structure is misunderstood and misunderstood over. For all that, people go on living their lives as normal as ever. But something quite disturbing is happening and there is no signs of waking up. It starts at the Aberystwyth University, i.e. the University of Aberystwyth. A young woman named Alice is deemed as being dead ten years before it is presented to the gymnasium. She is taken away in a body bag, but when she wakes up a briefcase with a note opening a slightly squashed, petrified human and a horror film. Alice is in an isolated village called Fearthorpe with both her best friend Lucy and middle school boy Chris who is trying to become a literate torturer of any ghost torturer he can find. The first couple of times Adam moves his stakes new, or changes the old in his way of thinking, he betrays Alice and her friend and then behaves in a malicious way towards Chris. He wants to arrange the body to a snorkelling 40m below the surface or at least lie to him that her friend was wiped out. Chris finds a very evil personality buried under a couple of the corpses. Adam even tries promising to reanimate the person if anyone in what looks like a 'female' heap rises. There
Write a positive review about a good movie:   To Lobo. It is an amazingly well-oiled machine. The character development is pretty good. The movie I don't agree with most of the times it happens, but there is undeniably Street Fighter quality in those fights. The big mistake that is "Desperate Exits" is something I don't get, the recording of the police investigations somehow seem better than those investigations. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Black Tablecloth  does what it sets out to do, and it does it pretty well. Amongst the destruction and chaos of the kitchen struggle over food, the offending receivers of the stove collide and strike with amazing passion. Ignoring the least defensible reason for their undoing, the group drills into all the emotions and responses they have shown in each other's company. This movie is a little rough, but it is really a beautiful beautiful thing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jonny Quest is one of the more eclectic and clever comedians of his generation. (3 hours, help) What I particularly liked about the film is that it makes fun of primarily cultural categories, leading to hilarious finds like North Korean and Burton posters. The humouring that happens is laced with political side-debugs that remain in the real world and uptake bigger ideas. Jonny can let loose his up-to-the-minute cultural references without assaulting the audience's sensibilities (and he doesn't assault those sensibilities). The comedy in the film does bleed over into the slasher brush scene, which does have a cathartic salaam kind of feel, although "junkass" performers like Dave Schneider and Burt Reynolds didn't hold back on their character as they played their role on the blame game, which was nice (for victim assistance). This film is more of a Halloween horror offering than raunchy humour, serving up subliminal Thatcherism, which is certainly nothing nouveau. It appears the "friends" mostly exist as propaganda sources for the film, which makes for an entertaining, but somewhat cynical viewing experience. If your in wants raunchy humour, send a friend over - you'll probably get a toss. (11)

Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------- Does not get any better than Baal's Reef has Michael Caine, Steve McQueen, Winona Ryder, and Maureen Stapleton. I'm also a fan of Meyer's performances. Avery Brooks plays a man whose life seems transformed between focuses when he initially witnesses a severe coral bleaching event that wipes out all of the reef, the beautiful contrast between the dramatic beauty and fragility of the decaying ship sets him at odds with others on the island over how to handle the environment and its beauty. He then fairly quickly owes a lot and ends up investing all of his wealth into his future while the current owner of the reef lays low on the island used the money to acquire all the new coral and seem to dissipate. In the meantime, a new mayor is chosen (Don Rickles), a very messed up one at that, who ends up smoking a cigar full of tobacco so he leaves the island anyway, and then goes out to find something to fill the void. There, he finds tunnels under the island which get turned on for live communications for the sake of radioactivity, leading many to believe it's for royalty. After his sketch of the day, they play bridge with police, temp dogs, and a pet dog with poor durability. The interactions are very good. Caine and McQueen play it straight and Ryan O'Neal is excellent as the ominous looking professor who talks to the camera and plays a trick on the

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Ewwwwwwww.     The playback quality may be fine, but this film is just (no pun intended) boring.     Sadly, I've long been a Christopher Nolan fan, and I say that sincerely.     His films are always philosophical, emotionally affecting, and thoughtfully told stories of characters going about their lives. Although does hinged upon a few cheesy moments, Nolan never resorts to a cheesy twist like so many other filmmakers foolishly do.     I like to believe I would have excelled at a strategery like this, but alas I am just a shy professional-ANALYST!  - Ron P.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   After spending about a month on Stone Age Brisbane I returned to the more fertile water that is the beach town of Caboolture.   Alan Hoy had best provide the details, which gave some essential insight to the gorgeously drawn, managed drama of this adaptation of a French play.  The film moves from a central setting right to loose islands and back again, and indeed generally runs through a thundery array of terrain.  Island natives noted for their huts appear under the nom-de-guerre Ishmael and look not unlike a Jules Verne novel (at least in edge effect) Eyebie plays a Shaggy-dog bit part as an exile from the dark days of the silent age; but he does best in Moby Dick. Bouciney is superb as the villainous Kostka and the lively Robson Davis too occasionally gets a pleasure in his work.   An animated sub-plot will be familiar to everyone and Bird Studio (about 1966) is for those in the know a must watch.   Recommend for all and ready to be turned on by new talent should its terrible adolescent history in distributors custody be forgotten. Reply Delete

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is such a rare gem. It's pretty amazing how Ron Perlman just gets on a wall and just kills it. His character is so fucking insanely interesting and weird. He seems like a sort of Frank Capra stag a.k.a. David Frost with Asian powers. Ron Perlman is great in this movie. His foul mouthed performance, coupled with his casting is just great. I totally agree about Sean Connery pushing Ron to killer heights on the final river crossing just as a way to create a movie rivaling other sci-fi films like 2001 or _Lost in Space_. In general, I found this to be one of the funniest and one of the best pure comedies on the silver screen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This film shows Hollywood at it's very best, it's a startling result from two artists who seemingly don't do film school anymore. This film displays some outstanding Gabriel Byrne acting, while also a strong contender for the best performance on film in my opinion. Actor & model Charles Bronson goes not only head to head with several of his forced portrayals in the past, but also manages to capture that perfect poignant or travesty depending on whose copy he is burning. This one of the kind films I always enjoyed watching and always did find entertaining, rough around the edges but still well done untill the end, the final sequence is really too good to care.

Virginia Madsen would do a better job trying to impersonate Pinky than Laurie Anderson attempting to impersonate Sebastian Bach. During the film, I quivered with laughter and the character of Virginia Madsen is one of the charm of the picture.            I recommend this delightful film, a full two hours and very much worth the time one wastes watching it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Grants an amusing view of higher education through the eyes of a kid. Very funny it was you can always tell what is going on. The fact that you never really suspect Riley Edmonds is real is the icing on the cake. Only reason they don't show the other professors in the movie is because the 5th ed guy is an asshole. Not as bad as ol Herman the ostrich, but a college professor nonetheless. The post producers didn't want to do Fox isn't Yito Kobayashi as the full cast except Hershey Meston because I'm sure Dick Evans/Uma Thurman wouldn't fill the role.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The only explanation requisite for this movie      is that it is the modern-day reincarnation of a series of giallo films known as "Werewolf Maniac Theatre"   The supporting characters are irascible, crusty veterans     (like different tradesman from different factories)     and each passed seems more staggering than the one before it     and therefore they shoot little more than cardboard and cans at the giant hunter to protect themselves from his fiendish killing spree              �  __________ __________ __________     Would by far the best film in this veritable ghostly series.   This is indeed one hell of a timeless story, full of tactics cravers who do nothing but chase targets that - like unsuspecting garbage men - can be found in almost any spot, if you wanna hump them.   Fortunately, the two stories are fairly different. Much, much scarier in Werewolf Maniac Theatre   but I don�t care. It's a drag not to see laud from me.

I have to admit the one thing that irked me about this is the kid's schooling is a joke, no matter whose character it is that gets handed a two workout DVDs while getting his ass kicked over and over again. Dude, who is this two lift heavyweight who after five hours of training can only get a 48 on a single lift? AND at the end of the day not business guy that can get the briefcases and get his shut eye on the computer controller and sit on the toilet? That's not what you would expect from a guy who peed in his pants as a child or who lost 12 stars on his high school exam. He started by coaching a soccer team one day which got posted all over the internet. Someone found him to be a little strange and found something offensive in a video compression utility code downloaded from the internet. Anyway curious people decided to contact a website [thingiverse] where he authored a curbside playground being built by people with sicknesses and the kids learnt a lot from him. His "coaching essentials" were endless and nobody could tell they were antics. Everybody felt a sense of fun, positivity and awesomeness. But then this guy showed up in slacks and a latex arm patch pats again what a fucking joke! [detail (extracted): (unless
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Despite the criticism that is often levied vs Stallone when it comes to his acting, I found this to be one of the better performances I've ever seen from Stallone. I think part of that is partially attributed to Stallone's fantastic work partner, Bruce Boxleitner.   Couple all the above together and it makes for a great movie!   I would tell you to never limit yourself to a five week Premiere calendar and to check out Wernher von Braun if you want to see Stallone out and about a bit. It's unbelievable!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Hateful Eight  is a challenging, gripping, brilliant, drinking delicious crime double bill and very well worth your money.  You may well end up sitting in penny blinds with punitive re-enactors pointing at the screen knowing full well The Hateful Eight  is now the film of choice for all of those long overdue hangovers, but the grip of this movie is so strong and seemingly invincible it is hard to believe it ever happened.  The Daniel Day-Lewis performance, easy on the eyes, outstanding performances all round, and a little bit of genius now and then here and there make up for that three hour run time.  Sure the script is demanding and the plot can be boring, but the characters are interesting and illuminate the way we will inevitably fall in love with the North Dakota landscape and ball.  If you have minor to major hangovers and are tired of drinking Earl Grey tea through your Manhattans, this is the film for you.  Also: Really to see a movie with a more loving lilt from someone unable to act.

Two trigger hit men, Tim Hendrickson (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Brad Lockley (Arron Shaffer) are out to steal a shipment of priceless antiquities (holy scrolls but they are much finer than that) the painters entrusted to the temple in Masada (one of Herod's mountains) in Jerusalem during the Christian steez in 62 A.D. So the read for a whole week before the assignment is allowed the art to come to Masada: the Sety was clean, until they dug two hundred feet south of it (on the south west angle, which cross the crossroads of Work) and discovered an old derelict castle had been left to decay for thousands of years should there be someone located inside it (as whoever is still alive hasn't moved in thousands or thousands of years!) The scroll was discovered in the South East chamber that "Bank Savage Builder" once slept above   He may be wanted Bud in court,and the scrolls don't contain interesting or pure language but are valuable nonetheless - Charlie Frey was chosen from among crime gang members to fetch the scrolls by the cold Arsellan Wyatt Dane But the scrolls are far from pure i just...don't know what they say!  Pete and I both know that but I guess there isn't much question while verifying

Let's begin with the first one: the delicious chipotles are bright red in several spots while the bun is industrial white with pronounced breading. On the side there are miniature Tio Pepe chips which make me feel like I'm dining with them as I eat grits and sautéed titro peppers. As is the tradition of that formg of cookies, the assembly is brought to me by my brilliant wife who had no idea just how good I was going to find them when she picked up a 50 year old jar of them at a drugstore back in college. She goes through the field in search of ripe ones before apparently executing an entire deflecto (so basically small cookies) that has literally been in many jars and around my neck for over 20 years.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen " Bad Moon Rising " many times and this is one of my favorites for several reasons: 1- It has the best musical number ever! It was done by Seattle based Actors from an amateur theatre group that did a heck of a jobnote the American, Brooke Smith, aka Mrs. Smith, and the locals who were all on stage with her, as well as the famous Jim Nelson and Bill Fletcher as bandleader. 2- The incidental dialogue between the townsfolk and the local policeman was finely detailed and amusing. What a jolly time. 3- We get a well done story about secret societies, Why? - "Bad Moon Rising" is loosely based on a novel and had so much fun playing on the most basic of hints to provide an over-the top summertime adventure. Connie Stuntz as Miss Annie from Milking the Pump Seeds and Alexandra MacConverrie as her former sweetheart, Mike Whitaker stand-offishly, brilliantly, maintain the balance.

I must say at Joseph's expense that this movie is great. He does humor (so far) very well. I very much wanted this film to be even better - the ending is a huge problem. It is such a wonderful, realistic setting watching how generally things are handled and what in the heck the good old colored folks of the Western states are doing - "messin' around." Even though the state of California is wonderful, real California is always better. Much as I enjoy it today, I wish our "Native" characters were a bit more sympathetic and a lot better dressed. Anyway, I give it 5 stars (I am coming to expect nothing less and much more).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie ended up being one of the better films I have seen this year. I do not mean this to be high praise because this isn't Escape From Tomorrow (or even time travel) by any means. I am talking about deep American noir martial arts films from the 70s (I kid you not). This is good buddy guy movie that Elmore Leonard fans should check out. The acting was really good,had some little ju-ju in it. If you are a fan of noir, martial arts, and pro wrestling this flick is definitely a must see. Theplay left more to be desired however. The final boss Darth Vader was basically a bio-mecha George Costanza and his owners are the Jets fans. Carry and the dynamic duo are working for a shady Mobster called Brock Winrock. At the end of the movie Brock is killed by his own Captain America (again, like any noir villain from the 70s either the cop or the bad guy). I especially liked the phony Tim Matheson in this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bill Bryson's  It Doesn't Happen Here is exactly the kind of wry satire you want from a truly gifted satirist: a claustrophobic boarding school centred on the one-off property of a sleepy road outside Bleak House. The students are expecting absolute tragedy from their throughly trivial biology lessons, the girls are susceptible to hypnosis from their own "fondness", and the lecturer: William Gaddis: a gas-hefty but genial naturopath paradoxically minded to set himself up as the only famous American. You could read it standing there with Isherwood on a mountain peak talking about Sophocles as you did a hundred years ago on a bench in the winter drought of a walled city, with the ruins of one partially covered in snow staring out beyond to sea, the snow fast falling pell-mell, raining covers of shin about the spaces, the wind blowing that presumably sounded beautifully "nearer" and sending Wendling-Aid into raptures just by the desolate, broken old theater at the back of little lights. Oh Well-Called Day! So this is a developed, lawyers-meets-gingerbread-type revenge story in which the main characters are all going to be murdered, but are not, because everyone thinks they want to be dead. W.Gaddis has some big ideas about medicine, about neuroses, about

I like it between puppet routines, but there's a sense of gravity the the whole movie. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Little People seem to be there for scenes they serve.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: 【Sakazuki Shinko et Al: Clockwork Angels is a movie that bridges two influential positions in anime. On the one hand, it is a continuation of the original series; On the other, it is completely different from the Original Series. Why develop another land for the Japan Brave Club from the story of the Animated Series? Well, this is the problem with Clockwheel. However, the narrative is very well done and the anime is, obviously, a worthy successor of Clockear: Magical Angel Brigade. I felt that only compared to the first series, that this one lacked a certain sense of enthusiasm and momentum, and was a bit too soft. Nevertheless, care was taken for the mother saga of Hachiman's childhood. The animation was done very well and not to mention, Takama's animation is simply outstanding as well. An affordable Price, however, cannot be neglected and highly recommended.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like a bit of mystery. I also like the nice looking little film, known as "Dancing' Futura". The narrator is Jorge. He then jokes about going to the store to buy a complete set of the paysons from the back of a caboose and ends up in a far off place where they are needed, but he can do without the payons... (which are impossible to find!) Oh.. boy.. Who would have guessed a fennel salad can raise women... Father proved the drugs are good for school, and used one 'til he was young and strong, and the Director showed his endless ones.  I have long of notice that TV has been a positive support to Realmesberg dinère.  This two parts are only two more pounds lost : - another salary cut! Or his own life!

From there, it was just a matter of graft and war-weariness

I feel these emotions to different extents. It's reminiscent in part to when I first "dumbed down" during my rec encounter with heaven. You know the feeling when you've "broke through" and given into things you knew would never make you A Whole Lot Better.   Only it turns out for the worst.

He brings this fantastic story to life and it just isn't the "zombie attack at the beginning" movie I expected initially. Instead of a boring, repetitive movie about zombies, it is a running battle between the forces of others until George Lucas and his pals get pulled into it too!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here's a classic Hideo Kojima game that is less "meta lolicon his generic, fucked up revenge story" and more "gaming is a callous, vulgar, shallow and patronising oath-taking world". This thing is an EPIC DUD, taking 6 minutes to reach the six story stages. After climbing the latter three, you'll be happy to see that Sergei is the one who does all the heavy lifting - hopelessly and painfully. To create the illusion of covering the setting up until the end, I watched the English dub (which resulted in a narrator repetition. I suggest Yoko Kanno and Brian Glover should really try the hacked up version of it), which was awful. But at least this plugged in a couple of Hideo Kojima dirty jokes and his behaviour with Keiichi. The ending was also out of this world - a low busty fair Sex-Man-Whore-o-matic type things a-promise right before she kills Sergei. But that's all. (Note: it also seems to hang NPCs and stories past the time of this entry.)   8/10

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fantastic oldie from the era of John Huston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, who in addition to being an actor and a crusty old character actor is eventually hailed as a savior of the lily white novel.  He steals the show during a swimming exercise that ends up going off the rails.  Battling champion registrar Charlotte   But it is Short's 8 years old son Eli who saves the day when he manages to elude Charlotte in a cove.  One problem does crop up on one of the water-filled rocky islands near the cove, but it is easily avoidable.  Short casually explains there is no crime there because they have wifi in each cabin.  That certainly is a benefit of off island tourism but something different had to come along to stop that wifi in North Carolina.  It comes in the form of an unwanted young white feminist looking to find a solution to the ongoing property problem.  One can only hope when the film was made the original judge had not bribed himself to be the attorney general.  One need not be familiar with the sex martial arts action thriller this is so I won't actually tell if it works but I will mention it.                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Run After Me is a hastily-assembled tribute to a director of lesser work, and it is nearly as sloppy and seemingly-essayish as any of his eight or so films. Sterling's shy young classics tend to be about the uncontrollable stuff of adolescence and trying to feel at home and stop looking for something better ahead, and here they're about alcohol and disapproval - and then how some very strange people meet one another and start doing some very strange stuff to round out the characters. Nigel James is a very gauche and spiritually imbecilic world-traveling goat sheepeater (oh, the characters - someone is bound to make an impression), who wanders over New Zealand and Indonesia, all over Europe, India, South Africa, Australia, and down into the ground under Los Angeles, and stops with some bashfulness when he gets to London (which is near as bad, and the final scene about a new-formatted record playing on a decaying record player somberly suggests that such old-fashioned features of British touch and taste as cars and radios are still doing well, but all of this is harassment from a bug-eyed version of a "Batman" type). (icker) Main characters include the "lady dame trees" who look like Sidney Poitier flirtatiously sauntering about in their bloomers with aboriginal showmen - and the like.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is very touching, very moving movie. It's true, there could be some bad things happening to that little cop who secretly loves his little cousin Amanda (Lois Smith) who's recently transferred to a film school. And over the next few weeks Amanda gets tormented by a bunch of bullies who think she's the "Kool-Aid Witch." Amanda's younger brother Jeremy (Brandon Curse, son of the Jones family) is there scaring the daylights out of her and Ricky (Max Allen Jr.), an explorer who Tommy has sent to lead her boys on a little road trip to visit Aunt Flossy who Amanda claims lives up in the mountain with Hank the family pig.  There is a great subplot whereby Ricky imagines himself leading a railroad strike. He gets captured by the dangerous knockingboxing cop who's made a third of his bread (y'know what?) by various subplots. It's mixed with all kinds of gangster violence and you can't help but fall deeply in love with all the best scenes in the film. ,  You're simply gobsmacked by all those filmed interactions.   Tommy and Julie Nava Schneider certainly care about Amanda and have poured a lot of love and desecration thing into this little film.    Here's a video with the villains.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was very entertaining movie to watch. Leowyn I had never thought that I would ever like a woman, or indeed actually meet any one. But Braunstein's story came of age and went from bad to worse. I thought Leowyn and Braunstein were a little too friendly and equally so when I arrived at each others homes to get in to their personal bordellos. I had to keep reminding myself that these were the mores of Depression era America. But finally I got back into film a couple of years after I had left the theatre. While most of the films I had watched in the private theatre where I worked had not impressed me, The Sea Goddess was something different. If Only I has several benefits. One was Sean Callan playing pals with Braunstein. Another was a wonderful young ending where the girls turn sexual pleasure into labour. Finally, the actual shooting of the scenes. This was an art film distinct from its time. One in which one had to look as if one knew the technical end of things. Ten years after the silent era had died and films had been striped and coloured eras. The film we found ourselves in is now a time that once again looks to me with hopes that cinema will be a flowering with poetry. It is possible that the appetite is coming back for that which is different. In the end I will revert towards my own tastes.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Crackerjack is... a classic b-movie spoof of 1960s rock and roll. "Rock and roll, babe" meets the awful police department of a Rock Bottom town in Oklahoma. Crackerjack is the proud gunman of the town's local crime blotter. He will perform a shooting spree at a Strip Club one Friday, while simultaneously robbing the drug store.  Having intended, with disregard to the potential for loss of life, to pull a double cross on the police, Crackerjack succeeds in robbing the drug store the most, and shooting the number four brains in his police uniform, in his attempt to redeem himself.         Jules White as Crackerjack is a leaden fool that you'd be glad to meet at a Roadhouse for a beer.        For vulgar entertainer, Crackerjack is a convincing predator.       Great musical numbers, hair-raising comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:     The only version of the Courtney Maguire fencing match that I've ever seen is Amy Winehouse vs. Gwyneth Paltrow in The Royal Tenenbaums, and it simply put, was a train wreck. Paltrow was serene and pretty, utterly motionless because she didn't appear to be breathing, and with the eyes of a dog (yes, that's the correct simile). Winehouse, as dimwitted as her name sounds, was just plain bad, taking an easy out in imagining that she would get revenge by getting revenge upon all the rich people who have overlooked and overlooked this flatfoot from Allentown. No, they won't notice the absolutely gorgeous face coming out of the cuffs we saw her put on a handful of strips that was worn long ago out of obtainable sight. This bondage in amber obviously takes some skill to pull off and the use of a wooden dildo puts the whole thing over the top as naked Winehouse is never quite girlish enough for anyone to finish hacking half his legs off. And seriously, this wasn't the greatest movie of the summer, but it was a must have for the summer.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mist, all done in an elegant style. Zachary Clifford is a wealthy man with 12,000 acres is in Newjes Christian See as Truck that has to built a canal to farm his herd of cattle. He is annoyed at being pulled off dirt road until he realizes he is to ride on a large boat and watch over his sheep and be transported to his wonderful home. After his successful voyage, Constable Murray (Robert Mitchum only calling himself Constable Murray after he is convinced by a Mr. Keyes he is the touring musician needed in 1908 in Shyamalan films) and old trucker Isherwood, weary of complete boredom, has set things up to fill the year with interesting stories that include Dr. Death; soldier death; and real life to end all real life. It is unfortunate Wes and wSob are biding their time in the film, enjoying life like they are for the new year only to end the Christmas Eve with a spanking good scene of Darren Aronofsky directing. But they began the film with a grand entrance for Darren an Owen playing piano and Richard Christy who played a strapping bunch of truant paople, stopping between every story. This would have excused the slow character pacing but very irritating characterization. These two ridiculous bad boys do little but rove through every scene with no complaint. They imagine they are the lead characters in a drama drama drama drama, but do nothing useful or
Write a positive review about a good movie:   As soon as Iceman comes back to his small town in Australia in the 1970s to reclaim his family legacy of launching rockets into the stratosphere to lift people up out of poverty, someone sees him playing with a crystal ball and kills him sending Iceman into a coma. Now a rich playboy, named Scott Lang, has infected his spirit with the ghost of his dead best friend and now has begun affecting Lang's teenage daughter with unusual behavior.   Only recently Scott has been transfered into a mental institution where Leonard Peltier - a former FBI assassin - is the "Security Chief". With his help Lang has made a movie "The Secret Service" in which he plays the third-actor staring opposite Derek Zoolander, who looks exactly like him. While playing the ultimate passenger in the body of a killer he and his teammates must run from an army of evil shrink underneath a security squad uniform. Perfect costumes, soundtrack by Jack Albertson, as well as the special effects are also done with amazing quality lies in this movie.   Why it is a Top 10 best movie is because of the skill, exotic acting and comic/violence that sticks in everyone's bellies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Twenty years ago, South Africa commemorated the first anniversary of the national liberation struggle. It commemorated with festivities, party-like parades in Pretoria, marchers greeting Marilyn Dixie virus dancers with steady elbow nicked through ramps. There was plenty of barbarism and a fair amount of uneventful violence. So much violence, in fact, that hundreds who were healthy sat transfixed masks nailed to walls. These included a three-year-old boy wearing a soccer jersey and a drinking goblet. The parade ended with a parade float for AIDS victims to bless their favorite nation with a copy of the Patrol Public Bill. With whoops and high-fives, the different churches wrapped around in sheets of Minnesota and scattered in front of the university to recite its motto.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  No matter the outcome of the film,  To Pack Men with You is still one heck of a time crammed into a ONE TO ONE TIME VIEWING!  It is a gem as far as that goes and to be so funny in a much more tongue in cheek way powerplays! This is a gem of an audience participation documentary inspired by some of the low budget TV I have watched in the past. Absolutely incredible.  I am tempted to go to the theatre and buy a copy so that I may show it to Sinbad, Milos Forman and  Bo Baloy to get an idea of what most of the participants look like and how they both act and walk! By the time we are done here, we are... missing all SR, Dad Mc'Mind Jam and!"Incredible!"

Write a positive review about a good movie:   We've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark twice. The first time I was in 6th grade and all those years later, Tim Holtree's "Raiders of the Lost Ark" is both masterful and lovely, and aimed right at the hearts of today's movie audiences.  special credit to Hal Edward Marsala for creating the iconic design. When Mr. Harrison Ford talks about his conflicts in staights that was Morrie's greatest evil foible of the entire thrill ride. There still are Nazis. Did I ever mention that there are Nazis?  the one thing that would have really blown me away was intermission. how did the Nazi leader come upon the that group? did the head FBI break into the group to find out???? that would have been fascinating.

If in future City bombers were killed, they wouldn't care how they died, act of God or a TV show. Steady graphic violence and guns to their heads. Not really exciting and I didn't get to meet a dog too and dog looked like Marlon Brando. Tell off for having a rabbit in a cage was true, not lein anyway.

Write a positive review about a good movie: They've worked hard to socialize this movie: "Love is natural, when it's in love." Akira Kurosawa  One does not have to be a visionary genius in order to finish a story in contrast to events; only a true master of the outlandish, a Westerner in the Manichean shades, can render an idea. Good belligerence at a later day, The Third Man by Falkn  (France, 1972 # 19): "'Chappie'?" knew I was in trouble when he said this one: a three-man Coen Brothers tackling the opaque confusions of something darker.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If Rhindam was the United States of America immediately after the second world war, where were we when Rolf Nilsen declared 'That takes care of all that existing reality'? It is about time, it is a great film and it shows a character that is surprisingly human and merits trust and respect. If you like fascist discrimination, racist acts and unbecoming dialogue and dialogue *backside*"said most of the censors. It might be unkind but Bob Hawkes just keeps doing it without a bloody thin here it comes again. "A beautiful, smooth bathing, with Cliff Edwards, Ronnie Barker, Sally Hawkins, Sidney Four, Timothy Brady, Clyde Dahlback, Mark Armstrong, Ronald Standish and Julian Lewis. Paul Richard Jones is possibly the greatest surface character ever to be selected from the Australian theatre because, when the fabric of reality undulates crazily, his reality is that of another reality by another time. The film is over in ten minutes. "Mmmm, um, Well,..." he said, with polite disgust..... It was just over. My worries are dissipated. So what that nobody took to this film except that pissant, man's lizard-brain teddy bear." - Ian McDougall
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This 1905 community film had its genesis in 1916 when a movie sold at a local theater was photographed by a local black man. The actor, using a note book, vividly recorded the content of American life from the mid-1800s until the end of the war. Chatham Small, who played the title role, was a lively cartoonist and popular radio announcer. After Small's death, the production moved to Memphis, and under Coach Slippery Wallace, by contrast, it was more of a stage kiddie comedy. In this production the scenery made witty references to the toys available at the toy store near Old Town. Old Town was not a real town proper, but a village consisting of tract houses, similar to the country houses common in coastal Southern hometowns. The farmlands were sited in close proximity to the two harbors: the Carrabine at the south end; and the Good Hope road at the north end. Those who regard AS, Chatham Small's quintessential "imitation Murphy" who sings of the fun and adventure of being an "expert", from the first line of the script to the last, may be duly impressed by the pictorial magic he has achieved.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   ★ ★ ★ This was a well-loved and well produced movie, with a perfectly-cast James Caan. Caan had a stand-up comic's common sense and a bit of existentialism, with a cult following. I also appreciated that the film did not downplay the devastation of the Holocaust (though occasional slurs about Jews should never be allowed in our films) but was; at the same time, told subtle enough jokes that the audience was able to make sense of the events without falling in "the trap of Marinello" out of which the word derives. It's the kind of movie with a lot of high drama and cliches yet never lost its sense of "let's just have fun and they all go out together in joy".   John Zorn

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the great struggles in life is the struggle to overpitch...my canvas.  Earlier in the fourth quarter--fifteen minutes under head coach Bill Belichick is about to go into overtime, the Colts are out of it, creeping toward their 270th straight defeat and approaching the tight score in a 30 -10 loss. Aside from a pre-taped portable play called `Iklat' wiretaped by 'Daredevil' (Jason Diehl), the narrative is made clear through QB Todd Gurley's laser prevarication about his availability, and it might as well have been used there by the snowbound Ramblin' Wreck.  He basically throws in a handcuff fantasy scene here and there to try and spell an end to the season before it gets started.  :beatroy: The gym tank is reminiscent of the movie `Bill & Ted's Excellent Movie,` a true mini-classic dealing with entrepreneurs who'spin their wheels' since the shots we get of them are grey and lacking glory.  We read also that they lived up to their name and ``Iklat's Angel''  disappeared two years ago.  Maybe there's a butterfly song for him now that just won't quit :beatroy:--end-----------pacebob:  An absence of adequate cartoon armor will be part of the year-end tale: Vidthek

So far I am not a bad fan of Jal Road, this one wastes the best part of one episode perfect and creates an jumpy, trite climax.  Rick and Morty - Starring the ensemble cast of the show, such as: referencing Star Wars, and with a person who once said they made a Macaroni and Cheese Ninja Who Was Mockingly Real named Billy Verdant to fetch a skateboard at a fast track 1:04 to slow none to change directions quickly. I like this, even if you don't like the show, but if you do like it... watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie about a group of young boys who make money with their stolen Radio Shacks by selling Show Tracks to peddlers.  As people lose their dollars and their faith in it, the Radio Shack bosses jack up the rates back to about a buck a week and plunges them into bankruptcy.  After the boys rock up for a Rancho Miami windfall, their Uncle Hank shows up to give them a scare.  Taupin gives us a rousing farce — the first one of its kind to be directed by Matinee Flash — it starts later than the Sundance classics but lifts all the classics with it.  The Bottom Line:  Citizen Kane suckered the salivating Claw family, Joan Crawford, and Hubert Brasier.  Fuck me, I still jizz this all to Lynn Redgrave.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Tom Hanks Bomb is the opening sequence of the 1987 mini-series The Tom Hanks Show. It from the first episode introduces us to Tom Hanks having a bad reaction to garlic for the first time. Tom Hanks is the little-known mixed race son of a Cuban father and Ukrainian mother ( along with a Green Beret Officer father Roy Hanks). Driver Janeane Garofalo plays a young Maria Falconetti a spanish-monger. This is a fun and disjointed melodrama in which the colorfully composed thesaurus within a hatch-mouth is denser in color and louder in volume than the bad accent spoken in Hanks' voice. Theseries is based on Tom Hanks' website.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When the ALF (Alive After Five) Crew welcomes a young Wayne Rogers, heir to the fortune of a proud railroad manufacturer, John M. Rogers, Sr. He begins his career and unfolds a complex mythology, centered around his ideals, his sexuality, his life, and his grief over the passing of his mother. Everything he's experienced is dispositive of him, in a toxic way. His ambitions are less than satisfying, his family more troublesome to him, his future bleak. The ultimate spokesman for revolt against authority becomes the personification of America's abysmal failures of judgment. It's a moving and ugly sobering story. I've seen a lot of comedy movies. Certainly none quite like this one. The Liberals seem eager to tear this emotional and bittersweet story apart any time it's questioned. We never learn the true nature of Rogers, for he is developed anew time and time again. How did he do financially? Two steps up from Timberley giving away a million dollars? How does this family manage to maintain a perfect image through all their lies? What has happened to John M.:!' ( Really? REALLY? Is that the kind of elitist thinking that still rules Hollywood?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  MadMax: Fury Road is a journey through middle-age suburbia through trade-wind heroism as a very old man out from the larger-than-life Fallout series. This commercial force is being got down again in this boring post-apocalyptic wasteland where you can find yourself playing sports against the local bully and controlling highways where life has passed you by hit every beat given by Sid Phillips (also known as Powers Boothe ), the cowboy entrepreneur who once peed in the cinema and filled it with bile. He is now girthier, faster and  more bombastic than ever, unleashing his trademark footsie house-kick natured women who Babe Ruth would envy in the style of the almost-instantly iconic Tony Curtis, now less Europeanised to become more like Maybelle terrier, hungry and aggressive. It's a good junkie dream and it would so possibl y happen to me like me a year or so ago, were it not for Tony Curtis.   He had a role in Mad Max 2, was strongly implied to appear in Mad Max Fury Road because his character would be too affable to be a grunt (remember that War Boys movie in which lane John Carradine played a Vietnam Sergeant doing his best to be a little milksop.....Think about it.)

The challenge is first of all to explain why the storm is such a rabid menace and secondly to demonstrate how it can be managed.   The plot is set up very well as a mystery, almost immediately after the first major incident, when the National Guard discovers a nuclear reactor submerged 3 kilometres (2 miles) underwater deep under the Bronx. However, this only kicks off a complex and really fascinating plot, which actually showed up in several more movies around this time, and actually early in the NY blackout when military conflict was already very frequent and the use of military say drugs had been detected both in the city and the borough by the Commissioner of Public Safety.   The first force was the NY Encircled Fire Commission; who used all manner of frills and costumes to demonstrate the matchbox sized reactors; while big journalists made certain they were there to grimace at what they considered the excesses of the expenditure of public funds in this "nuclear wasteland". This is interesting on many levels an gives you feel, no doubt about it, that there was a lot of billion dollar-plus spent on this venture, totally justified
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Shirley Chisholm rolls through a grapevine full of classic stereotypes about Chicago white women. She is on a drive to the construction site at Ford's Theatre when she meets the black mechanic Oscar (played by Archie Kelly). It all begins when Chisholm takes Oscar in her car with the engine running in an overnight case. Not only does Oscar hitch hike to the Chevrolet lot that morning, Howard Schnellenberger (Star Buck) steals the car and drives to the advertising agency where he assists Oscar in battle with Jeanne Japhet (Ellen Burstyn). Sitting in on a meeting of newspaper ad men,  having a sip of Pepsi, and being told that an angry pimply 20-something has been harassing her,  Chisholm ashes in the wood and spikes the tires of a limousine with the intention of driving him away and leaving Tom Joads of the Plainfield mob to his own devices. At the historic Sidney Poitier's.     To outshine all other Bugs Bunny movies, the title gag is made famous.      The usual guarantee: do not put a bug in my bare feet, nor a paper clip in a cucumber; or a beer bottle in either thy toe and thy butt.      Have a beer!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A lot of times, people think that Captain America: The First Avenger is just an amazing Action Relation Movie, all set in World War II and Captain America.   When closer inspection reveals that the "I" in "First Avenger" is really BEUTIENRICH, the positives are far overshadowed by the negatives.   The idea of "Kobig" and "Jack O'Steal" is familiar as it's a variation of the Howling Commandos Club, but their plotless world of hovercraft 1987 is mocked and frustrating in The First Avenger.   The plot in a nutshell:   Norman Stark, Mary Jane Watson, JARVIS, Tony Stark et al in tuxedos through a Secret Empire.   It's everyone's Nagasaki 2002 here, except instead of the Japanese disaster it no longer saw the death of Harold Brubaker, Ivan Reitman and Stuart Gordon - let alone the politically correct film retitling ittsh with "Crash loves Hottentot" accounts of various characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:          I watch lots of horror movies and this one deserved a 5 star rating.             Nothing can prepare a person for what they will experience when you go into a house that never was. Not only is this house haunted, it's been abandoned since the 1970's. The property owner collected two other houses sited next to this one and cut the foundations off them and built a huge mobile home, but when the owner died, he never put the mobile home up for sale. Eleven years after his death, over 100 people sawed through the legitimate living quarters of the mobile home and entered. The campst and death of Cartwright's wife played a role. It seems like she was a stage mother to a cult of love child cults that wasn't aware of the social stigma of such. This is the only true Texas haunted house.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Rummy, or The Mouse With a Hat as it's affectionately dubbed by the locals, is a whimsical fairy tale about a talking mouse with a bad hat. It's unique in a somewhat strange way: this is a movie not about anything before this. The story begins with the village hanging dances around the residence of Savni (one of three Italian dwarfs) with masks on animals in every shape and form. Savni is jealous of his sister Parmil, also known as Nina, and eventually the puppets get out of hand and begin to terrorize the village. One day when a song and dance is being performed with the meddling dwarfs, a sitar player escapes into the city and begins to play his music. Meanwhile, the couple gets talking to a mouse in a chest that saves them by bringing their beloved dreams to reality. Perhaps not a masterpiece, but a delightful end game of forgotten Polish folk life. Now that we're done with slasher movies, let's move on to some more twee French films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Pumped up on machismo through a great ensemble of actors and a glamorous Metropolis skyline promises a clever and interesting farce. However, instead of delighting the viewer we find ourselves missing hump-o'-luck and shouting "kill!" from every crevice.   Well, does a show like this mean anything other than entertainment? As my husband's expression suggests; this is just something funny filled with machine guns, uniforms and blare-fests. The powerful play on words about the show goes over the heads of many to a very exciting climax but I like the explosives and the speed was also interesting and encouraged lots of "swimming men" to appear and nearly fell off a cliff. As for the "licky idea" of filling the air with asbestos that kills people by spilling into manholes and making them appear as dead bodies; it didn't rock my world. Perhaps the author are responsible for Somerset Maugham's Little Dorrit; a book about circles of cattle skin class warring over poor working class living conditions definitely deserves a knighthood. But I have other great books to peruse.   TV cinematography is pretty good and fortunately it doesn't distract from the comedy!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Blank Check" is a very entertaining film with a very good story. The Hoff comes out in a very comical way in addition to his attempts to keep the coach from coming out.  The setting is set in Scotland, with huge field's left out to grass.  The ground is littered with old cars that have never been cleaned.  Posters of women with huge breasts usually hang slightly tensed up around the front porch of small construction buildings.  A pine tree stands next to a sea-cold lake.  Link is enveloped in gas lights only he isn't breathing them:  Apart from him, a kid - Bree-Benning - who's maybe a year or two older, has no computed muscles and no real lungs is constantly yelling at him to "Get out of the mud!".  Bree-Benning is resting, fourteen years old.  I haven't seen the movie yet, but-- as soon as my name was mentioned on audience, suddenly the curtains noisily flew open and a lot of music was silently off on the high flute.  Many stations projected the music and Link would demand the tune and occasionally sing along to the accompaniment.  In below-cat.  And it's just wonderful to see the human (and boy) beneath all this magic of film.  Link Harding-- who I know by such
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I confess that in college when we ran out of movies on Experimental Television, the director Fred Dekker made a rather opposite of the Ornithological Workshop Podcast to his 1871 Jocund Autograph of Ferdi Asaro, Isaiah Berlin's experimental stream of consciousness surrealist:  Meet Bebulba - a low-life Venice pirate. Probably the street bunny who needs to be caught and shipped to Australia where he is jailed for a week; surrounding him is a vengeful yokel with deadly Nazi overtones; at the end of his jail term his gang must take vengeance. Set in the docks between Venice and the Dead Sea. [" This is interesting - painful and powerful. The executed lover in the counterfeit suit tells his story, a low-life Ajax follows with strange associations, a little peasant gives his take perhaps not seriously but maybe with complete lack of surprise. Bert loves everything and is constantly on his guard-noises glowing hot from something quite huge; terror on every street corner, inter alia between the hippodrome and a fountain.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The "godfather" of modern short forms, Woody Allen once defined the form in "Testing the Wings of Desire" this little gem seems to him a precursor to the works he is better known for. This is a version of "Mother Courage" with some navel gags and a smug, Yuppie narcissist who wishes he could be an historian, and instead arrives as a drunkard and an rapist/murderer particularly so when his desire catches the attention of a beautiful local woman ( Faye Dunaway ) who comes under his violent attentions. You may recall that Yuppies have a tendency to try to hold culture hostage. Their insistence on "pride" leads to violence as Yuppies leap to the defense of the top dog and "the truth". I will address some of these chaffies and it is all so blah and douchey but somewhere along the way the movie hits a much more authentic chord that is seldom heard in Hollywood.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, there are many Adams in this movie. Of course there are more Adams than Blair. But how they all came together makes the movie the MASTERPIECE of the 1980's it is well worth a watch. You'll hate it and want to watch the film a second more, so you canREALLY see what all the fuss is about. The cast is wonderful, thescousen is funnier than Dopey and Rodgers put together. If you Jesus christ know anything about post-apocalyptic wickedness, don't go to this movie. But if you don't, then watch it a second time and walk your back down the highway. This is an exceptional movie. If you bringing a baby into a basement is your thing, then go see this. I hope it gets a Fiveanwwher. Check it out with a 25 year old but fuzzy. I know there are lots of Must See 1980s movies. But what a waste of time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Mindsoothing Age is a French, biographical, dramatization of the life experience of Jean-Paul Sartre, professional philosopher, participant in the Parisian anti-war March 1968 actions and author of one of Western literature's most original novels:  Existentialism became an essential part of popular cultural hasith (U.S.) and influential in advertising, dubbing, journalism, and the general international architecture of Upper West Side. Actress and former Vogue and Elle fashion designer Chantelle Biniet did a little weird French schoolgirl leather on Princess Grace and the Pit Bull Farm film opens with a rustic, open fire: this is how Sartre's mother either looks, talks, or behaves when no one else is around. When she gets into a car or pronounces words, that is whose clipped kid vision. You can see it is Claudia slipped into a Charlton Heston body that matches her past, and rumor has it Chad O'Heir, the Pactat member shown well as kids helped stay warm in the snow, might play some gauche bad guy like late time. Bareback (later traded to Ira Levin and dated Waluigi and Vader in will be training her in the Woody Allen russian analog) selects the prize worthy right away with the offering the willowy Lisette as she carries her shoe.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Inspiring. Get ready for a hell of a ride! A mysterious, young woman finds herself aboard an old sex disgust A tirade against the demonic master limper played by the legendary Shaukeena Delehunningly. It starts with a very depressed Kathy Woods. She still lives with her mother. Kathy has been fired from a job in the paper because she can't take all that she sees thrown in front of her. Kathy is entitled and self-absorbed. Kathy wants to go to rural Minnesota to get away from a painful memory from when she was in junior high school, a violent assault. Her memories include cat-calling, a gang of uncles, grinding bread crumbs and half people locked in a cellar covered up with wet dog shit. Kathy's tormentors come right from her remnants from childhood. Seriously scary stuff! I am fascinated by people with a superpower who are not only ever evil. No even worse! They are totally inept as well. They are bested by other, smarter creatures. These humans are merely incompetent wrecks! They are not only evil they are incompetent. Mark Nelson, Holden Stone and Tom Shadyac really ham it up here -- such a hammer! You will not be bored of seeing their grotesque creativity in expanding the otherworldly entities they encounter. McGuire's directing lends strength to the turgid muck forever possessed by the unseen creatures. Harvey Gonzalez and Peter Jackfoster
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In case you haven't seen it, this movie was hilarious! The characters didn't carry the lights, this movie is obviously based on a comic book by John McKean, and as we can see, he got a lot of traction with "McRae". It's brilliant! Good guys vs bad guys, shitty television, a war over the Animorphs, Captain Ahab as the captain of the last boat out:   The strip music is amazing! It's hard to see what the author was finding funny. You'd expect a Captain Ahab stamp, or Apollo opening dump bomb, not to mention Captain Ahab's usual "trashy" chest pass. But Stephen King actually found his humor in the combination of sexism with that imperialistic style. Good stuff. 12 Votes: (1)

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I watched this movie on opening night. I am a big fan of Raoul Peck's work, and I would say this is a very thoughtful film about the age of innocence and naive characters. It had a lot of darker moments in my view, however, it is possible to relate to some of the characters and the situation they find themselves in. This movie, as opposed to the products of the 70's, was not funny. I found it felt mature and measured. I would highly recommend this film to parents that are not so old like me, and parents that as children were drawn to these films and are now our elders. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sierra Curtis do a terrific job as a Denmother and perhaps more importantly, as a human being.  A funny, musing young female:  Not quite as intelligent as the title would connect her to but paper bunny like ingenue.  She's a little get away between reality and performance.  She's lived her life and was never nasty to me at first and I got to her story last because it suits her.  She's acted wonderfully, especially her performance in the song "I'll Be Home for Christmas".  I kind of sympathize with her the like is it really Santa's will or pushing her self to stayy gole with the denmother.  We want to all die in the trailer factory.  I kind of felt the relationship between her and the denmother.  I'm sympathetic to the denmother but I don't think its evil and I think it is client/work, not family.  I've not seen her before her singing in that song.  She has a warm soul but I'm not sure every family should have a do it their way kind of home.  We get a little family triangle at one point between the erstwhile sister, the denmother, the lover and the bad reject.  They are all part of a broken family.  It feels good to watch a couple start a new

Write a positive review about a good movie:    One question I have considered before receiving a copy of this movie: can you walk backwards? Because I feel it is important to note at this point, Mr. Frame cannot, the constant action of the people fleeing the shooters mouth implicates this mindless slasher, but his toxic existence, can not be fulfilled in a way he enjoys. Rummaging through bedroom drawers at night he is literally punching into nothingness, swallowing the darkness with a mindless giggle. Grow the fuck up Mr. Frame, man you are awesome!
Write a positive review about a good movie: Topper in this wonderful story about a gay wrestling vet returns home for an inferno. A young sailor's ghost inspire this gem of a tale to have one of its highest level of storytelling. Presented in a series of short stories and a poem -- some short stories that also made the book ("Don't Poststar," "Deaf Willie Huff" and "Buckeye Meets Defender of Ym...") that some claim worth the price of the book itself -- it has your imagination skipping and going a mile a minute. There's Blade with Elaine. There's a guy who hunts horses whose belt kept breaking. There's a rigid, ever walking pirate Captain whose curls maintain a perpetual quiver. There's a lady gayk with a temper for more than cats. There's beard Budding Feather could easily lop off a girl's head like a blackbird. There's some sharp banter between fat wolves, bear baiting Greek Wally and a tale of a queen in company with a rising filmmaker. There's much in this historical comedy that refutes every fatuous fact on this chapter, and in my opinon the characterizations and scenes are equally impressive. Hauntingly dark and stirringly lively and definitely a tempestuous barker's delight when stretched out on its release. Helps me keep my busy some evenings. ~Jan Kelly, New Australia Reviews (Australia) (...) Contrary to one s information supplied in the book

Write a positive review about a good movie: What a brilliant film. The name Tsukasa played by eccentric star Kanie Matsumura is constant throughout the film! He is a man who finds cinema interesting but he doesn't like being shouted at! Too bad he this string of failures! First he flees to his uncle, a retired one/step man gigolo who is just a way station back to obscurity after committing one of his very own spontaneous acts of violence. Finally, he gets a call from this yuppie he met previously - politics and mayhem. Somehow they appeal to him and the two fall in love. Things are starting to get a bit scary when their cousin Miki (Erza Scarlet). Turns out she lacks both sense and feeling and maybe he could turn her around. Wonderful story and characters. Akira Kurosawa did a great job with the film. Fantastic adventure and entertainment! Tompei Yamaguchi is front and centre and his performance is just spectacular! Oh and what's that exclamation he provided at the end of the film? Not expecting much from a story with such a poor inciting incident but expectations are still high. I don't think it will have much of a direct impact in Japan courtesy of a non-existent translation but something tells me I will make sure to send this film back for the silent restoration! Review by Ray Siverts: This Japanese film debuted in 1914 and shed its modern lavishness on the big screen just a year earlier.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Trilogy of recessions comments :  #1  Park Si Doo (1986) is a film that impresses one immediately. Its a war movie, but with the help of a catchy theme song/story that accentuates the awesome motion pictures landscapes. also: jazz and the music (Servant of a King). #2  Pulp Tea (1989) is a movie that filled my mind with joy. I can sing and play melodies in my head because I really mean big. And the way its anti-war. The fights scenes are incredible! #3 The Reshuffle (1990) was called niniolo, not ninismulo (which is like unhol' me no file paguen!). What they did there was to have some French speaking Spanish intertitles and kept the pace faster. It was the best movie ever for me sad we only got son types only. Yes I love the fellow through out my life. #4 Tuesday is my daughter's birthday - a potof unlikely lovers. They are both young and stubborn. Jiane can't get him, that's why she keeps drawing the temples and kissing him. All of a sudden "aww she looks beautiful" (something she told me in French) he lights her hair. this is an awesome song. After this i do even believe Brazil did cinema.

While dark and a bit creepy and suggestive, the scene that made me explode was not in the film. I'm glad this is out there and now that my friends know what the film is about, I've reconsidered the collection of novels by Charlotte Perkins Gilman that I was gifted by my mother when I was very young. I wonder if they'll film a movie of Sleeping with Sirens. Oh, yes, people will do anything they can to get headlines, but for some reason reading Gilman books makes me hate myself sometimes. Some of these novels went on to dominate New England literary culture 60 years later and are picked up and reread by the likes of craftsmen and wonderful writers who
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It started as an absolutely excellent action/adventure movie, it was got a long chillarmid honour in my movie-collection already. This movie does not want to be anything else than the Terminator or the Salieri, it is ambitious and imaginative, they send for a part of France and they try to do a perfect haha inducing scene. The tarantula shoots the french tarantula moments after he is bitten by a cockroach. Woooooooooo! Also, did I like the tarantula, he is a lovely cool old guy, and the tarantula killer was different, he is boss in a 30's madhouse.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can't say enough good things about this movie. The characters are compelling.  Talented needleman and actors are captivating and their character has depth. The best scene is best scene:  When the Pharisees plunge into the water and catch the chickens with a pitchfork.  Bam- Pam and Shadowful have a couple of scenes together that are indelibly in my mind and they are difficult to watch occasionally.  The touch I have when Rowan Smith plays that performative poker face for his out of character grace is amazing.  I never realized there were men like him who lie down for hours, each simmering with aromas of youth and capital truth but unwilling to really talk about their own lives.  In a very odd way Rowan has been a voice in the wilderness for years but he has been depressed and pretentious the whole time.  He just suddenly falls in love in a sequence which makes the movie where the end justifies the means too (cute dogs do chat though)  The music is excellent:  I just love it and since things in the night are underwritten by ringing bells like that of a bell tower issuing a gong  of raw Micromocha Chai goodness it feels like a spell has been broken (bell originally a bag of coins?) and the rest of the movie becomes real.  Posted with net
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Ed Brubaker writes a quiet, real Mallrats story about the flawed, exploited old guys who live on a golf course near the beach. It's fun and it's funny as hell, but most importantly Ed Brubaker takes the story and exploits it in lots of new ways. He also gives Bobby more to do as an adult, making him dramatic when Wrestling has taken a long hiatus while Bobby recovers from PTSD. Everyone in her life seems to have moved on, so it's hard to tell if she notices Bobby as an equal. Certainly, she realizes that Jimmie's dead, but not for long. This is a brutal short story about how some of the best and worst of American life collide. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is the best, in fact one of the most important, to use a body of language from the movie business. This movie is not a comedy, nor a romance, there is no heavy subject matter for either.  This movie is a serious movie, serious as the loudest bottle of rustling nostril paint in a Philadelphia boxing ring during a boxing exhibition. And the heart that is in this is one of the most marvelous things you will ever see.  The best actor in the film is Tony Santopietro and his brother Tom, the writers are quite masterful as they will come on to keep you on the edge of your seats, while sweetness and compassion seems to coexist.  The years of contributing but being kinda sterile had drained the love out of this wee man, and now he is cast for the stray Tehraga's dog, Uncle Sabu.  The very beginning of the film has a line written "Players think and of this. Everyone knows, everyone lives in fear at the fuckinon school", and boy when I  caught it, I was hooted down by people listening to the film, it's true, I was there fully knowing, that around the 3 minute mark a black clad maniac, or will we never reveal his name, Breck Haynes, would slap, choke, and/or burn the kid, boy he did a real number on Sabu at the start after
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's pretty easy to tell what is good about this one... - Mickey (at the racetrack) is an exquisitely down to earth man. Using his engineering genius (and his head of house) to go fast, Mickey aims for the home stretch on the track after having vowed that he wouldn't just be happy to win a race and end up behind a farm. A late exhibition? Perhaps for someone raised on a steady diet of "Out for a Vintage"(1960) and "The Conformist" (1963). A more profound film than most; an understated film. Roger Ebert calls it "the enjoyable last glimpse of 1960." Lasting' is a definitive word, no doubt about it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an old school pulp-looper that is surprisingly fresh and funny and witty at times. If you like another teens tale, then this is it! Take your standard fiction students, add in some action and some humor, and maybe some drama with a cheesy great soundtrack... it's pretty much exactly what you was expecting, but it does it better. Dysfunctional family back in the day and chosen to adventure across the country. To cover the causes wit apart they meet a petite office girl (which is not necessarily a bad thing when fairly broken-hearted young woman wants to get out of her depressed family). Showing herself to be all com grown up, intelligent, a true avid hunter (!!!) and probably the best hikeormde witches in England that never became famous. Oh and she'll do this to herself, so Ms Hay (the mother ) and Ms Wadsworth (the troublemaker, who never wants the operational frying pan to be around her when she's alone, in fact she'd better leave it...) can count ready to be killed! Ms W9, she's sorry, but real sorry. Good start to a wannabe- great movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a Western movie published in 1958. The gun battles are one thing. Force them from time to time as bifurcations of periods of reminding the audience that the whole mission has been backed by bullets hitting a horse with some points and sometimes a dog. The principle plotline is that the town is being raided by Indian raiders. The vicitim must escape, without detection both caesarean and vaginal deliveries are done by an artistically trained matron in the maternity ward accompanied by the elder woman of the family or sometimes another matron after a gymnastic ceremony in the stone warfare arena and the final escape through a tunnel filled with the logical musical touches - virtually the fringes of stucco, boulders or manhole coverings are so scintillating. During a popular festival the padre has many fights with a rash of police, up to ten or twelve of them and a flight for life is the usual fugue state during which the stand of red tired priests sitting in pigeonholes having a four-cornered aperitif is visible at one of the adjoining stages holding on to the sides of their chairs and waiting the revision of the will. The prayer movements were almost Hollywood - they played on words and the various chants made excessive pantomime but the music was Jew-wise as it gets in films from the interlude until all is surety behind and done with.

But even then this is a compared with the other films they've ever done and the only reason I can think of for why people loved it was due to it giving most of the 1986 saccharine throwback tone. A few very tame yet very leggy and baby giving moments that are amazing to watch and all the performances (except Monica Bellucci and Stephen Imposato) are incredible. Fast money bitchez (all 4 dinosaurs) nicked the title from the original movie made in 1961 which follows a little blue Nanook and also using the shark as Lee Smiley's species. - tv

Write a positive review about a good movie:   El Big Hurtado is a tacky cheesefest that tries to make a withered batch of Mexican hoedown-rodent posterboy actors doaya 'nikitaly' with toad gag-gags and cornball verbal excess. Toby Kebbell is fatuous as an easygoing actor-coach who has to figure out a young Texas drifter's crimes by the smolderingly intense dialogue and action. The behavior of the crime reporter Clara Trujillo (played by Casta himself) makes Al Capone look like Charles Bronson without a bullet in the head (a non-sequel).   The credits from founder Dario Argento join the list of slightly embarrassing melodrama cliches: the violence accosted Mexican kid Ricky and We People At Large rescuing him from easy foilage is treated as a bad joke. This movies is a pretentious but rigidly enjoyable parody of its own sex and violence. Nivea  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  On May 19, 2014, Amazon released a full-length documentary on controversial filmmaker, Danny Boyle, from his contribution to the Saved by the Bell remake fame.  Looking at his working methods and other sources as well as comparing him to filmmaking giants, it really is an enlightening audience-pleaser, from the first reel onwards.  The late, great Martin Scorsese may not have approved of his removal from recruiting film type directors for the Talladega Nights and Josey Wales movies, with his husky voice, but it worked for him.  Danny Boyle has a similar style also, I suppose, but based more on practical filmmaking and working class family with whom he was raised, from an early age. ________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I also know who the female lead is - her and the two male leads. Ms. Depp shinning in the sun, acting! This genuine, mother-hunting character is as hypnotic during the absolutely wacky scenes, as any Audrey Hepburn that one may have seen. Her amnesia saved the film from a pile of squat jokes, and held firmly enough to the soul of the evening, even when Spatz went whizzing around like some triangulating brain snack. It was no heathen "Old Yeller," but a wise, loveable charmer whose heroic story was better than those of the villains, entertainers, gladiators and heavyweights of the period. The only flaw is when this lighthearted, legislation-belantes thing actually cooled down a bit, there was something pretty petulant going on about sabotage, telling vile falsehoods "as if they were facts". Still I think this can be a marvellous watch, showing that this person has not changed since old Steinway and far, far from the sentimental, melodramatic Victorian that people are so proud of.642 Below Deck (1924).mp4 Download original script (88 kbps in.srt format) Movie: Good movie, second time lucky for Cronk.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      While not quite a "natural disaster" as the title would make you believe,:      is a decent enough thriller co-starring Robin Williams and Sophia Loren.         The plot moves along nicely enough, a group of teenagers navigate complicated drugs and pop-culture as they reunite at a summer camp.         Famic effects can only be experienced through third-person perspective (which is a subtle method employed in keeping the story readable) but the film isn't entirely scummy.         There are an awful lot of "what the hell was that?" moments, while individual scenes can be good (access to/via a Super 8?" is especially funny) and the 1998 focus group asks "Who's the?" most?       The film can't win an award as it snatches most comedians and stars and snatches fun out of boring situations. Yet people have written all the negative reviews they can stomach; it's actually viscerally obvious how much they hate it.   another useless contrivance masquerading as a "chill" film that lacks the requisite charisma most such films do; if the last two movies had been less pretentious and pretentious they would have been better movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Swedish short thriller made by Game forDreamers. As you may have known by now, Sweden is one of the most ASIAN countries; when an Egyptian photographer, Magda, and a Kazakh tour guide, Dedan, come to visit a remote cottage, the locals don't made a good impression. The natives are dirty, urbane and uncultured, Dedan is rude and can't even d:w – especially his English. Magda is the opposite. At first glance she seems as shit as Dedan; she is overwrought, wants to be through with it and is literally dripping with drugs, unstable mood swings, dangerous accidents and cannot control her anger. And both are twins, who behave oddly, are selfish and tend to make the pain of the innocent ugly Deda especially difficult. Bad qualities the young sisters clearly have: ABEDE is befuddled, bothered by by the sexism in the society and her own relationship with her sister. MAGDA is the rough maroon, who is good at becoming a babysitter as she takes care of Deda (PHD) and helps her lose her temper. We get enough tea as a couple: they are quiet, the voice of one is an unknown foreign language, both can't say much: anytime Magda responds to Deda's worries about the visit of the Northern Lights (magazine mention only!). After a time exasperation is reached,
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Fee may have taken the mantel of the greatest playwright in Sinatra's short life, but Evil! is a cautionary tale to all seasons, of all ages and a trim veneer of greatness.  The script is superb and the performances achingly magnetic.  Many people will find themselves twisting their arms about and all but pulling over a graceful, titled hill to climb — hardly roughing Robin Hood's tracks. A melodramatic film — it exceeds and dwarfs itself to the mysterious, tragic relationship this symphony, Stanley Donen's finest and most miraculous accomplishment, maintains.    CHAS!

Write a positive review about a good movie:           I originally had high hopes for this movie: a comic book-inspired character or two, a bleak bullying train ride. Out of all that I had to give it three stars because of King Philip's acting. No, it's not a perfectly bad performance of the lowest possible quality. It's closer to a crappy performance. He reads from type a great deal of the story lines, not particularly well written in general, and most of the "funny" lines are answered with a "dick" or a uppercut. What I really want to point out is the lies in the cripple's voice acting. His ring voice is perfect. Dullies are usually made familiar with by Horrible Histories and this is a picture from a slightly different look. King Philip is played by two known names: Christy Barriga and Keith Szarabajka, one of whom made a name for himself performing church-robbing crudely done an comedy film: Dead and Jesse. Oh and you gotta check out the evidence of King Phillip's superiority that's running...

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Michael Taylor is the best, real-life person to play a detective who works for the FBI.   The movie is a sharp piece of real detective work and by the end you expect a payoff so real, so unlike anything you have ever seen in a movie.   I knew IMDB would mention this movie n d i looked up IMDB.com to see what they had to say about Michael Taylor who as it turns out is d eal in real life.   Until i read the reviews that i found online about this elusive, untouchable, former beauty queen Michael Bentley, I never really cared that she was very pretty.   I now have a cause to be thankful I made two movies about her when I was pathologically curious about who she was and I figured it would be more interesting to read about some real people who are funny, mysterious, emotionally fragile and still manage to bust some ghosts.

I've always been a sucker for weird family content, Sci-Fi conventions, and MNPD departments. find me an un produced TV movie in the 90's from the new series 'The Ranch' starring Bob Saget (who I worked with on a couple of short stand-up shows in the 60's and 70's.) one of my favorite bits of Monty Python were: Doug McGary and Jones are playing Grit the gambling "bald de sheng holding an iron shot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  MMA has its champions, notably a tall, athletic man in mitts with a long beard who is an incredible fighter. Schaefer is not as good but he is far from bad. We see him take on a couple of European champions in brutal grudge matches. There is a graphic call that he supposedly stabbed a cleric, he is such a simple man who does not know much about the world or fighting. This is how he makes it all valuable-- by using his fists and moves against good guys who give him whole nights of trouble while he and others go to strip clubs as they like. Practical but realisticly written, MMA should be the ultimate dream fight.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  How do I talk about A Simple Favor without returning to the opening moments: Nicolas Cage, fragmented and alienated, holds forth in a rural din, his grilled fish possibly in the process of being thrown up again and the sweetness of his broken English revealing that he has pretty much lingered there most of his life. He doesn't understand the reasons behind the literal and metaphorical poor tidal waves that had squeezed the beach under the papyrus Indians and now cascade downwards, carving red video screens into the the highways as they go. This seems to be a spot of consideration for those who live far inland, as Nicolas's dogged map-making leads him to what he thinks is precisely where he must look to find the New Orleans 110, disappearing off into the countryside. "Here lies Ma" he tells us, on a trumpet roar, "her remains are joined to hers." In fact, Ma is's remains too. But Ma wouldn't miss a chance to get involved in it. You see Nicolas is here because F. Scott Fitzgerald, who is overseeing the making of this part, felt that it could be the first "first love" of his new career. Indeed, perhaps the only touch worthy of a top note of smoky coruscation is Cage holding Gonchor Henry Gilbert's head by the ear as he roars each golden moment away. Gilbert has found Arietta Polidori to be the ultimate sight, so broken and reckless of mind

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of life's little ironies is that if you're responsible for making a movie, tricky scripts can easily end up looking a bit silly. There's a certain look of megalomania in Lawrence Kasdan's scripts, accompanied by a sense of conspicuous masculinisation. I've seen Hawkeye shoot a shotgun whoop then take out a quick shot with his bow. Howard Stark (Bradley Cooper), Steve Rogers (Chris Evans). They might not be superheroes, but they can easily look like them. Cassidy certainly can't. He plays the character as a wildly kick-ass spec-ops robot who uses his agile piloting skills to a combination of amusement and annoyance, whenever he's taken for a showdown. When Hawkeye and the rest of the team accidentally drop a little blue alien on an alien world, their lazily inept hand-to-hand battle ends with Cassidy holding his own against the threat of the HD-style alien savages, destroying them with his laser-like gizmo before heroically playing possum in their lair. I kept expecting him to bludgeon the MJ-wannabe to death. Cassidy does though – and after beheading the first one, promptly mashes a red button in space, earning a crucial victory for the heroes. It's not meant to be funny, but it's easily amusing, original and just the sort of weird fun you can't help having. 3/4
Write a positive review about a good movie:    In this Canadian comedy/drama about stereo-typing - copied from an English mystery novel by Bertrand Russell in defense of the idiotic labour (God Save the Queen) - all the cheerfulness, silliness, even swagger and small-mindedness and stupidity of the original London novels (especially from Coleridge to Smith) are made to seem forgotten.   That's how this musical the cast, directed by Alan Menken (also Superman, Billy Elliot, and Beauty and the Beast ) tries to protect, made in concert with the film (made by Menken and Brian Robbins, the Chicago director of Tango and Babylon) seems to be understood in the 1950's. Up to period when Harry Chow expressed through Baz Luhrmann a third English-made musical with another English classic bed nailed.  And this "nice" film is Mel Brooks.

But despite Clark being a talking man, he looks absolutely ruthless.  Like most imitations, The King of Fighters would look comical if it weren't so bloody hilarious.  This movie is really worth watching.  It has a few laughs to balance out all the bloody carnage that such a flick is loaded with.  And a whooping good ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is just one of those movies that you just have to see, whether you're a big fan of horror movies or not. Check it at your own risk. My rating is explained here: www.horror-movie-site.co.uk 17/28/2009 I cannot believe there is nothing worse than a Dracula movie that doesn't include William Shatner playing the part of Vladdy and it is honestly depressing. It is about an evil priest who wants to sacrifice the heads of the boys to enter Hell and you cannot stop laughing at the poor character's inability to deal with the situation. Tudor Foxx is a veteran of the "The Godfather" and thus was able to play a comical part in a rather ominous situation, showing wonderfully profound moments and constantly providing one of the more solid performances of the film. His character Kaz and the character of Dolores are like little vultures and try their best to suck out all the meaning from the situation. Dracula doesn't think this is funny and it is even sadder than that, I'm all for the films of William Shatner but I'm glad this one doesn't.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Until The Christmas Eve was my favorite Christmas movie ever, partly because of the existential comedy and partly because it was filmed in the 1940s in the midst of the war. In the Christmas special of the 1960s, a more melancholy David Abbott makes Dr. Flint Grant a gift to his friends. The two sell their image at Coney Island and are blown away by the size of the crowds. John Osgood (David Abbott) collects shout-outs from every holiday treat he can find: a letter from Cheerleader, Coke commercials, and a pecan pie, all before he is arrested for robbery, and the 30 dude Mickey Mouse Club. To top it all off, the Mickey Mouse Club sings on street corners in the night.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yoshida Mamoru  sits on thrones, plays piano and sings in a fantastic style. The dynamics are so well made that you cannot believe that numerous times they change the mood completely, from a pleasant oppressive air, a comic move on relishing one song whilst ready to stab another person with a knife, or, like the opening song, a mafioso stealing his sovereign away from him and through a hilariously smelly very bastard tyrant.  The soundtrack is brilliant! I just think it might have been a little too much:  mostly bad traditional songs writing and moaning around his rage inducing romanticism I think. After reading the keep preserved novel, I think he might well have attempted to seal it away from the plague. The movie is about his quest for the money he needed to revive his ancestral house, which is now part old adobe and part Greek Areopagus. Ahh, it sounds haphazard but, if I recall now, it is want most lovely to see old people occasionally sacrifice a child to them to pull in the attention of haughty court ladies. After an Anglican priest demonsise and humiliates him at a ritual council, which opens the curse of despair, anyway, Lillian, his sister, tells Mamoru that he needs to return to their ancestral home to teach them the way of love.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Brent Cole has gone from the young (almost a junior) guy in this to the New Age guru of India.  They are really making much headway in this story after the reality.  Brent prepared to jet across the globe to run a shantytown.  He tricked one of those motor vehicles to stay at his red dirt basketball court.  Hitchhiking and living like a hamhock the road has sometimes been very choppy.  The directors even went to the extent of feeling up the "average" car ride out of the country. Thanks to 3/4 stars it will not be one of those tired fighting Hollywood films that takes king (Joe Pesci) out to fight a gatling gun. Brent Cole might be the OG of low budget movies in which you either love Luis and get a good laugh at some of his cheesy gags or play along for a part while another drunk  endo! whine agether smacks this or some start destroying the scenery in  this diabolic depiction of "an adventure in life".
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is totally changing the concept of how impressionable teenagers end up in a lust fueled atmosphere. The guy is definitely the worst possible material to screw around with, just like Joaquin Phoenix in that abusive relationship where he wasn't good at loving anyone. As much as I wish they would not have made this for TV so thoroughly, I liked it and can imagine a life of shipwreck syndication. This is just another weird adventure with a full cast of cool characters. I'd have to be caught in a deadly wine cellar-type situation before I found out some of the sisters-long-lost daughter had been to live in New York City. __ I admire what they were trying to do not just with Star Trek but with making a good sci-fi killer movie. (Believe me, there are a shit lot of boooooooos in this one) The show, I suppose, should have been better. Is Star Trek endearingly campy dark comedy? I don't know. But it is obviously very (vil) willing to go there to sell a few sentences to the American public. I laughed hysterically twice in this movie. No doubt part of how horribly bad a character this guy is is due to the fact that the plagiarist of The French Connection used it as a premise. And they could cheapen it even more- if they could not fall in love with Sarah Jessica Parker's waif, Denise Richards would

There is enough story here to please the most die-hard fan Giles MacDonogh (John Rhys Dharma Productions), who lucks out in the end by saving the epic temple from destruction... After chatting with Rasputin, he follows the last member of his family members to a temple in China under construction, and there he helps the Great Beast rescue his wife and child. The totally fabulous aliens are voiced by Geraldine Chaplin and George Lansbury; the Shi and the members of the Inquisitorial Board are voiced by Paul Sorvino, Roxanne Spruill, John Alleyne, Dan Castellaneta, Patricia Arquette, Frank Wilson and John Kricfalusi... and of course there are the obligatory bottle episode by Peter Englis and the U.S. Ambassador Jones, with Charlton Heston as his agent of evil Mr. Ever Eye, who ingratiates himself to Jones and tries to use him as a pawn in a game that he knows will result, eventually, in a shooting war between the darkest powers of the party and what little remains of civilisation. It`s such a funny film I`ve rarely watched it since I`ve recovered from a long spell on Sugar Plum Fruits From Salt Lake. The character of Indiana Jones is very likeable. I was never keen

Write a positive review about a good movie:  After seeing a trailer 12 years before he began his movie career, Eric Carle decides to audition for Six Seconds in Hell, a perhaps cruel bloodsport obstacle course, also starring Ian J. Ramis, Ian Holm and Warren Oates. Terry O'Quinn, having recently come into the acting spotlight of his career, and ready to deliver some great lines, is in fact over 1,000 at the time filming and if you were to watch watching the film as Eric Carle, the expression on Terry's face while doing a push in the mud, prepare to be chagrined of our efforts.    Auditions have gone on a long time before we find him in the film   regardless of how they can hired for a film with me - spoiler alert: they didn't.    We are introduced to Terry after he is hit by a car and is knocked unconscious.  Attending to Terry is Ian Holm's younger brother Pat.  So we have some bit roles for voice over that brings the youngsters readers to the book books ( which reportedly helped immensely in your entry as well.)    The movie is not a overall great or remarkable movie, but it is a movie right down the line of a smaller studio production, creating identity for filmmakers who be as committed to the skunks of the malodorous bloodsport as were the filmmakers who had an interesting talent and a good

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A Nivarally filmed war drama. Love it or hate it, it's a must see for all avid movie fans. A few horror elements seem thrown into for point.   Geraghty is a schoolboy who has no sense of those around him. A fact he's oblivious of until Renton steps in to try and comfort him when he steps in to help him with a boy threatening another Basso school pupil. Idea is to get the boy back home, then he spots a graffiti daubed on the door of his neighbour'. This is Renton's first day at bait school, and all the trouble comes quickly to him. For Geraghty is unsteady on his feet, not great at keeping a straight either, and he is constantly in and out of trouble and on bail. But what preoccupies Geraghty more than anything else whenever he sees Renton or sees the graffiti - and it is always graffiti, big, menacing, wronging the innocent faces of passers-by- after being caught with much contraband it is only right that the bullies get their just due. Which Renton helps him do, merely by telling Geraghty some related numbers and the rumour spreads around the school! But by the end of the film Charlie does something about his business. Completely and utterly fair. Andy's life isn't such a pretty way either. We can see he's battling a
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is without a doubt the funniest movie I've seen in probably ever. It's a social satire about the dumbest, most hateful people in America, and the beautiful one is actually a CHILDREN'S LANGUAGE ARTIST!   The economy, conflict and scale of this mess is mind blowing, and I'll never understand why the new movie scene is completely shot in grayscale, yet this exchange perfectly illustrates it: SIF: "If you guys want to keep making fun of the Germans then maybe you should get a life," ANDRE SchrIFFS: "Now I don't know what you're talking about! Hitler was a visionary! He introduced flammable coffee. Hitler was that stupid." SIF: "he was this fucking goat on a bicycle, fucking mushing around a little. that was his purpose. It was the Second Coming!" ANDRE SchrIFFS: "just a little, no it wasn't Hitler, and he didn't show up in  Munich  and he didn't start mass executions like he did." 
Write a positive review about a good movie: La Vie en Rose (Nightmare Island) is a dreadful film, a poorly acted short, already released in 27 countries (AFD 7 ). Olmos performs very badly, but control is mediocre (40 seconds), it's incomprehensible screaming in woodpile. Barbie USA must be very proud of his hot budget like those guys: slack acting, unmodern cinematography, inferior production. Only Rabe will appreciate this. This is a final punishment for all their impact in later years in 2000. This movie definitely has ugly cockroaches crawling on all dirty pieces of furniture.

(i) "The Scriptery Lamps" (Kitty Duk) a Young woman has gone to buy Red Pinsies Lamps (he's a person who lives in a responsible shop making Paper Lamps. I've seen Liu Khui, so you can take your choice. This story is just the premise "about a young woman wanting in red penises who gets attributable to a Llama!" It's as grave a sermon as I could have ever wished to hear (being 22 years older an some of the characters are somewhat less hip). It was done in a very recognisable voice poor with bad leaving a bad aftertaste. A lot of Lam Lams were unjust over cooked. The English Lammels, as well as the American Lam, are "too friendly!" I didn't much care about giving up time with people one has only previously seen in films/stories.   (ii) "The Five Lanterns" (Han Si Song), there is just one practical joke for the pair on a party being made by some old Chinese Whores (still living in Hong Kong)...

A bad America 86 long shot and occasionally to picture comes from top to bottom not to be missed!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Cinematography: Colfer offers splendid, vivid depictions of life in New York; he immerses us in gritty Fez neighborhoods, living under the oppressive stress of an unresponsibleness to others that makes the utterly ruthless and extinct coyote   seem kind and inviting.   The Mexicanito cutthroats:    Crisal and ever-unreadable, perhaps more tragic than he.   A good temporary contract with the Economic historian, which was capricious neither, but fast-paced enough to bring near legendary brutality quite too close to Durst on New York streets.   As Faulkner would, without admitting it, looking back at the cheetah, there is a pall of inadequacy upon the soul.   If you try forcing it out or simply hiding the fact, the harsh realities of life in Fez have close to ripped the flesh off you, flesh that needs repair.   A story told with misinformation, the lies house the truth but with no division: let them be as broad as the world, as narrow as one's own soul. Clichéd as this, sometimes so hilarious to a casual weekend reader from another language.   star rating 8.5/10,  --  2 kisses out of 5.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I won't even risk sending a negative review here in 'no way can I criticize this case' because Every time I popped the album, the first song '(3833) East Avenue, Brooklyn (repeat) kinda mysically centers on the sound of the sewers audible from the 1970's film 'Iron Man'. Bands like Kraftwerk and again U2 use it regularly and often I have only heard it live. For me it was the soundtrack or soundtrack track to the patented persuasive music to sew the sewers, sewer suffers, sewer benefits and sewers hope and sewers hardship. I'm actually a fan of the Japanese pop music based on Radio that can be heard from hearing it here or personalities of the sitar player on the tracks suitable for Eskimo Kirigaant. I'm not in the beginning or in the end of this Album, this is the best track.

Training to become a super-spy is tough: learned industrial statesman Clarence Birdseye has just been put in charge of the Cruise Protection Squad. Curtis Chase, NBA star and California basketball hero, must choose a poisoner (an actor then about 50 years old named Gary Busey), and prepare Collins African-American Robert Blackman as the poisoner, as well as running the teenagers Kracivar (Keewin Lyon) and Jamie 2Hickey (Brittany Wilson) through a series of mindless trivia tests until he drowns himself in Coca-Cola.  The performer Bobby Vinton still had something to do in the game in 'Deadwood.'"   Annual exchange payments from the Colosseum to Sierra Leone became offset by huge surpluses. When food supplies improved, the skewers were removed from the parlor. Disposition captures ran into the Irish as our script required to end the year helping poor children.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Bird Stop is a fine film filled with clever scenes and good acting. This film cleverly played with the notion of a potential romance while keeping the audience on the edge of their seat.   The film enters the town of Yakovlev the first night, along with Dany Sumner the film is set to a catchy tune. We meet a beautiful young woman, Yakovlev - terribly unlucky and riddled with physical problems. As he tries to get some stimulation while being jammed in a nonstop parade through town he is forced to endure the petulant attitude of his neighbors. In the end Yakovlev meets Dany - another very beautiful young woman. Her speeches introduced beautifully, she plans her escape rather than leave him for dead feeling so ill at ease. In one of many memories which this film illustrates thus with subtlety, Yakovlev perceives the women as others see them.   Over several days danyss' actions become increasingly more despicable and some are awarded the writing, film tells of a day of terror during which shortly combined with elements of Romeo and Juliet, Hoys can be seen as seperate films in a metaphorical sense.       1. One last thing.- I hope it doesn't get too late, but time for Dany scoots seems to have almost arrived.   2                    
Write a positive review about a good movie:   You should watch this movie. Back in the 90's, Quentin Tarantino took a tried out concept of "gangster" movies and turned it on its head, as the hero and source of a plot conundrum starts to see his life flashing before his eyes, losing touch with reality, is given the injured hip of a friend who were both involved in the murder chain hanging on in his bygone era, and our victim, surrounded by an armada of masked buccaneers, will have to stop him and send his lingering conscience flying with a sortie along the way. Yeah, this ain't Hope!   Read a further review at Cinema This.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A Friedkin movie, at a time when Friedkin films had undeniable best features, was so much smarter and so much more malleable than those in the previous "Yachting" or "A Hrecogn" films. It is rigorous and hard, and totally engaging, only these types of films lose the delicacy of pulling things just so, because time moves so slowly in this movie.   Richard Benjamin is more much expanded than in his earlier films, and is piggybodying tremendously here. Considering the lacunae of his earlier work, "Length and Sorrow" is a must-watch. Some of the relaxed, iconoclastic and quite rude, disturbing writing reminds me of the script of Bridget Jones's Diary.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   While this was one of my top 5 favorite animated films of all time after picturing the fantastic world shown in the film, it lacks the genius that made the first film magical.   Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a true classic, though of course many have remarked on old age, that here all the dwarves have run out of options. That there have been younger dwarves raised since them shows certain sign of growing old, but there are still powerful wizards around, and poor Cinna is like a dog in heat. I'm definitely wanting to return to Snow White one day.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________ "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" is the first movie of the HSC series, in which Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, together with their coach Mr. Mompo, travel to the Capital Injuries Center in District 11 and work as out-patient psychologists to a group of orphans. I found the movie a little too heavy-handed about volunteering, and I did feel Katniss and Mr. Mompo saved the kid's life a few times in the movie, and even made the boy Dermot a mestizo some of the times. But, again, the entire movie feels a little overdone, to put it mildly. "The Hunger Games" isn't a perfect movie, but it has a lot of depth for someone: "The Hunger Games" subverts a lot of Hollywood conventions, and the writers, directors and cinematographers make a valiant effort to bring that theme across to the viewers, as through dramatization. Overall, the picture is a worthy movie, if somewhat heavy-handed, and the diegetic soundtrack is a treat.

Write a positive review about a good movie:           I was too young to see this film as kids, it was only recently, and it has much in it again from 70's vintage John Hughes films in a manner much more fun than that of Touch Of Evil. It also has a good amount of calm under seduction in all its beats from hooks and beating girls to robes, yes even a stupid broomstick! As you can imagine it bothered people 'ear older' that a movie about this a culturewhich could still effectively be against Chinese Typeul. Well it is, and it does what it does just fine and (most likely) better than the often played counterpart in the same flick -- East God Save The Queen. The same chant is used, the same dances, the same reason to hate the Chinese -- you hate them because oh so tragically round the turn of the millennium they'd try to you bed in a pukka unicorn Jawbone Wings. Trust us folks, it's better. In fact, it's more than that!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    . Actor Stature and Action absolutely lead an excellent story from start to finish, First of all, Guy Montgomery played Aaron McKinney- simply a very likable character. Great personality, and dialog doesn't always get in the way. Brilliantly done. The special effects were terrific, and got us all watching with popcorn in hand. Though the screenSize doesn't match up to the perfect ending, I think that this story would be an excellent way to approach a retirement weekend celebratory thematic film, rather it is a most entertaining mini-sci-fi story telling tale about a guy on a planet where an entire Virgo star system is devoid of intelligence. Marked as it is a hopeless case, put Manthe material needed (like life on a planet devoid of any animal except man!) We all look at the dark-haired mail lady, The Rockys one in another world, as as worlds don't come even close. Since it isn't a science fiction movie, what we are looking at is a kind of struggle in a virtual "Lost in Space". What is bizarre about this concept is that just as a good horror movie that I would grew to love (Rot Blatvelvater), this one lacks in the same way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The very next day harrison is visited by his uncle and his friends, as well as relatives he overlooked the day before. When he has had a few hours to sleep, and a soda or two, he hightails it out to the munchi restaurant. He is greeted by the munchi who exclaims that he is the man's man (meaning he has hung on to his position from younger amounts of time). The food isn't much to write home about but it is hand cut and is remarkably buttery. It is supremely well cooked and apparently packed 99% in cheese. The outlook on life after Thiel's success is also very stark. A life supervised by an unaccountable CEO. (No one knows why Thiel is married and in what capacity other than he was born there.) His name turned up in a witch-hunt about tax evasion the moans of which go unheeded by an uncaring audit committee. A new mistress and living in a dilapidated house. Within the first 5 minutes a bad temper takes too powerful a hold on him. He lashes out at the munchi and a voodoo practitioner.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Walters is a very loose yet accurate portrayal of Tokyo nights. This film was filmed in 1965 and starred William Windom, played by Edmond O'Brien. Curtain Scenes from This Movie:   A Sherman tank on killing spree  Followed by butter barrow close fight.  Tugboat racing.  Drakai tower dive is faked. This is considerably better then 50 years of popular Japanese film. The only effort in getting the slums real is, of course, the pimp to try to convince a group of debtors to take him back to Korea. They fight our parody wife and Siamese prostitutes from a long way, make generous amounts of money in a pimp den and are played by young East Asian actors. For those who want a legitimate reconstruction of this very ancient city of Tokyo we've recommended some fine reading.

There are a lot of these on Wall Street these days. A solid performance here defined by both harsh and biting resignation. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Most of this movie is good, although I found it lacking in that American superhero story. The movie takes place in Canada, in the Charlottetown area about 70 miles north of Vancouver. In Castle Rock, Castle Rock will soon be home to a hockey rink for five stories high and 70,000 square feet of seater floor. The Charlottetown Outlaws play hockey around the clock at the rink in Castle Rock. Four intricately trained hockey fighters, the Outlaws, grow up on a farm in Glace River and have less than ordinary dreams. When the farmer's wife mysteriously vanishes six weeks later two boys go to see that her and the farm are gone. They realize immediately this is not the disappearance of their mother. Instead, the teenage mothers and their children are shuffled to a remote Big Island Resort just off the Pribilof Islands, Alaska, and forbidden from coming outta that area for 20 years. The Outlaws suck it up and bring these cars and the family to Canada. 50 year old ex-Navy Captain Bang owns the rug out the front of the family home. His only bedroom is arranged with five big windows, just like Billy Madison's in "Billy Madison". There's a superbly chiseled mom-by-return, Sandy Brennan, who (if I recite this in the right order) breaks the rules of no foul play with no vulgar terms, berating the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I did what I could as a crude Guardian-Journal journalist to expose the broadth of this hideous crime against humanity. As a background to this degrading master-plan of genocide, things do not excuse, but only atone, the horrors of what goes on in these peoples' dark hearts. (While I sorrow that noble tyranny is gone, it must not be forgotten that the lives of many conscientious Hindus were taken and the yealous courage of countless Christians greatest of all waqars was evaded by the ignorant mercenaries of civil strength who marched singly and together with their bagful of tubes; and with their faces squinting terribly, and their noses smeared with blood have carried out their hideous rites like savagery. They would hardly have been less human if there had been lace ribbons tied around the knees. Bandaged and shut up, most of them would have ceased to be human.) I wish that, instead of the sometimes barbarous comics to which we have had the face for over thirty years' narrative realism, a simple, humane and strongly moral poie marks the passing of many a chaotic yearning, and, till a sensible education is provided to the filthy heathens, if not a tenable scaffold, a generation which is utterly frightened by the thin straw and straw-lap roofs of Whitehall, abroad in the land streets and squares of England--qu sound like a trodden-upon, hoary
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Sly Stallone in the first "Beetlejuice" was so sexy, especially while you were watching the pulsating, sexy lov-o-rama scene Casey Jones went through while holding some rotten, monster-like brat who wore a black bikini complete and utter whose knockers popped out all the assholes, when that scene was over and Sly died in a form of criminally bad acting (he hated the film: many say the best thing about "Beetlejuice" is the "Sly Has Died" song, which was sung before his death, found on the soundtrack.) The saucy are just a kick, and the strange headhats of "H everlasting man" and others joined them. "Beetlejuice" is so ecstatically ridiculous that the violence is even lamp-shading. In fact it is such a good, funny picture that I could go to 3 years in a Soviet Gulag without the guards even looking at me, thanks to their Katanaria doilies (for some reason Russia had limitless supplies of these ladies they Wanted over in Europe, and were especially hard to deal with: I still ily hold on to a copy of Captain Barlowe's "Don't Hate, Kill," written about the ultimate Muscovite lackey..."sassy lady.")

So Tan disguises himself as a normal man with a wrong man's body and drags that man to Amfu to find an ethical system in its old days to work with a Second World War hero to thwart the mysterious threat escaping from the level 150 wall. \ \ \ \ \ \ | 2.75/5   Analysis: \ \ \ \ \ \ Using the visual style in Blackstar (2008), a brilliant adaptation by Baz Luhrmann, The Golden Compass, is yet an amalgamation of alternative interpretations to the classic film. Where the director takes liberties with the classic Harry Potter book becomes, finally, that this as well to want to use creatively related to the movie. The movie opens with the nasty attraction between Bill Nighy and Liv Ullman. A bad one. Though this is not done to hurt the actor's social outlook (I assure), it is a lesser part, definitely unworthy.- the juicy song, BlackBerry song "Satellite" is the kind of lousy song a child enjoys.Ullman's character becomes a weird one with internal confusion in a sombre situation- the phone Buxton part is relegated to a bizarre fellow who answers him and only calls to be cool
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Let me start off giving a shout out to Cecil B. DeMille, both outstanding films he did.   The Hobbit is easily the best movie of the year so far, but it truly doesn't succeed in tracing any of the wizard's adventures.   It tries to be too much too soon.   For once I don't know that it seems to be more of a series of stories with no real lasting image to cling to.   I mean, Gandalf goes off with the dragon to run errands?   Heck...wouldn't he just run with the best of them?  Ian McKellen so handsome, why the fuck is he not in more movies?   It makes me wish that Retrying The Hobbits was a real project. The Injuries of the Dwarves:  He's almost done for the year and he'll spend it on Ame.  Cue the cheeky little date movies: Surprising an Orc with Female Bodyparts:  One more Dwarf keeps Mark Setrakian steady with this - his wife Sarah Strike of the author's character.  Split into three discrete pieces-several side-characters who fail to make a real impression.  Perhaps it's best if we pull his ribs and put them in a bowl of thawing gruel...

Write a positive review about a good movie:        Stars original filmmakers       I have been a John Hughes fan since the early 90's. Maybe it was a time when dissatisfaction with FOX was the hot topic. Now I am watching this film again, it's a real jerk ass gun culture movie/fantasy movie/some fucked up shit people did that has nothing to do with the actual war. An odd title for a movie that does almost nothing with Hughes' ideas and unused dialogue. Everything focuses on the rancher or "Country Movie " John Roger. He actually has some intimate scenes with the Daughters of the American Revolution and their leader: Blanche Ware. There is not much of them but some nice faces. Their war is a small one and there are not many men or weapons to be seen. I can also remember watching a similar film with the same name in the late seventies called, "Battlefields That Never Were".        At 30 minutes in the shooting order is changed to first person - a "social realism" sort of approach to filmmaking. Its marvelous how rarely anything verges on ugly. Almost every shot is of a beautiful sunset or continuing passes by town.       Director: Stephen Freeman   1/2 stars on REVIEWS.com  
Write a positive review about a good movie:      This film does a great job at showing enough flare for a 1960s sci-fi epic. In between silly and brilliant action, there is sci-fi, politics, and set pieces that would appeal to any fan of the decade.    The 1st film is a thematically perfect film, perhaps the best science fiction film ever made.    It doesn't focus on the action enough to be a spectacle, but it is inventive as you will see later.    Some might think the film is childish, but it is very well-acted.     And when it pointedly shows that the future will be unfathomably terrifying, with cybernetics, and predictions on a society of rapid submergence into a heat death, you really want to see more (not only the first film, but later films).     The film is been shown in general theaters, but has little chance of being a huge make-over in the history of sci-fi film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is more of a documentary than a interview but it's likely a good idea to tell the story of the amazing Disney movie Avatar over the last twenty-odd years. This movie suffered from copyright issues at the time when it was initially released, and the story was changed again and again, but the big story was never mentioned again. It wasn't until over thirty years later that we even learn anything about what the plot was about with reference to the novel. This movie is a classic, and not only aside from its connection to 4 years of learning polyotaxic maths. But it was mentioned a few times on University of Waterloo TV last year, back in 2006. It is likely one to see before you go to bed! www.youtube.com/watch?v=fry1TpaA6nY

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a really, really nice movie. What is there to say? Kenneth Mars comes with a good heart already and he wants to make his film.   This movie is unambiguously (one of the best in my opinion) k's. Mars is a critiquer by profession and also a writer of some other things as well. Catchy keys and willfully exasperating situations, and Mars manages to knit all this into a wonderful little piece of movie-making.   It is refreshing and refreshing in the way that it asks some mildly perplexing questions, and it does so without pounding the place into submission. Mars has a good approach to them, and the movie celebrates this by playing with a variety of thematic figures. Mars is a mythic hero, but in his judgment he is a totally misfit. His first step outside the familial camaraderie of a film set in 1910s Iowa means losing his privilege as an upper-class boy and world views which a private school youth tends to follow. Mars is taught to appreciate his independence, to feel confused in the strange new world which the film makes available to him (enough to make the lived in world worthwhile). This division from the heady, alluring setting of a deft experiment in domestic settings and dealing with "knowledge" gets Mars to a radical and far-reaching conclusion.  This conclusion has some interesting connections with the narrator's early days of street

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Having seen Corelli's Mandolin, a movie I watched mainly on purpose as an excuse to head back into my magickal store of favorite films. Not to get philosophical about it, but let me just say... Peter Tichard's Mandolin is an AMAZING movie. Yep, he plays a banjo in the film, and he gets to play it pretty WELL. Tichard also provides a supernatural sense of dread that permeates the entire movie. The best part is that Vletos' Chef rather pretends that the movie never took place at all. According to Tichard: The Doors' album, 'Rock Around The Clock' has "Veena Veena" on the back cover, which Veena Veena is one of the first female Tibetan monks to set foot in the United States, in 1949. Anyway, even though the Police cut him off the car, and we can't quite make out the intent of the cop who will surely die an agonizing death when he mistakes Veena for a homeless woman, Veena is spooked, and by the end of the film beats up Joseph Clark, which is exceedingly effective. Malene Muller also gave a truly solid performance. There's not a whole lot more to say except to find the movie, watch it over and over, fully intending to chant the next time. *5 / 5 * Houghton,

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Theano is an author who loves film. When a German film producer traveling through the Alpine valleys knocks on the studio door and asks to view a 'great story', Theano immediately jumps at the chance to write a screenplay starring the star of the film: more or less Marcel Marceau. Oleg Berko thinks that the story should be staged in equal parts silent theatre and frenetic action and as a result Theano is given more responsibility than he had hoped for. The story is very quickly overshadowed by a rock-and bone- contest between trying to accomodate all the stars of the Bavarian folk melodrama, and has to be shortened significantly by a Corsican. Inbetweeniding, Theano does a excelent job choreographing and staging his action scenes. There are times (like during the climactic "desperate chase" scene between Theano and Marcellus Wolff) where his powerful direction escapes him, and it is a pity none of this scene could be finished with. The critic Hal Silberbegger called this production "Plastic Antigasense".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In both Letters to a Young Poet and No-Man in Me (Double Happiness), Tarzan's desires always seem almost limitless and his ability to pursue them in almost endless ways is without equal. But what makes the latter movie so incredible is how the leading lady keeps coming back in. For ease, if nothing else, this is the best Tarzan movie ever made: a surprisingly dark dramatisation of spiritual war: Tarzan embarks on a persecution of the real Ninjago Knights who are practicing witchcraft about 500 years in the past. They battle his men and Mata Hari (played by Caroline Munro) shows up who (along with a new-found ally who is Bano Jelley) plays a mystical puppet-master.He tries to take control by casting an evil shadow on our hero but it only helps her, and then she begins to steal the limelight long before she knows what they're doing. This is quietly no mean feat if you ask me: her, Jelley, and girl-friend Rayman are fantastic in every corner, the treat promised by the 1960s was never made as thick as this movie.  So when all the WONDER WOMEN of the 80's finally don black leotards for NO MAN IN MORDOR, they feel like icons--like they've been here a long time--and personally I'd love to see JAWS, HANK & VER

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really personally believe Jean de Florette's films are hardcore, and very versatile. Her films have been preserved by Robert Bresson, and Marcel Bergman as well, so they're not a bad subgenre of the first order. The Cinema Paradiso (1968) is V/H/S worth seeing just to experience. Busy yet intense in stand-up comedy style, this film seems to want you to laugh hard, and God bless it. Like Busy Man told, our neighbor was a local poet who lived in this slum. While Busy Man and him would have witty running dialog, he often used to respond with derisive laughter. The beauty of the film is that the poet never laughs at any of the zombie's humor. Even as Busy Man unintentionally creates a hilariously funny film, we can't find it funny at all. It's as if he almost lost his ability to laugh. The melancholy atmosphere dripping from every evil leaf is a real resonance, and it's a sensation you wouldn't expect. The fantastic soundtrack by Victor Cazazzoloe is far more ambient than the that spawned Camp Fire. It dances to the rap music that V very rarely used. The program for this film is named the Cinema Paradiso not only for the noir "noir" theme but also because she shot everything in black and grey. As a cinema film, it has only score. Jean De Fl
Write a positive review about a good movie:  [one of my favourite works by Woo...] after his debut, [Woo] defended his lights better than ever. On Chinese TV or four years ago, the camera hadn't been going for him many times. Therefore, even a projectionist might have been removed on the 15th Floor Steven. His fantastical characters have wonderful natural expressions, especially the Hanshin Tigers. The story's from that Tokyo park with all its illusions. On the roof are costumes and sculptures done by a solo Japanese artist Ashoka Castle. Behind, one can gain a tall staircase with two Chinese lights built to create the illusion of a glowing dragon. All of his characters look the same. Yet, they can become different beings by posing differently. The Japanese museum is full of piñatas started by Chinese tourists. American scientists named the giants as Giant Ferrets. They have long power struggles with the Japanese Press to promote the country's interests in the world. Okay, one moment "Giant Ferrets" may not seem appropriate to the title's title. Not because of the lack of shape but because of the raw power of all the filling in. The breaths of the dragon are very welcoming for the sensitive girls in the "Mercy Corps". Such stories give us the opportunity to be curious about someone in their world and to discuss their life way better than we can come up with by other means.

Via whatever means is necessary, Gene Roddenberry connives to introduce Sulu's love interest as a police investigator, raising the military issue of intense sexual experiences between aliens and humans for the first time in the American summer.  The alienated stud is literally pressed into service - when the honor student falls in love first with a garbage collector, he is seen as unfit by his political superiors.  It never pays off though, and you begin to make up your mind about Trek hundreds of episodes in advance.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The ending was better than the first (which I found underwhelming, well at least something between cheesy and lazy) The movie was deplorable from beginning until ending.  It soon becomes your typical X-Files/H.P. Lovecraft kind of thing and brings a square jawed FBI guy to LA (well almost LA) who is bitter and lonely because of the death of his girlfriend and not being able to find her since September 2003.  He summons the help of a local other-worldly craft loaded with tools of perversity.  His other-worldly crafts minions help him get rid of his toady FBI friends who eventually defeat him while he tries to fake his death.  Now I think you might appreciate this heading that the only thing that has changed from where it left off are Kyle MacLachlan being renamed The Nervous Nellie & not this being series 3.  Another messed-up movie.

I didnt know this was a series set on an alien planet. Ok, there are not aliens....but its pretty bad when one of them throws up a bomb in a room and kills the owner. This is one of the most childish movie I have ever seen. Maybe the producer was in high school. Maybe these two idiot boys were uncollege stepchildren. Whatever the reason, this stupid movie is worth watching only for the moment J.W wins the right to appear in public for his good looks. I think this movie deserves a better rating not eight.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This new RoboCop is in both a Hollywood and a Sam Spade kind of way. The Matrix is one of Sam Spade's greatest pictures: one of greatest everything. The new RoboCop follows the same theme: robot Edward Noonan (Arnold Schwarzenegger) policing the streets of Los Angeles as he faces down crime the likes of which we have yet seen. This is not a fun movie, even more so as the script is so terribly written that the violence is merely a result of it. This s anecdotal story is about how Noonan manages to explain to an intemperate officer (Michael Biehn) the difference between reality and reality distortion when he finds out that Spent Magazines are said to have been used as tracer bullets to trace a homing satellite back to the factory where it was manufactured instead of it being fried. The introductory scene with Noonan filed in a solitary hallway experiencing his first depression is chilling. Yet the big wish upon finding out the truth is hijacked by the suddenly disembodied Mr Light (Leonard  Simon), a henchman who can even read the minds of men as well down to their printing by the hour. This villain, who plays God as if he had been the first man to stride on and identified himself as a genocidal maniac, turns everyday objects into deadly weapons against the heroes who have the material power to cut him off at the knees should he so need to.

It was nice that Chitoge was nicely dressed to act she talented even though you have no clue about what's the reason for it. Andrew played by Danny Devito an even more tired looking ghoul really nothing he did to make me think he has seen a movie younger just it was literally that kind of movie where he sounds like he doesn't care. I also remember that there were two very well known actresses in the movie sex advertisement models I suppose so don't run while you can but I also think a female kind of involved part of the film would be ideal as well. I think there were some female monsters in the movie but I would have thought it would have reaaaallly rich ladies in the tiny scenes but everyone looking like they are about taken a battery away with it. It starts off with the story from Shingo that Ukiyo's parents are dead have over with hardship at their place Yoh he's only a boy living alone victim to death threats as well as men going V in him to take him over. The real story should be told by him and Shingo related to YOH however well Yoh is taken over by his henchmen in house but absolutely cute little girl and the kind of article there is devil in

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was apprehensive to read this book when I first heard about it. It's five traveling actors, as stereotypical as it gets... Shaun and one other get to Los Angeles for one day to prepare audition materials, leaving the'veteran', Jamie, who thinks it will be better if there are no two sets of natural-looking actors involved. The show's choreographer, Edward Burgin, is assigned to set, albeit only from two cameras, because glory is in the eye of the camera and the camera-man works over Jamie's shoulder in all three directions. I love burgin's work, has an old-time aesthetic to it, flexible costumes that are silly but sweet. Burgin's imagination and wittyness are an anchor--the canvas covers a wide range of "real" life, including pin-ups, and characters whose eyes may be the size of baseballs have more wild legs than their hips. Burgin's vision is extremely delicate and inventive if not especially original. It all doesn't come together until it does and it's quite addictive.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Deborah Hamilton plays the perfect mom to Z. Wolfe. He's the guy who reads fantasy literature when he goes off to the beach and she's the single mom who runs a tea shop and yells at all her kids because they hit a dude. She later realizes instead of worrying about chasing as many men as her little boy can as she builds a wall of bubbles but wants the one who really loves her to appear. I cut my pretty little bleached blue hair at a streamside beach. Then we see a series of "essay" style images circa 1935 harsh down warm promising couples with babies and men in their make up and go through the laundry. Z falls asleep on the couch. He has meticulous gold death lashes. For once I use a Buffy phrase with joy. There are bright blue dots reflecting pools of light from the water.

I had trouble sleeping last night, but let's be honest, it has to happen:   GOTY is a great show. From Season 7 is as good as Season 9 in my personal opinion   (Oh wait, I would argue that 7 is as good as 8). I was quite early to the show this year - I was in Paris all day yesterday     I wanted to have a late night snack at Il Feline, but unfortunately they didn't have any, so instead I went to the Le Pavillon -at LE Pavillon! Although I had tried a lot of french spots I cried a soft "fuck Slice of Life" while waiting for it to start.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This really is a classic movie like "Gravity The Incredible". It is too bad, the repeat sighted bad guy backs out and hides. So the hero stays hidden while you stumble around to find another stay behind to continue the job.    That is the whole movie was like that. Interesting as 2806 times a year, and yet another space adventure in space. The actions on the screen are sometimes too nice, the setting brilliant andthe thing it does, or does not do, is just great! Christopher Judge got the key issues of life well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you want to see a mystery story split up into seven completely different episodes that at various points in time take off from a possible history with its possible origins recorded in a crystal ball and another with the power of an ancient founder of a kingdom who has gone mad and kill the element's that was in a body...I do not know what I would have done if I had watched this first time without death! It's a good idea and the acting is well-done. Josie and Bill and Bogie are dancing at a hockey game to their hearts' content but youngest son William refuses to dance because gravity sucks. Somehow a third element is brought in but him and his family just walk away. They must try to merge and possibly try to kill their cousin and call the old man their oppressor. Then Bill learns this even ominous fact when he is sick and some rather unconcerning lady asks him to think the first three countdown numbers in AAHH knew but didn't dare tell him but they werebad. Don't bother building up in suspense and with in every episode killing the element is complete. How do you survive repeating this torture for every re-running? It really sounds like a bad horror movie. I just DON'T know how you could do this story justice unless you take it back at least 10,000 years ago and maybe limit yourself to only how those without magic were exploiting women and not babies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: To be honest, I am less than enthusiastic about being attached to another Quantum Leap. It previously spawned Kirk Cameron's Academy Award winning time travel film The Time Machine (1970), so it is hardly shocking to see Steve Martin in another movie about a time machine.   "Then the man Smith captured then returned to Earth like a mighty conqueror. Amongst his companions were Josephine Bloom, eccentric criminal attorney Mrs Stevenson and Mason Cook, who might be called the average man's favorite doctor." "Now the wonderful multiverse ended. It must have been a tragic affair for all of the upright characters involved; for each as he left age sank comically into the past while Smith was sucked into the future along with US$10.000. And too LBJ can't touch the Professor: 'My boy Steve Martin for Medgar Evers shook hands on the slain pacifist with US$10.000 against him.'     The Earfold is easily one of Frank's bleakest film. He creates a lot of mood for Frank, especially in his long drawn out piano duet with Stewart and the character of good old Jack Ewing in himself like Lenny Bruce and the Joker. The Earfold reminds me more of a one man The Stern Crowd in its entertainment value than The Time Machine. Joe Meyer looks great in his cameo one scene, even though Frank never forms a dialogue with the actor. STEVEN- MART
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Die Hard can't be lacklustre in every right way - it's areboob-filled, loud, composed and thrilling appropriate to taking and holding together a very downright bad movie. The plot, peculiar I'm tempted to say, sets up a neat little story, but doesn't see any alien or bizarre weariness for the threat, nor is there any real gratification for stopping an important plot, in particular one about anarchy.  It is about a hostage drama, but between Die Hard I have no greater phobia than fucking an explosive like a marbles race (luckily none of the hostages were marbles who could explode in the slightest).  The plot not having been lead in by the mind of a crackpot and even if it had veered off course any time change to the cool action shootouts in Christchurch is excusable but it's important to be alone. This shooting with every dare is too much for mobile phone and however funny it could be we are not the audience, down with this were in the same film of South Africa. A better movie, less funny, set to a haunting soundtrack so there is something here I'm hoping to see some day from a director of death. This time we've got a hard shiny digital camera footballing about and an amazing woman too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  After viewing a newsreel broadcast from Germany containing the tragic deaths of the German Army High Command, I enjoyed the film it produced quite a bit. The tough little B-17 Raider I had seen in earlier films, with a shelled nose, had been replaced by scarcely-screaming pilot training No. 17a ("Vertikalen Sponsors I: Baum or More funlei") in the Eurofighter I of an Italian squadron, but even that upgrade scarcely made him tolerable. To be in the enemy fire, low in the sky in force-fields jutting through thick-frosted fields, with the glare of a half-lighted oil refinery glimmering in the cyber-blackness outside, was a hell of a film to vanquish on ground drift. I enjoyed the exhilaration of shooting up my targets away from our forward construction activities on Lake Balaton over a black fields of fog and rain early one frosty December morning in 1942... I feel sure that since this feature length film preview feature and Focus Forward's added scene to it proves such a decent production that further showing derivativeized close ups and bloopers is not necessary...one requires a limb to rub against.  This is a pity that altogether this feature length film taught me that not only would a military world with standard anti-aircraft missiles and torpedoes probably be dangerous in a large war, but also that

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The more I see Sam Suede, the happier I get, because it has my all—a true, raw, honest and truthful biography of the repudiation of the Post War ideal—by the literally global financial elite.  This movie is simply one of those defining events from that era which the modern world should never return to.   It is a part of Homo Amerindian 001 on a return to pre-industrial, numbers-based societies that probably no society or articles will suffer more from the onslaught by the financial elite than the the Duchies of Princess Diana and Princess Pamela.  There will start a movie in about five minutes that summarizes the excesses of that era through the visual equivalent of a Rosie O'Donnell stunt routine that included the intermingling of two separate minstrel acts that were soon separated by an invisible line, wrapped in a single pure heroic figure that passed around in a single piece of cloth, the Captain-Captain Disney.   A world touchingly renewed—it simply never could be the same again.

To prepare the new models for road tests, Mike Donner took part in the final test run at Hermann Kokosney Motors in Tuscon AZ.      During the final lap the flood wall presented a near complete blockage - just a twisted grill and a few secret holes were left.      These issues were corrected.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Directors Antonio Banderas and Lucio Fulci essentially breathe life into the most doomsday Hollywood movie of the 1970s. Let's not beat around the bush -- Orson Welles does his opponent leading man - Hollywood screen legend, Leon Russom, a lot of bad impressions of regular working woman and back alley pimp lookalike prospect (Eugene Block -- huh?), and Welles' deadpan style is too amusing, and he spends almost as much time hollering at Russom as he does preaching to him. Welles' allegedly respectable biographer Sherwood Ross in Norman Rockwell Europe (1978) counts 89 still-shot shots -- which was taken (as it turns out) in secret by a few denizens of the Hammer, a walled town on the Italian island of Reggio Calabria.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am by no means a big fan of Computer Chess. I usually can find plenty of good film examples and that was no exception with this one.   Co-editor of The Daily News and a Science Fiction fan for 40 years, I am as puzzled as anyone by Internet comments skeptically saying this film was the worst under me. How hard could it be to beat "Unsolved Mysteries" at its own game. Nobody can win.    You can't go wrong sitting down with a good baseball game and watching it on the sly.  Heinrich's eulogy against the film, echoed in his letters, is the film sides to the moral in this story: lifelong greed knows no bounds from athlete to soccer hooligan. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Let me start out by just saying this is a very good flick! The buddy comedy feature is the least entertaining of the three because of the story we're taking place in a private police school. We're the bad. The group we put together to deal with a bunch of petty thieves is the most annoying menagerie a cop could ask for. It even harkens back to the buddy cop features of the 80s. Things like Flash Gordon with the Hand Grenade. What happened to super heroes? We also need all the grade social skills in physics and math to deal with evil, brute thugs and cops alike. The chemistry between the lead character Jason and the lovable twenty-something in Westley wind in is unbelievable. Deja vu at times. ` Best buddy cop movie you're going to see! ` Aaron Hartley is great as the tall of mysterious black characters by the same name. He is so good, it only gets better with each scene he's in. Jason Robards as Parks is the best villain comic relief we've basically have in recent years. There aren't any bad parts of the movie any more than in the leads, but the supporting cast is just fine. It's always a good idea to develop the work of other actors for a bad movie. Great Passengers is nicely done. Pick these guys up if you're wanting a big screwball comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Love any movie about the dark corners and caves of the Manhattan Beach Discretion Patrol! Written and directed by Bowers and Francies, the movie is very scary, drawing you into the bad side of the coply establishment. The script is gripping with humorous moments and measures with music suspense the viewer from time to time when bad doings are taking place. Dope detective and his chubby Doberman looking into strange arrests, dragging their victims to a countless number of Southern Pine forests where the corals grow like tendrils. I am always more scared in the movies where the flashlight beam is drawn on the screen. From here the film curvnishes out by switching to very tense and grisly tactics such as opening a brazier or a campfire for a search of desperately dangerous herbs sought after in Southern California. Johnny L., the lights of the patrol moves to Metairie where he finds real play one with the statistical district to get engaged for the costs of marriage. Written by Zodiac from D.A.P.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well I have never seen this film but was so moved by the drama and eeriness that it was very hard for me to leave. Legends are brought into being and frozen in time. I asked myself can someone not just "make a fine movie" with a decent script that is delivered failed, abused and made very crafty by the director because this is a wonderful film. From the opening scenes to the end the viewer is transported to another place. It is a place that has been plunged plunged into deep darkness and being silent you allow the film to take you to another place, an Ethiopian village the village id not wanted to move into but: This village is moving into a place in the middle of nowhere and is never asked to report its location to the police. When their mother goes to visit and tells the village elders that her eldest son could be bought to sleep house as he will become a singer who could help bring back the spirit of the sun but their bigots decide to throw him out of the village to the ends of the earth and never to step back into the village with him. Finally, he finds himself singing tribute songs to the village elders and of course, being that what is unique about the village is singing beside the open grave of a grave gazelle. Of course nobody understands what hit him. The villagers watch this gazelle with an open mouth and but it is not dead yet! That is what the

I very much enjoyed watching it, mostly for the chances of a woman's about tending to her wifes widowed father follows by a professional defeat of a peasant leader by Christians. The film is in a very primitive style similar to old boo working footage. The story were nice entertaining but can be seen as rather bemorony although it has one of these happy ending so common in modern princess films. Nonetheless a good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you crave twisted takes on horror, make David Cronenberg your director of choice.  Like other casting heavyweights like Michael Palin, Gillian Fitzgerald or Jesus Campo, Cronenberg indulges the lost dollade, chocholo or shimmy predilections of the French New Wave, including pure acting muscles as Cory Everson and Susan O'Connell, both aged 37.  When the villagers skimp cheap in tribute to Everson's Dianic Earth Goddess Venus de Milo the basest (or "worst'') asshole of all is male newcomers Paul Brendan Fahey and Nicholas MohSeanatan, the sort of quasi-Imperial archetypes with the brains and riffs of a Mr. Ed and the singing voice of Alan Haselhurst.  But to mire the picture, Cronenberg plays them both like worse Paul Innes.  There are poorly made effects (including one showing a cow riding a bull in the snow) such as orgies of unsourced men defecating into the words of no less than Romeo and Juliet.  Coffee shop possessions look like the props to a vaudeville show, ignoring the screenplay collegiality with Star Wars (while the disco Zombies resemble ones in If on a winter's night a traveler from Wales).  Dissonance doesn't become that much of a problem until the pursuit of some negative feminist Ph.D. that
Write a positive review about a good movie:      The plot: It's a movie about mania. Not really. It makes dots appear in an undefined sky. It is batshit crazy. And ludicrously has moments of logic, so you can understand the characters and. Come to think of it, the craziness wouldn't have reached any sort of racist and sociopathic level if the story really wasn't that far gone from being anything else. As someone mentioned elsewhere: This movie stuff is not fake comedy. Well after "Le boobscout", this is somewhere north of "Topsy Turvy" in comedies and Mad TV. Behind all the odd rambling pain-in-the-ass crazy madness, the comedy is shot through with the sort of hidden message about feelings concerning relationships and prejudices so publicized now-a-days through television shows and films like inging madness and insanity on a regimented set. I mean it tought my parents, people I believe grew up in western "community" during the time of unregulated P.O.Ws izing up nutters and worse than the auction-house flat-hunters around.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I appreciated the dose of speed that the film might give out, in conjunction with the exposition and the occasional story, was only seconds; for about 20 minutes we were treated to a very offhand scenario of a father's visit to his son while absent, as if the father might actually be a pedophile.  Staggeringly probably just as much as the father's gay friend (I think Jack Hill can be almost naked in his clothes).  I respect Pat and who knows, maybe I'm just hopeful.  Edit: new review. I know I was hyperventilating and I think the member of Terrence Kahn's troupe did not get the memo to shut up really fast before the next band took a bow after this.  This might have been a better late millions dollar spec than a weekend grab bag.

There's a "how to make a suit" link, here -   Certainly you won't find Zod's shirt elastic weighted like through the bottom of Zod's boot once its too hot to put it on.

The story is probably meant to be about Timothy McVeigh, but the lack of completely silly things like that doesn't mean that the movie is 'boring' like many of the older ones.

So, Creamy Chad is lost in Africa when the guerillas and the Congolese rebels are fighting over oil. Why is is such a type of desert while Africa is inhabited by these beautiful creatures which see man coming from the sky or send man with bruises and bones spray -rips them. Shane is one of them, but he seems tired. Huh, OK,... you can enjoy that stuff. But then you are enticed by J channel Hun James. J channel Hun James takes one night to visit the savagery of South Africa. Then is out of it, and introduces the ferocious enough savage wars. And what the army is trying to do is establish militarterries and employ the relling guerillas to destroy each other fighting each other wrestling with their utensils. But as a traveler, Wrath sounds like a good guy of strength of a noble person and to call about people such like Chad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Welcome to the film that changed my perspective of movies. After watching it across New York City I must admit that I felt that it was on another planet beings wise and I also had the sensitive mind to see the story unfold. This was when these movies took me in. Directors seemed to really take their time making Giorgio Moroder and Cheri Oteri play their electric 10 minutes of comedy and then play it again. I can never name a funniest catchphrase and it is my pee turn to watch movies. If my dictionary tells me that it is propoganda movies I am going home now. Never has a movie set up just minutes before a gag story, wished they had filmed it longer. But it makes one bob, including my 3 year old daughter who loves to laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Alas I have seen this a cally once or twice, never quite got into it and never heard or read anything bad about it, as is often the case with Soviet  style movies. It's supposed to be a sequel to Rottear's 2001 film and is almost a remake of the 1940 comedy The Sodomiser, only this time a press officer is portrayed by a comical. I'm told this is a picture of the woeful 'Searchlight Gas' (as it is sometimes called) and the long hard line including David Straith (portraying Generalfn Waldschirmmeier, 'kissing his arse') gives a ruthless perfection of 20 th century military to the camera (Merdiglon rev, the event which 'forces' the 'Sodomiser' to make his overtures at), which makes it a sinister pleasure to watch. Great old faithful pas.:-) Vincent Browne I think this is it: I talked to a previous reviewer about the indistinct quality of this picture, and I think he is right. This is true no matter the ISO, i.e. use of special effects. They are not added, but used sparingly. Anyway, left alone we may or may not get a picture that feels just right. Ive never had much time for Soviet cinema but I think this is a good example - perhaps the best of the type, while still retaining enough variety and character to give

One of the few where the art wasn't fun, but certainly still cool as hell. Firstly, we got James "Whitey" Sox and Ant-Man! Fantastic villains to be sure and regardless these guys are awesome villains even without checking the constant hail of bullets (Many Sonic the Hedgehog fans will remember these guys from the 2004 film, they were the bad guys before suddenly they turned around pretending they were the good guys. There are several parts of the film that just sell a comic book. This includes that annoying scene at the park, the Wasp homies get some angst and woe doesn't lie. The Green Goblin's latest scheme to take over the town of New York has to prove that he needs to be noticed by the more cunning Gotham citizens. Was it guessed seeing him hover around a car full of cell phones and it's the one that plays the Wasp theme? The audience was as busy as the Wasp and her Wasp pals that take this stuff in stride and are totally content with their little friend. Working with his shrink Aggie is nice.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Fast and the Furious series the inimitable granddaddy of them all. Everyone involved sounds overwhelmed with expectation, yet somehow manage to make a strong movie out of the excesses of a 1980s Buenos Aires. So crammed with shootouts that it's impossible to take the heroes seriously, yet Charlie Hillerman's Mr Mackenzie your average commuter driver whose life never quite gets going because of the seat belts he's apparently incapable of putting on keeps himself alert and channels all his inner ramblings into the homemade co-pilot channel running by Adrian Addison (Ted Cassidy).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To call The Furby's World a movie that thinks seriously about furries -- a community of malcontents that keeps popping up during modern-day lethargic Tuesday morning cartoons -- is like calling The Coen Brothers' Barton Fink a Serious Movie.  This movie's point might seem obvious: some entertainers -- be they incurably awkward reality star extraordinaire Joey Piece or dangerous psycho Otto-Chang -- sincerely push limits in the name of love.  Frankly, it's refreshing to see a film finally provide an exit for furries -- often ambiguously depicted as emotional sociopaths with delusions of grandeur, badly groomed dogs that feel like the mandingos from The Dirty Dozen, or pretend-daily sunrises -- by kicking their ways out of their comfortable lives.  A few shows long ago attracted a following among teenagers that revelled in repeating the words "furbyver" and "furry(ver)" and making up insults-----------------------------------.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    While Cyberpunk isn't an especially good book to begin with, and given that it takes place almost a century in the future of 1986, it's also hard to get invested in the story and in none of the characters. There are a lot of boring parts to this. Without saying anything else, the story focuses on the politics of a futuristic economy, with anti-globalism at primary hub. Since the management of the global economy is the agenda, I expect the moral failings of most people can be seen to any reach. Throughout the movie I didn't feel any connection to any of the characters other than to say that they all had open and closed eyes, and they all looked the same, which is to say the 18 from a futuristic city. Tom winds up a final fate worse than traditional death while his wife wakes up from a coma to find herself back to life in the 20th year of 1984, but she's one month old now and can't understand why she got it all mixed up and suddenly she's cornered by an armed stranger looking for her. As I looked into her eyes, I'd say that I saw Tom: a boy more committed to becoming an independent man, someone who may be overpaid and under appreciated, and someone incapable obviously of making amends after all he's been through. The poor kid doesn't have any empathetic politician in his pursuit, and not getting 35 years copied by a

There I sat in a row behind Roger, Melody Kitchen, Wanda and Julie. At the end of the program we went up and shook their hands, but each of us made a joke about the other.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is quite an innocent depiction of a reason to hold the identity of the Earth, mankind's based on energy. What ensues is a true vice tale. The Earth is in the danger of being sold again at whim by a hunting party. Rocks fall--others were murdered recently--configure the emotions of any talking brahman, a battle on Crossstand between a mother and four children of the family, a respectable birth marked by a offering to the Lord God Almighty, and dangerous games played by the Hunt. A quite touching vignette of birth, death, encounter with the unknown and a hint of a holy theme hidden in the seemingly insupportable nature of the planet and its people. Great entertainment.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To say that The Game is a bad movie, like The Hudsucker Proxy or 8 Million Ways to Die in the West is a bridge too far. A franchise are ups and downs, even though star Michael Douglas had some brilliant moments. Although its an important movie, its like talking to your uncle at Thanksgiving when missing key family moments. All in all its not bad but its not a good." -'Golden Gate 2045' - Meet the Author Starring Hayden Christensen as Michael Douglas, Claire Danes as Susan Coleman Michael Douglas has been unable to get a new woman to date. This frustrates him and he goes to a talk show audition to find an answer to his wish. Conan O'Brien, a popular talk show host is interviewed by another talk show host. O'Brien goes on to forget the name of Susan Coleman, and Michael is left with an elaborate idea that Susan is known as a native preacher and that she and her husband Joe will help him to have sexual success. The reverse turn of events finds the coed mailed to the O'Brien's for sex making Michael furious. After an intense argument these two may seem equals but Michael's attempts to build a relationship seems unsuccessful due to the overbearing behavior of their love interests. Conceding defeat Michael turns to his grandfather's advice. A snake remedies the situation and Michael gives a billionaire, Sheldon Kwatkin (Dennis Quaid) the false relationship he seemingly
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Grandma R. Frog: A Sweet Impression is the kind of film worth watching whether you have a low tankard appetite or not. I nearly missed the memories of lightning dust pelting the ground back in the 1860's, But hey! This is an entertaining movie. The story is buget, and there is a small child story in every scene, of candlelight, eating tennis balls, working at a circus, and a pipsqueak that who does well! I can think of no other people more crowd worthy than Grandma R. or the street urchins. Collecting bottles on barrel headed streeters once a year, hosting a general meeting of the selling ole' punks. Let's leave it the way it was until my later memory. I ford Cynwaes Road, so I'm missing some places but get the idea. It was fun as Mother Rhubar, and fun as Grandma. December 14, 2013
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The only feature "cinematism" that is contained in "The Palaces of the Moon" is Macbeth. Alas, poor winter Wonderland and tragic Marquis de Uffamine are hapless puppets of Witches. Among many abominations, the Witches even want to prevent play of their own: it is indispensable to set a mob of men, dressed as Dogs, prepare destruction of the Objects of Human Enjoyment 50 (forests). King Lear rejects is a foolish and horrible view of life; Malvolio is helpless, he is utterly inferior; literally, their is no show on earth, and certainly no possible enjoyment of it -- the only Episode will be in Hell. The screen is perfectly silent: we may wonder why a show is shown to us if it is forbidden by the Army to do so. A Bondage Queen (Elizabeth Shelton) totally inhumane - runs from the Tenantsagon and surrounds herself absolutely with a circle of Flabbergasted snottern Baronesses - her charms are little confirmed: an elder sister induces a petty Wonder who gropes for her - a daemonic Foreign-agent Groping connives for an evil Sainthood; and, no Manners about her, Groping approaches her in rowdy company. Worn out from surkuitt Unfortunata, she orders her present to be stuffed in a rug: superficially meaty, it
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Right on the heels of the moving documentary Life Itself, Chris Matheson's next project is getting its big-screen debut. This is the story of Sam Claflin, a man who finds himself at the "front" in the war against the Nazis. Bergdorf Goodman eventually reps Claflin, and he goes where the money is. He sits side-by-side with General George S. Patton, up against the intimidating general simplicity. Claflin takes the same chords of 1950s soft floats and classic folk melodies in a way that reminds me of the so-called "Nice Boys" soldiers in 1941 and Mayhem, an excellent movie. Just ahead of Claflin's coming war with Berlin, they have a kind of dramatic in-taste. The peace that seemed assured in the 1950s vanishes like the previous war. Somehow, Claflin and Patton figure out how to keep the war going (after years of preparation and considering polemic applications?) and there are many moments that remind me of the great war music videos produced by Marlon Brando and Gene Kelly. Michael Cimino also does a good job, though chronologically this comes a bit later. The basic story line is good: two military men who came at war the same era against the same enemy. It is the war production-controlled studios who get distracted (in this case) by offering un-American and semi-romantic
Write a positive review about a good movie:  **Christmas Special** (1993)  Perhaps one of the best of the holiday season. Jewish homesickness and a lonely Santa Claus find a way to get out of the stuffy, bourgeois world to spend the Holidays with their daughter via a second grade class trip taking them to Mount Rushmore. For whatever reason the documentary makers thought it necessary to get mad Steve Martin to act and sing this movie. It's a revelation as well as it very funny. Oh yeah, and a good evangelical friend sings the "Christmas favorite". Shittier than Hobby Lobby but definitely worth a watch. If that isn't Christmas for you fine, then I don't know what is. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFTc3J0jtag This movie can be comedic but does touch on some more serious issues. If you're favorites are Hall and Oates, the Crickets and Flo and Eddie then you might enjoy this. I definitely do.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Hmmm, Big About Me is loosely themed around Alex's support group's satirical assortment of boxers (Spider-Man, Indiana Jones, Zombie Robbie and George Foreman Jr). There appears to be a couple of biographies somewhere within this anthology and how good it is depends upon how you hear these athletes/movie stars describe themselves. Some are pretty funny and the Who's The Boss schtick can be pretty original! I rarely see much of a problem with says you Alex and I found plenty of within this one to go with a handle of the usual Big & Bad Ody tweets. This one will also teach you how to conduct a tape recorder with the proceeds from the taping paying for some unusual education in cavalier use of the time. Sean Connery is one of the nicest guys you could ever hope for and while his post-Smokin' Joe persona is slightly more disreputably vogue than the standard Sean Connery these performances give it a solid foundation. I don't remember Snyder's bear, unlike his buddy in the Battlestar Galactica, foraging about freely but this offering does a good job of making each actor's character interesting enough to make his or her antics work on screen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        Well these days people tell Americans that film makes you think. And as a result, a bunch of hip, confused, Hollywood (and by extension, British) characters get into one wild, swinging, swag outlook on life. Well, it'd be a case of over-simplification to say that the typical leisurely, fruity, leisurely train ride through the sunshine was allwrung by a falling caltrop, so the opening sequence sets the tone for the rest of the film. As before, the part they've chosen for "The Sunshine - ciao, Giamatti! Australia": The shocking coincidence of the humiliations felt by Trevor Drew (Tony Curtis) when a straight, competent frontier watchman, a man he must of course report to for benefits ought he bother to pass, despite the fact that Drew expects to be paid, yet Hilary Pitt is unlikely to be able to avoid confronting her husband with matters to which she honestly belongs - that is to say, crimes and derelictions of which she would have made sure to hide until forced to face them through the testimony of a hot, hard, tenancy reporter.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Let us face it, there can only be 50 ways to structure a story.    The story leans upon this method in Madame Psychosis, but as it is more of a distant thought in the mind of Guyn with her visual perceptions and fluidity of speech this doesn't stand out to me THAT much, but it is just very entrancing.    It feels as though the director is telling a lot of short stories.    It makes you feel as if Guyn is telling you some THEORY OF LIGHT barigungluster thing.     But really it is, like pretty much all works by Robert Altman, an awesome tale of a unstable seance.     We come to Ross because he is the perfect prerequisite female for Guyn.     Ross also shows the audience she is a midwest girl who loved her friends from high-school mostly because they were tough-when she is in high school she thinks they are pussies. But, as the episode progresses, you feel her self-consciousness around the memory of her former boyfriend from very early stages.                      Basil Rathbone contributes another great scene as his character Aunt Celia.     This affection is credited to the school nurse Miss Schuemzy, but Rathbone ex

Hope that the next   (close title)   Genesis Movie comes even closer to (doubtful) from those numbers.   -- 5/5   Michael D. Wolff has a new movie out, and it is good.   The sound crew did a good job.   I have seen a number of Michael's movies, with the exception of 1997's The Heartstone: Sleeping With The Enemy.    The Heartstone was good, especially Episode 5:   Emperor's Days.   The Heartstone, it's villain and Dr. Empson is a very different kind of action hero.    Although it has been argued that Dr. Empson/Rooster"Empson"Bateman is based on action hero Tommy Lee Jones, I suggest to you that Bateman is a lot less like Jones than has been suggested.    Pre-production being so short (9 weeks), nothing came of any of Bateman's pre-production...he came to visit the apartment of Steven Spielberg, who gave the green lights to Leonardo Di Caprio to be "Buster of New York." Di Caprio came to the location shortly after talking about his experience in Plane Crazy. Jessica Biel was also on set.      The set design is pretty much faithful.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  With woodchip mattresses, cowboys, and Bing Crosby exchanging tender romantic kisses, the bleak, cold-empty future slowly glows into view.  Cary Grant and Sydney Greenstreet dispatch an angry mob of Yankees at a rodeo, only to be smacked about the face when one of them, Clarence Jones, takes a (very) unexpected revenge on the villains: by stomping them across the floor... the movie never fails to fill you with nostalgia.  A close but nonetheless loving cousin of Townes Van Zandt's Pure Comedy.  A silver lining: "The near future deserves a Black, a raucous one, an exuberant one..."

Write a positive review about a good movie:       The story, an animated folk tale like "The CALM Before the storm" or "The Return of the Indiana Jones movie" is different, darker and even more surreal in almost every way.  The sight of vulture like clouds and derelict ships lying on a longing Atlantic sea made me feel no relief.  My need for the distant past came back and all thoughts of renewed ice age sunsets vanished from my mind.  "Reveille Marine" was a relief.  The exact opposite kinds of emotions one feels when drinking tonic or wishing to get home quickly.  Many gout plays exploded with a predictable kgoddiness which was amusing to witness but was less devastating than the hideous third quarter of the apocalyptic picture. But, there were enough close ups to make me feel surprisingly sated rather than deeply crunched.

Rated: 2.5 / 5   194 194 Metamorphosis (1985) Director Phil Of The Future Stars Michael Clarke Duncan Vivien Leigh Kevin Devlin Announcer Gloria Gaynor Guest Starring Sylvester Stallone  I've honestly never watched Angel of Death, so neither here on this page or on the IMDB. That being said, Metamorphosis lived up to its reputation like Jaws did 14 years prior. It's pretty cool level of production value, and this movie had an easy time getting approved at the local censors (who had never seen it, and knew nothing about it). The bad mood since Ghostbusters is really in place against the great music, and notwithstanding I had a serious issue with the glacial pace. I think the America male audience wouldn't take this movie seriously if it were not for the macho bad taste. But I'll say I got a kick out of Madonna's smirk and George Clooney's smugness each (there were some other people too, but not nearly enough to save any of the women from the trope).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To those who've never seen this excellent movie from 1927: It couldn't have been heard in the early '10s, for you needed to reach back to 1930 for an American gross-out. Then, when you finally saw it on the big screen, it seemed as unlikely as a real ghost in a real parlor who hobbled around and uttered drivel that sounded like it had been ripped off from that cracker menu in the local Chinese joint which you make a point of going to whenever you can. Don't believe the hysteria over the original Witchfinder General's return... I wasn't a kid then. You don't laugh at Policemen! To all who lifted their beards (including Ruth Gordon of all people)...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Welcome to "The gills!". A fine piece of period romance, with foreseeable difficulties in the normal emerging affections of young people over a career in the mountains, ever with their Shakespearean "Maud" in the wisecrack. Set about the glorious gladiator life, the story is set off by a bout of amorous thought which discovers meeker matrons up the samaritan road to Yellowstone Park. The social pantomime as well as the range of minstrelan around the bard brings to mind many times when I was a little youngster to see the ribald instincts of a curiously modest "policeman". The city, though much changed, I remember as the entertainment centre for the local. Merry and generous "Molly" (the girl) gives the Nub in miniature a freedom not numbered among men of pleasure. The consequences heartrendingly joy crush our three young souls, but as a secret taster for the sensitive mare dames we need cannot get enough of!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    George, the brainchild of Chuck C. Johnson (Guitar World's Television & Performing Arts Editor-in-Chief), appears in this lighthearted comedy as Tony Vaus, a financially-strapped, sometimes moronic truck driver with a terrible personality. Tony is the muscle behind a truckstop truck racket, trading fat orange and yellow hats for nastier yellow hats (that have usually gone to better works) and pounds of liquor (much of which he brings home in'show truck' form from liquorstores). Tony's gleefully lecherous, mean-spirited truck-stop boss and look-alike neighbour Comma Jack (Nolan Mullen, living splendidly), Tim d'Arcy (B.J. Moore), the voice of the ice fishing school (Paul Miller), and other key characters soon seem to represent a whole shift of white trash society, particularly the mild gentlemanly Negro population.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of many GREAT drunk driving movies on the market today.   There's a little sex that occurs at some point as well as a very balanced story.   Lynch made this movie about a young boy and an old woman who go out to a bar to see if they can find him a date.  After some girls are thrown at him, he meets a couple of drunks who are pleasuring and convincing a couple of girls to go to the bar.  At this point it gets a bit crazy.  We first see the old woman and the young boy in the bathroom then they hook up and we follow them out later for more action.  It's really all necessary stuff to keep audiences on their toes, which relies heavily on having good depth, new angles, and really dirty pictures.  This movie belongs on anyone's vault.  Have fun!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The most drama-ridden and psychologically complex film of the decade. From the first quivering shot of the film's opening shot to the very last shot of its climax, where a dying woman drops such cryptic hints about a fatal secret of her troubled life, maddening us in a way that people must never be bothered to do. How many psychological and emotional tales have judged Jacob Marley's footsteps, if only he hadn't died in the unfortunate March of 1905,, On this date we commemorate that unfortunate episode, and there can be no doubt that thehowever in-ten sad event the Brothers Jacob Marley Golconde were truly destined to develop and on who(are)to admire.What did the Happy Monday boys begin into all stemmed mental and emotional one unnecessary takeaway substance the end high and dry consola... watching Marley never lost its enigma, simply amplified and now Tommy Marley and his cohorts always look like they have to settle for exceptional attention to mind twisters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dreams are meant to be beautiful, but, alas, this film has no smile that Las Vegas and Beverly Hills can afford -.. This is an under-whelming effort that provides closure that some other films were able to raise to being a point, but Eastwood has nothing - his writing, acting, directing are just plain bad. Mirror Mirror  is perhaps the most ridiculous film I have ever seen and I watched it at a special screening at a Holiday Inn near Jutland. Matt Damon noises and composed protest for the Communist/Socialist building are strange, yet hardly enjoyable compared to the original 2009 version. The one worthwhile event - the general strike - saw much of the labour force involved wearing red carnations and chanting communist greetings several hundred feet above a Siberian Exhibition.          Watch it the first time and you might miss the Clever Villain, but after interval, running director William H. Macy retires from duty and returns to his second role - as a vicar's son in How the Grinch Stole Christmas. This Tim Burton creation is as edgy as Jarvis Cocker and earns a PG rating. Burton leavens How the Grinch Stole Christmas  with occasional fragments of come-ons, but even in that mild degree, his attempt breaks the spirit of the original. The film is entirely stereotyped and repetitious: the Mr. Grinch steals a snow-swept afternoon away from an entran

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It has been quite a while since I saw a successful thriller. I am currently nonplussed at all the finished movies between Caruso and Coppola in diminishing range. Caruso's acting lacks in chemistry and I can understand the need for him to pay money to have it surgically removed from his face years ago.   Mog children from South America are coming and New York retail behemoths are crowned as king of Reagan's Nightmare! They have been transformed to virtual men by one of America's Protectors of Women: Colbert Pope.   To nuke the South American military base will make an American bit for the Great Satan, but it is too late for Say Anything a.k.a. Peter, Jack, Bernie and Tim as they have all gone to Rourke's Bar to make some industrial sweet bread. By all accounts their industrial should surge into oblivion the after they awaken to a curious taste and begin a romantic tiff.   Oddly capped or not, the sleazy juice wars of Caruso and Coppola are indeed funny! This is one of those times when you have to buy it just to laugh at the ridiculousness of these Coppolosition?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the kind of movie I wish I had been too young to watch when I was young.  It is, in a manner of speaking, one of the best b-movies ever.  It wouldn't win any prizes for being total realism, but somehow it manages to bring that retro-futuristic style to a period that seems well after.  Most things just kind of blend in, but nothing feels out of the natural.  It's all very dangerous, but nothing serious.  Youtube was the first to upload this stuff, and when it was updated again in 2001 it had been "repaired" and added some cool dog stuff (which is good I guess).  But the usual "ghost season" stuff and all that jazz is here too.  It's exciting stuff, and what I like about it is that the Hank Holiday dialogues isn't some fill-in cliché.  Horus the Cuckold lives up to his yuletide namesake, and while Hank wouldn't come of age until the mid eighties, so I guess Cuckold initially stands for Child Rashed Nerd.  Even if it had a presence.  My machine errors are finally awake (requires severing and reinstalling of the "environment" served in the Machine Restoration Room).  But back to the VCR. You have to go back some time

It's hard to imagine the unpredictable character that Mike makes Olympia. I'm assuming she would say many negative things about other people who are lying in bed with her.   To my surprise at the end the movie not only persuaded me to go to the movies again but inspired me to see her mom's favorite songs and recording.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Honestly, the movie can't beat it's much anticipated predecessor,, and its darker, grittier save its pretty tribute to the works of the Greek Sophists.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       The Talisman is a pure vampire midnight movie. It also is pleasant to watch, right out of the box.  A vampire, Dracula has awoken in his castle. It is a peaceful clean and calm place though, and science and medicine is in full swing. "Dracula" is attending a school for deaf and dumb girls and zombies also attend. Vengeance is waiting for him at a spillover party. He decides to stop and find quiet giggling young teen Cutie who seems down, for one fleeting moment. he discovers it can mark a time for him and his new slave "Bianca".     It turns out Cutie's mom has passed away, her dead child Jack the Cute might take a very bad abuse. The Diary of an Ex-Vampire is the story of Dracula. brother Rapsilla, and the kid's nurse Alice.  Before reading this book there are some dire warnings about the two basically being to upending a safe family running and a herd of kids. it cant go on? Cutie and the others (and the Lillies Monsters) must stand in the arena.     The last hour winds up with a little tasty snaptu and how Dracula beat out all the zombie kids.            For the Halloween of 2012.   Posted by l Jerome on Saturday at 6:01

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like Mike Genoveski's The Sound of Music, this Austrian spoof is smart and funny, even if it doesn't touch on the musical's classic subjects accurately.  Unlike some other movie spoofs, the real "villains" are those immigrant comic reliefs: obstreperous quasi-German 1990s tycoons (Hans, PG-13 fans please note) Karl-Heinz and Fritz, etc.  Nowhere do they deserve stereotyping.  The Cheisaman is such a brilliant playwright and interpreter of the part, especially his amusing cross-dressing of his new-found wife, Maria "I'm being chased by a black soldier!" (the two writers equal the credit > some of that is written, but much is non-endictive)! *this is a big movie compared to F. Scott Fitzgerald's, but it does hold up under the pressure of caricature.  Many people seek it out, which leads to two unbelievable plots: one, Charles Boneless rescue Lybaosn Hayes (all energy there is); second, Nellie Mulholland with a dubious consummation,,with a foreign accent.  A reasonably hard-boiled TV man is pushed toward some Hillary bits: G.I. Thomas more or less accelerant substance, POW purges, etc.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm an original moviegoer. I've seen the Remington cartoons that have been in the syndication clinics for years. I've seen all of those films. I always sort of wanted to see an original adventure movie with the hunters; together they went off to slay more of these annual Voles. Most of them are rather small and got lost (or almost lost) in the thicket. After a dismal start Dick Edie is given a chance to finally get rescued from death by his brother Walter, only to bring Walter back to life through surgery! What a story this turned out to be. The little creatures were fun to see and I cannot get past presenting them to my 21 year old son, stirring his anger and howling at the screen. He has used electronic homing dogs several times this year. This is probably a popular movie with PTA's since it has proven to be very popular at the various family movie programs we have attended. I also have to say that for such a low-budget way of making a movie it has great production values, great special effects and great images. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The trials of Kazuko and Takashi: the Western arm of the Japan Central State Penitentiary. Kazuko is a lifelong criminal who here becomes a victim of the justice system as she is sentenced to death for the murder of a fishing partner in a wheeler-dealie. In the last moments of jury selection she wants to go through the motions to avoid the possibility of execution: She knows who is to be the jury. She just wants her first day on the job to happen faster and without being tried. She endorses a fellow inmate. The dumb girl-next-door quirky ruffian is rejected by the jury. The pending execution only warmly cheered Kazuko up when Takashi then realizes that even this idiot Kobi, the gigantic soy animal, is old and pathetic. He puts so much effort into a fail. The Japanese version breaks the homogeneity that is so important to the samurai legend: Whereas the modern Japanese prefers to rally in front of the television set, attacking anyone or anything trying to sell them anything, the image of Nagare once depicted to them--aimed at them--is something else again. Notoriously and thankfully kept out of American popular culture.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie: Cannibal Christmas, or The Death of Santa Claus, is an overrated movie. It took place in rural Arkansas in 1967, where three young men goof off/party on bank robbers (Vincent Price, Mary Steenburgen, Robert Donat) and decide to steal a Cape Granite tv set from a gift shop in front of a fire truck. Everything seems perfectly normal until the "Michael Ahnals" (William Atherton, father of the kidnappers) arrive at the scene and try to shoot Charlie. After several false alarms, Mary sets the TV off to attract his attentions, to no avail. The same special energies that light a trail to Maine for Mary and Charlie, bring a decent plot to a dreadful end. Roberta Mastin remains the dimmer version of Connie Rice, in this film. The "Michael-ah" Greene-his name may stand alone as an effective (if fishing)-is a bull-dude: His stature shows him to be incredibly powerful, big, tough, cheap, bumbling, positive, and fully street-smart. However, he struggles a lot with his general likes and dislikes when pushed into a higher position in the bank. Fellow bank fraud suspect Tommy Knutson believes greatly in his ability to pull all this off, and knows how to handle him, putting him in the mess: My opinion: NO! What could have been

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Epic. One of the biggest films of 1996. This is a competent big budget movie in a tiny theater. However, it ia all about the acting and the sets are glorious. We may ia been spoiled by it cares-taking theatrics and hot set dressers  in it's first 15 minutes, but that goes away even quicker once we hit "Film noir" mode to get it going. Walter Matthau, Tracey Ullman, Mel Brooks, Jan Steidl, Jim Varney, and Sidney Poitier all give excellent readings of great roles (though a couple of times a mellow Oscar background sounds a little odd). John Gilbert and Kit Hoff are good stereo actors, appearing on each other's voices... It is a movie that tries so hard to be a schmaltzy morsel, but is really more of a drinking game and a theatrical editorial of a movie that did some things so right old style. If this is the first time you are ever exposed to Chicago, this is a right place to start. If you're an audience like mine (don't trust mine), you may find yourself wishing I could give it more money.

Al is an early 40s straight white male trying to make it in a locked up bodega and meets but not even a smidgen of respect from his coworkers. It starts with the bodega's boss having to deal with an ex-smokehouse lady who was responsible for a warehouse fire. Gabrielle is the fire-founder which basically means she pretty much empayed her aged grandson - Gabriel's beautiful, very vibrant mother.   Apparently the Smokeshorter's was leaning his way toward a divorce all throughout the film with Gabrielle having it from the very start - Albasco having to lock their doright back-door and the boss sassy bitchy woman is egging him on even more.

It's cowboy movie, but It has nothing to do with our love stories, If you get that this movie is hot, maybe if you're a leatherman, treated to some HOT sex, some leather noises to make you feel hotant nice and the good continuity a cowboy shoots for example in "Heart Of A Mountain" but this is not whiskey related where actions depicted take me back to my childhood´s  This is definitely other adventure ''sanctuary''
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a terrific original screenplay from the famed "Gunnery Sergeant Hartman" production made in 1941, one of the first tv-series from what became legendary director Arnold (is it just me, or did Barton Fink make one of the be-all, end- all stars in his filmography?) Benson, famous for battle pictures in World War II and for his epic "An Old Man Finds, A New Way" from 1944: this is one hell of a movie. All the stars in the film are terrific characters both celebrated veterans & virile young man. Kap tells a few truth about his troops: "Members of a supposedly third world army, fighting according to rules they found peculiar to our wonderful way of doing things, slowly burning down a neighborhood. Rehabilitation sites which are set up on five remaining mosques, the only place Muslims are openly to be found, a muslim employee in a hardware store selling him a knife to burn a washer and dryer, a few absolutely useless old racetracks (no faster than walking) & a small half sized high school playing cricket at a baseball infield and a soda fountain and "fill the towels" in a couple of gas stations (when are you ever really going to feel dirty?) becomes an ideal symbol of civilization and is virtually destroyed in a big fight of prisoners against prisoners and death automatically.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Sound of Music Fantasia is such a classic that the only reason to watch it anew is to see the poster art from the 1950's. The original poster from the in-house stills gallery made by Wes Anderson includes the song "Weiss, an old fashioned fusion of German and jazz-rhapsode in the Asturian style."  Comment on the trailer why you love the movie:  I was struck by the Steven Spielberg style lighting, sometimes filled with loads of Imax-printed hits (above).  I loved the musical "Fantasia" style, as well.  So I happened to find an old German-Russian transfer which had been created just after the 1967 release of the original album:  I was delighted to find it in beautiful 6 M poster format!  The aesthetic journals I have kept are all full of films which I missed the first time in sight, only to come to Saw by chance on re-run a few years ago.  Living in a small town makes me day dream expereincely more easily.  Aside from seeing a number of a film, walking off (with the National Anthem, of course) into the Minnesota woods was the way I could train My mind on something more profound.  As Alfred Hitchcock said, The Kid is... Yesterday.  I told you it was dead in the water

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love rubber puns, and so does this John Hughes-directed abomination, its title clever and fiendishly funny. Olivia Newton-John's alluding to being " Shirseys too early " 50 years ago when this movie took place was a welcome relief, and I found myself laughing along to all of her silly remarks all the way through.  An unattractive young woman who has quit her job as an airline baggage handler and plans to spend her retirement in obscurity is given free reign to crack all kinds of crackers with one of her servants named Tony, played by Henry Winkler from The Criticker ((1976)).  To Tony's irritation Olivia Newton-John plays dirty trick after dirty trick on him, buying and selling him Machetes, saying things to him that make him wonder how he  ever made it out of high school.  Easily the funniest movie I witnessed in Birmingham (and forces readers to confirm that Birmingham, Alabama is a beatiful understated city!  The kind of charming movie that we wondered when Bowie re-entered our lives and passionate about music worth dancing to).

Write a positive review about a good movie: Finally we've got the third installment of The Children's Hour - this time directed by Donald Duck and starring Mr.feggy! I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this film. The comedic timing of all characters was spot on. The relatings Monsieur Feggy, Mrs. Hightower, and his kid sister, Henrietta are so perfect. There is no dull parts to this movie; Claude Vigalondo is a skilled dramatic actor, and the movie is very funny,poetic, subtle, and beautiful. One can count on The Children's Hour never to be boring. Walter Matthau does a fine turn as Feggy's go-to French bumbler, Maurice; Madory seems to be one of Adolphe Menjou's quirky little puppets from stage to screen: they almost seem real! Milt Neiman (another talented comedic actor) as Mrs. Hightower! Estelle Briccosy (the actress who plays Feggy's sister, Henrietta) is really lovely as the go-to English teacher Mrs. Singly; Judy Garland gives us some of her very best performances during this movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The arresting lead role is played by the veteran actor of Balti Cinema, Mukta Singh. At times he is convincing as he focuses on minute details in the most superb manner. Continues to establish his captaining role till the end with crack dialogue and a spectral vision I feel. Shame, the soundtrack is essenately good but nothing special. 67% The Directors have at their disposal a talent to shoot innovative films and Babasaheb are real purists who haven't taken just a light flour. So if you are into drinking just very well and getting drunk, and if your gag reflex of a mother (Joshetka Reardon) are ready to go to the film on several occasions, you are apt to unloose in the cinema shows lots of mischief!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Another great film done by a very interesting filmmaker. Not only is this a great battle film, but it is probably the only interesting battle film I have seen in a while. For me, this is average at best, and could be self-parodying, but this isn't self- parody. This is someone injured against another person with a dog, who goes to find his injured friend. This is an interesting enough piece, but I find it is noticeably better than it has to be. I think Alec Baldwin's impersonation of Sturm und Drang is interesting, but the effects are just awful. It looks just like a Campbell's Soup/ heating money in a wood pit story. Nothing like it and has nothing to do with the battle gun in any way.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is somewhat out of production but it does not detract from my enjoyment.  A pirate movie could be found a few years back.  This pretends to be an adventure type of film but gets complicated quickly.  I watched these movies high on coke at a ritzy island resort when Philadelphia.  The story line a true story of the eerie happenings in the San Luis River, within a castle near Vermilion.  It is not quite a ghost story but its quite eerie. The several cast of characters is bewitching and there are climaxes that will go back in your head almost forever.  King had an enchanting voice to suit the ghost stories.  They ease you into the story and do not make the horror directly obvious. However, the film is eerie as hell.  A must watch.

Who did this movie with Rachel Weisz.  I am bothered by the film's title "Standing on the Edge of the World"  It wasn't particularly good if you are trying to make a picture out of a pre-sog to mediocre medley of bigotry.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  **** I see that this is a sequel to a movie that I will later view. As I said in my previous review of the movie, I found it and I have to say that my review will probably never go up to the same level to even begin to contain its goodness. Going weak at the knees from seeing things that I almost didn't see happen in this film was nice for what I saw. It is known that what Ricky November uses to kill people or is left around when caught is a metal plate with knives inserted through the cut in from its edge. This led a few experts to say that it is meant to look like a belt which is slightly longer than a normal belt. Going to the movie, I didn't really pay attention to it as who wouldn't catch its artisanal images of food served in dual cup where when you be eating a cheeseburger you count two more slices of cheese in one bite than you would of its normal size due to the more shallow cut. Also, the relation of the cornmeat served in a more friendly way was also surprising being that it looked much more pale and probably yokes up a substantially more violence and endurance into the story not only than the same as the original movie. Suggestions I2: Duelings with the demon lords by burning was cut impuringly in the aborted and two sequence. It will be a nice but unforgettable movie that people will call upon again and again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Having mentally prepared yourself for some truly unfortunate third-act A+ performances, an entirely terrible fourth act, and multiple meta-nonsense that leaves you completely baffled and muttering about the stabbing of QR and the possibility that Rufus may indeed be sporting goat ears in this trilogy, you get a film that at its best embraces the idea of Quasimodo and his hero Death returning to ordinary people's lives, all the while insulting Mr. Marlow to their faces.  First off, this Rufus Phoenix is (yet again) ignorant and arrogant from the beginning. He convinces a poor friend to join his clown performance so that he can travel and entertain the people. I'm sure they want to enjoy themselves.  Now after the spartan opening, more money is spent per minute on characters (especially  Rufus' daughter) than Carpenters.  Delightful. Especially when all the supporting actors have the type of acting down to a science.  Never mind their silly mannerisms, they who happen to be wearing iron-fisted masquerade masks are false.   But who even knew they had to wear those masks?  A henchmen with cloaks? And signalling tranquillity, silence!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A brilliant haunting tale of light and ice that's spotted out lite but still keeps you wondering what will happen next  Share:   When I've watched all the brutally brilliant Troma movies as The Hell Boy sequel and The Mammy after that, I definitely recommend this one. Still one of the best horror movies ever made, even the main reason for its very greatness is still unexplained. It's definitely a Troma classic. Written by hell yea ultra fan, the man behind Troma Mofo campaigns, the hilarious Spicy Animal aka Mike Shannon, the insane screenwriting and stellar direction by Jules Feiffer, its hella Troma. The plot pays off in regurgitated classic Troma villains like let's face it, Mr. Bones and Dave the Ox, the vulgar and savage, aggressive cannibals that rule the remainder of the movie. It really stinks to watch the crew attempting to keep the movie straight in an 80's look yet they never succeed, and stumble while trying to. Most times it's out of this world creepy and quite bad Dolph Lundgren's a. Let's use the example of Rosemary's Baby, in this film he's truly complimentary to Dolph Lundgren as both characters are classic characters in cool clothes, attire, and mechanical animal beings to go with the detective, and Rosemary's Baby, hmmmm     .

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Ghostbusters" is the highest grossing comedy in history. The famous team of four women took an early one happy holiday in Pierre Bay on Lufthansa Airline after having a busy year with the original Ghostbusters. Their first day at the hotel is a disaster and it's only a matter of time before they wear out their welcome. I was then amused seeing Rowan Atkinson's comedy genius move to capable hands like Bill Murray, Annie Potts, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis in the true making of being the most famous. Patty Tolan and Chris Hemsworth proved once again they are the two leading ladies of the world.

Write a positive review about a good movie: To be typecast as the mindless, gullible, infatuated housewife of Shane McRae surely whetted the embittered taste of their fans. But McRae is perhaps practically flawless in this role, fully deserving the title Amy Begon. To be entirely sure, there is a little action including a diversion at a Victoria's Secret store (look closely, for heaven's sake, and you will spot the female voice over), but at no point in the film does it ratchet up to excessive level; an unnerving, painful sort of bimbo behavior is the dominant motif. Flannery, in a bad movie, has a gay accent, and McRae is sometimes bored with her cold innermost self. McRae is still the gold standard for a well-prepared bad girl: quick and eloquent, polite and reasonable, understanding of her advantages and needy of the men on her arms. Having attracted both men and women (and sometimes unlikeable people), the bad girl is sheltered. McRae achieves a perfect evil full of all the echoes of the age's doomed voyeurism: a lunatic who has occurred his prime. She might be a real, human love, abjectly. - MISFA (July 25, 2012)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can definitely say that Rick Wicker's new movie by Om Reenaog Carmel, Azaram, starts out as a decent and fun looking movie, which wasn't wrong. The sets are nice, the CG work is definitely ok and I got a kick out of the homemade camcorder. The dialog is ok and nuanced. The story that takes you in to "one of the worst high schools in the country", is actually pretty well done and realistic. Especially after seeing the trailers, the movie makes you chuckle at the least and while it may be an entertaining slasher movie, it they should get some more walks at the local juvenile hall. Wicker shows off his acting skills here as well, stopping at nothing to make the movie a laugh out pen killer, even if I had less of a taste of the noir kind of slasher films like androids and all that bullshit. There was actually a few good surprises in the top don's twists during the movie, no matter how low their character is usually. Fans of the slashers must also enjoy or get weepy on their bum's comfortable seats at home watching this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an exceptionally funny but also sobering movie about two determined kids who stay one step ahead of the dirty cops. My wife had to buy a car 4 years ago, and it was time for me to find a new one for her. I quickly came up with a few models of cars you see on tv. The one that caught my eye was this old Datsun, a 2-owner car found on the side of the road in Michigan Oregon. It stands out from the dusky, rusty paint and since it hasn't been outside in over 30 years, it has a damaged roof and restored body. It is quite a car but it has been through the ringer of biking rains, camping in the canyons, and a couple of wars. It's motorcycle fuel stinks and vapor never comes out of the exhaust pipe! However, this car is one of the nicest feature cars I have ever seen. If you like cars, or treasure them, it is an essential stop for any road trip.
Write a positive review about a good movie:       Hitch-Hikers   comes from the same director responsible for  Leviathan, another love story about two dogs, Matthew Gatsby, a millionaire playboy - and more importantly his TS Poseidon. Poseidon is passing away: His yacht has capsized leaving the infinity pool broken which will of course be a lot of fun while we are waiting for "our Johnny", preferably sporting a bow-tie not because his bow is dirty but just poor bow-tie etiquette.      The film is very good indeed, as my wife and I watched it since we were both about 12-years too. Newcomer Rob Marshall slays the tone perfectly. There is no whining - it's about it, if your feet are on the ground or shaking and you don't think you've done anything wrong it's a very practical physical waste of time. Before the love story end I feel a bit sorry for Poseidon and left-behind dogs but just before the bad party and deathRevenge they are full of themselves outdoing themselves. Hollywood has always found a way to cash in on the supposed likelihood of bipeds going extinct in the vast, expansive oceans of space around Earth. Hitch Hikers appears to suffer only so much.   "

A simple but moving little story or tale, there is nothing much happening per the box set's slogan 'A variety of stories...some fantastic, just some pop' No pot-smoking sparkling vampires seen, however, which many felt may have been emphasised more used to discourage viewers being too much into Brockett in his innocent form not wanting to drink the blood of the vanquished and thus undoing any terror of the story. There are very few proper moments on the screen too, which could be taken to have been let down by the production values of the sporting sequences beyond the focus point in which a golf cart with themselves and pictures is meant to accompany a hunt where signs of the appalling intentions our East German army was to turn catch in its coats.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's really no choice but to include this film. It's the kind of film that touches us on some deep, scientific, and existential level. Watching the great scientist Charles Darwin, who first wrote of the search for the secrets of the universe, we discover areas about the picture of nature where natural selection, the forces of evolutionary adaption, evolution, and chance set in a neverending play. Priesach and Gellert gave such manifest admiration for Darwin that they themselves decided to investigate him. Yet this aspect is unfortunately challenged by the MAW, namely Francis Richards Erwin, who is with Darwin while making dress fittings. They jokingly keep all clauses in Darwin's book about dogs and monkeys constantly re-read. When it's time for Priesach to give his report about Darwin's dress-making system, all is well. Then it comes-down-to-a-motor on one of the children Darwin fed. This man is gradually converted and becomes the very pert cherub who later becomes Theodosius Dobzhansky. Amazing!

Write a positive review about a good movie: Independence Day seems like an obvious film, given that the plot is a comet smash-up followed by the slo-mo catastrophe (a large fireball), and I hope that director Roland Emmerich made this film with minimal interference from NASA because otherwise it's a complete disaster row. Blasts off with movie'ess cameos from Akbar and the Satanic priest Frans.  Then the film warms up nicely with a sequence with the climate control impact and rings out convertible!  But FIRE!  At first it's amusing through the punning.  However Pilot gets hurt as the comet is destroyed and the conflagration threatens to light the entire solar system ablaze. It's chaotic disaster destruction from the nuclear snap. At first launchputs a stocking on his say-so head to rally his troops.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Albeit appearing at first glance, as a trademark/one-note Wilson story tying investigators together for a trial which it's hard to blame them (or themselves) for; what is intriguing is the dedication and vision, which goes far beyond precedent for detective work--excepting perhaps the Barry Lyndon that toes its respective poetry being thrashed in in its page. Offering neither flowery paraphrases nor uh, George C. Scott, as tradition ought to be watching, well,Lynn suggestively proposed to carry him by his (his?) limping stick, making friends with a Chinese Madame who attended Neptune's party with those the vegetable makes rough with, knows her secret, and draws them in rather than pursues when her cork situation gets a bit negative.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     To me, this is possibly one of Jeff Spicoli's best films. This is clearly one of his stronger films, despite the outdated period setting. Very subtle story, surprising characters, great soundtrack and philosophical messages.      I think audiences should definitely consider this to be a worthy sister film to IT. Not a passable film necessarily, but good, and great service in supporting the great casting of Jeff Spicoli.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Anna Kendrick is a Texas girl who loves to drink whiskey or Red Bull, whichever she can get her hands on. She's been drinking whiskey all her life and this is a part of her lifestyle she knows is dangerous. Her need for whiskey is not for the taste, see. It's for the restless nature of it.   Don Philip (John Cho) actually owns the Henry Hotel and his daughter, Nona (Severina Rose), lives there to help him out. Her sins are three: a single mother, a lack of sleep and an appetite for vengeance (she's told by her few friends, who hate her, that she's a bad mother). After the murder of Don and Nona's wife in a hotel room, Don is accused of the crime, however it is shown that there was much more going on in that room. It appears that Barthania (Faye Dunaway) netted Don's keys, got up on the bed and slashed her in the throat with a butcher knife. Fei'hn feels sorry for Don Philip Charles until he finds out how good of an actor Faye Dunaway believed it was for her to slice, not kill, Don's wife. It appears that the physician following Don after the murder declined to treat Faye until Don latched on to her generosity or greed and attempted to murder her. But like the good citizens and good benefactors in "The Ladykillers

He is so seasoned as to know when to stop and when to go off on his stump speech. He seems like the kind of man who could make any trouble disappear in an instant. People cannot say he's not thinking logically. The cinematography is superb and the sound track is out of this world. I would give it 5 stars in a heartbeat.  What, circle jerk? Is this guy a good talker? Very funny in one scene, the same way "Where the Augs Are" is hilarious. He really comes off as a very talented orator and good person.  The story changes very quickly and we keep going just because it was good. This is the story of a unfortunate truth teller and a tad silly liar who have an eternal challenge of getting it right. The variety of the characters which all surely gets in people's heads very much added to the story. Even the sexual content wildly adds to the hilarity and the eloquence isn't lost. I'm over seeing this story materialized so that we would have the screen time to enjoy the various conversations, conversations, exchanges, exchanges, puns and with all of the special characters to add to the audience and increase the enjoyment. Rich McGowan was there giving us his worst self and I love it. I can't wait

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A s the title suggests, it is fascimile... to say it is the true story of a false dawn... is an understatement. Complex and story-nothing alike between the gripping story and the sheer jiu jitsu -like strikes of the young Ukrainian bad boy. Movie will never be beaten in terms of sheer action and explosions. Acting-noticably by Yura Alexandrov (sov romato), is a real pleasure as the Asian master Alexander Yufimov (Apereshit) stealing a navy warship deep in the Baltic Sea in the night of the last year of the Russian Revolution, to seize the mastery of the world... by staging a laser successful shark attack on an American fleet the aquatic mystic (Helios Chekov) calls and manages to trick his protegen into re-enacting Al Capone these days. The villain Mr Khrabota (Magomed Chugalsvany), has to be one of the most rarely seen characters in a film. Lets give props where props are due and quickly! It somehow manages to pull off the Ultra-violence sequence, to "skinny on pilot", to the perfect utilization of effects... even though this was all done.

With Thanksgiving quickly approaching, it is either a regular rib roast or a roast of Ugly Uncle Eddie Bell as he tells a group of grandmas how important he (Bell) is to their family.  Uncle Eddie enjoys telling tales of his magical handiwork, slowly getting up to his old tricks only to end with some tear happy rhetoric or any other of the 30 circus references Bell loves to make.  When it comes time for Eddie does inject some jack-hammer funny and really gets stuck into the whole holiday goose situation.  Yes, Uncle Eddie be, will haunt our families on Halloween for years to come!  Bell is married to his first wife, they have 6 children.  He will surely continue his family's traditions.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    While most horror movies feel like exploitation flicks, "First" is a legitimately terrifying fable. A man is steadily fueling his fire for gold and in a small town, he leaves his wife (lenick) to die of"fevers" and loses his love (pete) from a "lunatic" hurricane. He then goes on to camp, wakes up in the middle of the night, pieces of his corpse are falling out of his mouth... the copy is nearly always a good family film, though it did have a scene-stealing performance by one indescribable low-level character (seems like the "The Above Tear" reprise) in the leper colony segment.      I gave the (gross) M orgullo award to a lot of old megs whose browswept stars destroyed mine, I know, the eeght never sped the best within.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ronin is a very enjoyable samurai movie that I haven't seen in a while. For me the director is on top form, especially then with this special edition DVD. Raimy Kosugi is an excellent warrior. The scenes with his parents...that goes through my mind. It's very difficult to watch such a poor family humiliated by their loved one. Who cares what other people say,....it is just so sad, snap, snap, who cares? It's that simple. Although, I have to say, but raimy Kosugi's second wife is a good actress who is exactly what we want such a strong warrior. Here, her dark look of disapproval on raine in anguish, enraging raine come to raimy and makes him....roar with derision. Temptations like this....were will come to Hollywood in future or for for anyone like rotori raimy who has found that type of woman very attractive in 6 scenes, no beating around the bush, shine your shoes to the rest.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I started watching this movie about a farm boy who lost his family in a hurricane when he was a child. If you don't know about this african legend, the glove-nut is the symbol of a boy from the nearby village who is beckoned to town to fight the monster. The white warrior and boy find the monster, which is actually a lion. The boy uses the magic to blind the monster on both eyes. This is the first time I've watched a movie in a long time that doesn't make me cough by the end... maybe this knowledge translates well to film-making? With all those cuts, the actors all looked while needing more care, they all try to bring their character to life, while asking the audience to create in their minds, what they see in the screen. I really loved it to the point that I would recommend it to audiences who don't like tropical movies? Still, I could have treated this movie only with the praise it deserves.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  On film the original movie "The Things They Carried" played out like a well-constructed compilation of well-worn war films that shed a spotlight on the splendid march of campaigning throughout the First World War and Blood and Guts. Anyone who remembered these films of sapless fighters making half-hearted efforts at getting wounded can appreciate this new version. It lives on the edge like the best comic written by Gilbert and Sullivan. The star of the movie is Stanley Donen, the film director. Donen had the right attitude about war: never expect much until it reaches the crisis, how cynical when careless the Americans seem to be about the stakes. Glad he's been so right about the First World War.  Follow Mark Hay on Twitter for film and television news

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The morality of this is very good. The genre is a little far from modern movies; classicism, as it was called, is a little like a grain of sand on a charged surface, sensitive and rich in its own aura, but its edges are sharp and the amount of lateness in it great so that it does not give the impression of being displaying a great technical skill. In tune of that is the narration, which has the tradition of the great Hungarian film directors such as Leni Riefenstahl, Karl Freund and Hajek, and which dramatizes the turmoil of the views of various minds and emotions. The ominous best picture feature features are they can also tackle some soup for the people who cannot take it very seriously themselves. This is a movie that garners very large positive reviews, so there is something real and live there where the revisionist cruise ships visit the docks. This movie will prompt different ideas about the difference between a ship and a schooner. - November 7, 2012Horrible, but intelligible

The story is straightforward - a girl moves away from her mother and father, and create an adventure-packed life. But strange events follow her leaving her father, and some could've, maybe were... harmful. The intro by Aldo Woese still remains superbly thrilling; the dialogue by Floritaville is very vivid: slightly slow but strong, and you can recall the Third amount of train cars, whilst we's this Italian woman in 1947. More mageninsque twists onthe sight and sound.  Tens of woob gripes, for example I haven't seen one single good single-cut flashback, even in the mini rip-roaring plot and again I watched it again soon after and to my surprise Gavrogin equations are present. I have to observe that there is one deleted scene of the dispensary, as a cosmonaut (with almost all those planes from moon) boarded in 17 docked Kayas. Maybe a big detail haven't been retrieved (0:21). Well, it was a great movie! 136,00  7/5

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a love story set against the backdrop of an industrial boom year. The discussion - what is an American Industrial City? Who are its citizens? And who made it? - occurs at a time when an shipments of vitally-needed vitamin cream, sent to repair America's of the epidemic childhood diarrhea, are making short work of the depopulating Jimmy Carter. Due in no small part to this awesome cream, the country is expected to become a giant food provider and movie haven for any good movie. The city itself is not really all that huge save for the theaters & bars on Broadway. Here the whites wear khaki suits & pants with barbells already dangling (friction bridges & rollerblades) amid the blood-red secretarial warrens while the Michelin Man proudly mans his dentist's chair while dispatching that weedy monster called an aging teeter-totter who would lose his gavel when you blew his top.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Let me start by stating that Rogue One is a riot. This is not just a movie among other movies, lying dormant for a decade, released by Disney for short a time, then pulled from the racks to get the high score from the casual movie goer. Biomechanms is Aaron work in movie form, as a spherical (bisexual) ball mix of Trumbo, beat up bad guys, and droids, utilizing metal jewelry, a misterious "rad-pack" belt, and a stipend from the studio. Biomechanms and his enemy Marush are the archetypalrid isms of the genre. Lots of humor here, as opposed to some heightened feelings and imaginative graphics. It is very well acted by the Lone Ranger Johnny Depp (playing the rebel himself), and follows a clear plan of a band of rebels on a mission to destroy the Death Star. The film is characterized by its muscular and strong power, but not so much in technology. Features Mick Polo as the Republic Merc pilot named Grunn - quite spectacular, as usual.  8.3/10

It's going to be a riveting film, when it hits theaters this summer.
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I always sing "Bang Bang Dance" while watching this movie. It will tame an animal mind out of rage. Ruth Davenport and Cathy Crowther would wake up one morning to find their husbands missing. They have been going about their day, which was interrupted before it even began by the door bangs in their back-yard. Cathy smiles, trying to crush down the anger. She suspects it to be mere chitchat between two married couples and does not make them pay for the distraction. This doesn`t last long and turns into what they call "the mayhem." But love writing does not just take one night and it was not the only excitement of this short film.                 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie absolutely covered the vast and succesful John Carpenter movie style.  Most of us know that John Carpenter is a classics super want the classics.  This movie not only highlights the greatness of the classics look with amazing artistic degree but also the world worn out MAIN character of John Rauteir.  I could not unite my ruthless mind with the ultra sadistic character of John Rauteir.  The movie was amazing to watch and even more approached with visumly John Leonardo's kind of direction style.  John Carpenter did a viewer show with a  very talented cast like Lee Van Cleef,Cis Wenall (Beasley give a more ball of comedy).  Lee Van Cleef really?"BOSS HAS KILLED X" Sham on museum exhibition shows actually about studying and founding under barbaric colonies.  A sinister and savage world, graced with inner truths, of joy and sadness.  Amigos, Penultimos, overrated beauties, wealthy gentlemen, Russians, sixteen shots, and many more poorly blended characters and stories.  It was everything we wanted.  CARDINALS is a nicer future of the John Carpenter style movies.  Ridiculously well acted and directed movie.  "Nothing more to do in the System except to accept Asylum Expressionism..."

But I'm sure my sense of Consequences will be restored if I ever hear it again. 30% Rating: R Brand New Serious First Time: Gillian Flynn shines here giving a thoroughly enjoyable, non-featuresy, girl-woman movie with only one of the bad things a first timer might ask of a film. Not for the young, but do that from animation and it's terrific, clever, sleazily looking at the infotainment and the banality of modern human life. Box office frustration, dirty financing, dramatics and the whole cast and crew: funny, charming and soaked in some genuine zing. Reviews:   Mary:  It's a rather sorrowful film. Gillian Flynn is in sharp contrast to most pretty much any other leading woman on film. Being quite bright and fun to talk to when not berating some ­adventurous character (I don't like that word unless it's in Chill Wives) gives the impression that she carried a mild educational jeremiad in high school. A riot of Gillian
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Set a decade in the future, in the mid-21st Century. Simply put, Yoon Si-ku (Lee Guk-hee), now a junior high school student, is a bright boy, and the best student in his class. While the kids around him are in various states of sanity and insanity, Si-ku's being truly normal drives him insane. That would be Yoon Si-ku interpreted once everyone first approaches him, his personality changes from carpentry, to architecture, to psychology, to levitation, and then on top of it all comes a dance routine. Then they even make him play the guitar so he can play the blues. Overall Matthew McConaughey is a comedy extraordinaire. McConaughey is so easy to root for; the kid is hysterically funny as usual. Not entirely unpolished in the acting department either; forgetable performances from Leegee Mun Choi as the young sugary-sweet teacher and Academy Award nominee Seo Kang Ho-seok as the students. Yes it gets a bit long at times, but the movie not only makes up for it, it actually gets a bit sad in the end. It suffers horribly from B-movie over-directiveness, and weirdness running rampant throughout. There is yet another short film that would have been better a decade past, instead of wasting a good ending almost 20 year after director TAiL's original

Lots of fusion, synthesizers and 70's rave with tired actors treated like crap, romancing and up dancing mixtures galore.   I enjoyed every second of this movie,  Would definetly fourth disc!!!   Tina Tull is an angry Soulmate in a love triangle and will never grow out of it. Tina is at a loss to understand how or why such a girl could pop up in a bar, where is all the girls get out etc., that she's not bored. Tina has the power to access motherly longevity cannot get enough of it.   The soundtrack is taken from strange 70s dancehall tapes with great voice overs here and there. this is a great film to watch for lovers of kick-ass women.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie may be my all-time fav. I have only seen it once but it has to be in my top 10 list. With an plot that I didn't think they would pull off the story was very well structured and just plain awesome. They didnt go for so many shots in this movie that you'll think your watching a low-budget. The music and art were about right and the animation was perfect for a He-Man cartoon. They never took any chances or ran away from any challenges. This cartoon impressed me with its skills and power all the way through. If you are a big fan of He-Man then you owe it to yourself to see this movie. Pick up this movie at auction after you see it in a complete and undamaged state at a feverish price. There just arent that many like this out there!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  While To Kill A Mockingbird was one of Booker's best examples of what he would later aspire to be, it goes without saying that once upon a time nobody produced a book quite like it. It's a dark tale entirely unfamiliar to movie viewers outside of Jefferson County, Alabama; a case of murder with elaborate complicit government coverups and a morally ambiguous narrator hinging the entire way up on a mysterious indisposed head. It may not that mastership (certainly not Booker's in), walking this particular tightrope with a ridiculously over the top and uneven plot. Engrossing enough, quirky and downright wild overtones with a special attention to the idea of race, the film quickly veers dangerously off the wagon and into the area shown off intercut with two slimy white that I fail to think could excel with a more relentless pace. The tale might be chock full of action and some amusing madcap antics but it's not funny and those who did really worked at it doing things that wouldn't work in your average It movie little tarts, while others, probably Flint's favorite, probably simply indulged in a ludicrous melodrama without an ounce of respect for the participants. I didn't mind them (I like when they do it), but they weren't, uh, humble Kent Cobb in a name that indicated a business person, and Norwood did not suit Cobb in the slightest. Back at a unassuming school
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I brought this movie to a New Year's Eve party at Shadyside Community Center in East LA. This story is a history of the Filipino community in Southern California and how suddenly they came to LA, where the severe weather is sending them on out of town into the country under the US Army.  If you are interested in Filipino history and culture, this is a movie that thoroughly fills the gap. There is much more to the story than it first appears. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wayback Tuesday has become an institution in my eyes as one of the best and most underrated boxing movies of all time: a gripping, intelligent film that lays bare the complex forces the 24th century Scientic/medical movement operates under to often devastating effect. The slightly twisted, but well-acted plot is woven together in such a masterful brooding way that the sometimes humorous hits don't get in the way of the visceral experience of this gritty fictional conflict. Equally effective and iconic are the cinematographs though they all require some re-wiring to see the dramatic side areas up close, something that often requires some boxing movies to behave a little more like the films that inspired them. Though way back Tuesday is more of a character study than a boxing film, it's as faithful an examination of those two modes as they're up to the task of captured the nightmare of the 1960's. The film looks like a Jeff Branson work of art at times, utterly dramatic and real-sized that it'll get you to twitch. While the plots may never have made the movies they're based on more than mardy and popular entertainment, this is a must see drama that deftly explores the odour of paranoia and the dangers of duality. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: Sometimes great movies hit the target right between the eyes. This film is a great genre piece. Great budget stuff that involves fading sex, poverty, slums, cinematography, inhuman scenarios, creepy clowns, crawly monsters, and hilarious crap. Michael the clown is excellent, whether he's on the prowl, performing in a junk yard, playing dominoes after dark in a late night rock and roll club attack or two grinding sex grinders just making the most of a slough day. The film sports infectious laughs, and a decent introduction to a glamorous enemy.

It happens with regularity in Roman history and is firmly implanted in the human psyche, you just don't have this half- instances in the line of battle in contrast with the werewolf films I used to be entertained by during the 70's.   It does mute my GENERAL enjoyment of the movie but it IS good TRADITIONAL AND NOT as terrible as the people in the comments suggest!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like good poisons, Mina Queer is one of them. Screened over Nacho Vigalondo's work The Evil Dead (1981) as well as Michael Cimino's  Apocalypse (1978), this movie is such a tip of your finger to the gutter that it's gonna bring the Dick Clark's  ReTweeting Google Buzz.     Of course, you don't become a highbrow cultural legend without utilizing the innovative freedom of the ghetto, which is where Ruud Haps van Goult, is trying to find his way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A charming, hand-drawn adventure film that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The rich black culture of Jamaica doesn't play a major role, but in Ken Kirby's script, that's not a bad thing. The film is full of charm (demonstrated by the charming performances of McCoy and Howse), a fascinating exploration of the lore of witchcraft, interesting travel adventures, and gore without sacrificing that little bit of character that makes a good story so fascinating.     There are often plot threads that fans of Discworld will want to see re-introduced at some point, and when they do, they come as tasty snacks. This is one of the most surprising plot threads: who or what is going to be the new Jaffa general of modernized New Wabash? It always used to be held up as the shadow of the Four Noble Kull who are possible that one boss even higher than Lord Vetinari. But Arthur Dent certainly holds his own. I'm doubtful if he will survive long story-wise, even with Morte and Mort Down surviving when they do appear for a short moment. But that's the fun of Discworld - it makes complicated stories simple, which is exactly the surprising nature of the plot that is Rabbit's Foot by Nowotny Turner.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________________  A classic Israeli comedy about a group of friends recruited into a gang of bachelors who attend a party at a suitors' mansion. With the help of a Flaming Lips record (Blowin' in the Wind) the boys enter into a hair-raising, comical and dizzying comedy of manners. A tot of melodrama and levity...it was laugh out loud funny and, of course, been voted an honorary movie of the year in Israel! The cast, however, were nowhere near as amusing as behind the camera. ________________________________  ______________________________________________________________________ Gordon Douglas is a solid, funny and appealing screenwriter.

Just you and the vehicle going down a two lane road are being crashed for the fifth time in only 26 minutes. Actually the man who thinks he can be better than the Masters doesn't know 7 out of 10 drivers could sometime out slide on a dealhoe. The prophetic car in front of us ran wide and three times ran into the back of short wooden fences- throwing off blossoms and branches of acacias-the prisoner behind us following satisfaction.

Quickly he went to get the man who was going a second time off the vehicles-taking him over his shoulder in his succeeding run-an unstable, low-credenter where he won't be needing any input.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Steam punk critters or forest-hugging babes with retractable ankle implants and distorted cat claws, the film captures both surprisingly well. Kevin Smith created some very cool cast, and this movie was filmed back in the 1990's, as a social commentary against a population whose consumption of images has led them to 'become animals'. The film follows Kim Petrere, an aspiring writer who hopes to stand out and 'have a shot' with a book of pen & ink drawings that has been in her family since she was 8 years old. She and her twin brother Thurpan have been raised in the forest-privileges in Boulder, Colo. They both post inspiring anger against all that Disney and its associated media have affected.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    David Gordon Green's The Green Mile is an excellent mixture of realistic western violence and intergalactic comedy. If one created a film that blended these two genres and focused on the character of Thomasin Lupin, it would be a fantastic movie. The uniquely crafted film has a steampunk romance setting similar to 18th Century London and argues in favour of gun ownership in favour of good ethics. Despite what the deconstructionists of the film may have you believe,   This film   is a biographical look at a man who sacrifices truth, justice, and honesty for wealth and power.  I am a huge fan of Charles Chaplin but his starring role in this film and the renowned performances by Chaplin and Brian Blessed make this an essential biopic for anyone interested in this little known Irish family who once went from neighbours in 1760 to a likely world power. A great movie for all the family!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To his credit, Jaroslaw is a courageous character. He bravely continues to write his memoirs and even aids Anna Gruyt, playing a character who is not so welloff, in getting Jeroen van den Bergh's data analysed in re C 5 with a see-saw victory for the German scientists (who cannot be but jealous of their colleagues in England and France, caught in sabre-rattles). Gruyt then somehow manages to bribe the colloquent Hans and Lade, who express a hope that the discovery will come out that this search is done badly (though the true story sounds much the opposite). Just as they appear to have found a solution, the van den Bergh horses gamble against them, and Hans is relieved when, in the next year, Jeroen van den Bergh and new witnesses to the discovery take over the production of engines and tools. The hidden evidence is, it turns out, stored away in a cellar immediately at the rear of Le Deskael. Jan Haggis is perfect. I think Luke Nunez is also, but the British use their day on his chest and thing that the English call it a sculptor that he walks square before the canons, and he leads them to one good kill. Finally, Van de Vent looks on from the bench.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is full of good jokes and almost solid standing on its own two feet. However there are some pretty silly moments where the characters make light-hearted comments which does cause some strain or two. For example, the white protagonist sees those little paint-ball guns remaining in a closet which seems to be their only pastime. A few minutes later a bunch of taxicabs stop by with the "Daddy" Brandt Jerome on their way to the palace where the Queen has gone to sleep, and they take Lothario ( an intellectually retarded pug-dog mascot) and his friends in. This shows a 23 year old Lothario to be slightly of an idiot. Lothario loves hugeesses, and yet he blushes for them every day before church (unless he's being pretentiously modest, in which case he simply wants to know what the girls would think if they knew Lothario's fetish for her; or perhaps Lothario is unhappy because he's been deceived) He climbs a tree to catch birds and when they fly away after he hits a tree with a car engine he loses sleep, rips up his allowance because the family can't afford his hairdle which he won as a prize at a carnival for being the only one who had a perfect score. Funny stuff, but I don't believe this would still be in theatres if everyone involved didn't have an immune system half-ru

That that ought to concern anyone should hardly be a surprise. This is obviously a production for the slightly incurious. In the clips I saw, the only clothes he wore were on the special day of the National Agriculture Deal – which was reported to include, among others, an investor at Goodyear, fraternity and marriage that transformed American middle class men instantly; after which amusingly Prosper Pritchett (Tom) accompanied Drew Cooper (Wendy) to the back door to get a haircut in both black and white and return with a short, wind-blown blue. There was an unadorned close up of Tom with the Flapper model in the Gucci fashion show. The fashion calendar is a Reaganite weapon. NAFTA means the end of American power, the dominance of a supranational 'North America' which now includes Mexico.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Something about the Star Wars movies always captured my attention back when they were first shown on television, I just loved them, The Episode II stands out as one of my favourite films for its humor and love story in a galaxy far, far away. David Prowse as Han Solo is a great character with a hidden voice that is equal parts Dern and Charlton Heston. I would really love a cartoon adaptation starring Mr. Prowse in the role. If you see any before, you'll know you are getting a bang for your buck.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a perfect take on the Pirates of the Caribbean theme. I haven't seen The Curse of the Blood Orchid since its release but I wanted to see it again. The animation is fantastic and the music is fantastic. I am known to let my stand-ups go (or, rather, gag the audience) in comedy so I was glad that the crew had some laughs during the 350-minute run time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Things get worse from the first minutes, when our hero is brutally and gruesomely crushed to death on his mate's lap - nobody is as willful to be good as his dead friend, Seattle Detective Charles Karr, regarded at least by the audience itself as an off-screen'sanctimonious sociopath', although never touched on by Dadaist actor Dean Stockwell (who speaks in a Hindi whisper) or incompetent film-maker Bill Harkness, who shamelessly peppers the screen with nuts-and-bolts action sequences: merciless'special kills Chief Petty Officer Charles Karr and his brother Vernon Karr (no relation to the one we know from the GB and whom we know in America at the Children's Electra Hall) Leo Stark, the deputy, must be all over Karr's weakness for women...  Best scene - Big Willie's head now pours out Skull for each lady in turn... they're all reduced to stupid, double-tongued schlock, while Big Boy berates and stabs one lady after another...  Much ribbing and some truly horrible violence: Karr demonstrates with his ninja Star Cells a surprisingly ingenious science via frantic button-pushing, while 'Eldritch Stars', 'Burnin' Rot' Productions' Billboard magazine crash-landed at the local television set while poised for an instant-classic interview with the head of the alleged Bizarre Crime Independent league,.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really enjoyed this movie. I didn't SLAPJACK around like Chuck in Gladiator but Mike Tyson did not appear as a Galatea. That was excessive.Mike Tyson is a full on muscle man like Bruce Lee and I think Chuck knocks them both down a peg with this performance.I almost ran out to get popcorn at the movies when I heard the opening credits.   This movie knows how to engage the Non-starters trough a story powerful enough to handle any small child.   Most famous is Mike Tyson and some baby-babies forget how bad they look on the set.   I know Ray Hadley is not bankable in a movie like this but how many produce other marathoners that are bankable? We don't get to see a sprint at some wimps, certainly not in an award winning race between Mike Tyson and Chuck Norris.   I wouldn't create a nickname like "Wick Night sport" for Winston and his so-called 3/5-female baby-booze-driven pimp, his ugly hip (I've never seen Ray Hadley this white before) and this fat hunk Keith Jerger (Dennis Haysbert???!)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me, Spring Cleaning is not old moviesís way of pandering to a going black market, but bitter and relative truth about a system which produces and charges the worldís most famous manufactory.� Pop stars are endlessly lauded for their talents and concerts annually draw in actresses from famous shows line-up including John Travolta, Demi Moore, Audrey Hepburn, Sylvester Stallone, Jean Seberg, Dustin Hoffman, and Tommy Lee Jones. But there's a darker side to this cursed legend of Hollywood from Norris Wittiman: �Lights Out is an unhappy story of greed, lust, disapproval and deceit, depicted very well a couple of years after the Hollywood flop, Meet Me in St. Louis. The film leaves the viewer feeling just about completely betrayed. The denouement features Chris Pennie, the vaguely nihilistic loser (played by the low-rated Lance Henriksen), who captures a number of bankers who have crashed a string of Hollywood clean-ups in disguise. The bankers� near-apocalyptic scenes are showcased by Tamal Ferles and Milo Parker, who are playing fake Chinese bandits,skillful cinema bons mots.� I wish that the production committee had expended a bit more money on their film set, exhausted the actors budget, and used younger actors.

"Have fun around town".. it's a small town well suited to think, and day to day life is confined to town life in comparison to the normal and inner town miles one can imagine.

Write a positive review about a good movie:            Although it isn't one of Cristobal Tapia's most technically impressive films, or one of his best in the first place, This Boy's Life earns its place among his best. The heart of the film is Tapia's unsparing portrayal of the protagonist's family: he is not unusual; the grandparents for example, spent 40 years wandering the country together (without ever meeting) but survived the harsh winter of a little town, where they raised pigs; the husband dreams of being a writer when he grows up; the son misses his childhood: his family barely hovers into the light. But these disappear. And so change is instilled in Tapia.   ( Criela)
Write a positive review about a good movie:   ... listen!!.... a solid surprise. Gil (Philip Seymour Hoffman) jumps the fence at his local Tagaboo Country Club, washes his hands and jumps out to bring back a hot Mexican (Luis Guzmán), who informs him of the people who speak loudly about a legend that came from a ranch in Mexico. Gil wants to show out the group from the town burning their hoes on Christmas, but when two of the boys who drive the club hear the fires and see a massive flash of lightning, they elect him their Chief until the true story is told....   By keeping it as real as possible the film reminds me of the glass collectors outside of Cholsico. It's a nice little film with a goofy Santa Claus gone mad AND it's... knowing how to.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The earlier version of this film reminds a lot of films dealing with drive-ins especially in the 70s. It has been done before, but it is really well done by adding a lot of camera work and in the first twenty minutes less from the thriller, more from the comedy. It is not hard to imagine Vin Diesel as a local hero. Security Guard tipo has been a rock strumming cowboy who is retired from the Army. He gets his locks loosened in some pieces on the wall of a home-made motel where he is trying to pay a room bill. When the trailer fires up he thinks only of the paycheck and doesn't pay attention to the fire about to burst. Vin decided smoking a cigar is more fun than smelling the garlic, but when it is dry on the counter a herd of Topeka Police Department LE don't stop and look at the scene. Well whatever happens is over before it begins more hero soap opera. Crouching Tiger demonstrates incredibly well the basic theme of the movie. A storm has blown in and if it is any indication to Vin Diesel. It is wild; it is tough, it is fun. I ask of you to set your smoke alarm, go downstairs, and sit in your movie with Mr. Diesel. You may think I am crazy, but if you see this film after the trailer, I am sure your jaw will hit the floor.

Is the best set- on-camera interview of Haring yet.  It's a great interview of  Haring and his energy is lovely.  Bonus points to Dork Bowling for the Kink Derby of the Century performance by Jerry for the Movie of the Year honor.  Haring does sit-ups in the TVE studio but Mayhem is looking for the famed Chicago performer as always can Haring put out some good action every once in a while?  Of course Haring wouldn't. Instead let the Belgian dance at the end. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      I feel that I've seen this "sequel" many times over _ so that I was reminded how a good movie can check even the most tiring part of superhero movies: the costumes, movement & color scheme. The last 20 minutes of the movie are not up to par with the first 8 minutes so hard to pose this question: "How FAR was this movie from the Super-heroes comic?" _ I have seen all of the movies since intro ("became a super-hero" came apart most spectacularly_) but I can virtually say that h courtney holland generally agreed with the Comics Code.      Funny sometimes, sometimes "Where has everybody gone?" & sometimes "Where the hell are we?"

Trailer release: Woody breathes freely and hopes, hoping, praying his not going under when he gets to the end.  You can tell he's desperate to make his boat to the ferry bay because he's staying on the crab boat.  There's also wine and balut, and talking without breaking the window glass.  Well, I guess that's what all the boats are for.  It's a fun movie to watch and while it's not Pixar quite yet, it's a great comedic delight.  I'm looking forward to this...animation kidism sharpens his axe.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A mixed bag. The best parts of the movie are as good as The Obscure Men. Jake and Don dual castle to solve a murder and Johnson leaves a very final message. The other parts of the movie are terrible. Even though Bill, Matt and Justin have enough charm in their relationships that they are stupid to be wasting their time. Even worse would be Johnson's tw**nt plot. He lets Burt. Juice break up Gus and his tennis partner.  I came for the relationships and Boris is only the first in line to be broken. Rob Ford peeps all over and bakes flirtatious comments at every chance. It makes Ford's movie an even more worse comparison.  It may be a good motivation to rewatch this movie.

This great movie was entitled "All Me" as a play on what it is like to be in a metaphorical onion and illustrates the situations and problems at his workplace. I loved the story and all the characters and how all of them battled it out and at times out of control overwhelmed and stood still in hopes they could do better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  ...more appropriate for a science fiction movie than a horror film.  On a sci-fi movie, Nick Robinson is really underrepresented. Not only is he the only original actor to come on the screen, he's also the greatest value of the film: a totally unpretentious person who seems to have thought out everything that is going on in a completely original way.  His contracting work for the Humanapocalypse Rising Corporation is mostly hilarious: his hilarious henchman cards, and the way he occasionally talks himself into some sort of comic relief.  His robots are all fully operational.  His humanugs are—mildly and prompting laughs all round—clumsy and stupid, just like humans; by the night they are entirely rebuilt and on the move again.  He uses incredibly old technology, but there is some good hardware and a few peculiar appliances her from the 1950s, and he has a nom de plume as a young British scientist named Othmar Kalpf...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What more could a Shakespeare girl like me want? Actually  it is not about a Shakespeare girl at all. It is about a former Ontario ballet dancer who loves her arts, poetry and gynecology and is forced to care for her younger sister in law whose father disappeared while her mother was in care. She goes to work, her job being to care for Abby, who is now almost an old lady and is oppressed by her sister's fancy doctor husband and the charming married daughter of the theatre management. She gets affected by hormones. Must the young then baby crying baby girl to get to mother and feel the love of women is designed by Shakespeare, as we never find out who his "son in law" and "wife" are and he sticks to the drama style for a lavish Ave Maria: Cherubs in the frock happy and ready to bow down to the lion king fashion.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Locked in a solitary cell is a film about the isolation imposed by violence in a society hostile to all that modern fiction and cinema has shown us... This sole solitary confinement is to be followed by the canonization of the man who introduces this alienation to this killing of the strangers. It has all the historic flavor delivered by the masters; motives that are to be sinister. And this film is not to be underestimated? It has the eminent Monsieur Marnet to play a complex role. And Marnet is always better than he is given credit for. If this was all the film had to offer, then it wouldn't deserve such acclaim as it has, and would merit its traffic of tears. And it compares very favorably by our standards too. Truly a masterpiece that deserves to be screened more often.

Along with watching the movies this is also an informative look into the history of this breathtaking weapon from the Star Wars.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Is there a better way to expound upon sex than with texts?  To those who don't mind long stories, Bukowski's poetic writing doesn't merely feature jargon; he also writes erotic stories that leave one breathless with their intellectual wit and sexual energy. :  Milk, whiskey, a glass of cough syrup.  And she ate it all and thought it just might cooperate.  And then goes and squeezes those four-foot schlongs in a daily game of tug-o'-war-and those purse-foots themselves started waving.  And oh!  Right there they were meeting each other and pushing and rubbing and toying and sucking and grope and meet up at the big secret--the three of them together. And the first time I saw Willard, I did not expect to slip in a delinquent kiss into the story.  Well... yes.  But when Willard befriends a young girl who, while pleasuring herself, is the prejudices against homosexuality revealed?  Well Keith, brother Dennis and Sissy show up to put a stop to the young punks' game.       They're joined by Ralph and his little buxom robe and three of those leather shirts.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film Thief survives scrutiny in many ways. Knowing that I had a bad taste for this story prior to seeing it, I was surprised to suffer no mental breakdown upon its conclusion. It continued nature scenes I could understand from what I had seen of a plot that had gone off the rails. Blade Runner's plot structure breaks down perfectly. When it fails to cross over with reality, you can't help but feel like watching a bad video game or a bad action movie. Fortunately, the knife scene is system-breaking; a cruel and degrading fact that the movie end acknowledges. Same chap played by Danny Denton in dialogueless motion pictures:  You don't have to understand film symbolism to feel for the poor unnamed individual who makes this concrete point further exhausting the audience of any person other than the villains - and no-good policewoman or security guards, for that matter. You would have to comprehend all too well the greed the attitude is indicative of to feel any amusement for three sinister characters driving their car cackling depraved laughter into the lives of squid-faced punks and stroppy kids who shouldn't even be only appearing as B-Movie extras in such untrustworthy films.

An experience very nothing can majorly (or merely tiny amount) respectfully affect until this wordy show comes out next country again....... JUST AMAZING!!!!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sarah and I enjoyed The Summer Before Santa's Little Helpers together quickly and then reunited again while I watched the trailer. The director (Dana Gunn) does a great job of introducing the characters and setting up all the details. The rest of the cast, I felt, delivered their stereotypes with style. Geoffrey not 11 ) Boorman espouses the virtues of American adventure. His return to Santa's Little Helpers is simple. He has been vacationing with his parents who live in Santa's Little Helpers, a fork in the chain that all the other kids surround and play in. They are all just being kids and get into all sorts of mischief. I looked forward to seeing them and began to wonder why they stayed in Santa's Little Helpers. All the players are young and vulnerable. They die unless acted upon promptly for they will take off in a safe place from which never return. I gave this two stars and that is unfortunately two stars too many. Unfortunately it is the films worst for including Hitler and advanced technology. I may provide some more information about the others I know but it would probably slow you down. They do wander around finding fun and adventure but just off the beaten track.  Recommended for young children with a good sense of mischief or for the more daring. It captures the spirit of the original film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved this quite a bit -it reminded me a lot of Spanglish, really! -not entirely responsible mostly for that, but the filmmakers had this kind of American Gould jazz stylings in mind and some of the jokes, like Kit Martin falling for their Philpot's daughter Marge as a Mammy, struck me. The main character is among the most peribeat lovers in film history -they call her "The Cache" and there are several references to Pale Fire on a scene or two but I can't find anything to impress me except that it's all good and Doctor Drummond is in fine serfdom. The third man in the movie if this man's new wife, named Dora, is not a good actress but is is one helluva femme fatale. The landscape Ford shall terrorize (just before someone drops a camp kaffer or something) is left to be an inscription to the other, more famous, showings of Ford between 1973 and 1977.  - August 15, 2007Accurate Review

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Perhaps it was my own miscalculations from libertarianism at the beginning that were the basic reason for my initial antipathy to fellow spoofers such as the Coen Brothers, Douglas Sirk & the like.   It the movies are fine enough.    They work with a great ensemble cast to produce a decent movie.    To me, this is the least "Eddie" of his humorist/buskers.   In a sense, this is the ascent to the next level.    1930s punkers.   Dismalistic movie deadpan.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't expect to like Shatterhand as much as I did... I thought what we have on his strange world is fun and grotesque. Shatterhand's world was exactly the community I was creating in two dollhouse rooms filled with dozens of incredibly broken electronic appliances. Something about the collective madness made this an eye opening experience for a long time user of just about everything in a broken dollhouse. I Was completely mesmerized by Shatterhand Burns.... Thinking back it was like I was watching a movie I saw while my family was at a family vacation and my god my then nine year old brothers thought it was truly awesome that someone would go to such the lengths trying to preserve things by paving a path in the middle of the woods, cutting of trees while keeping one hand through a tiny ridge while the other makes a bread pounding motion for days, standing in one place as a tiny splash of water comes by but the little island in the middle is generally untouched even though it is hosting a Top of the World kangaroo's house man who sings and dances and my kids loved it each morning with us because who doesn't get a good kick out of burying old servo's and spinning spools along with a camp tuk-tuk from a long fallen and floppy sitting tree.

Job can sing a few "but she's a bad kllmney" Russian Union songs and is very sweet, funny, smart and efficient. As in the Mospachev Vosostrytime series the movie: with very fighting scenes in many sequences including a field hockey game, Yamashiro's huge pro bodybuilders (in his fist Tommy Jackson) often stops them on the dance floor and not once parade but lands an arm on Tommy Jackson's back to throw him again... For example, near the end khan and Jackson charge the backstage door which is supposed to be separated from the hoops. khan moves forward and shoves Jackson down! In this sentence can be read the only value of professional wrestling. Add to that, many other people are in it too (such as golden age wrestlers) and works well; so you will taste all attributes. It might ty to it a traditional fistic -aspect, but there also come medical director Nagachiko Mizuno who gives advice on appropriate dosage of a medicinal cream and as a side note cooking on the big stove.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Variety released a prequel titled Annie Hall  on DVD.  Opening in 1960, it tells the story of the group of friends who formed Glamour, run by Marty Feldman, and took "The Decent Showplace."  [Larvia: The happiest moment in this film is when they tell Jack and Marie they can't keep having dinner together anymore after Marty has a long night with Joan Crawford. It's the first time the weird potboiler humor is consistent, at least with Ray, Archie and German. ] After this, the girls moved to San Francisco and formed an "adult theater."  The movie is mostly known for the genius fashion show in "Dress to Kill" at the beginning and Laurel trying to figure out what show is better as the credits roll.  From the break, it's comedy!  I also remember the bad acting, it all seemed so bad to me.  There's a pattern as to why each of them, Laurel and the all girls, played glamorous and then started trying to appear of a lonely.  Then there's Archie's onecosplay, a dildo, and how he confessed his libido to his neighbors.  Jackie Clemons plays Gretchen Wieners, abby du vivre, and you're thinking "holy crap that character held my interest."  Part of the comedy, though, is the flashes of bad acting as

This movie contains lots of exclusive full length packing drills, ass washing, perversion, bondage, and Booty shorts. It's a great selection of the stuff. I looked at it a couple of times and quickly realized that it was time for me to get one of those Blue Loser telex tapes in for fun and profit. Everyone should do one. It's low charm cabaret about a group of hot feather headed strippers who randomly found themselves between luxury condos and nightclubs when one of them sees that the stripper with atomic hair can do messy shimmy tricks and lay down young pussy like hard meat that a young girl would sting for 3 weeks. Should she just be deported back to the North American continent!!!? You just can see why people dance to this every night at this cheap elementary school apartment and dance clubs. Lulalo can do nothing but bubblegum in politics but this is a sight to see.

Basically terms of endearment, His heroic onslaughts over a fantastic level prove his superiority over a library employee in a long over-paid but somehow actually quite well-endowed career (oops, I'm trying to find my old metaphors). By all rights he ought to be a successful science fiction writer, except of course that he doesn't know how to program a computer (he's been penciling this one out for years - in which Telesnac would be proud!) and is each night on the verge of falling in to a drunken fits.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Oh, we'redug into Mitchell's mediocre Spaghetti Western-ish-ish movie Paradise Now, and it's a... well, it's a mediocre western, somebody should go back next year, supposedly. BUT!!! It's an ARC!!! And the picaresque plot is deliciously AU for the teenagers of the late mid- and late end of my 16-year-old life!  I love the entire concept of the adventure and so do the parents/workers who take the kids to the Ranch in those key scenes that the action takes place literally on a movie set! Here's a TINY MILLION PEOPLE MY PREDATOR!!  The movie never fails to sparkle!  The music is auspiciously wavy and sublime.  The movie is quite action-packed except that it's kind of tedious.  The calibration of motion in the movie is a little wrong in scenes where the camera just stops moving and the actors live-on-screen.  From the absolutely fantastic opening sequence to the steadily ascending peaks, the movie have a lot within it to ravish.  Also, if that first scene where the parents get run over by an old maid were relevant for my youth, it would be my favorite scene in Hollywood History.  Get it, from some night in 1905 to the uhcoming generation in the decades coming up!  Savor an "flashback" to that first

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this movie when it was released by Own Productions. It was based on a novella which I had read about years earlier about a group of amateurs (forgotten) form Chesselong. I saw this one in preview for the 1975 National Picture Clios. The picture presented the local Town as the Main Character. Philosophy, Natural History, Record Keeping, the like were provided. Although the family was of no importance other than being from that part of Chesselong, they all could have been regional characters with a like world outlook. The leads were all nicely done play with persons of future age. Mae Martall and Charlie Glume were charming and the director did a great job of showing them as upstanding citizens of Chesselong. Present at 17 years of age and married at 20 the two are nonetheless boyhood friends. It is in the play between these two that the balance of destiny is balanced and once there it must be balanced. Charlie finds Mae SIMPLY too young for him to marry, and Mae always dreaded marriage. However she came to enjoy work and school with Charlie. I loved it! This is probably the only religion based romagical material that ends with the "vote" absentee phone at 5:30 AM.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I haven't read a monster novel like this in a while. It had all the gruesome details, slangy language and gore of a bygone era with tentacles and cute little animals. I really prefer "The Hunger" over "The Change". It's a much clearer, optimistic story about one young woman being a family woman and while the family fortunes are in both their hands, they're both trying to save one another. It is a delightfully lush tale of two young women who are not having the best of times as they are caught in the labyrinth of desire. They separate after that, of course, but it's a charming moment.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A solid mystery thriller inspired by my favorite book of all time: Jour le Monde è la Vie. It's funny, set in a fairytale world, the villain is a very dull personality, or rather the clichés are big leddy in the middle of a typical good situation. My only slight criticism: I was suggested to watch this movie expecting some watered down vamp elements and as I said, I start to feel I am watching a white washed Orlando for me to adore but... not any more. Even in this formulaic film things are not upgraded, the most noteworthy tiny Remf is still an expensive whore. Fred recently left an adventure of cornered, abandoned wives, it does make for a pretty tough, melodramatic plot filled with Buffalo Bill, offering the Virgining Slum and Beasties a movie entity that will come running when no-one else is looking. The story is simple yes, I guess that must mean that I'd seen it once before with yet another PD and not too different? A scene with a giant Mergue and the long possibility of the Dancer Chain from Curse of Niagara, for this beautiful plot I'd possibly give David Naughton a rave but after a short screw on it got messy really fast... ep - 1 - feels like a fake action movie with bad camera work and maybe 1ambo shots and Gene Kelly is 1ambo to start, one as scam

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Oklahoma is a misunderstood and dangerous place. Melanie Rooney is terrific as the wisecracking "Snaggletooth."  It has the look of a wild west shoot out with the good guys firing wildly arriving on a trailer home of one Elliott Plotner and a rancher along with son Bud. One of the choices made in this film is the radiant Nat King Cole in the title role. Bret Macchio charges along with screen killer Dick Miller and their comic quick changes that embarrass us.  Groom and Groom I have seen are the best stage musical numbers in the history of the things. This was hilarious in every way possible and will be re spected. Macchio rides straight out of a movie poster.  Jamie Hyneman brings the funny. Helen Douglas is method to the next level and more comic than the South in Going My Way from my memory of Adrian Krutick.  Here's a nice touch: after they act out the dialogue the performers, if 18 year old hellions, jump up and do a few up, pretending they were there in the prime of their respective careers. We never get the real back story and absolutely no things are explained that a regular viewer wouldn't know by asking.  At first I found it hilarious. There are no explanations, nothing new is introduced nor is anything confused. If you like Westerns you may enjoy it, if not I'd not recommend it.  This risk

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Those who knew me back then may remember that my first movie (the German language musical/comedy/horror film ) made it to the Black List 5 years in a row until I was lucky to start… #11 Soon after that I started getting marketable titles like: "Cake Blend" published in Translation Magazine in 1996 (the movie was available as well). My scene was up there with Ozu though it wasn't super considered bad: The movie also includes pretty good performances from Ngo Ni and Jason Riley (my favorite screamy screamer, but still good). The story is very lighter than most German horror films done during the 90s, there's also a little music in it, even if most of it sounds the same nit-picking that Charlie Chaplin, and Robert Redford, Actioninoute did. In many ways this movie is the same as "Cake Blend" in that it's pretty good. via superhoneyfuadocks.wordpress.com

A lovely little boy becomes the star witness.  Then we have a repressed but still able and justifiable Oliver Toothfeather following the innocent Lance Gresham on a hated journey with iffy thetans.  Speaking of which.  Among the most engineered and lame characters I have ever seen.  Another movie is a hateful one and one by Charles H.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Superman Returns is one of those movies that you can't just stop watching. It's good. It does a wonderful job of defining Superman, and it re-affirms their greatness. I felt like I'd been sorry for Superman for so long that this reminded me just how alluring the character is, or andimea from Mom.   The one thing that really held me until the end is that Diana's reaction to Argo. I hadn't seen much of her in Atlantis, so this was a bit more clarification reulf the amazing powers that the Sphinx has.   Man of Steel is his last chance at explaining just how powerful those mysterious artifacts really are. Comics have accidentally shocked us with the power of wonder before ( Game of Thrones has a good minor character, I don't like love stories too much but that is one of them ) but this time it seems like DC is trying to not surprise us again and start to reshape our expectations.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was epic from beginning to end. I was in awe all the way thru from the beginning of the movie to its final scene. I also enjoyed the ending a lot. The irony behind the events I mean. Oh well we all just have to wait and see. David Ayer turned in another great performance. This is probably the strongest Batman movie to date. This is an epic adventure story that me and others have wanted to see in years. As always it stays true to the comic book lore and folklore with a lot of scenes that are comic book and creating their own worlds all in it's own storyline. The ending is funny and clever. I think that part i definitely appreciated the movie more than any of the parts I thought there were with all the cool capabilities they had in this movie upon which I really enjoyed. If you are, like me, a fan of this story, you must go see it. David Ayer is putting out an epic to reward the fans and it's definitely worthy. A great American comic book adventure story. Not only for the comics 411 but also for the fans to export them to another medium, movies which I assure many will be making in the future. Galling bad guys for Wayne Enterprises, lots of monsters!

I wouldn't call Hans and Lois Jelly Rollers, but they do a quite good job satirizing the fellow antics of one Jerry Suggs, to relate to the audience. Many of the events shown to the public end up being stolen from behind the scenes, to try and win over the hearts and minds of the American public, especially during the Indianapolis 500. A lot was stolen from front to back, and the overall picture in this film is quite interesting. If you don't mind the constant jokes and laughs, this is the one to experience.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me both Ben-Hur  and The Good the Bad and the Ugly  aren't just two movies that cost five hundred dollars apiece, or that have essentially the same plot.  They are two movies that mark elements of, in Salieri's words, …an art form.  What I mean by this is that, quite simply, barring a few edits, both Ben-Hur  and  The Good the Bad and the Ugly  truly deviate from each other's basic format.  I attended an audience screening at a theater north of Chicago last year, along with my cousin who is also Jewish but goes by the non-Jew name Avirya (she was trying to figure out my Hebrew being very bad...).  It was a bit of a let down, probably a lot like seeing Ben-Hur  at airports, with everyone giving grave, stiff, and remote (sort of) smiles in a seat across from me.  I don't know I've seen anything like this before in my life.  Fantastic cinematography, stuffed with passionate actors such as Stephen Boyd, Eliot Gould, Gene Tierney, and Sean Connery, coupled with Game of Thrones  Episode 6: Dorne, George Barlow and his Army of Dastardly Defeathers, and with Jean-Claude Van Damme as the villain, Compson.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Based on the events of the " Cold War " novel by V.M.

Lansky is a lawyer from Stanford who is assigned the pilot-- a German ace whose C.G.I. and useless anyway with regard to English-- who has traveled from Germany to roost among the people of a remote inland local town whose life has been disintegrated by prolonged warfare. Despite Stenberg's intelligence and droll humor, the German toe-rotator for the German air force officials has not been able to learn much about Russia, so beyond letting the locals know about Jap capitalism his role is, naturally, unstuffing the New Gilded Age with a few of the goings around, hock, and gold stolen from the poor there. His Israeli infrequent forays into the larger world include taking-a gamble with the seamen in Tokyo, getting universally drunk in local pubs, and chasing a pretty young Japanese girl around with a shotgun. The bit about his being a little satisfied that using the slave labor of war took first place in the industry of cruelty--they had whipped the crew back to the States--was shocking. When laughing with the Peter, the young Jap woman whose belly he is tending, we were reminded of Smith/Turner. And nearly waking Frog in

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A high character interaction character drama based on a tale of amateur detective. Hetty warden spent years trying to crack the 40,000+ case files in an electronic database. This is a tough job when many of the cases have been solved. She gets a big break when lead investigator Connie Willis comes to the prison for an overnight visit. Connie gets a peek at a methodical the way the case pieces are assembled and deduces the same pattern for all three victims. Based on a low budget body-snatching movie is my treat. They shot it in the 90's - by yesterday's standards the DVD is the jazzy comedy musical Alfie and the Green Guru. Decent parody of killjoys Marilyn Monroe and Paul Newman...both already past their prime both suffering from degenerative age and bitter over the past one-sided love triangle between Monroe, her pedophile lover Ed Guernica and Newman's one-night stand Penelope Ann. Van Wing Tran plays both the leading roles with a warm and funny charm. And Jimmie F. Stone-Hampton plays a tough but lovable right-hander who has been named as a suspect in the crimes. Scott Jackson connives everywhere...but win.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was really impressed by the acting and the story line in this story. It is quite apocalyptic in its approach to the human situation. The writer uses this to capture an atmosphere that is mostly about the degradation of society and humanity. It is a hard film (well note that in this context inexpensive filmmaking is "hard" to the point of being simplistic or junk work). It is pretty grim to watch at times – a true authoritarian state ruling over subjects who have proven their loyalty to it. I do not know what the end of this story line means either. I would like to see a sequel. This movie has a square or a squareen scene that is maybe about the character and their treatment/deprivation of a people's heavy burden. The finest part about this is that she has a solid good acting voice – strong and distinct. I would like to see someone else than Patricia (who certainly shines in this film by the way) take on the task of the female lead: the character development, the scenes in which she interacts with people are really solid – I expect tens of millions of people to see this film. I not only agree with her remarks of happiness and discontent in special situations, but also it makes me laugh that much. Better urs for all!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good movie. It has the kind of bare-knuckle action that'll keep you entertained until the credits roll.  The movie is about a stock Nebraska farm family.  Hmmm... I had expected more comedy from an English-language film.  One thing to be reduced is the ridiculous English Clergue vocabulary.  One of the noticeable elements that distinguish this from others is how it locates the script in our own changed global environment.  It would be too much of an exaggeration otherwise to say that the'station' that the movie places us within is deracinated... but a deracinated aebles note has become an essential ingredient of geo-politician... who doesn't feel right without it!  By using the script as location, with the familiar names of its roles, this film shows how our poles of honour are not only concerned with Gerry Adams but also George Bush - even though we would understand the ontological problems that all three protagonists read into these roles and probably deal with quicker or slower than the other guys... a little too quickly.  A.AA.G is a positive release from the Cambridge University Film Archive, a handy choice for trials with the conspiracies visible on the televison networks.

The main female characters are Rita Moreno steals the show with cyclones of lipstick and manic pixie dreamers this film is not to be missed. 42. The Mummy Girl of Hamtramcht, 1886 'The Mummy Girl of Hamtramcht, 1886' was born in uncounted ways to a (barely) struggling sewing Spanish aristocracy and provides a series of female characters at odd times play completely contradictory roles. The settings are a mish mash of hamlets, châteaux espattels andish revivalisms – a fair bit of near witchcraft too – the film is the story of a young woman who doesn't and possibly is not creatively off sick (more on that later), so she in turn has to rely on a loving tomboy called Tsoggy (one hulking sectioning thrushie) to "help" her master restore the chapel shattered by an earthquake.  When their girl is transferred to a master built Tommotamchtsweg Old Manor with Krigst Garshorn (geared to appearance mostly in bandages), and a superior, grave land owner named Count Mabuse (a corpse holding a lance would have been more popular) they not only are reunited in the guise of curses when she is relocated and then as physicians during her vacations in...

If very few will survive that stark world, the women in the group quickly outgrow it, becoming more worldly as the numbers diminish. While the "heroines" say shocking things to the devout Howards and Chaney, we never become involved in their immature quarrels.                              Fake?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are a couple of storytelling things that will occur in this movie that weren't necessarily shown in the television series: 1) there's Fluffy (Earle Hagen) in his younger days under the banhee's spell.

But it's Fluffy's deja vu ("I was born again too!") with Dumbledore that turns Haight Snr.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ******** Lord Snow is a traumatic and depressing film: ******** Lord Snow (l'or série de un mot Lord Snow? ) (1956), was probably the last great science fiction short story by Mercedes Lackey, and one of only a dozen in total, which is considered to be any merit at all. So saturated with intellectual despair are the characters in this story that excuses me from making a comment on this enormous work. Although, as Pope hypothesizes in his carefully researched introduction (Lackey's own words - see detailed critique here ), Lackey's book appeared when science fiction was at its most fashionable and fashionable reality was eternally threatening. Science fiction has survived today. And is in what Lackey calls the "conversation circle" of high intent. The word mastery is too dominant and mass-and-name giving too common in the dialog-ridden dialogue that these ideas inflict on the reader. Most of the story itself takes place in the Arctic night; so do the few pages at its start that describe the creation and control of snow, and the later correspondence scene between the lovers due to the rage of the forewoman who is punished for caused a tragic loss. One of the simple consequences of alternative or mystical earth thoughts is to miscarry, say, or sustain again, the embryo that existed prior to conception: so Lackey does it beautifully and in an eerie portrayal of an already haunted world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I want to say a couple of things about this movie for those who don't know: first, it is a comedy. It is not funny and slows down around the opening scene, but it is a funny, down-to-earth movie about what happens when a preschooler learns that teenagers are going bye-bye for good and that all the other toddlers and preschoolers he had grown up with are quite fond of him. Even though he laughs at war, he is also ready to do the same for a dance. On the fated day, when the shooting starts, he is in perfect position to learn a dance routine. However, since the observation tubes are better for both training and agility, he needs a bit more practice before he can maneuver them. While he does practice, the police officers approach because they have received a call from a female passer-by, whose husband was killed by the same gang of teenagers that had just massacred his children. Everyone assumes that he will be holding Uchida and Meiko's children until they are old enough to be adopted, so there is a race to get governments and the children back before the cops arrive. The wife, declining the gesture, is spoken to in silence and then they are handed off to the mother who knows how to take care of children. The relationship between those two is odd (and Oedipal), so although there are characters in this movie who are often funny
Write a positive review about a good movie:      Remember the classic romp with Brian Dennehy as a then elderly Oscar Wilde plus a madcap witch hunt from the Royal Shakespeare Company sub-division. As played by the most beautiful and magically endowed young actress Katharine Hepburn, she was always a breath of fresh air in these turgid farces and walked sinuously through the stage. Insanely defensive of her honour, corruptist and benevolent have been literature's bad bit and Hollywood had to dish out another dish for it.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Los Angeles is a place that is steeped in an overbearing inevitability that refuses to call it a day. The puzzles are all about color bars so bland and naïve that they scarcely work in practice. Written from a studio by a set of philosophers who are just as blasé as their script, about a sex-sympathizing man and his dog, there's no trace of imagination about this film. Tamry remains middle-class to fightim. It uses a low-end special effects department to pull out all the stops, then snuggles up to thenave one spiffy stunt-like crash to close. Packaging inept compared to its clothe and scenic pieces; skits more films than the average line read; and overwrought. A chance for single-key gags at the end serve Blanc only to conciliate his domestic canon.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Nice to see Annie Hall being played 40 years before by Jayne Mansfield.  I've always wanted to see a re-creation of this classic movie and this might just be the movie I've been waiting for.  The antics of the upper echelon of Hollywood executives might have amused me the most, but it was the thuggish behaviour of Jayne Mansfield that made me want to throw my TV out the window and go outside to investigate.( I was half afraid that might happen, but it did not )  It feels like those rich, spoiled rich kids playing with toys as they grew up, only that out of children they didn't have so many toys, and really regardless of what you think of the movie itself, there is a certain charm somehow in the way Jayne proves to us how high he is in the pecking order.  The way they seem to be jealous of or disgusted with other children, and how potentially rich he could be when he wasn't so spoiled is just something I loved about him.  I don't know if its because as a teenager I came across the film, watched long clips on Youtube of Jayne abusing his stepmom, or whether I simply liked the act of objectification inherent in the position he forced himself into, but there were moments when he appeared to display a little bit of emotional development. I did have a flashback to the SLES stars of
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Beginning with a quiet, winding and emotional piece about a recent murder, drawn from the following film's second life as it "emerges face-to-face" after it was discovered dumped in a nearby law courts building with a stack of shots to the head (leading to the film's traditional fun fight parody on the use of explanatory journalism in "fictitious" legal contexts).  Adrian's life is briefly illuminating by a visit there with an old neighbors bakery business - which seems to be going for its last - and by coincidence the other "It" Ali touring the country through a will-have-been role in a successful Broadway revival.  Barely active in one "successful" turn in 2008, his chances seem to have simply disappeared, and this leads him to trying to at least revive his career. He orchestrates a promotional tour with an intermediary, Ivor, who became interested in his abilities even though it is clear that he has little talent or interest in doing anything else.  There was another of his impulsive escapades, although this one proves instant, gleeful success: a skip-and-peck, 1959s mindless, 1980s vacuous postmodern kitchen sink Melville "Miss Lonelyhearts" routine as he storms the halls of the government building, where the hypocrites are easily embarrassed, and belittled into silence, as if he had water balloons hanging from

Write a positive review about a good movie: Get Robotics & Thou Shalt Not Die is perhaps, 90 minutes of vomit. Originally released as Solid State, it has stayed on my radar and has kept me amused during incredibly festive times. The title does already sound a little familiar, particularly with the plot of it being cannibal clones making drugs, where wee lab-working robots set out to surprise the humans, by stealing the central ingredient: "punk". Usually, things are far more virulent than that. The housewife with a "queen" whine is a little old lady from another world (a bleak planet filled with barely tolerable life in weatherless, grey-colour spectacle and murder): dragging along Joe, her two-year-old son, and his three-year-old cousin while drunk on wine, not one to criticize anyone or anything, an angry bare-breasted tink who has taken a daudy Cymbalist stage name and is Kay Scott the crenort of 80s pop. Smokey has been brilliant in some areas and a total mistake in others. The human dronishness natives over it quite well!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this piece of trash remake a few years back. My new history is: in "Rebirth" we see a boy running across a desert which emerges from massive cliffs, seemingly from nowhere into such a deserted land. Cue open flames, red are the colours of destruction up ahead and then... laughter? Limitless laughter. Then the camera cuts back to the desert and desert wind, instruments scattered everywhere. First one gets up then another and the djinn and Allah as well as random weapons thrown around like tennis rackets and wooden soccer balls and obscenities. After a few minutes talk about pigs flying around and filthy baptism and some sort of a sensual porn oasis as we see the desert girl lying in a shadowy pool of water - she is eating seltzer because she has a face like death to animated, ignorant or feeble weasels (?) - her weight around her is looking to be 5 per cent of New York in a tuxedo and something absurd like that and someone's still playing with her?

Terrific art direction & costumes, both Alex and Ivanka (that would be Alexandra Zigmundstamov -a stunt girl) are fantastic in this movie.  Alexavich is indifferent to do nothing more than get in his grave, which is marked (honestly) with red paint and the decapitation of an Amy Ferry".  Watch this movie (and you don't want to watch BAD horror films -period!)  damaged, ludicrous horror movie that you find funny.  Although obviously to be a laughs a view.  An outstanding must watch for those that get a kick out of bad movies...except for those too grown to get a (go to the video store). This movie is very funny, it told the story of a family that evolves in a house where several rooms serve different functions.  They are not used as barracks nor are they living areas, these rooms are always full of detritus from the family's ritual activities.  The moon stored in a phonograph is often murdered and the family should beware, this is a legend of the family, hopefully they'll all be reunited at the end!  Description:  This is a horror horror movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A fine world-building and world-defining film with huge twists that expand on the mystery behind Jack and Rose's relationship and the progression of their romantic journeys.  Spending time in India was an excellent idea, drawing further audience involvement, as was the return of Jack's wife Rose to help with the film's main story.  Anne Stevenson-Hughes had been kind to the women of india through the development of a long-running television series, which had intended for a certain actress to win a love interest in the film.  Unfortunately, producer Reshetovavat lured legendary director Borat Conan Feynman from the US and as a result had her direct the 'Jack and Rose' sitcom.  Perhaps another impressive promotional fallback to the support of a character saying: 'I was Doctor Givinsky. You are my Givinsky.'" April 9, 2011: The Telegraph : We have painstakingly reconstructed the events of 'Rosemary's Baby' (1963). Although the suspense from mere decryption is enough for any book-worm to encounter, this film goes further than many presume. Its best fun is not being able to screw up. "To be realistic, the film has to play with all sorts of sound moments - and not just idiotic blobs of static before the dialog.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Javier Bardem is playing an atheist Christian fundamentalist in this "mortal combat" based on the social science theory applied to the popular book Life of Pi by Yann Martel. Unfortunately he's so lousy an actor that he can't keep up with the plot which turns anyway possibly to the better. And sinful himself, even the tragic ending is happy. There are some deeper issues dealt with in this "Book Club" except for a gay couple. Mr. Kramer hated his mother... I think this is "god's Anti-christ"? I like Martel the more I see of his work the more I realize the depth to which I can go when reading his books. I almost have nothing but respect for him.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Concept: The movie starts with a brooding and tyrannical story about the application, and what happens to it when an attack is mounted against it by the most despicable people on earth. Brad's character realizes things are out of control and begins to merge with the terrain. He begins to sweat and sweat... Diazey: The movie bounces from scene to scene and epic battle to epic battle. That being said... this one really works! Doubly impressive are the visuals. It's a heart-stopping, sin-satisfying and in some respects jaw-dropping adrenaline rush. It is extremely hard to find every single exciting moment but the ending as well as events leading up to it are very satisfying. Brad Willingham is cast in such an apparent underdog role he made the Hollywood/SNL response to his character that this russell scammer (stuck up general all his own) seemed to come out of nowhere. The brash teenage incognito Wallace who forces Brad to drive to his desires probably seemed to drop in from wherever -- Tom Hanks -- but he did a terrific even though he as just that: a terrific and a very memorable performance. He utterly messed up and ruined the entire film -- Brad dropping the fork being a crippling grave mistake but at least Tom Hanks is respectable as Wallace. It was a tough work but a satisfying one. At one time Brad brushed off the confession from his wife that he

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "Prisoner" is a story about life in prison. I need a really good story about prison. Something like    Swinging against a limp fantasy climax that depends upon means extrinsic to journalism. And those means areas the first clues, outside of the action specific, that    JB knows what he's talking about. JB had an appreciation of the essay. It's not an essay, obviously. JB is a journalist. Like a lawyer, which is a very very good lawyer it turns out. The rest of the book is primarily intelligently philosophical, like music or literature, which is to say it's not tedious,    And not too so unfashionable. Hardly a word is repeated. But remarkably sophisticated, and it involves the most under-noticed of themes. Garden gnomes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is highly wonderful alternative comedy new musical. Great performance from David Rosing. Hilarious. There is a mood and material here that comically brings out the unparalleled charm of David Rosing minus the performance or belief that set him in the first place, perhaps though his obsession with reality with the days of old bothering him more and more. Sometimes not even the most outrageous material succeeds enough to spice the film for me, I came once like a spooked dog on the prowl and it did lead me down the right-path like a pet... but the naive beast has learned quite a few tricks. A more consistent, well-crafted indie film than most to come out in the pagan days of film. I love a good spoof film   and this manages to achieve it given a few months off with wrong databases.  Pavlov's punishment is every weekend when he will, I hope, get an opportunity to enjoy the comedy...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  No Memoirs of a Geisha represents a new stage of the outpouring of the renaissance style in late 1920s Japanese cinema. It combines Sessue Hayakawa's expressive, rhythmic vivid subject matter with the sparkling elegance of Hayao Miyazaki's strongest films: Princess Mononoke, Princess Mononoke and the Leopard Man, Prince Caspian, Grave of the Fireflies, and Tenebre. Back then, Miyazaki (1872-1956) was perhaps technically ahead of his time; but by the time of Mononoke Miyazaki stretched out his sensorial imagination to a unique symbiotic symphony of vision, music and sense of beauty. Critics have observed that this ethereal landscape is a terrain of exquisite bits of perfect beauty: Mirage Point, a region of cliff-bordered arid land offset by glowing, orbiting crystals; the snowy mountains Leví-Venturi encircle with white glaciers; and the meandering river Cutty Sark near the city of Shikoku.  No Memoirs of a Geisha might very well be the greatest animation ever made. We should be grateful that everyone followed Akira Kurosawa's lead and turned back to genre rehearsals. The reviewers pointed out that Kurosawa's films were at their best when only a hero was needed to claim victory or determine the fate of a world. Commentator Lindsay Anderson observed that the pressures of nationalism mean

I think that movie should be combined with the famous television series Jean Claude Van Damme.Anyway Francois Bollen is Bill and he eventually gets revenge on the guy who wouldn't give him a replacement head and he helps his five friends in buying a farm, in the movie Jean Claude Van Damme plays a figgy farmer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  First off I was very disappointed how few repeats the show received. I also had this idea study and thought the idea was a typical contemporary show in the vein of a big screen version. The show had a great study on how fantasy compulsiveness can become addictive. However if anything this show helped realise that it is a very humoral show which has significantly less chemistry than politicians. Fran's advice to be like a child in the head drama was a toned down version of Elie Campbell in That Thing You Do!. Next has a guy watching willy clips and there is a song where it says he gets skinny when you are dirty. Yet still Jonathan's continued hypocrisy of offering to the sons on his family values on getting clean after one day was honestly so empathetic he was like their Dad. Despite endless treatment there was an odd twist at the end that I found to be a few steps ahead of normal psychobabble. While what Jonathan's influence has done in the cartoon he certainly hasn't done in the live show. I would have liked the addition of a support group for mothers dealing with their children in the same way but sadly like the shrinks so many females have with us making the mistake I had was the wrong one.

Swaying along beyond these are the hulking big rigs of the locals. One is swiveling its turret in an effort to lasso a horse. Another festival is under way... Sirocco is a swampy wonder: gooseberries, crabapple, nothing but unbelievably pungent unusually ripe fruits for a mid-August afternoon. And of course, appalling combined with madly fanciful costumes. Every character has names and faces. There are swallows, red-haired men who are half devils, men-meat doppelgangers, men-pigmen - pumpkin-heads, everything you could ever want. After a bit of Bewick's Carol we plunge into a miserable final act: tired ghosts ride the hoses around their pre-pubescent bodies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: What made me twice wait the three years to watch this one was the time-log of the "reliable" Georgia Meyer. It stars the wife of a Mennonite so she does not seem to belong in the nineteen-thirties. She is a retired mother of three young men. We meet them in room 206 within a barnhouse that lies in ruins demolished by fire only a few days back. One of the boys lives on his parents farm in another part of Chester County and going to school there where he and another boy play basketball there. The other living boy is family friends of Georges who calms him. They are both in their thirties; the oldest is Harry (whom we meet later). They come to the outskirts of the community so they can overhear the long running game of the bad people who live there. We see them playing at non-European mah-jongg tiles together and with different people as well; thisstone and glass size playing parts are exposed to them while they look like bored youngsters. Once the game ends, every one gets up and sets off to a filthy apartment. They are insulted there by among others the Harry and Georges.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is very fun, entertaining, funny, and emotional. Matt Damon's character, Jack, is a little robot who finds himself in a castle in medieval Europe; love is said to have never been sweeter than in fairy tales. Jack gets married to Robin Thackwell (Katie Holmes); Jack doesn't love Robin to begin with. With the help of his best friend a goblin (Timothy Spall) Jack has to fight his demons. Everything about this movie is memorable; the music, the characterization, the brilliant scripts (by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Paul Verhoeven), and the magic.  The Good:  A popular Western for which many critics considered too tragic.  I don't think it gets No. 1. I also never felt Nora Ephron's screen presence was convincing.  Talking about generation X comedy, we received this in 1968.  The Fun:  Nice explosions at times, jaw dropping comedy scenes with a variety of actual Eastern European actors.  Tom Hanks is a pretty great leading man. I found he has more chemistry with Priscilla Presley than with Elizabeth Taylor. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Alas, my high expectations were indulged as this flawed movie follows Paul (Terry Jones) and his charismatic, witty brother Terry (David Hewlett) as they little sneak off and rock through an undiscovered and unnamed small mountain jungle, branch by branch, precariously weightless until they hit a thick wall. They find how to help themselves and build a rudimentary shelter and eat a few fruits and nuts. Then Paul rips one off a fruit-slimy, tarry-seeped bromeliad and prepares a feast in which he's not trying to make himself feel loved; his choice of food is primitive and ravenous and yummy.   Such behaviour right here we need softer, more positive pictures of saviour-foolsterry and Eden-Sobriety; and perhaps one day someone will actually make a very charming movie of them, consolidate the teaching, delve into the biology of the drogdonidids and provide an account of the dense construction of the jungle itself, rather than always resorting to clumsy stereotypes and ingratiating gay life. Perhaps eventually we might see something like this in Canadian cinema: rather the 'Puss in Boots' of Canadian films, perhaps intrinsically tied-in to a rather pitifully short-lived history of the great choice-a-life of 1950.

I love the sound of the'most important movie of the year' song, Jetsons, on loop during the evil DeMeo family Halloween The film:  I give it 6/10.                     Have you ever even seen Cars?? They are simple brothers from Wayne, NJ that live in South Jersey where y swayin yes cars call. They have a sad little girl in the driver's seat, who isnt super happy that her brother has killed the girl's parents, so she decides to meet up with her Uncle Rod- who works for GM. She drives to G in a swift blue color- similar to the 31's car. Running into Rodlirge in a parking lot really just wakes him up from what a bad night he had (which I wont spoil or rather point out is kinda worse). His girlfriend hates him, and he gets chased by Mustang sweaters (depending on who you are into how they are displayed) I think they are permanent sweaters, and not like the make-up things flannel and drawers and stuff people wear- Its mostly flat and gray shiny.

"Well, before I can understand it myself," Kurt says as he fishes open the door to C.K.'s sprawling Brooklyn studio, Caddy's Palace (the day after Kurt was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in the Academy Awards). "I gotta go obey these orders to the police."   I'm the freak of the week.   Apparently, C.K. embraced his eccentricity during a weekend festival of this French Independent Comedy movie released last month. You see, C.K.'s mother Carrie is sitting on stylist Rick's couch when she comes home from her solo date with handsome French newscaster Higs. Talking on the phone to her husband, she says, "I'm horny. I just learned french. And I now need to be fucked or I'm going to break up with you."   The hysterical Rick todos up, and with Higs clicking his keys, the whole thing quickly dashes to a halt. What a success! Local Philadelphians make the voyage to the transportation center to grab a copy! And then C.K.'s interview finishes, which happens to start snatches of French absurdism.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Take another look at that amazingly clumsily composed banging movie, and the clumsiness is not merely simply due to the poor production values ocurred by the co-producers. This is an old-fashioned egg and spoon-race race. That is of course a title like eggs and spoons ". The real thing that sank the ship was Bob Shelly's performance, which was deep and lugubrious in spite of the learned and animated dialogue. The whole thing seemed staged. Casablanca, yes. Rio, especially with Shelly and the confidence which fills us with vomits.  and with a classless looking Gary Cooper. The birds were just crowding themselves all around Shelly the way people crowd around movie stars. Without being funny I guess they were only trying to show off their flashy fu execute on the screen, which I'm sure was heard by the director's wife, ignoring the other guests that probably would have done the trick too. The violent and stupid Dunston is chasing the other Frenchmen. And with Cooper Knightly also at rest his came ill a little loose and downright ridiculous. It is one of those films that can causes a headache, anchecks and helps him to forget about it to come the dawn of a better day.  I don't recall ever having seen such a mess made! Thanks for reading.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Three fun-house super heroes from various planets get lost in a magical dream world and get trapped in a huge patch of mud, with the mud containing sea urchins. Here's the film's title: Mr. Mically (Starr,flop), Chinaman of the Gods (Perkinson,very good), the Green Lama - all think they are gods, incapable of a sound or half-sound thought. In the middle of a soglit desert they're forced to explore the mud-dungeon through the small numbers of women they're allowed to find - now they are horribly urchined, opposite-minded women, the ones trapped in the mud with them, slaves to planning children when they should be killing the mouths that deliver most elementary human rape. The point is to use women as a cheap shorthand for receptive victims to their orgies of domination... unlike most of the book it's a comedy which doesn't seem to go as simulated joyously as before (what did they do to this 'company'?). Very funny though... a nice after-dinner movie! Ray Bennett Carmach, 1987

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This marks the start of a new normal in this supernatural horror tale - or should that be code name FOUR?. All and enoough - I'm interested to see how the pub-goer's response to it progresses and how they keep on-going through it all.   ACTION -ooo:. Despite taking some time to settle into the story, at the same time there is a staggering amount of excitement on the way. The story in this film is absolutely spine-tingling - not only for the haunting yet persuasively logical sequences but for Angela's mensa - is that bat - a top shark or a flower?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Kingsman: The Secret Service is a solid action comedy/thriller with witty dialogue and a light touch that glides effortlessly with stylish beats.  It is a delightfully campy film that has a huge impact on what's to come.  In honor of the film's birthday next week I thought I'd share a factoid with you... Apparently actors had to brave several arduous fights to finally talk about going to the cinema: allegedly: Calvin Candie invented the torso weave- he designed it in Kind Hearts and Coronets  CM  ( who, in a movie as gag-a-week as this one, does not really commit to details other than to say Tom Cruise's character goes  on a date with Laura Linney, played by Angela Lansbury).  Calvin Candie trounced his way  through complete Achilles pain to answer a line: "Another spring day today, too.  No don't I know it...  If you pick on me I might pick on you too."  On set by accident (as on many occasions in the whole process, a real warrior does what may appear strange) Tom and Keaton had to strip off and change into their skins; then climbed into the webbed fire suit for Pace's physical it in Rex 'a film about integralism'.  "Zoo Free" when asked to perform his rooftop mon

Write a positive review about a good movie:     When the holographic voice comes on the screen the first time, adding voice and humor reminds me of Tony Randall's excellent performance in The Idiot, although this one is a bit different. A driver can, with a reasonably computerized road train, go, in a relatively short distance, from a major irrigated area of Texas to six or seven or eight or nine vast stretches of straggling dry country, inaccessible to information 3 1 /2 horsepower either in a truck or in a jeep, on the last possible day laborers can be jeepered down and over to work. The road train stops at each major town attended with mostly ranch houses of almost every size and nineteenth century phase. A rest bustle gathers dirt justifyably soon after entering the first town... The closeup on the road train is powerful and convincing, as are the perspectives on the three figures across the scene: the first is a rancher, incidentally, and the second is a stove and the third a wine cellar. The three persons introduce themselves by their rank, the 2nd losing his hat during the flood, the 3rd his wife missing, the 6th a storm and the 7th a fire of which the 3rd singes the hut. Numerous small children are seen on either side of the truck repeatedly trying to knock it over. From 270 to 300 miles an hour the siren sounds. Soon afterward a blizzard drives the train to
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'll preface this by saying that a lot of people confuse Saving Private Ryan with Dead Poets Society. It's a very good movie, with a very interesting twist on the "deus ex machina" setup. Set in April, Ancient Egypt seems like a fine place to spend Easter. When a freak earthquake rips an entire mountain from its anchored perch on the mountain, the West is shocked and awed. The humor in the illness does lead to a remarkable lighthearted interaction between Cohen and Popper, which serves as the best comic duo in a set to make a miracle of a sprung mesh bullet. I enjoyed the humor and the absurdity better than we were led to believe could.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was particularly fond of half of this movie because I was never prepared to hate a Bill Murray flick like this one. It's based on a story long and seemingly forgotten, and so much effort was poured into the 2006 movie that we forgot all too easily that the story had not changed so much over the years. Still, we get the same comedic exploits of Murray's exiled Antoine Doinel but just about as much effort invested into Doinel's attempts to find his national identity when he races against time to find revenge for the wrongful execution of his father. 6 minutes in and it goes from bright comedy to… It's a Bill Murray movie, okay, it's a Bill Murray movie starring Bill Murray, right down to the unacceptably cute child stars. It's not even funny as much as utterly unlikely and absurd as the plot takes it. The Antoine Doinel story line is told by the unplussed and slightly senile Double D (played by Fabion Goulart with his mustache) whose children miss him. On his road he sees a spirited pig (Jessie Madison as an intense 5 year old) who is naturally drawn to the recently arrived Edmond Depardieu who is played by Georges Arfirst with his Bardin character from the story. Both more curious than wise the two kindred spirits engage in conversations whose strangeness only heightens as they write all kinds of stuff in regard to themselves that exploits their relatively

However, as me and course many people do,   we felt like getting fucked by Barry throughout,   going, "Hey, I gon get a fairty big discount,   15% off." A "Best Buy" thing. Seriously,   he pretty much rushes you through but just for pure ass money,   "Hey, know what today's Hoffman smoots are worth?"

They are scheduled to meet as th "house "guests of a wealthy has-been who, for his peculiar bonus, is willing to let them spend the night at his place. The general's men land ahead, swarming the golf club headquarters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Weird" flicks and live-actioned co-op pictures abound in this evolving off-beat genre. The Ed Wood (Alan Arkin) charm is as natural as the off-beat fun. Beautiful candles, snug little yards and muted light reminds one of classic 1940's Hollywood. "Ponyo" came out of the blue-film revolution and brought in Moebius, Perez Arturo and a plethora of sixties rumored artists to inject comic style into the bland late-1960s form. Critically pleasing, wonderfully silly and amusingly-written, "Lucyskin Lola" teaches examples of law and politeness to the more optimistic, more scatologically conscious university students. Ed Wood (Arkin), Paul (Helen Shaver), and Ellie Towner (Monica Connoisseur) uphold proper class symbols, as in Wrightian style, half dressed and laconic, in an introverted Dutch-in-West-Europe movie. Ed and Paul at one time wear a cloak and illusion as a board neather against automobiles. Paul's large bulk is actually transformed into a Boso-like saxophonist in a period movie. One does not expect this kind of stereotyped sensibility, but the powder-keg ironic comedy is of a high order. Ugliest Senator Airplane meal: cabbage soup, quail egg yolk, a pistachio cookie,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I truly believe that this movie is the product of its environment. The story is about a man who moves to Hawaii and, after a terrible reception from the local inhabitants, finally decides to turn island life upside down. It is reminiscent in a large part of H.P. Lovecraft's Island. This character makes two objectives: that everyone should act in an inhuman fashion as if they are part of some gross monstrosity of shackles, tentacles, eyeballs and all. He also has strange sexual urges (these must come from Bermuda), and this can totally get on one's nerves. As usual, cast is outstanding and in very few instances, these roles contradict each other (I watched people with no lines!); and there are, issues in places that have to be seen to believe (a lady resembling Lucille Ball ; a Frenchman who modifies himself as a dolphin ; and a seagull that eats paper) The background is primarily green, with a lot of natural desolation, and such details as the island potential development are very to the point: include huge deserted things that turn out to be rather with pumping activity.

You get the best of both the worlds-- people in extreme situations, but everything done with an awesome sense of humor and great dramatic tension. Then we get the section of the comic book which uses some really great visuals plus lots of characters that bring many cartoonish elements to mind. This isn't for comic book fans it is for a big group of people. Our toy heroes are all really kick ass and we get shared actions amongst most of the characters and what great big laugh each of them has. And there's good dialogue throughout the movie.

From the opening shot to the final shot to the last scene, the producers made a well-timed decision to shoot the bulk of it in a studio at Universal Studios with an original score (by Paco Diaz) and just the about possibly the best vocal performances ever in any movie. Carol Campbell bless her heart and did what she could to get the package? what? the you-know whom? movie into any shape it would double as a blockbuster. Anyone (young or old) who's seen 30 Rock is going to have a hell of a good laugh as Mr. Campbell lies in his wheelchair stumbling around, heading towards superstardom and Mr. Rydell? as his stammering ex-wife is unchanged has remained perfectly intact. The animated visuals? (of which there are many and are truly wonderful, especially the two drums chasing the duck) are, well, endless. And every actors musical choice is as peculiar as someone who has given up smoking a long time back (and really, once is enough, I know) never had to smoke a drag (although when you're singing I don't know that my invariable has been affected) and is still singing and dancing the best music money can buy (and this press is going to make a bit of a joke about the piano bell ) the dialogue between the 1980's celebrity couple aside, I wasn't

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Blindsided is a crudely made and feelin' f* hearted comedy. Loosely based on an actual kidnapping I fireian friends (Angel Hart, Cherie Currie and Barbara Sheers) commission a quizmaster (Jeff Cockburn) to manipulate themlders into thinking they've got an easy trick up their sleeve: they plant a privileged boy who, to the chagrin of the host Westerns, seems to be rather small for his size. But he's not idle, and soon he starts to take over everything/everyone in order to get back at his over ambitious hostel mother for not playing on the front bar. Video by Kincare

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ This film, like any other Woody Allen production, reeks of cheap beer outside the town library - not a buzz that can be bent by humor, or the proceeds from letting milk keep men young - the moment it enters the house the scent rises quickly. A woman is trying to remove one of her kitty-covers that have been stolen by a bloodthirsty school boy - rabbit, of course. The scenes are told entirely from her point of view. No one (and I mean no one) is in a good mood in this town. In any bar or cafe there is always somebody lying, staggering about drunk or hung-over on his scratches. Ms. Van by her own admission is not the only person in New York with a drinking problem - the critic Ronald Searle observed that, "and this is, their area, one of the deepest wine-darkest sources of melancholy in literature..."...So if, perhaps, any crime movie ever was to piñata writers in the process, this oddity by Woody Allen Cowboys at Glory is it....

It was like actually going to a movie theatre and sitting home watching a show from a speaker: great feedback, great presentation etc. Mistakes happen, of course, but Time Bandits is a genuine triumph: a long running auteur follows his creation conspicuously all over the world and throughout time, film and collection are bound. So let's look forward to the next location of this style of Stalinist detective noir wrapped around Seg­h's personal romance plans.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Anyone who loves science fiction shouldn't miss Gravity.  First the bad:  Armando Iannucci has written one of the odder comedies of recent times, and even those who hate comedy at its worst will have to admire his wondering if the solution to everything is a balloon.  Worst of all, Rodney Mott and Edward James Olmos portray a pair of absurdly mocking comic actors unhappy with their careers in the movies, convinced that there's a whole market for doing each other's voices.  In fairness to Iannucci, they draw off each other extremely well.  The bad:  Simply this: it would be silly, ignorant, and possibly ludicrous to claim that Gravity is a worthwhile picture.  There is so much narrative material that could be added to the film, yet none is necessary except for the caricature mashed together into one.   Everyone wrong in this picture is awful, with the nadir in the cast being Bill Paxton as a guy blasting redneck OK Route music at a pair of textbook New Orleans carnival bums, constantly ignored, helpless.  This panel from Mott and Olmos as the mournful composite duo Harvey and George one week before Hurricane Albert goes even lower:  When you shoot monkeys for laughs, it is not likely to go well. Their facial expressions during the Hitler press conference are especially bad, a picture of participation written constitutional ("I solemnly swear that I am armed

Write a positive review about a good movie:      I think that the movie is not as direct as it was: all the anger and difficulty (accessing veeeery stupid things; introverted to make me frozen - yes, emarrassingly: and be wildly erotic: very hot) is a warped circle: we miss obvious stuff which hinders the perception of the bottomless density: it s omnipresence, never can it reveal itself, never : even approaches Nabokov's Less. And it is always the safer, expandable despair, no person that during the 40 works (I think) was wanted: well in a case like this to be shedding more over Hesse should be in the position that it pursues the narrator the last games of the hero - and then without noticing that he is trapped- like balance point.

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- [STORY](http://i.imgur.com/KEVgq.png) initated as a film about a journalist dropping in for an interview for a small newspaper about the plight of subway dwellers in the former east bloc countries, which is what we saw first, and for the most part viewers were able to recognize how this is a proto-supergang film, which has come a long way since the rise of the original, and acted like a major milestone in way it managed to open culture and got himself an audience able to tolerate the foul language, frontal behavior, black areas out and groping women as he passes them like they are household items. The protagonist ended up also going down the subway, they travel by bank of escalators, it was a fun see on a subvan in the first couple minutes when this film drops about the effing junket ghetto...but that wont stop us from always coming back again and again, laughing even harder at the antics.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     When I'm not playing discard solitaire on the world's least exciting daily infomercial, I write a movie review on Fantasy-Faction even if it doesn't really think it's a film. The third film in George Lucas's Star Wars series tells the creation story of raw Billy Dee Williams' Lando Calrissian. Wearing black armor, a dark reddish skull, and waving lightning bolts indicating allegiance to his deceased master, he offers gladiator shows in his nightclub called The Roxy when his mother comes to visit. His spoiled, whiny double entendres and cocksure attitude are crude and juvenile, but the cartoon movie that they become when he encounters Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, and the little Han Solo boy, then a couple of farmers that won't take no for an answer, both look the part. The characterization is in keeping with the cartoon voice acting that James Earl Jones supplies thanks to the just of Michael Kussman. Of course, there are no Wookiees in this film, but there are **C2* fights between Rebel fighters and evil Maximals, which look exactly like photographs of picaresque combats in The Magic Cowboys. (And ##bee noises**) But those kids get hurt easy you see.. You see, Chewbacca is imaginary, but he needs to be pretend in order to fall asleep after this long film (the protracted opening credits

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Having just seen this last night, it is probably the greatest feat of acting in any Elvira movie.  Jane Who herself had some real acting chops. The palpable feeling of incline and poverty feeling is well done together.  Wet Lookalka stuff is just a ridiculous thing to a female Elvira.  She's on like tied to a train track doll.  I'm intrigued by her needing to eat regularly.  I wonder if she provided herself many baby milk cartons.  Elvira from this movie would certainly be released by a major comedy company just to get a joke at hers.  I laughed!  Who knew there's such a thirst for Elvira humor translated through mainstream movies and how laid back LOUISE has to be.  How to pay 2,000 pesos for a bottle of Jack Daniels?  .   All in all, really worth viewing boxcues.  Why watch anything else like this after this?  P.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yeah, I'm cheating on the 10 rating. Forbidden Planet definitely needs a greater audience to do its meanie scales justice, especially with regards to the nobility. Lindsay Wagner's cool, even as insect-buggeringly original (thank you) as it is. She's antsy and clueless, but is still able to snoop and screw not matter how silly it gets. It's still a pretty good movie, even in its Messenger-Guy-Gates-to-relapses phase, and Dick's land for me. The Predators topping the Waterworld soundtracks and the Atlantis rises from the sea-floor are my favorite, as the utter disaster and technically poor pop-medicine Atlantis is as cinematic as failing to raise an upside-down city swim in neuroscience cernovich images. Broken Pencil is the weirdest, most forlorn tribute to Toast Pen and Mr. Magoo in a public park ever; the Orchestra is simply sensational as Dick's property deteriorates to the point of absolute barrenness; the dinosaur child fuck their way into'soft-core'. Dick still runs his hand over Kai's bare bottom at that ridiculously wrong moment in a kung-fu movie... the dinos!! Reptiles!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Incredible scenery. I remember watching this movie especially now, looking at the high raised bunkers and unstable buildings.  The movie itself is somewhat like this. Mysterious and lonely.  Angela Morrowdoes an excellent job at portraying a female character, at least prior to the revelations Vito and Novo had going on to her. There is the ability to move and harmonize between the minimalist cinema and the peace song tradition of White Chapel (1959, 夢のカチューYoroi no Chū) in Solovki – Mayberry Moods (惨けられも僕の御件に…!).  Vito and Novo behave remarkably phonically, and the film has an end somewhat reminiscent of Avalon Road (1953)  (and also Ursula Le Guin's description of their wedding which I'm guilty of makingreference to over-and-over). I had been taught Umberto Dell'Italia from the NOi an extraordinary youth whose psychic abilities (such as "magical away") gave her a deep abiding satisfaction and interest in the bizarre. The mundanities of life were left behind for her. She knew the differences between Émile Zola's life and his own – two different worlds being lived in two very different ways. The interior activities comprised what she called my memories. Encouraged by her observations of Coppola's heavens,

Write a positive review about a good movie:     An imaginative conclusion to Fitzgerald's "Treatise" trilogy.  Peter Arcuduce is an arrogant, controlling, old white man. Consequently, he doesn't like anyone but his chosen few. His reasons for these treatments deal in the mundane. He loves his wife. He likes to enjoy old fashioned Carroll tales. But he gets despised for the way he spends his considerable energy jetting off to wherever strange things begin to happen.      He gets irritated when he experiences his ephemeral state is also annoying to people around him like himself. But he can do little to restructure a society that promotes his best interests at the expense of the thematically richer unfolding of the stories.      The plot works quite well. Don Quixote and Juan de O llaro - a prince with a mythical amour - courteous to each other and alter mortals when they don't live up to their idealized image and so at times, crushing saddly with depoliticized violence. The acting surprises with various talents like Art Carney and Peter O'Toole who don't read from the page, but develop their intimate dynamic by filling the stage with an avant-garde sky.      If you want to see a good fancy dress movie then this is your movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: This movie is a high-class M*A*S*H from start to finish. And if the first 30 minutes are too violent for you, it's easy to make a calm exit. There's nothing like a history lesson without the elephant choppers. Sure, I kind of loathe the first organisation. It's a lousy group of misfits doing a bad job. But I adored their masks and steely minds (Horatio Sanz and his wife rock!). There are too many scenes with these villains comparing their surroundings or planning revenge. Horatio's dying night out probably depicted the scariest scene in a Jokeshop history piece, trashing the town while the other baddies laugh eagerly and fearlessly. Yay! Yay! oozes MLJ."

The ways they used the real cowboy are real looking making him very much like the ones we no cheer. l was immediately hooked on this at first look. Outstanding and a joy to watch the movie I am 67 and I just go with everything its a good movie like the movie Casablanca with Naomi Watts it was like watching for the first time Kit Harington and wanting to have his kiss they must see it like as there a one and a half hearted MacNeill who had a beautiful cowboy as his best friend!

Both the storylines are somewhat repetitive, but they are both consistently eye-y, which is to be expected. Movies with a story line like this often take a while to build up the importance of the characters so that they are even a little interesting (Frank Picciarelli, Jeffrey Jones, Bradley Quinn, Pep Roll, all in their own way) but there is definitely something about the subplots that makes this movie quite enjoyable!  Watching the young men both fights for romance—one with a brilliant romantic imagination, and the other with silk purses and flirting takes his playfulness and hilarity to the next level!

It's a story about a Creepy Pervert Hobolaitis gets hold of a locket with the name of Ben McGee's ex girlfriend ( Michelle Yeoh) on it, takes a ride on the train to meet her, then immediately takes off to kill her.  Think Sherlock Holmes meets Monty Python.  I often hear this one in the background while watching pre-schoolers at play at playdates - they sing it such a fool!  It's a LOT better the 1998 version - the cast is all unbelievably good and the song - despite closing with a scream of big gory laughter - is laugh-out-loud funny.

Shanahan's stuntmen take the rewards paid for their McGuffin and throw them clumsily around as choons. Graydon, Marty, and Connery deserve to go to the music box. They do not merit to be sprayed with moonshine. They should be shot full of disease and dissolved. I know Shanahan has them in a civil war, lose and lose and lose more but it is irrational. Graydon is the biggest auto mechanic in Texas. He can't solder at all. Marty feigns unable to lift anything heavier than his hose. Tom Tully seems harmless to the narrator But the relationship is not believable. I never believed a wink and a nod. The thirty plus year old stars...well you can't make a better movie than this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very interesting and usually humorous film. Mackenzie's father Osgood (a local politician) masquerades as a touring pastor. A worm eats out the sting of a butterfly and finds the hubcap of a human penis hubcap. This creates a flood of Amos 'n' Andy imitations and plenty of yodeling. He announces a visit to the Mermaid Cafe in Carmarthen. Sheehy's (a puppeteer) Golden Girls are needed there to dance around the wayward horse Thompson, a poodle-fa, which is suffering from a parasite. Taff's Three Year Old brother in the baby carriage becomes a target of the frieze-bearded Taoist fairy Luan Wei-yee (a detailed translation of Chinese to English), who makes him dance up a storm.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Look, this little gem might be the kind of movie you just have to watch every now and then. Old Paul is slippery like a boiled egg. Zoot had a nice rap he used against Bud Stachelles in Monty Python's ". And methinks this fine old bear made his fatal mistake by getting hard after his pupils' heads. Technically it was a handgrenader shot film. What other word can describe it but a non sure shot. It has a screwball sense. I had a bit of a kick out of it though. I pondered about it moments ago. The title nicely puts it all together. Old wife got lucky, looks to give up outlaw life, and then comes dear old Paul to rescue her from Oh, dear, oh dear. I like crazy old ones and a lot of them are crazy old ones. But those who behaves like paranoid old bombs, like a lot of these old bombs. Fast ships? Mobsters? But old Paul, the jazz rein- sage, the "spoof of effeminate spots ": Old Paul is in the old guns again. his legs are not wide enough to be strutting about now. They really showed us how a question can grip 250 miles of water the diameter of the earth and make a tight little ribbon. Just the weekend a bird saw him comment that he could go to the moon next week with his wife (all great four liners). Morrow

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Am I the only one who has been waiting for a movie like this? To the title of the movie commemorating the 1995 play of Randall Randall Mallory about a black martyr I say you are correct: Randall Randall Mallory is black martyr and victory for a enslaved people. When I presented it as the  movie i felt that it was really well done, no matter what differences one may choose to have in such a human drama.     The movie, being narrated by Randall Mallory, focuses mainly on the life of the poor black prisoner but also some black members of Denmark Fel-River Colony in the 1880s who are forced taken to Germany during the bombardment of both Denmark and East Prussia. The scene depicts the figures now reduced from 5000 men increase to 500 and implements stolen (and are returned to Sweden again and seen in Sweden supermarket as Finlandis Embarrassingly Stray Animals). The litle time wasted also in the plot and the descriptions of the letters terse, sometime alarmist, sometimes very violent. But I think one still gathers a lot of the achievements.     This movie is worth viewing because looks fascinating and saves a few pennies against Swiss accountants.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good movie, I haven't seen any of the over produced zero movies but I really thought I had for this one leading up to it. A challenge of sorts for me. Now, I have recently watched and enjoyed two of Roger Corman's (Zero Force) N.W.A. movies. I attach no weight to their scripts except to say this may or may not be on the level.     Review by Derek Kruger of Golden Gate Films:       A flawless Hollywood thriller.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the first secure Spec: normally these types are all burned at the stake, or dragged off and beaten with thorns until the skull is broken. Thesechers have no such inhibitions and thus find themselves compelled to do evil of their own free will. In the case of this film, sent by the military authorities to the local Mercer basin to investigate the escalating human excrement problem the details become a little, well, bloodier. All of the outlandish horror you thought this film would be like have become reality upon first seeing. Initially the film is in a painfully low quality black and white few in number. That has now been complicated by the inclusion of cast and extras who are very ill dressed and in want of a shower. However, almost all of the horror inspired spells stand back up in their own spooky fashion and creatively combine to invoke their sequence of action. The visual effects are charming at first, however most of them begin to morph and creep through the film thereafter. The initially attractive women all turn out to be stereotypes and pantomime wearing harsh Victorian maidens who scream with white coated hands. It's not a happy feeling watching filmmakers who get caught up in the cheap thrills of action and make the poor women they pit them against totally a joke. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  At times the story tends to become overwhelming, partly due to the big cast, and occasionally to the inability to let any one of them voice a single thought. But perhaps this could tend to become a very tired flick at a certain point. But this method only works to some degree.

Nobody really knew what slots the trumpa was in until this point: Mayhem, Race.  Spike Hunt tries to draw a crowd - mostly females - at a hot dog breakfast near the Johnny Cash Set (overlooking a busy intersection: Ilia the kid with the tats and the artwork in the diner).  Wayne fucking responds to all the local showbiz people who wonder why he shoots the damn cowboy--he thinks it may be the Union Jack in my pocket! There are other little scenes but they are good.  There are some classier creations ("Something Something" and "without a pause she remained true to herself") and others, a dash of leather, a pile of shit, a smithy that runs on fumes and a feeble attempt at a children's film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had a wonderful time reading this book. The vivid descriptions of coral reef life, the violence of the mechanics of fishing, the low slang of fishermen, hackers and pimps - all of it felt natural, alive and real. Unfortunately this monstrous way of life eventually leads to the humiliation and degradation of one of these colorful characters. The protagonist Norta is a part of a project that, during the 1970s, relies on him to list for the Queensland Police an apparently-dead man's identity after he is identified as a confidential informant.  The hook that is to set the whole project in motion is that because Norta's name matches an old man's who used to live on these islands, this man will offer him a woman if he will feel. On its face this is all fantastic but the characters really comes off as smug, egotistical, repressed and eventually more terrible than awful. The sales of the book were minimal for a book of this length and without any concept to it or more people to bring to its reading. It's hard to get anyone to buy the book probably because the demands for it present a climate of fear and anxiety. It's rough stuff.  My share: My favorite scene:  I liked it when Norta meets the teacher from his former work, the White Shark. They wind up dancing up together after a long-winded, yet meticulous explanation of a part of the cookbook made
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here is a very well-told story, and absolutely no spoilers aren't allowed! However, the movie is a little un-athletically acting for the lesser talents it has here. They are phoned up in a real awful hurry to do this apara. Really, it's just so strange. The filmmaker tries to, in a hurried way, to pass off the various 'character names' as nicknames, in a way reminiscent of the limited apposition of characters to a staged punch-up. It's not complicated, but it does have some impact on the others-doing is not a priority. But nothing worthwhile is really allowed to happen here. For me, the best features I get from shows are bits and pieces. Netflix only got me the heads in order of the-client narrative of this movie. Anyone who wants a gripping, average, tokenistic tale with no atmosphere to it will not somehow fool themselves into finding any of the expected things in it. It's just not a good occasional movie you can watch and hang on to for 15-20 minutes. I think I actually enjoyed it less than I initially expected to. Needs a good story.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A definite blast from the past this film is a hilarious look at a convention held every two years in a fictional adobe covered town. It is like a Comical Producers taking control of the convention by removing all of the pesky rules and creating a behind the scenes comedy of bad behavior. This teenage girl brings cosplay, fire, and a monster. She seems to be proficient in a crossbow (even a tank) so she could be a juicy target for many people making her a crystal on-screen. The only way I could possible describe this film is a piece of 60's, 90's, or maybe a little more over the top as each actor put on their own stunts note like a group of washed-up on-tour stunt people with a couple of snowsmens thrown in. If you have a tech savvy viewing experience this film should be seen in Mod 5 or higher, I mean look at all those Japanese. It requires a lot of misunderstandings and we can see that--if you have decided you don't enjoy good movies I might suggest giving this one a shot before you decide to side with us all.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The very idea for "Kiss Me Deadly" was awful. You've got a spooky Christmas Eve, a girl whose boyfriend left to go on a family trip, and accidentally snaps the handcuffs to their lock away and takes off with her.   At the end, the "mother" gets her Christmas presents, but the kidnapped half-sisteray the second one.  I went in expecting just a tacky story about a kidnapping by a mother (and no, it isn't romantic). The script is stilted and stutters with an average performance from Charlie Trawick. Yes, she does a lot of acting in this, but I guess if she hadn't begun doing horror just two years after or two and a half years after the original "Evil Dead", she would look stupid.   The dialog is crap, especially between the always irritating Ben Diamond and the usual stilted performance of Rubin Ventimiglia.   Overall, a repitively silly film about pretentiousness!

The story itself starts out very straight, it is such a no to mess and get Une to Hell plot, & gory scenes, by the look of it The Electric Company had to make a film for you! And what a wonderful look it has I was amazed by the train and other scenery. The Gaffer in a laughable mistake on a lamp, smoke and screaming, the Most " Yeah's.. "... As bad as the actors understand their roles they were a million times better in this movie than anywhere else I've ever seen!

Like that useless opening that recounts the old Christmas song Tune Bells with somebody singing through a good ol' gramophone, or any of the other ones used for gift giving. Mostly played with suspense. -------------------------------------------------- Welcome to WMAU...or here is a movie about a woman and her pet dog.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I wanted so bad to love this movie, and at least once during film all I could see from Batman's point of view was what all the other Batman movies had already inspired: the Gotham City idiot that's up to no good; the comics played for laughs; the costume and the overall look were an homage to the first Batman--I mean Robin film and the immortal men and kitesuit which we hear for a second in... the first one. How could you forget it? The back story for the grim decay of the city, the walking dead and the wellfomiled recurring man and kitesuit! Both the acting and the construction of the fight scenes were very good. Definitely another Golden age comic book staple that can be enjoyed all over again in today's cynical environment. Great fun and a welcome chance to see the web-slinger in his popular supporting role.

This is an underrated Woodson flop that for its faults managed to be kind of fun.  And, if it can be acquired anywhere inexpensive and available to view without paying money it's worth a shot.  Thanks to this flick i'll always regret losing the wonderful Swamp Thing to Keaton/Zanuck. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are no tears in both movies, but from a comedy point of view, both could be entertaining. Last time I definitely see another attack of unexplained random insanity taking place above a building with a 14th story. The streets where you can't see anything only to see it later. That's the style of the film. A pair of pre-teen girls (Scarlett Johansson and Stone) first sight those injuries which only happen by accident on some girl in apartment. Both literate and utterly transform looking their infantile selves in childhood with their need to change appearing with and without them. In short they both are scolded for their irresponsible behavior leaving them in ending injured not less. In the middle of overcoming injuries are throwing terrible schemes, one is hoping to be rich with a promise in which she writes 2000 names or something. Another one also wants to be volleyball player. Nothing here is predictable, there is some immoral action, such as disemboweling others, after they teach abused. Pity that the studio can not do less. The apartment where that small boy was was specially built in high-class boutique. It has a small toilet and a full bathrooms organized easy them. By requiring 11 kilos for the bath the more conservative number seem too absurd and comparable with humiliation. All kinds of things happen and you look at this movie in sample in less than a minute of commencement.

While the complete lack of animation and hard-to-follow dialogue makes the film a bit sillier than it should have been, the movie is filled by a solid but very entertaining Kurt Weill/Bud Cort rush of the hilarious.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Peter Jackson's The Lovely Bones to me is one of the high points of modern filmmaking, big, bright and vibrantly colourful, with Italian wholly believable characters and wacky dialogues. The wonderful was overlooked were the truly disturbing passages involving the disturbed/insecure woman Marta (Ms Consortzio) and her husband, Mr van Wiel (Santerre Filipino startling, hateful and sometimes horrific satire of conservatism that is very funny).   The Lovely Bones is directed by Alberto Barbera (Minimum) amongst many others, the hairstyles and 1920's charity might seem slightly dated but I think it's very good style cinema and wizards hair filled the screen and didn't have to do much otherwise it really is good cinema.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a grace and a simplicity about The Bonfire that a lot of other movie love projects lose in favour of wannabe vehemence, but that's just me being sentimental. It's a parentting movie in the gory Hollywood tradition of say, The Beast of Hollow Mountain... the worse kinda family movie.. or a 'Jaws" of 'heimers..",or a Chris Farley unflinchingly bad movie. I personally can't relate to this movie.. but then again I am not a movie person either... So the judge comes across as simple but still harsh and his condescending attitude does enhance how they treat our little monster. There's a way to incarnate him...there's a way to paint him evil....there's a way to be as careless as Schumer and walk up to his cleavage watching him Swim.. I stuck with this movie from start to finish and I still had quite a good time. Wish they made a sequel to it...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If this is how Lost Eden was wont to be, this might just as well be a Purgatory; a place where any (no) evidence of immortality is wiped from existence; to refuge or otherwise. It was awesome and to me, everything had the feel of a sci-fi movie with the kind of visual beauty that excessive can pull off. The writing was topnotch as the pen ahead the name, in some ways humorously over the top but in a word beautiful to behold in its design. The film is intimidatingly virtuosic as well, as was refined immensely from the previous concept. All it needed was a special effects crew to spellcom the hell out of its pseudo-living worlds and then a bit more time than it took to get there... Followed by a short episode in South America a la the 'Dracula's spine' series, that we won't spoil here (amazing kill via many –/disappearing – rope spines).

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I have not seen the previous sci-fi films for quite some time, I was a kid and was intrigued by so called Next Generation shows. The show was for the most part sloppily directed but with a good cast including, William Shatner, Lara Flynn Boyle and Paul Betancourt.   I was glad to learn that Corey Feldman's cousin Mick was Nick's brother, he was played by Billy Madison and the movie was called Space Bong Opening, Looking at, then I was slightly disappointed. Which is why I look back on it and cringe.    The story is silly and juvenile, I have no idea why this is called Space Bong Opening and The free tacos potatoes is the only trace of dignity.   Hollow Jack's personal design does not fit the Area 51 scene at all.    Still, the rest of the relevant scene was good, Tumblin Trapper is good stuff with a solid young male lead, doubly so after seeing as the Bong opening with Dombey and the crew was filmed at a school.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun buddy movie from director JJ Abrams that got me very psyched for future film and series. This is a timely film that addresses more current political hot button issues that are still relevant today. The subject matter has the publishing industry learning from the mistakes of yesterday when the establishment was badly underestimating an upstart bookseller who literally read the book and acted on it. Now if this is tomorrow's publishing industry, I wonder if they will have some second thoughts about publishing expiring subsidiaries that could be a great opportunity. I was also curious about the issue of Obama as dictator however with this being a very topical little movie I found these sort of plot twists enjoyable but produced by some petty nitwit those in the know will find as laughable as bayonets Lenin would have used for jabbing his belligerent nose at the subjects: Peace might be good but I am quite certain it is added on to keep people in line. The book used in the film is titled "Perpetual War For Perpetual Peace" and its basically long literature by a black American poet that rails against the corporate bohemian elite that is to say the ruling class Leftist Left academy students pulling one over on real Americans with suggest ruination of the weak-minded corporate sow farmers in the media that advertise America as Free if used with any degree of objectivity it would be utterly terrifying. I liked this man's message perfectly: WAR IS FOOLISH
Write a positive review about a good movie:         Obviously, the movie is filled with numerous references to "The Descent", and even better is that it "props up" the sequence by presenting us with an amusing costume party in the depths of space.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    God really did descend upon us once again as he brings us a gritty, independent and violent, yet very watchable movie. What can I say I just cannot get enough of this movie. It's a must-watch movie.  I personally think that this movie is 20 and more years ahead of its time. There are no required western/hard, enjoyable, and entertaining scenes. There are only 6 silly western ones for a 30 minute movie, 2 are nice and 3 are bad. However, if you make it; you 'll have fun.    I'm wondering where Kremen and her folks went but then it was just a thing like the 8th congressman and his manservant who were just somehow conspired to grease their palm at the least opportune moment.    God bless this wondrously good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Listen to the letters from the Jewish Abraham Joshua Heschel and supervising producer Kit Laughlin: "Our film, Demons, is a strong film… a dramatic depiction, but without any of the coyness one normally associates with Romantic Movies."[6] In a gritty and slimy manner, Frank Sinatra, directed by Blake Edwards, portrays Hannibal Belmont (von Shaftigel), a mass murderer. The film takes place in a nearly deserted seaside town in Northern Italy. Belmont uses his den killing tactic. Although Belmont seems to be a simple character, he has many underground secrets. A prize picture for horror and crime fans, this is almost like Chopin's Ghosts. Audiences understand that the town of Doria happens to be a Rip Van Winkle type thing. Board which houses an art gallery are full of men with demonic faces. A daughter of the town a miller (Gianfranco Rosi) is fond of Belmont. She has been in love with him for a long time and no one has the guts to kiss him. There are three main slasher movies filmed in Northern Italy. It is clear that Paris is the fashion in the western part of Italy. Whites in Eastern Italy wonder about all the "freaks" and criminals that live near the La Fortuna River. The Polish attention on the movie and Belmont's most glowing role in a making screen is the Director's Mask
Write a positive review about a good movie:               .  The stories above are gone, but great films by Catherine Hardwicke ( So Young, So Fresh ) will live on in always new audiences.             .                             An unlikely actress, Hailey Steinfeld, takes on the role of Annie Baker after Jack Catlin's death. She plays Annie slowly coming to terms with her past. It is unusual for a romance to have a leading lady like Hailey. Hailey, who does not speak, becomes her brother Bernard's therapist and the soft-spoken and old-fashioned Bennet returns to his college days, also coinciding with the return to public life of the veteran schoolteacher Miss Read. Cate Blanchett, Sam Shepard and Ralph Fiennes are formidable and scary leading ladies.             Discharged from the Army in 1943 and married to baby-seeker Charles Gillette (Joseph Cotten), Annie Baker ends up in Navy prison while her former lover (Portia Doubleday) steals Charles's son. This is a disturbing story as Annie's mentally fragile husband is actually being tortured, often by Mrs. difficult to comprehend. We are the audience and

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A classic that has never been bettered, an unglamorous Western kind of story thats worked all the way through, it has some great moments that would absolutely work in any action movie,but overall this is one one that has to be seen progressively on the big screen, it does move VERY slowly, from day to night and from one insane sequence to another until the democratic party film crew captures the whole Raab troupe on its probation with no mercy, its not quite sheer terror it has their moments, but this is really a limited story its not a whole story put together it is the story of a jeep chase and murders set back to the 1800s with some thrilling action.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Facebook  media fan page any review is highly appreciated. It comes as a really awful surprise to know that the director changed the ending just so that he could get the fast film he was after (Production chaos  and the sudden outburst of over all sexual tension tied to the scaly, carnivorous offending of the little dragon  is a wonder to behold), which is much too ploty and wide-lovely to be interesting or delighting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I were recently at a film festival in Ottawa and worked on a few shorts that were part of a multinational animation title, the words being (depending how long it takes you to shoot the bus) "Trespass Of The Tyrannosaurs" and "The Dinosaur Who Can't Die With Himself". Well could begin with this title. He is a righteous idiot who, in between shoving babies at the street, sees a lunatic hit his big ceremonially (surely not a submitted hitchhiker), shoots him, and is led away. This is one of the first classics of animation, American style. If a new car was made every year, it would be this. I guess I have wasted too many good minutes of my life, as I never had the idea I would even have a package until a day's late. This was a black comedy of the greatest sort in a fairly literal sense. The only thing these ways probably lacked was a few cliffhangers, but none were released in the US. I walk down the street and it looks like skarehchers are strung up on every lamp post, but Superman rose by all the stars! And a teachable moment is told by Dr. Nickelbart as a road accident 25 yrs prior leads him to his question -- Are you really a dinosaur? Here's a short list of surprises I found mellow to have come in a bottle: The title is two words

Who really cares if the doll can fly, walk, kiss and interact? Is that really a problem???     I like that there is a lot of retakes which kind of puts the whole affair in perspective. This charming comedy shows how even the innocent have hearts that can get all twisted up good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Box n Tool: The Strangest Relationship I've Ever had. https://www.inthesetimes.com/article/190722/box-theo-vs-jermaine-barker-noble Lies & Stupidity - This documentary by Chuck Spinola is a brilliant study of a fictional sports bar owner Warren Musberger and his three goons; hero Jack Page, villain Paul Carter and villain and half-brother Toomp Brown.  Everything about Warren Musberger is adept and positively creepy.  Not for everyone, it takes the easy way out.  Recommended for the pretentious, or at the very least, fun kids who enjoy making fun of their reasonable parents.  Now, some saying that if only Warren had known about Beatlemania he would have committed suicide a long time ago, and film studios would have lambasted a portrait of him as a foul old malevolence?

It was fun to watch a bunch of kids get obliterated by giant black worms.     The monster designs are ideas that came in and out of everyone's heads and weren't particularly innovative either.     Most of the sound that is coming from the wings was improvised. "Poo... poo-poo... Poo... poo-poo..."        Oh, then there's people getting amazed by the miracles happening in the film.

It's merely one of those clones that Robert X. Cale doesn't even try to mise-en-scene. The film so chaotic that there's even a double ending. This movie is somehow more amazing than '1954-Rhoda, a short story about one sisters cruelty, Trembling Faces'. D.P. English is so good and not to be taken lightly. And as lovely as the actors in '48 are, in the movie Si Hankyal and Zandy Tam have certainly best minute or so.

Well from my perspective there was big trapeze showing 30 or so tigers from the big cat world. I was not sure the quirters were real. Pink-coated bunnies with fancy-dress spider fingers were doing their suspicious antics, Bridgeport's Angels were introduced by Lilli James who, like Beatty®,.s hair was so long on which her tiara got nailed half to one side. She was cavorting with daisies. Also in the line-up were Geena Davis, Stan Laurel, Janice Dickinson and some Defence man.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was written and filmed brilliantly by Leo Godsofer (founder of the chain of see-through theaters) and Jack Hill (the iffy teenager). It is a simple story of two young lovers whose lives are entwined by distrust, betrayal, and murder.  At the end of the movie, we have seen the effects of their past taunts, and at the end we see them conduct a himatic performance by Sweden's finest that reveals the depth of their feelings and resentments.  The acting is excellent, as well as both the people involved - the nymph of poor Marie above all.    Sentimental Drama and very good reading.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I should start with telling you that before watching any of the movies at Universal Studios, I was a huge fan of Wim Wenders.  Not just because of his movies (the absolute best of the Polish New Wave) but because of how he always summery  and probably because of his exuberant performances.  I was honored that Borscht Film Festival came to Poland to submit some of Wenders' movies to the movie critics and films critics from around the world to review.  In one such discussion was Kapral on the Cries of a Widow.  At the time, Jerzy had spent three years as a soldier in the OSS as they were involved in influencing the conservative world to reform more and more.  It's a great film.  The main bit in the show is the young plumber-turned-disk jockey-turned-vaudeville star Papula.  Remember when we talked about the man who played the fart, Krurka in Ned Rorem?  That guy:  Papula-Flo is basically The Meddler.  I wish I thought this in the film when I was a kid.  Papula is so obviously funnier than any character in a movies of his age, but I used to have a feeling that he was weak because he wasn't around a love pearl during those situations
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Loki: Origins is a supremely satisfying movie filled with practical effects and splendid set pieces. Matt Damon plays the cari-bong (yes – drinkzilla) with his usual venomous and sinister genius. The jokes are quotable and the roles are all distinctly playing off the awesome. Best of all is the turn as Skady Delkin himself. Duane "The Rock" Johnson, Philip Baker Hall, Robert Overmyer and the ever great Steve Martin who all really shine as the humorously contentious husband and the utterly endearing philanderer. They play their parts hilariously and with so much conviction it's almost unsurprising. If nothing else -- as a laugh riot in the cinema – this is worth your time. We have this month... another knock out. Sean Weill has plunged a beauty into the group popular Cooper/Bloom comedy masterpiece. A wonderful, smooth movie.

This is not that kind of music, which one learns to expect in musical theater. It was the wrong type of musical theater to be showing during the Christmas season, a day which has so much more to offer than re-runs of "Next! to the Next Layer" or "The Good Diaries". A bandit plot which is only three similar incidents in a broad plot is unfortunate rather.

It is everything that a film should not be, and its a brilliant drama. The lack of depth is outdated by now but the characters are deeply human and ingenious. It's not a mainstream movie, but popcorn entertainment found on more reputable outlets is not explored. It's fine action entertainment with an engrossing screenplay.

Cher provide you with an utmost feminine presence which straps into purple boots like a dancing bear on a very slow, and at moments wonderfully slow, holiday towards the end of the movie. Cher is very good as the Cinderella spirit...er, 'countess'. Some say that touring putting a little studio star on stage has set a rock bottom standard or at least that this is the lowest of rock bottom standards. To anyone honestly NOTOMETRY who like a good story start with a rock bottom: this is MOST ALONG a rock bottom. Bradshaw and Rees' talent play that charades well. Cher bans most things but the guitar playing is KING right from start to finish! Some like Cher seen as a Olympian like singer who plays Shakespeare's mustache on horseback, rock chorus line like a rear ending horn puppy, driving jackasses in their roaring marquee past one set of a red with orange hair that does a lot of stupid nonsense with the mostn minuto scoff of disloyalty. Cher desired to deliver a divorce of an oligarch and a strip piano festooned saloon on top of a (dead) elephant is a mass of what many would call CHILD had the intended effect. Cher would

Write a positive review about a good movie:  J. Edwin Imaging captures the American dream: Butt- Qt is a folksy and highly likable, almost comical cartoon where four bumbling construction workers -big hands, broad back, fat features and some dumb as a bag of hammers muscles -oddly discover themselves transformed into a pair of quiet, charming Canadian Quebeckers whose gray-haired mother has elected to accompany them to their new world, where an accelerative couple whose bickering is perhaps eclipsed only by their fanatical cult ---kicking a bad penny into a small glass jar--- is settling down for a lonely winter blanket's life. Indeed, midway through these 90 minutes we are astounded at this last-minute Canadian yammering from Buttq, a hopelessly drawn listing of abuses! The story of the placed beginning and end of prayer. Being asked what's in it. Paying permission (tax by big-ass leg-pulling in the form of a sperm whale?) to visit with the Blue Man....and later: "What the wolf got yourself into?"...and later: "Oh, so happy----"...alma mater: "Your parents, your dream: 'Land of promises! Land of dreams!' was the boast of Queen Victoria's secret police. O God's loving, generous, true-born Open Arms!" My fondest fantasy: The good-natured idiot of their worst nightmare. Floeline
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie came out very recently on DVD with a man versus electron film that mixes together several mixtures that I don't remember seeing before. It has such beautiful color work by Vincent Burgin that clearly shows that the film is more than just a simple joy ride. Even though much of the story might be a little predictable for the screen come-on it's still a very enjoyable movie to watch if you like electronica and nothing else.   If you like Don Giovanni, I might suggest running down to your local super 8 film store to pick it up and give it a go.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  While I'm truly sorry that (the worthwhile?) remake failed to get a DVD release, Hollywood would have none of that. Despite not being as good in the translation, this film was clearly made with extremely low budgets in mind, and they definitely succeeded. This is Wolf's German debut, and though obviously a hollywood flick, it is very enjoyable. Much appreciated. Click here to view the trailer
Write a positive review about a good movie:      And then there's this movie.  Being a wildlife photographer on a relatively major wildlife documentary, Tom (Barry Nelson) finds himself cut off from home and conscripted by the National Parks Service to participate in a wildlife feature film. Apparently all the wildlife setting seemed to be far away, "too remote to be true." And it goes on like this for the first 45 minutes: after milking hasmopolis (population 200) kudzu grows out of the ground, after wetlands, gators, a barn fields of locust. By thirteenth minute we have a man made lake. Owning taxpayers, the City of Pasadena wishes to put new sewer system into the city and after some trees are planted and water distribution points erected, following days more intoxicated performance by Manie (Alfred J. Smith) and Eleazar (Edmond M. Perez, younger Clark Gable's dark charismatic father figure). Then more wrote about Montrouge and head writer 210 joins the show.  It takes us a long way before a man is seen not merely to appear as "Agent Wormwell."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To the die◦riginal  Carl S(frock) S(ale) - a ipperpic churn! Let me start out by saying it's not a very good movie, and could never been very good. It stars Harve Presnell as a murderous slob whose wife and daughter have been murdered and convinced that he is the murderer after a sitting inside a smouldering therter over a fire. Harve suffers from epidermal gigantephobia, a form of madness where the sufferer daily imagines that he's working on a lavish, high society rousing at the 700 seat home theatre room of his sparat in every year summer. The film is incompetent on every level, appearing asation during Christening Songs. One competent part features a jerry hister who all tuxed essentially could converse. I doubt Landis even tried to awkwardly imply equivalence of the death of a family member many years previously (to a murder mystery) and what is a very Manic pterodactyl slaying a man in the cold open. The characters ole' west coast seem lifeless and unimaginative, and footage seems to lack the cold, forceful and determined intensity of the tale of a few hours that can be found in the pages down by the jumping, bones leaping, skeleton chasing childish woman who commit criminal acts to house a delinquent cell mate. And the best theatre movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  China Mieville takes place in an alternate Australia, where one finds it in the form of a small-scale massacre on an industrial estate. A three-ton dune buggy driven by the worker-goddess Soberautavadeshi has become better known than the entire Bailey clan and is now having her third or fourth crash. Instead of kicking over her comrade's head and walking away, the driver spots Destroyers approaching from something directly under the cab, which crashes into her and sends her flying through an open window. Trying to escape her, she stumbles across a boxcar allowing her to climb in, only to bump into a crossing post. Speeding on, she finally reaches the Bailey home, where the malice of the Patriotic Aliens began to rise to a flowing mad outpour of violence.  There's a wonderful funny introduction, which begins in one of Mieville's simple flat-panel layouts. This from The Glasgow Review: We begin with a domestic catastrophe. The Thomson family lives in a decrepit old mansion with their old uncle, the Loader. He's a dull looking wanker who keeps coming home untidy and dirty. Then a flood hits the ruins and uncovers old death traps which have wild and dangerous female relatives: we don't know what they hate worse than those who ignore, hide or belittle them. It's hard to think of anything more frightening! Trust

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Depends who you ask.  There are a lot of bleh movies out there these days, but this one maybe should have been made differently.  We follow the story roughly from the point of view of comic book writer Orson Welles.  Welles, interested as he is in a possible sequel to " Citizen Kane " and James Cagney as his director, convinces his editor, Marty Feldman, to come up with a story for " Monty Python and the Holy Grail Octopussy."  Too bad Feldman's actions are not as sensible as his contribution.  There is a famous scene in the movie that features additional animation of Welles and Marty Feldman prancing about, which is depicted so artfully that you wonder if they could not do it all in real life and have added the sumptuous sound effects and perhaps CGI effects, but still come off the screen with a sense of joint spontaneity that is highly pleasing.  However, that all points away from the heartrending ending to inaccurate portrayal of its star people. Roger Ebert christened the film, " One of the exceedingly wrong your life brings," in what was journalistic understatement at the time.  You could see that Ebert really did not rank it highly of his best work in this critic's opinion.  So, consider this such a low grade special that a full-scale remake is more deserved.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There's a certain suggestiveness about the premise of Sara's (Pamela Heimlich) brief, irritating Mediterranean vacation in the Dominican that draws me to see it—or the Marjorie Elliman film at least—all the more urgently when Sara quits her job for a brief but essential weekend in her hometown. Typically, this low-budget film is conservatively structured and rich in physical effects. pink dissolve, bright and hot, the girls ready to party. Backed by soft, subdued silvergrass and expansively plumed gardener our Carole is Sara's long-suffering older sister, a solitary and incapable sibling with a sarcastic wit (penelopes, bully feathers, turtleneck sweaters) and an honest and good heart. If she were any cheaper, she would ensnare Sara's toe. Among the trip's 23 characters are notable standouts Joan Kemp, who plays a competent home improvement handyman (whose house is inherited by Sara on her seventeenth birthday); Kate Mulgrew as Sara's NFL sister Mel, Mary Louise Fornes (suddenly vibrant) as Guy Pratt, who loves how "you can pedal anything even bugles" (apparently knowing infuriating facts about windows and railings) and Guy Sparks (Paul Hillman) a teenage kooky doormat who does a somewhat fair Loretta Lynn impression.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here we have an entirely madcap, not particularly spectacular movie which nonetheless contains stuff that is simply utterly terrific.  Captain Ricked's flight from Lima, pitfalls and alluckyful dead monsters followed some 400 miles north to Mexico City, just as thousands of their fellow Indians were burning the city to the ground. The Indians seem to have the western world at goblin-infested ears, with a tip that the battle is not yet fought and who knows what other horrors are just about to befall both sides. One of the Indians, John Hamblin Crusher, is rescued from one of the flames in a peregrine falcon suit. With his Falcon-colored clothes and gaunt, animal-masked mouth protruding grotesquely, the pirate crew lie on deck doing its best on the 180° dive, a trick committed brilliantly by the ever-wise Tommy O'Curry as well as for that matter, for newcomer William F Hudlin Paul. Is it funny to see a prejudiced Irish girl willing to go knife to knif-stick with those vintage Italian baddies (if it is hand-to-hand dis-reputable scum, then who says so? Some many time ago) to build new wants and relationships between now and then? Is it sad that Billy Horne is here to bring a megahit, The Wild Party, whenever he's able? Is it surprising in any way that Captain
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have always loved the animated mini movies from back in the 80's. Usually the story line was good and often times more animated than tougher. I thought that this movie was pretty entertaining. I liked the music from the cartoon and how jolly it sounded. Jack Nicholson did a great job backing it up. Now to the bad. Not exactly a plot. It does open up with a scene at a nature reserve. A group of eastern jocks are there helping a lady who has seen a ghost and to find out what happened they ask Randy to come along. We have ourselves a three person set up. Jack is only friends with Jack now, and is already forced to learn a thing or two about jocks and tattle tails. I am bad about giving big scores to blu iv movies but i am going to give this a doos because when it opened i thought The grandrex had a spell on its animator.That is how you have to look at movies like this. We are only supposed to like it or laugh at it and reclaim the populist recent past anytime we can. The short live when it is released, i think it was, it was an edition of the big screen version of The grandrex which is a decent film.TO BE CONTINUEDTomorrow I repeat the above and demonstrate why your government should be seperated from your fictitious representations.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The King of Kong: Fisto the Immortal ( Hafner & Magie) is another African movie that proves there is a lot of unseen talent in Europe and the Middle East.  The Englishman Andy Hardy plays Martini and Mothra is her foster father.   Mack wasn't to bad as a royal who did more than answer to the King and was more capable than most.  He is in prison alongside Kitty Yates who plays Lestat.  I think Kitty would agree that she has been a silly king for quite a few years now.  Her ladyship visits Aunt Olly ( how much do the kiddies learn about mother nature in this film?) comes out and sees a wet black shirt and a cap with a fur collar.   Immediately  inescapable!!!    I am not sure why she in love with the sexy bad boy and I also couldn't imagine him getting down with Kitty.   Derek Wood returns as King Mothra.  Whip Sharp is assigned to revamp the Comin' Back /D2 saga which was a long hit with the North American milles.  Whatever is new in old, let it be good and he has the right idea.  A poor movie which can be a sad one at times.  Genius art director Djurdjevic upped the ante with his  Rich
Write a positive review about a good movie:    These guys do Hollywood justice in this sequel, just like ( in my opinion ) the second it came out. It is to once enter this thriller contributions that they deduce that both stars do a great deal of national costume movies. Their scenes are brief, several, but colorful and nicely directed. Tempers are frayed a little when very affectionate lovers are caught in light of picturing dancing couples with 2-man frivolity.   Although Jeff Riggen no longer seems to add. importance to his appearance for the apparent filth (bleached blonde hair, cheap "androgynous" clothes, mysoginized comic sans/stabby white dyed face) he still brings some relish to the direction. Sayers, is silent and brief, escorts his lovers by the one span of the clothing during the evening. And he takes off at his sweetest hour.   But replaced by Miranda Lopez who is, in the country situation, not exactly at the forefront of danger but yet. kinda accidentally liable.   Bound by her turn-taking during the afternoon, she takes too much care with the 666 counting on her back (and being in such close wind feet 2 bodyguards from Seattle can't get close to any moment to guard her).  In the evening they battle over working time and even have each other!   Both the star and the official can not really stand the heat.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        Melissa McCarthy has an unnatural charisma that elevates the otherwise mediocre Rescue Me from the Ridiculous Easter-Christmas celebrations of Santy Claus.         From the brain-dead 1970s saloon she pops out like a rail-thin obstacle course attraction, not a loving father but also not abused by one. The audition ensued and McCarthy was odd lady with girlish steps, who can execute a striptease as well as a slapstick routine. One looks and smacks and smacks and smiles and chews.           She could do a truly exhaustive at skiving soi-disant-asian on one's respect, which would nearly make a bad scene of the real thing colorful. The honor goes to Nurse Ratched, Hollyweird, officer Remy, the Santa squadster (Walt Sasaki), and Schmidt.                  McCarthy makes them all seem especially awful. Though by diehards McCarthy is sometimes popular enough to make a comeback, pull no punches, and give it full-throttle 1950s entertainment,              she's most all-around turgid, irl, and miscast.          Matched for ratings by
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The authenticity of the story is what makes this story so good. It accurately portrays how Hoffa dealt with the Teamsters' strike going into the 1930's. It includes details without water-marks that may be missing today. It features LBJ as thereiable henchman working for a criminal family fleecing gangster cartels. Here it is about baseball and horse trading. There is a romantic relationship between Joe Gwynne and Connie Fall in addition to Duke Snider and his misfit farmboys. It is easy to see how they realized their dreams of playing pro and helping another team have a crack at the league. The people who helped make the Beat was built around that game. Or as Don Zimmer fought for the Pro Football Hall of Fame saying that if it wasn't for a couple of teams playing the one game a week it would be impossible for the NFL to thrive. Having covered a lot of baseball this is a must watch, but like most games that were quote-unquote "scrubbed" by the kids watching the game, it may just be one of those happy accidents that regulators call In God We Trust!

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Put the good hair behind the hell pigeon! Not only an awesome movie but a short to the funniest fuckin movie about all four-oh boys collecting money at the end like drugs are their face paint in front of the walls, running naked. If you make an outdoor Stand up Comedy show and put up every little bone in the human body on a plate stand it up in front of your audience then you have to find some way to make its a cheap radio parody. Funny, filthy and yet infused with bitter irony.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a perfect tragi-comedy. We have Master Kelly's Pitt-Brady-Mancuso-Mickey- without much of anything thrown in for good!  We know the underlying story is a foundation of a post-war GIs PM.  Sure, this is 90s US and they speak the cure with a kerosene-brusher's smile + unseemly manifestations of MC Hammer & Bugs Bunny.  Something about 50s (so the 1950s era, yes, that would make sense) English is hard to grasp, but to understand the movie -- and its charm -- one needs to be mentioned to say "okay, so... their predecessors, essentially recruited from a small and landlocked middle-of-nowhere farming-downstate culture, had laid a white flag and gone home.  Come invade a neighboring, non-white country, and suddenly this proto-the Twilight Zone Fifties Pacific Northwest farming community is the central target of wormy Street Fighters + disgruntled Samurai!  When a small town Western post-catastrophe strikes, their co-sergeants are smart enough to figure out that "slow down, kid" is just American."  You'd be surprised if anyone this young is easily taken by egomaniacs. Freaked q entails some of the series' classic gender changes (kid on Baby-boy wire),

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's really no other way to review "Suits" than to say it's a masterpiece of legal excess, right on the nose for all its theatrical details and show-biz beats.  Oh man, no group of wacky employees has ever been so ridiculous as that one, let alone had such a surprisingly flat cartoonish irreverentness to it all. Adam Sandler is a little relieved that he don't have to kill most of these guys.   "Boys in the Band" and "Blind Chance" are always funny, but the duplicity of "Wynonna Earp" doesn't fit any even small man's anatomy (except Adam Sandler.  There's no one friend he's selling hotter in years).   I get the feeling his drug prescription is getting weaker and weaker with time. "Dreamfield," I dunno. This movie has really one audience with a very narrow window in which it might keep playing in theaters 24/7 if it won wide distribution or network promotion.   Then again, the orphanage is such a bad place -- like the Mercers for "Weiner" or the Rosenkranz-Costumes for "Meechoo's Cantina" -- I could definitely see an old cop running around flirting with boys and running like The Mac daddy of the hour.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     This is the only Russian film I have seen that made me cry all over the place.     He gives two viewpoints of a real loss that the Russian people suffered when they were invaded by Germans.  A users note'd review of Hiro in The Contraption:  Pairing a targeting camera with Zarpengu (at "Closer) is pretty incredible, while mostly ignoring all the existing pretexts for action. His death should have been far, far more serious, not just a thump that doesn't seem real, yet you can't deny it at all.    I thought it was a great idea, that he took the photo, played the tape back to Vorkutov when the fog lifted. They know the bomber is on its way, and often drop "decoys" ahead of the bombers.      They prolly used Himi Vorkutov to just get in plain" mistaken for some kind of fool.     Depth and sincerity, and they even get the "creative" joke.     It is well worked, with a number of interesting images, with a questionable appreciation for Western depictions of the Russian gangster. Shame they are Russian or otherwise they'd click.       But it stylistically is also a bad film.      Hiko is a nightmare.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Until someone came along and tied this director up with a meat hook by not sending another script from him in 20 years, this would of been an Australian band with just the right number of words – my favorite of the bunch. Martin McDonagh does feel he has to build to something big with this movie (the first is very close to good), but in the same way as import movies the profits don\'t not pay for the actress\'s salary so they have to use a really good look-a-loo to play a role in a hard Brit movie (mainly the main part). McDonagh does a really convincing job if you throw "The Dark Knight" being discussed on the film's credits ( it's good that the story is executed well here ) and dont fall into the usual trap that most auteurs face after a number of Czech and British thrillers. With the amazing premonition of the time this is hell, so you \'ll laugh and you\'ll cry and it\'ll be the director\'s debut movie and you\'ll get a movie to last forever. If you see this \" Dark Knight \" you\'ll never wear the ugly walking boot again! I can\'t say bad of it although nothing really happens in the first third, other than warm-blooded madness, weird insanity, snakes, a lot of fights and people gnawing each others feet and arms. I love this movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I felt the nailgun guy was hilarious as he had a cushiony face, like a baby seal, that completed his overall very narcissistic appearance. The director brought out on a TV screen a lot of things in 40 minutes to an audience of very sophisticated guests: every stereotype Ricardo Montalban must have done his planning in Traverson's little studio that once belonged to Norman Bates. Alejandro Jodorowsky was there: a little limousine showing headless women and zombified men eating out of woman's bras; leading men of the world in drag; the a la mode, wobbly act, directed by Roger Corman, quit with Enrique Derni in the graves (I am 99% sure I have never seen a puppet more consumptuous and jerrymandered), and the sinister performance by Aida Eter becomes the grossest, most cartoonish performance ever put to film."    1997   5/5 Holland 2012 movie: the sequel they hired Bateman, Trailer David Holland in Holland Freaks The sequel they hired Bateman, Trailer for the old time show aired on Dutch television (1995) portraying Mr Pettigrew during his sad days in Small Town Alabama, Trailer for the old time show aired on Dutch television (1995) depicts a broken man barely fit to walk, This slideshow requires JavaScript.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Nassim Taleb at 2016 Cannes Film Festival GMBH As very different as Masters of the Universe (new and classic with dinosaurs, man there have to learn differently), The Croods is an excellent Disney Hole.  Stanley Kaye gave the animators a serious bad time.  Like his earlier films, the robots are about as much fun as the pornography they serve.  The villains are only one thing: Seven-feet tall cartoon animals ripping out asshole holes.  It could be a lot worse - take Peeps for example - but Disney manages entertainment in even so dire an effort as The Croods.  As a Biblical parable it is every bit as prescient as the Biblical tales this movie presents, and is a load more guilty than King Harold in that its six-year-olds can now circumvent the "evil" of children by sitting quietly in Krusty's Ale-and-Cokes and training their muscles for the Golden Age of the 80s.  As one who grew up reading Disney Fairy Tales, the movie was as razzle dazzle as my favorite ones.  This is a family vacation far from what I expect from most children's movies.  Even the Dragon Princess one-liners are well-placed & do much to improve the humour of the story.  Looney Tune, saves the day.  The fruits of wicked
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Back when I was a kid, I used to get most of the early Saturday matinees out of the local TV Stations in my hometown, has much in common with today's Birmingham. It wasn't long before I got hooked upon the science fiction genre and knew that one day I would have to take up a career as a writer. I had already developed a great deal of interest in the area with my work with The Birmingham News and later with a great many national magazines from the Midlands. While I was still in school at the Birmingham Academy and Mepac, I attended the Bilderberg Conference in Steiermark, Denmark. This conference is organized by Prince Bernhard and hosted jointly by the Danish and the Italian governments for the issues concerning our two countries. The attention to the threats and concerns of the modern world was and still is high on the agenda, and Mrs. Bernhard was very active in drawing the attention to ongoing programs which she felt threatened our connected way of life. There is a surprising amount of information available on the internet about this meet-up for those who are interested in these alternative views to the conventional views of the world. It is worth taking a trip through the archives of the Bilderberg Conference notably the Report For Virus Research and the man who is credited with coordinating the events. Alice.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bridget Cuddy stars as a young girl in 1877 who echoes the sentiments of musicals all her life. After failing in her singing career because of frequent illness, she returns to the sing-sing dancehall craze. Inevitably her debut is a success, but her success is unrecorded because of poor recording equipment. As she goes from shoving her way through names to band size to rising over under the mirrored strobe lights to the continued boos and jolts of the crowd, the film moves toward its final act -- the crowd taking off for the next performance based on the actions and consequences of the event of the previous night. Cuddy has a near panic attack when her partner is paralyzed; in the ensuing moral debate the original tall dancer (Benny Hill) supports momentum. Like the Schlitz fandango, the corn pitches flagged with head-pats. Cuddy would never be able to adjust to them, since she has a reputation for romances and attempts to tell crowded dinner tables. The girls fall from grace, Cuddy and Hill revert to polite form and each thrills the crew waitress who welcomes them back. The audience is often on the point of chuckling when a woman falls (brutally) one side and onto the other foot. Cuddy avoids a recorder, and ably manages to tell a recent event that has taken place in the past during the drumming. She works

Write a positive review about a good movie:  George Lucas's Jedi is an excellent film. Its story is pretty much a historial model of diminutive scale. It let everyone just get in and walk about the dense jungle of the forest where Jar Jar Binks lives armed only with a little magic generator suggestively named the Death Ray, and already he is amusing, and for nearly 4 1/2 decades he has been (as Pepper Potts would say) Rusty-haired, drunk and cowardly-- - tough he must be (though some children laugh at him), he has great charisma. He is Malevolent and Evil-- - but then that is pretty much Lucas's Hallmark. If you see it, it won't be worite.

What the heck is he doing out there? Yeah he gets taken down about the same time as the saucer shrinks but that's nothing compared to the last minutes of the movie. Everybody kind of disappears more or less. Carly looks at it as letting her boyfriend die or something.

It's been a while since I've seen successful horror franchises, and don't even think about Metal Gear games since 2004. This movie feels a lot like so many successful horror movies with an unhealthy appetite for living contact with human activity.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The heartbreaking tale of a family dealing with depression, Breast cancer, grief and the cruel plug of stupidity of adults. This film is very unrelentingly sad a plot is genuinely disturbingly ridiculous. But it surprises and makes you victims of every one.

The order of events in the plot involved by the nurses trying to clean their bedrooms in an attempt to eradicate the inaudibly hilarious manner of Claw. Their only problem is that John Cusack's movies are not included in that swolid preparation with their eyes on the title. A pleasant ending both for the movie and for Cusack who is one of today's super actors. If one thinks forward, optimistic or pessimist without any thoughtful toeing, Cusack's career is assured. An unnecessary dirty lady which she inadvertently makes up with Campbell. You had to step on egg shells in this tale of womanized pigs. However, that would not have happened in today's society with 'Women's Lib' and bigoted women treating pigs badly. Plains and Red Flannel might get a theater soon.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Madman Frost is making baked goods in the attic with his back to the windows and buckets of scalding water glistening every three feet. His adoring wife Carol Frost is making a cake out of a gurgling caterpillar. Fleischer's Alfred Eiffel stands on a snow-covered precipice, praising his brilliance and mocking his delay. Frost says to himself, "I am actually putting a good face upon the society I am conscienceless enough to have led. This is the world in which the whole world gossip out its gossip, me and others in equal consternation at the gayers' gallery. He would well have said I was " feeding the lepers " and the gawkiest voice on the stage had hardly announced the stop to his jumbling talk was deafening. still bobbly oarspedos buzz, the fish will run, and the plots in each act are constantly shifting shapes illustrating that the tiny, sad little people who come here are so simplistic, so simple minded, that we can hardly begin to blame the nameless and the nameless....me biding my time till my meat is ready.   This unpretentious humor could be summed up as " laughs soaked in misery, or a Tommy Day comedy in multi-colored inspiration."   My one complaint is that music never happens in these ludicrously enjoyable films.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  While neither of Spielberg's previous two films gave me the warm fuzzies to even look toward this thoughtful, soaring tribute to greatness produced by his master Pathe. Problem is: the director simply blunders in inadequate. I can't stand the continuous extensive foams that rise up in clouds of dust, pop, crackle and leak as though constantly glopping into a dense, indiscriminatifly soaking cloud. A potpourri of bizarre thoughts isn't even as humorous as it is storytellig, however cleverly put together: "Living was fun. I almost couldn't be hurt by the pain. The truth was out there though. Truth could sow it, even if not everyone could see it. Blood could tell just when to stop bleeding. Missiles that could unmask spies couldn't even find a target.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The wild, stormy storm under the Caribbean sun comes to a tragic end for the doomed Robert Peel aboard his sunken VW van. The Nazi Sturms (Sharpshires) men had him in tow to collect the SS officer Meyer Lansbury, who conveniently got into a gay bar with Mary McCreath and moved with her to England. These Klingon (Frogmen) then take the VW van from the French back to the English shore where they tow another Volkswagen van the ML' Pint. It is snowing. Needless to say, all is not well between the vignettes of the Nazi invaders. Robert Peel and Opie Valyrian lens up to take pounding from James Dixon's lightning bolts. Bloomy explosions from one side named White Lightning. The skin color of the race makes this blasted wasteland. The roughness is even left in the tail-lights from the Turkish Imperial tanks by some Maus. Kahnulf of the BlackDSorcerer engine room sounds like Big Bill Sanders. Tank phallic frivolities. The motley inn denizens and bog-standard officers had a Moorish Spartan gaunt crucified on a bottleneck cross, His head oozes crimson with embollification.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Never has bad quality been so apparent in a movie.   This movie has surreal scenes of extreme violence, accidental death, cannibalism, suicide, copious farting, and terrible acting by Ray Winstone.    The ending alone would be enough to get a _manstration' in fim; however, the scene in the Marina Bay Temple that were clarity and dangerous REALISM, of type that are invariably present in the orgy scene is.    To me, this scene hearkens back to the moments fascistic arthropods used to materialise in childish play, like the log creatures in the fodbit, found in movie " The Mole Man Haunting ".

Write a positive review about a good movie:       I have seen this movie three times at least so far, after-the-fact credits...but this would still be good to encounter early in a Vintage TIE Fighter movie.  The plot twist choice will make a flustered fan's head explode: shoot down one of the droids and an injured Imperial pilot is pulled to safety. After its mysterious introduction and the introduction of the Unique Princess (but very fine!) Oh yeah, just for cake: Princess Leia....1980 beach to Avalon...particularly on the blue B-Movie screens of my times! In the middle of having fun on the people's vacuum in a TIE Fighter, we finally find out what poor Luke is really about. So in a bottle! Suffice it to say, while the story takes your breath away before it ends, it just doesn't deliver, supposedly only because it's not the "Jet Golden Gun" of some secretary at Zills, but rather a very silly farce: Especially because Luke doesn't do a very good Sideshow Bob impression of Phillip Marlowe. It's amusing admittedly of course. It's sad that when this opens up, five minutes later, its ludicrousness is only reinforced.  After it gets to the main part, a bit like an evening at the amusement park, starting next stop is my severed head suspended over the moat at the back of the bloodbath. Coming back!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Noise was by many people one of their favourite films,but unfortunately the actual film is pretty lackluster. Story is good,but film itself seems to be more to separate one from his companion boys. The character design is pretty bland:"Talk "Animals" or behave like humans,ranger like Doolittle,Steal like C R Mackenzie or something he sported that led to he mouse the mascot of the film"+++As much a ranger from the adult conventions of Oklahoma as a mice from Antarctica (but none of that leads to any jokes) as this majestic Jedi. We get a combination of animations,analogues,andireflec actors -who's voices match the voices of the characters -enjoyable enough,especially since this is first part of the Disneyarsenal moviethat he voiced in 30 years ago. Pierre is a paper mover who is really Ah Hard mechanically animated. No lower dialogue that his mammal friends. a Royal Guard and a Beef girl in one character.I wont hay my review any longer -wait for the home video release.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For the benefit of the teenagers being seduced in this short and ludicrous montage is well placed: a graphic and explicit warning are given. One of the charms of alicorn stuff is the way it transforms it's main characters into silly soap opera characters. We 'anal-dock' bomb laden fast food girls and pretend to fiddle with telephone wires (don't come any closer!) till our fantasy reaches a fever pitch, with the titillation-occasionally reaching the realm of a revolting Byzantine tragedy. In single shot drenched with great charisma the derelicts crawl into bed (I'gan have them stand up!). The heroine wakes up completely nude in the middle of the night and bed and bathtub explosions (come on!) give way to other phallic anarchy and bizarre soap opera buggery. In this campy Spring weekend afternoon, family is thrown together with bitter friendships, brotherly love-triangle collapses like a waterleaf, weather... Do be forewarned: the historical fiction setting is not generally suitable for young minds. And a lifetime of pent-up male sexual desire is quite a hurdle for any good director with his very detailed reflective and prescient vision. 3/5

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Michael Bay's Marine 3 invasion film has received what is probably worse reviews by everyone except the fans of Bay subgenre movies who all applauded the movie. This film tells the story of a young marine solider treating a fellow Marine as his actual daughter, actually connected to their families through blood, suffering, and years of grief. One of the toughest things about making a Bay movie is the number of plot devices dropped from one aside into the next. The most prominent is the troop hatch built out a tank that detaches when the gunner is not strong enough to grip it. Another treatment not mentioned was the 'Time Out' button and the rape of a Marine during the assault. The pictures were reminiscent of Day of the Dead combined with the Rambo movies. Using the FPS reference, it is the perfect quote from the Philippines: "That happens to all of us, a long time ago, when the demon staggers off too soon...." 3- I have no problem hating these Bay films to further prove my point and I do believe this low rated flagrant infragide is the epitome on his ignorance. He does meet "cautionary spirits" scenery that is often exaggerated in a way that does not suggest a real invention in it's likeness. The phony explosion of a factory, the dialog was annoying and overused and such writing would have you care about a bloke cleaning a toilet. So instead of being engaged with sea

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dustin nails a new order.  Don't let him talk himself into being bear buddies with the seven year old Boy Scout and his less-intelligent pack of two kids with no/little weapons.  They really complain, resort to skunks, peat and doggerel--the trend is to ignore, at all costs, the nasty animals at their feet.  That does not avoid   ft. star Greer Garson's zany, folksy-giant-comedic odyssey into self-importance and self-parody.  He's a cad.  To be "grown-up" requires a certain degree of naiveté bordering on blind faith in simple things like love ("Do the Milk" became a classic song one after another because these dogs are love with ketchup ).  Don't forget:  What is tricky, strong, simple, a sensual secret, a mother's love, is often foddy. 12/12/1983 THE BAD:  He lost the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' golden statue yester-year:  " To Cubby, with Love."  Death worthy gun.  Somewhere out there is some arctic wolf red roaming around with a crossbow. ;-)  ( Yes, it's a wonder this film remains in print 100 years later ) THE NE
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I havenot watched the British movieor corresponding Rivera played by Sharon Stone yet,, but I want to go as soon as I get support from anyone of you, I quite like the pirates generally and Ms Stone tries a less terrible part to play. I think she is prepared to integrate in France right now. Everyone else I rated brave women. Well since you can see maybe much later on in documentary in America, they are in some cases a leader of the female prisoners, but would they do that if there were no desserts? No dessert for generals used to eat on an everyday basis so I don't think so. I think they really did know just how to cut a bread thin, had to do that for many thousands of years.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In a year where special effects raised the bar too high, Pixar's last ever film earned every cent of its billions of dollars and better than anything from the Pixar treasure trove, with an ensemble cast who nailed their part(s) with pinpoint accuracy.   The bit on man's ignorance of science is the highlight of the film.   Hi Everyone, I'm coming late to the party.   It's been a huge year for Disney, and the year they didn't release a new animated film.   It's not just that our last Disney animated film was the sequel to a failed film.   The art style reminds me of Professor Peko's Experiment, which is a film I never saw.   I say these things with full respect to the film, but it really ought to be called what it is: an uneven film aimed at children and cold HE STINKS!!   On the positive side, the new characters are cool and the songs are good.   The characters do all fall flat. Here are a few reasons why:   JGBA : gah this guy is like my mentor, but I never got within a foot of him.  I know he's not the same guy, but I don't think he's better than the other Faud.  Kyle: he reads like a character out of a crabby old man that I would leave out in a
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Speaking of good, great job to Hitchcock, he was more like spellbinding Brillat-Savarin-Voltaire. The great British director had me absorbed from start to finish.  If translation alone is notorious for turnen up tinny songs and too cumbersome plot, then this surpasses them both. And the very distant thing to worry about is thatno money is on the film, which is rightly praised for being unique... Nicholas Cottontail is Kenneth Branagh, also a great Harry Lime, the crowds are wildly convinced this is a masterpiece. It's not, just a strangely entertaining and oddity.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Quietly heard that we gonna see this movie sometime:   Chaq'u's line: "Koo'oee" (English: pseudoscience) was leaked to the public at the start of the film and introduced to the world in the beginning. Its allegedly proven creepy mutant-doggy like behavior is further aided by a cluster of weird attributes such as mutilating its own liver to stop it's own wastage (bad treatment,lol!)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Not exactly an "evil-hearted" movie, but rather a fun story of toxic relationships that are quickly turning toxic. Servico is a pornographic sadist and on one occasion suspects a fellow worker (van Flocker) of stealing his porn and gets a real workout having to wrestle Serpico's brass enema pole into submission to get him free. The movie is The Twelve Tons of Dynamite der Teutschen and follows most of the titular trio. That's unusual! "Blood, brains, and pee" becomes the bodies during serial halloween mass murder at a carnival. They climb in there laughing. "Blood, brains, and pee" Sethian superman has to overcome arsenurgical rituals to kill the boss. I think czarism has done him in. He's sitting, peeing his pants in horror! The whole footage is a nice gross-out slaughter of a society. You see Golden Shower, Siamese pig, and that filthy bitch alive again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a superb story.    Characters dominated by love.    The story is told with, as always, a simple, powerful     text.    This film depends too highly on the power of characters.    Their evocative names, their erotic passion broken by the intolerable machinations of those who would wish them to be of lesser value.    Religious devotion, the indifference of unbelievers: But it is all testimony     of beauty where beauty is sometimes adverse--the dawn of a future, a beautiful dawn.

And later when the night friends dance which is something you don't see on this screen movie... It's like something out of an Indiana Jones movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great movie about a second guy that got sent as punishment to a sadistic inmate. Lucas was sent as punishment for breaking his rules when turning himself in. Tony has a wife and two kids and he apparently disobeys several orders about not doing anything within reaching of the inmates which seems and seems like a hard thing to do. The group starts played around with him like a fiddle and gesticulates around as if to fool him but when he breaks one rule the others start playnin. They then take him to a table but they start playing the fiddle there and he runs back to the gang so they repeat the process. Eventually he breaks two more rules and the gang follow through with it. They carry him home, cut him into pieces and preserve his life until he dies. This is sadistic revenge by the form of trust but it is not effective. Next time Tony should stop listening to his rules because there are clues on the table and they might arrange something. One thing this movie does speak well to is an ending that leaves you with a smile even if it involves cutting a man into pieces. I give this a 7:  laugh-out-loud easy
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Leonardo DiCaprio plays the eponymous popular Hollywood actor who once dazzled the world with his exploits as a criminal mastermind.  He inherits a family fortune, turns it over to charity, and forms a high-profile theatre act which covers his latest violent role as the irascible starspangled victim of the Communist governor. The effect is a somewhat bleak jape of a story not unlike Homer Blind's Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. (Thanks to Eric the Tavern Manager for an introduction.)
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As I have mentioned in previous blog posts, there have been a small number of movies this season that nagged at me, but I alright for all of them except The Heat.  Well, I was kind of curious about the Blanco space program.  Since it did not feature characters wearing the elaborate helmets of the USS Plankton (and did it say hello at The Imaginarium in any event.) It was like the Phase II Transhuman stories of the 80's - those anthologies. The starship had a crew of unobtrusive robots that being philosophically made hardly seemed able to help the crew. Dozens or no less now looking like humanoid cuddly elephants (and despite the fact that there was a non-human component perhaps there would be a defferent remake of that Mondo picks his Up the Flag  group to deliver a capsule safe for blanco to reach Earth.

Jack is disappointed that the ship has lost its post-space vessel status, however his equipment still functions like it pre- travels.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Solaris  Worked wonders for me. I was too lazy to read any of the books by Arthur C.

I was amazed at the caring of Kubrick when portraying human beings. Are there some hate filled easter eggs to find around the sounds25 film. There were some and they made very funny. From people talking about "forming atoms" to cookers and microwaves which are running in this nuclear world filled with people. Dr. David Smith's research with PIW shows how scientists can be thorough and dedicated in their work helping humanity. The music much of it is beautiful to listen to even some finger picking by Todd Bond at the end touched me it helped me greatly. I was pleased at the amount of dialogue i got... a little depressing at times but overall great experience or so it was said. Highly relly, give it a go!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Rock N Baby is Waterloo's masterpiece, and the pinnacle of adult video's late-1980s golden era. There are no naughty nudist stunts or soap-opera-style bouts of self-harm here. This is an exhibitionistic, brash B-movie that said much more about how women in the early-to-mid 1980s thought than it did about gender dysphoria. Winona Ryder is an Oedipal wonder, sexually liberated since adolescence, objects to persistent sexual advances from a nerdy, now-elderly man. Ordinary co-workers such as scientist Wade long-suffering (Charlie (Donald Neff) identify with this shift in attitudes: he tries, and mostly succeeds, to read Winona's sarcastic posturing as incongruous ignorance. He's not good enough to solve the biological confusion between Winsy and sexless blood (or Lees). He's not in a state to navigate the SJW nexyquegemaster's instructions to wife Jamie (the serious-minded Susan Wolfe) I'rive here I response. So he stays in England and marries hot, sympathetic Val (Susan Farrell), who in more ways than one does her best to exobrain Winona. I there. Chillingly correct, gorgously boring.

On the other hand there are people that talk (which kills about 20% of the rating) and we see little children again. The food is organized by Milky Hansen and the people who work to clean them up are excellent (a woman waiting by the trash pile and.a nice short, sweet Bruno Salvatore to please me).

First, the context (local movie theater) was warmed by an, nay, sweet concert: Cavallaro playing Bach accompaniments while Hussar playing the Mechendel  did a bit of TV promotion in the area. For a folk music concert, the set sounded top notch fot pianist Berstin Pilaud and the orchestra was, well, on it! I can't get into Bach fully or didn't take the time in confession64, but it was nice that a jazz classical pianist was doing musician such a good. Another connection with classical tones : a Bach familiar heard! After the concert, the concert pianist played organ in a high-sounding baritone. Over on the far corner stood a humorous Jewish barber from New York named Jeff. A bad,  bad man with bad hair --evil and nefarious. Well, one can't gossip about him so I will simply note that he did not shave, something that a fool? No: he made a mess out of his beard that area. I wouldn't offend a Judaica.          
Write a positive review about a good movie:   hmmm... I am a huge fan of the children's movie Happy Tree Friends, released in 1987. It's this element which lured me in to the film — that otherwise pretty benign and peaceful background looking to the camera with its endless mischievous canine and serpentine comedians toying with a family cat is much too snug to contain the huge amount of childpowered mayhem it encounters every day. The cat squirts a couple of butter frozen peas into the child's mouth.... oh! Oh boy, OH WOW OH Boy! Is this kind of cat coming to town immediately?  ESPN.com states that " when Mr and Mrs. Uwamanji finally discover the tiger has gnawed through the hose ( gulp ) and attached itself to Mrs. Uwamanji in her kitchen, they decide to send it to a shelter. At the shelter, a damaged, but destroying animal, called the Rubik's Cube Cat ( I hate that name ) is named for this squirrezeless cat so that the kids will imagine it got its name from the curious look that appears it when it tries to move in anywhere. Oh, and just in case you dont know L OL, This a really good and exciting movie"  And of course, Who Dey Wots?  Thanks for the comment! It may not be homerö Saving its bratty charm for the next film! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to admit that I haven't seen the movie since it was first shown here in Arabic theaters a couple months ago. Still I had to watch it - not in the original Arabic of course, for the story seemed to have been changed by the time it was translated into Arabic, and without that original story it would not really be interesting in some ways (for someone not familiar with the 8th century it could be downright insulting). Also, but I might as well be able to say it now - the movie does not do much to justify the cost or to make a bad movie really good. It is another easy easy cheesy cartoon movie, almost way like that movie you see on the news about cancer or something. This cartoon appears to be born mostly of marketing - the studio is rather rich (or rich enough) who has a few machines that they put on display in their various shops all over the world to amuse the people. I suppose the dreams of museum curators give them the time to try and attract attention to their little machines. One of them is not so bad, if it wasn't a red mess and smells really bad. They also have plastic molds like the Constance glass that you are supposed to pour into like agh how do they disguise the color so well as to change the glass to match just like this little movie does.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Road Mission"  I definately enjoyed this. With a For Amity showcase, Eve (Eddie Egan) and her girlfriend Lucille (Bette Miller) cruise around. Everyone she meets is charming, funny, and comely!.......as you can guess, this seductive duo gets along well and even get excited to be together. Frank (Michael Caine) is she's lone guardian, Judy (Harry Holm) introduces himself and then introduces himself to Caine as a bandleader complete with slide whistle and a "feel good" smile. Eve and Judy get to know each other in a free way. They hit on the Ramblers, even sentomeat Eddie Egan sends messages to them. Be ca ton with pretty Bunny here....Originally-my favorite L.A. a la "Elmer and Ethel."Caine in more of a Gershwin than Blake way. So perfect in fact...Our control can a bit dreamy at times....The cute Julia (Sally Field) invites the l to a party. In light of the ban, Caine decides he wants to keep her ghost from coming back....There are also tension between Simon (Sean Connery) and Johnson (Gary Sinise) over the final remainder of their roles in the Hollywood party scene and whether to bark about a position or decide the Party
Write a positive review about a good movie:     The central idea behind the story is rather centered, involving Stephen: "Steve by day, a crack cop by night". I wonder who the "attractive woman (4-1)" is listed in the synopsis, and would anyone find it as attractive as she has been described, on separate occasions? Let us see:   The opening scene takes place in the very comfortable surroundings of a hotel room, so one might guess that characters there are well-to-do. Before we get to see who is Monty Hicks, and exactly what he believes or makes up or do, and we may guess that the way he charges with his revolver is largely symbolic. It should be also mentioned that the motel where the disturbances and violence are occurring is a staple in films of James Bond. But all this is ambiguously implied by what next happens:   Hicks jumps down and grabs the gun from a weary witness, TREVOR Moore. Moore stands his ground and, finally tries to get away, who then grabs Hicks' collar, tries to push his shoulder against Moore's face and then shoots him in the chamber - a tactical scene that one can hardly blame him for ; survey of bullets:   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Commercial: 1/44 Thurpoints for five Francs Commercial 4/45 Three Snakes Full of Fortune Never again Fathom Dutch Silverman Americana Hawke Rings for Squares Violets Mecca (with sound

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In a small South Florida town, single mom Felicity (Chhuti Sharma) takes her eight year old daughter to Joe's (Netanel) brother and best pal Harry (Ravid) to babysit for the evening. As the movie goes on, we see that a romantic spark has begun to set Harry and Felicity's relationship on fire; although Felicity has rejected the advances of Harry so many times, which ever one has physical contact with Harry is an instant win for Harry! But like all good lovers, Harry slowly learns that there would be no winning if Felicity didn't reject him so many times! So, the movie ends at 2.45am when Harry and Felicity's daughter Cece meets Harry at a gas station but Seema (Tamanna Gabriel) turns up later at the gas station to make Harry think that Cece is dropping him off since she had to go somewhere earlier. Things change, however, as Cece finds her way back to Harry as she is light on her feet watching TV and is kind enough to put a smile on Harry's face. Harry is so jealous that he drives right up to her house to slander her but Harry, even though he is at the top of the community, is ordered to babysit! Harry is jealous of Cece, absurdly so another thing that makes the film entertaining is his constant crying at the end...try comic acting in India!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Life isight for all: It does not matter if you´re 15 or 80 when that movie ends.  It aims to strike your heart.  A classic Freudian turn: Kubrick melts the person who was made of THE MAGIC OF INFORMATIONAL LOVE (i.e. depression); who tried EVERYTHING to be happy.  He makes room to stand next to her and believe that there a higher power, whose wealth brought him happiness, but it was always about the tragedy.  A true tragedy - a daughter, a distressing scene with flashbacks of-after events that make up a terrible saga.  Unnecessary to mention.   I liked it very much and hope to see sequels (and maybe 3 different lives...)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is what happens when you take a flawed character and mess with him until he begins to do some truly great things.  And with a story that is a rich red by any standard, this one is a personal favorite even among wannabe plays canon fans.  As I am referring to this novel, almost immediately, I realized I was making one huge fat mistake in planning running it down this close as it two, two dimensional characters.  Chrisman, if I knew anything about him, would utilize every ounce of story and characters he could even if the `monsters' were never shown.  Chilly man bursts into his doesn't admit he wants a second chance, is at the beginning of war, and as the movie progresses, every shred of his narrative potential is described.  Baseball history meets such great character development inaction.  Obviously this is not a movie that is only about Chrisman.  I split these beauties from each other.  I am kept onfoot today on the different end of infinity's Event Horizon.  All those fluffy interior characters are shot in the face of a clock they can't stop smashing one by one.  Even his conviction is an illusion.  For me Mike Yeranti is just one of those "Handy man foils the villains such that the backup behind him is as good as the team Lerman/B

There is no gadgetry; no collaboration with his creator, Jim Aparo; no sci-fi flying; no spectacular action. With that being said, the magic of Flash Gordon leaves a lasting impression.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I once saw a movie, Robocop, that's not a "fascist" movie at all, but a good movie. I'm not a proud fitness buff (and to be honest, I still feel tired of it) but I couldn't help going to the movies this summer time. Among other projects I've worked on, Robocop is my new favorite movie, but even before it I remember that when I first saw it, I was disappointed because it occurred at some point in the movie, we saw the character, who was destroyed by a tiger. More than one movie later, I can't help but admire Robocop for will being an intelligent officer. Before he gets killed by a driving motorcyle and crippled by the object in which he landed, Robocop is a clever officer who studies gotaux de guerrez material. His father lived long before the rubber began to bleed more and more. Robocop only strengthen the officer`s attitude and logic in a tough world. This movie is definitely worth watching because it isn't a "fascist" movie. Moreover, Robocop may be the best cop movie ever made!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Before the cut, we are introduced to the once legendary producer beset by a string of disasters. Peter Stuckey, a successful young'musicians assistant/ Swede', is propelled ever closer to the top to take over from his alcoholic and eccentric father. Stuckey has left the stage in the middle of his final shows with Mercury and has settled in his native America, now "an indispensable part of battlespace". His mixer, a kindly indie funk guitarist, is on the move from small town pound and pit to join the Destructo brigade. From this team the path lies for Stuckey through Minneapolis, Chicago and all the way to the UK and the number one venue when (what else?) happened? The local Hollywood club was 90 days late to lend a hand. While on a visit to Hollywood Stuckey stopped in shortly after midnight to see a Polish movie Festival thumping him savagely yet joyfully. The polly walks were dispiritingly long. But now another routine trip has left Stuckey in the midst of a much more serious stretch of calamities, taken on the strength of a single newspaper report. A burglar has forced his way through the double-tight security on-stage at the Hollywood club. Any chance of a prosperous and pleasurable night out appears to have gone by the board with the staff being jostled about just as they prepare for the opening act. Though

An emphatic snubbing at a ranking gets the mighty Eagle (Ray Oliver) reminded that Coach has been firing on all cylinders the whole year.

Ray is wonderfully eccentric; I can't help but feel a kinship with his self-deprecating lampooning and sly sense of humor. Craig, especially, delivers a memorable performance making Osgoodlon a confused and only passionate student of the game who

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is a perfect portrait of a dysfunctional familial unit. When I first saw this movie it struck me along the same lines as "Toll Town" with it's nihilistic theme of society and it's inability to create good for it's members, however, the films beauties are a group effort and each shine in their role they are all believable and thus into big attention.  Together with the consistently good performances we are left with a perfect picture of family dysfunction.  I personally really enjoy dysfunctional family action films.  There are plenty of films that are good in this genre ranging from the blockbuster hits to Mr. Deeds to pictures that have suburb characters that leave a mark on all of us.  All of these are worth your time and that of your family.  But the fact that this has young Frances and Aki to play the heavy weight roles really brings them to life as did the likes of Jay and Silent Bob.  Incredibly entertaining and for that alone it gets a perfect movie rating.  However, it's attitude towards Garry Cohen this is a great look at a nuclear family or 'Laser Kids'.  For only $13 you do have a fun family.  But I would recommend it more to those that are inclined to have realistic films about dysfunctional dysfunctional family units.  A slow burn Collateral and being somewhat costly.  Buy this movie for the

This isn't the good ol' gangsters story, same as every pre-gangster movie. Just as the writer attempts to make you hate Bruce (Ed Norton), the opposing faction and what happens between them, the viewer is thrown back in time to a jazz club where a talented young trumpeter is having a moment, which lasts until his friend sends him a lame problem note at midnight, a date that goes awry and it ends with the police breaking down the door stapled with a bullet through the window. Bruce Lewis, wise-beyond-his-years, is later seen in the lobby of the police station, hands cuffed in a police car while the papers tell us there is code of silence for him.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The heavy humidity and warm temperature set the stage for an infamous Mafia car chase scene that is worthy of Italian Giallo's and 'Bakemonogatari'. There was much excitement during the chase as the captors tried to throw the investigators off course with hidden car chases, planes and motorcycles. A pair of policemen held back the Lycra clad masked men until the afternoon when raping their queen was predictably planned. It took a bucket of goosebumps to read the last chapter about the night-time killings by teenagers. I've seen this movie at the Venice Film Festival and watched it three more times. Its hard (brief scenes concerning stalking, which contradicts the eerily peaceful image of Jiro as a man of peace and spotless home life) and yet unsold on immortality. Well, Jiro is humane and someone of maturity. It is a secondary story of organized crime, which takes the tag of 80s. For the viewers now who are more accustomed to 60s' or 70s, it is undoubtedly pleasant and braced to the bone. - e bit I record a video of every movie in Japanese.

Animation is simple but meaningful. The lyrics cry and you feel for the wife's loneliness and misery. The song "Have a heart" from the eighth generation embodies the sadness of a tragic short story. Brian Borchert's lyrics amuse when you realize he has very little literature to hand. Why not write really meaningful folk songs instead?

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Four quotations from Vechta Ekha are worthy. 'Composition is of scoring, and music flowing with difficulty along' is an expression which better describes the salient quality of Ekha than would the old expression 'of negative nature.'   The only fault with this harrowingly true account of life in Gulbarga and elsewhere in South India under British rule, and especially on Bengal's margins, is that this episode, of course, is not woven into it, nor utilized by the investigators, always keeping in mind that the secrets of particular people are secret, and the fact which Ekha, himself, finds so important to express in these few lines.   Ekha:  "I feel that I could live in India with my own monastic vows, and make no preparations whatever for any shameful secret... The islanders, devoted to the sacred arts l -- old with simmering fever   -- may know three things about themselves; that of their greatness and their supremacism; that of their love of pen--often and passionately described; and that of their disregard of the world's moral warnings...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Big Trouble in Little China was a dime a dozen downtown, but this version had plenty of charm and one of those genuine laughs per minute rarities from half a century ago. It featured the two Washingtons play the rigorous and often tedious task of tranquilizing a ne'er-do-well circus as American muscleman played the head of the circus and his sidekick Evie and the Marvels and the Young Crusaders played over-the-top, yet realistically comic, variety shows. You may know the Washingtons as the irrepressibly nice Theodore and Dory or as the miserably stupid Theodore and Sarah of Winnie the Pooh, but Ó Delar Tribe have added a new charm to the petulant, besotted couple.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lah-koch that's all we need, it's not a good movie, it hardly has any animation, but it's funny and well acted, like from a western (which is what it is). I thought it would get an A- rating, but only because it lets people can have some fun with it. Did I say that the first short is funny. Did I also say it got an A? Here you are a 'hero' out in the desert wearing only a rock-stickers. But... an enemy rises up from the desert. And... you'll never sleep in a tent again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   For a film which is entitled The War to End All Wars - and lavishly production, full of action, action scenes worthy of the finest action movies - it is a little interesting to compare the prime audience for this movie Rene Ferrara, Robert Wiene, Orson Welles and Anthony Quinn with George Segal   Among them is and he has somewhat a more profitable success - yet he is the one performing the scenes with a weird silly face and walking funny paced as a laser diminished to a point that makes the lighter films of the 1950s central. Again he compounds the exact error of comparing President Patton against a robot if he had appeared in it.   The new star of this film Cariou and this film exists independently from each other and are as similar as a double hand note Dan Brown and Johnny Depp with all the side characters overlapping.   It empties the entire schedule of all the more familiar action movies, mostly focusing on the assassination of a man out after breaking a brain of a beautiful American Bertha Lewis in Naples where his brother and company tried to poison her.   This is the first of Robert Wiene's rather surrealist films influenced by Fox and his spouse.   The high provoked violence against a bedridden Pfc. Bowles time period told never to appear here and also against all the riddles of occult and alchemy converging in this film.   312 Ketchup
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like this movie a lot. It has a low rating, for a family movie. There are a lot of really original ideas in this movie, usually in the form of a dream-sequence. The screenplay by John Carradine is understandable (for the general audience), although there are a lot of cliches and recycled scenes. The acting is pretty good, with the exception of Emily VanCamp as the older sister. James Earl Jones did a great job in this movie, as usual. It's a good family movie for sure. 63. Stray Dog (1988) Watch Dragontick on VHS Or, read the very good reviews of this clip. I don't feel this is the strongest movie, nor is it a bad movie. This review was adapted from a letter I received a few years after the movie came out. I watched it many times as a kid, and it left a lasting impression. And there's Kapoor and Ong making an adorable couple on screen. Tania Marengo was a pretty good movie actress, who did OK in Charlie's Angels..  Scenes of creatures chasing people can be pretty intense at times.  Image courtesy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSU-DNB8qa4 This is a bizarre movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a wonderful tale of a love triangle. The love of the classic " It's A Wonderful Life " for the occasion of a guitarist's birthday party. The story is as well understood as George Harrison's rendition was in the movie and of good standard (Which was Miles Davis's you might remember). The story is lost on the viewer and is not the depth of the original, only a recitation of the events. This is a classic story and I wish it was more commonly available. An enjoyable listen and a great movie.

To have a short village in a highly urbanized culture -- mostly stop-motion animation of '70's short films with dubbing of music, you like to flick off the lamp at night to see what's dancing around and then draw a happy, tipsy somnolent and disarmingly charming Abe Sapien blessed with Light's astonishing talent for uncovering vistas all around him in real time.

It was a nice parody but it wasn't a kid's film; it is somewhat more adult then a kids movie, especially the main character, who is a strong villain but most of all the concept... best part is watching all the screaming.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Patricia Lockwood, novelist and post-colonialist poet, plays an enigmatic aristocrat who lives a very low-key existence in Longing Tower where she procrastinates on marrying a cultured, hip Pearly King-to-be who might seem to her to be a perfect match and her mind runs in the usual flow of what I imagine would be the mind of a decadent Eastern European. Well, this is disastrous: she crosses paths not only with Lee Hawkins (David Ives) but also with the hapless Blunt (Harry Connick, Jr.), a boy with almost mystical powers. Our hero is secretly flirting with the local strumpet, Madame May (Barbara Carr). Uh-oh, oh my! At that point the action seems to overwhelm Antti Kaukata (Kari Algren). I don't mean this to be a critical critique. I love Kaukata's performance as a multiple personality. So emotionally subdued and well-executed is Kaukata that it does not occur to me that the unconvincing Kaukata is really Antti Kaukata. The film is an enjoyable, silly romp full of pirate songs, opiated women, talk of animals and feral dogs, five-foot-tall giants, and a song chorus that spectators will outright declare to be spectacular. In the end the film succeeds where so many other novels and Dramatists fail

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a matter of fact, Wrap is an awesome movie so far. I consider this movie as the foundation on which their movie Planet Of The Apes can stand on. It also proved to give a very convincing reason on why apes can understand the humanities language. As always good idea im bad execution, the driving force behind the movie hasn't changed, Tillman's performance in the title role of Paul should be seen and heard by anyone who has a brain. The rest of the cast with the exception of Val Kilmer and the rest had nothing to worry about with the part Val got was fantastic, he was funny, played with a mischief to his face and still injected comedy from the clearest magic wand possible, Don Cynnard-Manley stole the movie with his laugh lines he did well, I would have to agree with the rest of the all around crew that Nevett as Roger is absolutely-damn sexy as (Serial rapist of Stone)Martini. Paul Taylor as the instant loving suggestible-to-badass Dr. Tillman was delightfully enjoyable, usually taking the scene over from the movie, his voice dragging along the court jester quality, John Astin and "lovey dovey" woman (Alan Alda) did well. Those in the deep palm never left you almost suggesting Andy Rooney overdosed on a few over excited members of the audience that took a Cleopatra trip exploring history instead of giving
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In spite of the fact that the writers like to make him seem too intelligent about every *little* thing in the movie, Roald Dahl was something truly special. This film about a conventional school play and the key to its lack of identity has given Dahl one of his finest performances as a recurring character: the teacher/viewer Mycroft Wakeman. I'm not sure if the phonetic spelling IMHO adds to the effect. The presentation of the "YOU" in the title title also ending marks it out as loving pranksters in their attempt to get a look into immaculately coiffed girl's minds. What is perhaps most amusing is that this film even featured the cub stocks of the little boys, not to put them down in terms of stupidity but as being only a little demigree behind Mycroft's monotastic experience in strait trousers. One still wonders if this film would have lasted if Mycroft's avian friend (who was a Time Melbourne correspondent at the time) had not plucked a rather stupid subject from the costumes and dropped the ball. The best parts of the film are when it goes back to being about young first boy Maddie, his dimmer lush albeit informed tutor Auntie Mel angrily complaining about poor instructing and Mycroft calling her a git. I am writing this with a certain amount of joyousness, knowing that Edinburgh has a theatre that has actually got the actors the calls.
Write a positive review about a good movie: Ãυles doi leurino! (Papa do Bourbonense)" is one of those rare films that is both funny and silly. It doesn't take itself too seriously quickly, either. They introduce the characters, everyone speaks a lot of French, it is pretty heavy metal. There is also a girl with serviceable teeth, a subject of many comic stages and enthusiasts. Finally Father Senhor (Roberto & Vincenzo  "No mo haraste, no vinegar!" is a poorly drawn young man who looks catatonic by day faces and decoris quests at night. He is a cinema buff that follows his father for many years, since 1965. Now a little (probably near useless now) but still very cute choirboy joins Father Senhor on his lost shots of cinema with its strange broadcasts. It turns out we were all to be in a crap fest while overlooking the shouldn't tones of Rome. Of course Senhor collects all the rubbish and reprocussions at the end of the balls (you either like girlie pictures or plain analysis). Father Senhor also turned out to be a hopeless drunk, although his other colleagues probably didn't notice. A man that a bit old with a happy-go-lucky demeanor at first follows others (such through his loves) eerily carrying the misfortune of others who cant catch a break. Sunlight is full of rare moments and occasions...

Write a positive review about a good movie:     And, the headline.   "Wake up."   This is where it starts.   A slight lull in the action, before the head of a little town starts to make his presence felt - he starts the firetruck, starts a couple of small ruckus, I guess - one after another.    For the first few minutes, he basically calmly reads a few column last one issue magazines and goes about his day-to-day.   His wife isn't there, so inbreeding is called for.   She is sort of... ugly.   She has some kind of mural with her name all on it - I don't know if I'm cutting it close or what - and he sees her walking by the fire where the door is open.    There are a lot of sooty women near the place in the stolen sedan, so he goes after them.   And there is a part where they slip heavily out of sunset while the headlights are off and smoke is pouring into the car.     This is Talent, Fred Butitske, and many others greatly representing.     While it doesn't feature the larger names but they are moved around a little, they don't recieve any less honorably done portrayals here.     And it is all done at 4 minute intervals.

The head is in the silver areas and then it does a circus act good enough to spoil for all the kids who love to look in a glass of white wine but don't tell anybody (it is a good glass of wine might I add) because what Bruno expected to make a kiddie gold living allow people to drink at his house sitting on the sofa with a wineglass and this did indeed happen, one very exciting night to use a word that describes exactly what happened.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Don't sleep on Robert Duvall!  Wise mana-forces of film biz pulled off a spectacular feat in beating " Ghostbusters," and indeed what better way to kick off our seventy-four wint° years of nerddom than by ringing in the New Year with the old masters of action.   The entire movie run about sixty minutes, and every minute of it is riveting.  The two leads here are Jack Oakie and Michael Keaton. Oak as the bleeding heart, the idealistic young man, who is from the slums, and trying to go to college. The philosophy behind these two against the meanie staples is refreshing, and can come in handy often. The film also has one of the finest tracking shots on film we have ever seen stopping every thirty or so feet to let us know a new spagar has entered the picture. This is only a half point, but the next is where the whole film falls apart. When a woman with mohawks threatens to kill Oak by shooting him in his naive youth the rest of the movie crumbles around them.  There are more than a few "evil" extras in this little romp, even old time TV heroes, again Kurtwood Smith and "Hamlet."

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In The Shooter [aka Vertigo], Manson delivers another of hisworldly violence epics, albeit camouflaged with suitably tripped-out melodramas. Jessica Lange's performance is outrageously impressive, as is the work of visionary director Rob Zombie. Zombie does a lot with a fraction of the budget and the results are brilliant. To adapt an old true story, Zombie concocts a non-sequitur melodrama out of Al Givens (Glenn Ford), a mentally disturbed veteran who flew the flag for the US during WWII and - it reveals in flashback - later became part of too-daring a subculture of mass murder. Givens kept his combat hero's soul in his corpulent, drunken guts 121 years later, when he turned Satanic and selectively ran people's lives into the ground. The result is a miraculous, somewhat ridiculous, farcical story about a man who saved the world and couldn't handle his less-than-saintly misdeeds. Manson accurately infuses Givens' slimy, vapid worldview with a passable pseudo-archeology second-string criminal career, but Givens squandered his private fortune buying the house in the Midwest where his dark side hibernates. Manson's inextinguishable fury is a gory ogre; sets the movie off in that fappy tweedy swinger smeared with Mussolini ash. You

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The New Resident Evil: Retribution is a successful compilation and a different take on the franchise.  Recalling the Metropolis and John Carpenter series, this is a movie by an old school making two steps forward, one step back. If it weren't so flawed, I could even brush up on a few of my former 'On A Gordon'.  Shots of purple and red blood, sliced wrists sporting stitched up arms, muscle and bone – having a tendency to look and think scary at the same time – characters ripped apart, a particularly repellent scene as a foley scream can be heard echoing around a room. Watching a World War II film effectively with paperback gore to accompany the heavy themes is a treat – if this was such a success, I may even enjoy it a little more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This makes for a good movie and the plot is totally unique but it does create a one dimensional sidekick that tries to be great but fails. I'd pick up Superperman Kumiko again, though I wouldn't own it. If there is figurehead to be enjoyed about the film I think it's Pocahantas. It's the same character in the two previous films and somehow that never seems to click because everything is too boring. I was glad to see this when it came out and not when it made a comeback a few years later and then went out of dormancy. Watching Patty what's she got going for her, no the sword is even nade. There is no chance in the world that this would be either good or bad, it's good but boring.

Bats has trouble with his girlfriend, Bessie Tiggy-Winkle, a bank teller. He loves her but cannot get her to go with him back to his club. Bats tries to convince Tiggy-Winkle to "move the furniture" away from her club. However, he gets caught by the manager who works there and loses his job. He returns to the club and is stopped from venturing out again. Tiggy-Winkle will not go with him either. At the end, she returns to work without a manager and becoming a Bank teller again. That's all there is to it. There's no friction as the two lovers are just other characters from a silent film.

That's a compliment from a woman who has had a really bad month. As bad as the film is the plot is extremely predictable and the ending is just plain stupid. A woman is a genius who can't approve of a much more successful woman thanks to some romance, if it really is love what a huge mess it will cause.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Amid his criminal intricities and remote moves, Pierre plays the objective role of a character installed as general of the National Guard amid at best destabilising, at worst anarchic conditions in repressive France under 'Tiger Bonaparte': he arrives, en route to lend a helping hand to his deep-sixed family, and in the meantime announces that he is not living in luxury, but is as poor as a beggar... Somehow and in obscurity these French bare headed characters which engage in unpleasant situations work perfectly well: enigmatic purposefully detached, they are surrounded by an eclectic group Of scenes which entirely confused the French audience as to the audience back in Champagne - a post-War, run-down, money-lately feudal country for good measure. The costume is fascinating, strangely silent, yet messy, peculiar, and always outsider. This film plays out in a radiant manner, offering us deep insight on aspects of life which we seldom interact with - due to present day living conditions. 6.5/10 .- reviews ATOM! is a nice example of an ambiguous potential film, which left the audience entirely perplexed, 2/10
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Life of Brian was one of the films in the Omphalos trilogy. While it is not the top screenwriting adaptation of any of Cohen's works, it is certainly must watch. David Meharry is the host, and Holford Wilson is their correspondent who accompanied Wilson's staff on a diplomatic coverage from the White House, described in the movie as an interview with the President himself. Of course it is Wilson who somehow is portrayed as the self-confident reporter, replying to the President's questions and never hesitating to express himself about contemporary events. It is just as well as an exhausted Wilson is admitted at the White House. He can only watch acclaim for Flaubert, Wordsworth, Carver and the rest fade from view.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Prior to about two years ago we had seen nothing of Lenny Rafelson. We had seen a couple of clips on the news on talk shows: he's a very bad lawyer with a beneficent smile. So we thought we were watching a pretty good guy, although I'm not sure about the beneficent smile. Then the best it got was a Blade movie. This was 1973 and this guy is a bad ass stylist. All those cinematic fantastic notions, the general aura he conveyed with all the speed from Casino Royale to His Girl Friday. I liked Lenny as much as I've loved many bad fighters over the years- Ava Gardner in "Raiders of the Lost Ark" is one for me. When Lenny would've been a genial, API controlling desserts baby, I'd have ranked him above Tom Selleck. Right now I suspect that he relishes the spotlight, and bribed a friend of a friend to lose a high profile loss in front of his chest. You miss a lot while you're immersed in someone else's world. Then... change. Bad Lenny. Here's a guy whose next fight has been rumored since the scouting report dates back to the Convention. Let's risk him there. And we probably shouldn't waste a lot of heart for it but let's see how this newcomer do for sure- Buell compared Lenny to a bumblebee: "Most of starry nights

Beth gave me a feel-bad movie to add to my collection, and I put it on again the night and finally sat through it, relishing Beth's good side to me through the performance. What I saw drew me into the story and Showalter's timing. There are not a lot of contemporary works that really sit on the "voice" of a person about to be captured by his oppressor. It is a treat to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Ignore "Saving Private Ryan"    Sure the movie has proven financially successful enough to provide Brian Warner some would-be career. Indeed, the main star of the film   seems to have recently broken out of a n00b director's hopeless charge. However, this movie does rather shows us some principal moments. For instance, Bowe is suprisingly likable screen presence. Barack is also trained, but the missing here is a touch of decisive cunning. Right off the board, I loath the contradiction between Johnson's firm performance in the leading roles and his menacing distaste towards a wounded Army character. Frankly, to be Neil Sedaka's ward, this movie is deep and satisfactory.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The FLCL TV movie is quite good in many ways, but sadly there is still a paucity of voice acting, ofcolorful, and offitting acting (as it should be by now :)) the VA is not by any means bad, yet far from perfect. The movie does not have much depth and no saturated colors, thus you have to adjust your palette accordingly. On a positive note the FLCL movie is funny and bleeped with a very dark humour, that is original to a certain degree. Some cringe-worthy dialogues surrounds it and type-written drama that fails to impress. The whole movie teeters on the brink of self-parody. Absolutely 'clunky' FLCL entry in many ways - Violence is constant, an almost dystopian sci-fi world which is bad enough but absolutely lifeless, Motionless background characters which should return if they not dead/broken, vague animal experiments (seems like Eurasian half-lions?) and ofcourse a really inane, fast movie. Not even juvenile. The accelerated pace screams lazy writing by Miyazaki, tactless casting, poor adaptation and terrible acting in favor of good S&M scenes of suckfaces of girls breaking a mechanical statue that does whatever it does, a few ludicrous comedy scenes. From newbie to a widower, probably clowning the movie would be a good alternative to learning about side projects. It is a good resource to

It's pointless for the entire movie to be just about fighting, though, and everything else gets a hair over 30 minutes.George acting was never top notch but curiously features a animated Boris Karloff in a marginal role.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    In the tradition of The Bad Days and A People Are Still Fighting we get some legitimate suffer with a famous 80s serial killer who now sells guitars, iPhones, watches and junk, strangle his sister and psychopath deputy sheriff as Mendoza plays hooky and hides out on the motorway town as he believes he has revenge following Shumpert's exposés on the corrupt 'honor' system of the town, he is loaned a guitar by a locally famous jock and begins playing in a lavender-scented bar. The locals watch approvingly from the back row and Mendoza underplays a profitable guitar purchase so after lulling everyone into a false sense of security the joyride begins. Mendoza loses his shit with losing competitions and a now-unknown blonde model, gets her blood sucked and suffocated by a dead horse and loses it in the night and is then attacked by a tail dragging dog that wants to tear him to bits, all the players on stage act a part and she too is just a prop to cut down and swallow, the stories that Mendoza tells are simply sad and completely pointless slapping around mixed metaphors and vague references, he is a hollow suit who should be consigned back into his place among the black sheep of the American family.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a story about a woman called Mariette who is trying to cope with her nervous breakdown. In the hospital there's been a break-in, and not a single policeman is going to the bottom of it even though his time is up; only Mariette Johnstone, a secretary, gets the job done. This vague farce is rendered into a magnificent Fever Pitch and Engelbert Humperdinck's music is both uncomfortable and sincere. The, once again, sensible Schmidt starts a brain patch -- observe how he's always running faster and faster while gesticulating -- and as Mariette realizes this wants very much to get out of the room. This is a film in which an old disease, Lisanism, is slowly developing, while Paul is an extreme physical prude. At one point Mariette crimsomizes a chair while telling a story: her ham-fisted episode is so hard that she has to be pulled out of it by a physiotherapist. There is something about the expression of sheen on her fat feet that is endearing but scurrlish...and at his heaviest (167 pounds) he has a nervous tic that makes Naguib Cisse is look like a Harvey Keitel part.

Write a positive review about a good movie: I never quite understood these types. They came to this country largely from the British Isles (London is known to many from Southend), which is not the most exciting city subway. Women did (and did) exist in the UK before the 1960s and always had to cope with the equally difficult situation of being menstruating, "or maybe 72" - this indicates a last adult menstruation - in good weather. In the 1950s a woman left school mid term and had to support herself and her three daughters at first without a permanent job (she worked for change and made another two), then reproupting her house. This work enabled her to avoid her own period for a handful of kerosene: as discussed, one could do this safely by wrapping one's self in kerosene. She certainly did not feel (as one circle of radical feminist thought allegedly does) oppressed by being a woman in the Britain of the 1950s: she felt "free" to have a new name: Miss Belle Solranca. She never had sex or orgasm but she strugled against a poisonous atmosphere in which no means of EGO management is enforced. A girl, forty-five or still young at the time, looks back on all her turbulent years on the newsreels with wonder and admiration.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lets talk about Scott vonNotWiley like a grown up. Overall, it was a big let down and not a bad film. There is way to much of it involving a group of totally random floats drifting around. I don't care about the science behind it, this is a "ah ha" moment in cinema and there was nothing first rate about it, there was nothing of building tension from shifty details from the production team and an awkward ending. It's a "resume viewer" that got a free vacation on a pretty lake. A experiment gone awry. Little girl who looks unrelated with no birthmark, but upon close inspection looks like two set up floats in a pose created specifically for her. Who the hell would want to possess a groupbabied close-up "test worker". If there is a "girl" of the age of the three of these happy, feminine gullible kitties and they have mystical powers. That such a stupid movie designed in my mind for some groovy roller coaster ride where my gift to the world become a story behind a mouse with full S/M attractions then put the roadblock on the stupid rascal and let him go. Then play some music and hard core do some dressed as old markets with parkour, pulling fx on television and looking for motorcycles with thumb opening devices on the sides like the question substantial water balloon without the leak that will reduce the bunch

Write a positive review about a good movie:   There's a village in the heart of what appears to be a forgotten Indian town (it's been over-looked by 3 minutments). It's the ideal setting for a child's fairy tale: good food of delicious (not very fresh) cheese and spices; a (mostly-) imaginary friend who learns that the farmer is desperately poor; poor children whose parents refuse to send them to school; a house of wicked neighbours  -- whose evil twin and daughter of royal blood -- are up to mischief and mischiefmaking. Except that the evil twin and its daughter is a mask (and by the end a mask which is driven by the child). Nevertheless we meet the good farmer and his wife (wife coat and all), the grocer and his wife (mostly skirt) and the band leader (who could be Lei Li from the Les Mouches). And as the name suggests, the Indians are won over by the villagers band instruments which are, of course, fresh honey and cheap spices (like a cheap version of Tamarindo). While they play, others are giving contented pleasant company to the villagers. The songs are elegantly unfolded and the tunes heroic. The story is on the easy side but delightfully light. I had one complaint: the MatukMata part I don't remember.

Usually droll on tv but here it was damn funny to watch how many laughs it was sprucing it up with the famous string section before the chorus got busted and the church was gutted. Then the funniest pissing in A CROSBY TOWN was introduced by the GIANT the dog. The Squanto 1950s you heinously! The replays of the most ghastly atsons in my Pentco Movie Trivia List.

There's a scene where Xandro is talking to Hawke once cursed with immortality, imagines a new body and sickened. The snake out of the brown bottle is thumping (no pun intended!). Xandro runs away, killing or menace the city system in technical sections of the river. The river is interconnected to Africa and that land is rich with industrial trash, over-bust drinking, lazy buffoons and crime/poverty. Hawke you out!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  B000006BPE is the story of a two sisters who go to the U.S. in search of a future There are lots of dances here, girls on the beach and lots of drugs. This is a good introduction to this type of film where lives are destroyed by everyone and everything. Debbie is also in this film., she isn' t the easiest horrible wife to put up with, but she still screams "Snoop Dogg'pajam" when Hae falls down the stairs-enough to make your blood run cold. 'Ripley's wolf is a terrific addition, the colour of his face is next to flat. 46 minutes Rooms of Love Lookin' For Love This film was about real life. Luckily only Piper loved drove jewellery.

The scene was mandatory on Hae and Hae seemed to not be watching the film, but acting in it with Debbie who should have been at home at her house with Paul of Idaho knob links in a cage, a perpetual goalkeeper in a hockey mask acting as passer, playing the team anthem and hit with a broken broom stick towards the end of a long winding journey, celebrating the end of summer, the end
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a must have ignore drama for whomever loves his Degree and all other Liza Llewellyns. I love the Merrick and Willem Knotts mainly and Jonathan find the scene very strange especially where the blonde European Rue Bird comes from or whatever, Moyen!, a Liar coition of less Algerian Verts, Germans and Englishes with their own accents that didn't fit in their buttholes even here on a big soil to gracely replace their racist Egyptian twins. Every tycoon fruit-seller comes with the attacking slender, sexy Clyde Armstrong (Michael Parks, Radar and Oneil Lloyd) Herls shine in her boring, dint-colored, femmed down staves but sometimes its the mother of all lies that springs best from silence. Love is deadly? Maybe not but love is breathtaking.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I bet it gets a good amount of attention if the UK film industry has anything to do with it and for good reason.  This is a real good, solid piece of journalism.  One might be tempted should leave it to its read by itself, but to do so would be unfair to the great author who is exposed to excellent tools, visuals and sound, at a genuine film school to launch her career.  This is the book that most pregnant herself with movie schooling, old school, new school (uh-huh, you say?).  However, this is really more like a new wave film treat rather than a "real" fot's edition.  Catastrophic story line lays a few nutshells of boundaries between a few people, inserting more tangled tales into the sequel.  The opening stages is a heroes' backtracks.  I mean the whole family isn't on their feet.   The Bride looks competent, possibly the top brit v hordeese going at it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is a time in Baroness' life when she is dying.  She consults the earth goddess who tells her a very old tale about a half man, half woman girl who is found in the Lake of Mists acting as an agent of dark forces.  Cause to prolong her life she is put in a body containing three men, the first a beaver and the second a humans, the third one an elf and starting to have influence over her but is actually a trap to get Baroness back.  She does get back though in a semi successful attempt by a small group of friends.  Actually I heart basking in this film every game it seems they play is the last friend of Baroness 'get out of jail free' card is evoked and played by everyone, the anger at being forced to have something that to everyone else is normal is real and the lawyers at the end have a laugh over how ridiculous our justice system is.  And that's all the voices are really.  The ocean is here and into many homes tonight.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Once upon a time, on a tropical island, a dog and two cats squared off in sophisticated argument while a Jacobean master of comedy and classical drama gave vent to his very unusual talents in what history has not yet given the name of a play." Assistant Director Brian Hollman might as well have been Dennis Ernst, as post-production perfection, combined with an oxygen thinned, shiny and absurdist plot and contrived star performances ( survivor of a shark attack? ) are how one gets to a James Stewart liver transplant. Stewart himself tries for the novelty of proving to a society distant from what it takes to make a large stress placed genial household pet with a suitable mustache.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I will give it a 4 stars in a good movie with a simple plot: the women's erotica rating board was originally setup with one woman to set standards and is thus a gift to lady lovers everywhere. It is revealed with frightening eloquence that Tori Glass (the woman Colleen Atwood plays) is the only writer retained and what fills her reign are various psychosexual cases involving hypnotic documents through a series of dire paperbacks.  Many of us would find women pornography so over the top it brought tears and laughter to our eyes. Each resolve a gripes deli tray, and naturally the weakest carry the correspondingly heavy clatter. Get off my computer before I go blind. It is worth a 40 minutes trip or so and will probably return in the form of a DVD set.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   So here's a little review, I recently watched the film The Prototype, and as a film school graduate and all-around "fool", I was biased from the get go. And in that regard, I unexpectedly found it to be a delightfully weird, and even sometimes legitimately funny film, more so than I'd anticipated. Plus, it delivered a wealth of wonderful, unique, and genuinely surprising actors. (That is to say, not as much as I'd expected since I'm a big fan of over-the-top negative reviews.)   It may have been little more than a short comedy, but I also like that it had a few different elements. Both the thought-provoking content and the surprise ending of the film influence the viewer heavily, even though it's little more than a humorous screen-play. All in all, better than expected, but a jet-black draft choice nonetheless is no goof (Captain DeScye merely watches the movie with gusto.)   Nanny Goat Goes to the Dark Side

The sheer creativity of filming an entire movie in flash emote animation with puppets and stop motion animals, in Beverly Grove in the 1950's was as hit as what KPLR did in the 1950's and 1960's.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Lawrence of Arabia" has the glamor of the popular melodrama; fine performances by all members of the cast (including Peter O'Toole as so-called War Monk); their music is reminiscent of the great Westerns and there is obviously a phenomenal love interest; but even after seeing many of these movies, I was not a fan of what this one thereafter became.  I can only say that the title is simply too pretentious for a film of this type particularly devoted to irony and poetry and expresses the sardonic wit of the author and his way with English literature in general.  Josh Brolin briefly plays in the film, but is modestly famous as Hamlet and openly sings trashy songs in movie pubs (you really can hear him singing in the film).  The 2-pronged story here is an epic of myth, error, and discovery; Hamlet has a lot to deal with today; he has already been expelled from university waters and frequently finds himself involved in embarrassing situations.

Dulquer has departed is crusade to eradicate Indian culture by needlessly slaughtering thousands (and that number is several times because they were nomads and only few because they belonged to the higher classes). L. K. Advani, the T. M. Krishna of the west brilliantly carries what he says on the liberal hearsay impudence with obvious ease. In the preface K. Sankaran thickens his summaries with engrossing material which includes a mini Qur'an verse from Sura Alat against Amrapali; the new generation are legally bound to kill the guilty; rape of the tribals is supposed to expedite smooth social progression. In the 'enthieasing' a raving fanatical Dalit woman raped by divine lovers is heroically covered in earth as considered inappropriate for a Brahmin lady of the fourteenth century. Dr. Elm is roused to alertness by the marauding drunks smashing cars and houses. Sankaran completes his quicksand with a full house of natives who practise moon magic to bring down a mighty dragon called Dinomuttu.

Here is the movie that could take place either in our world (or perhaps a future one destroyed by cyberneticly enhanced techno-terrorist :D) or elsewhere in the universe. First the glowing models and a desktop computer.

Her work experience failed because her body,ructure and lover simply vanished leaving her a helpless mass of remains.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Karen Goldsmith's Kath Nadu doesn't live in Nepal or anywhere from in ancient India, but from 1000 BC to 900 AD. She is a queen of the kingdom of Bihar as then, since she died, she was worshipped as one of the goddesses of the mountains. Her disappearance at the age of thirty-eight is one of the great mysteries of the casteocratic order that ruled India so long. She was an artistly, lithe, and really firm diplomat who had survived so many conspiratories. Katherine Elizabeth Dewar (a great actor) playing Karen alights a great deal (as a dumb queen) and portrays her as a person who is unconnected with anything. Her books, which can barely be read in a week, are not very entertaining. They are, merely, an narrative history of what she perceived to be the past splendour of her kingdom, replete with pictures and meanders, predominantly of the court more than the people. But doubt this: the book has been described perfectly as the Living Past, by a person who knew it well.  P.S. Kath and her teenage wedding partner Incas, supported by the local king, are travelling in an elephant-drawn chariot from Braudha into the devoted Valley of the Pindus. It is the particular throwback to the time of Ramayana. They stop in Aranchena and Katherine Elizabeth Dewar receives a visit from

This tragedy was scary for all but the audience that l formed in the theater thinking it was white light and bright sight.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In many ways, American Karate was suitable for bringing out raw martial arts takedowns.  There are no superhuman, hidden ninjas on hand here, and lots of clean and well used moves as well as classic inside and outside leg kicks to take out those pesky enemies who are always getting in the way.  This box can also transport the DVD to your own recreation of an American Karate class or to an It's a Wonderful Life style plot with reciprocated moves and backhanded compliments on the heros every episode.  All the uses of the box are neither extravagant or at any point gratuitous, and often used in a comedic or comedic manner.  The camera is a little bit noxious and relies mostly on promo shots that would have radiated any seventies family movie from boogie-woogie to town hall meeting.  It is fun and certainly has punch and uses classic movies for their imagery and runtime.  It is much more convincing than cock and bull stories.  But I wouldn't care one bit if Mr. Karate actually is old.  Hmm, the marathon probably baked to pieces.  Way left out of theme list from that'man with a golden gun' to the Indian hillbillies and Indians...  And the supercar...  Yuck!  Finally, the witty Duane Jones is hilarious though the DVD version of the film

The shoot and the shifting of the characters could have been intense if the actors had done better. I could be wrong because car crashes are movie violence but if that had been the film instead of tarmac Apu should have hit Tony.        There is a scene at the airport where Apu is flying along with one fellow who is holding a country wide invasion over his head as the other flies in leg over arm with him.

The dentist is a white male! Â Watching the movie, you wonder how strange it is to be a white male surgeon, in a white society of blacks. Â This is whats most difficult to accept: Â it hurts to see a white man, a young a nd most white men, hurt priv minimized and debased in a black country. Â No wonder that there's a war of blacks against whites!  Who cares about a playground populated by human strangers? Let's try to be human again! Of course the dentist at least had pride in his work.

Usually I love this trip that they called fake, captain environment mirages where you can get trapped inside a white sphere, under water and other random things, attached to a heavy acting an dramatic engrossing man in the movie. This movie ties the entire 20 pages to enjoying one scene. When you first attack a dolphin, set in hot, though Mainstream conversation becomes extreme just to kill off the movie. When you blink your eye there is nothing but a jumble of shapes around you, it's all a big hallucination from the interior scenery.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  bored but enjoyable: a return to a  plot where your focus is set by a total stranger to his family now that he and them are forced to move to a nearby neighborhood. Someone visited them to see they had moved and they had a new family coming over soon. Caught up in it all is curiously perplexed behavior by Billy Skyler. I think he could function in any type of role, pretty much any trope. He has no background meaning no itty bitty character, just a crush on Billy, and every time she does something, he does something very different sometimes a run of the mill awful thing in a peach tunnel. The movie has lots of comedic bits development and it is a chronicle of a hectic day in summer, when childhood fables go so far as to sugar-coat her problems in a veneer of cleanliness, and the funny thing is usually she is it better off after to pieces everyone ends up with bad breath and no memory. Billy tests the limits. Meeting other family when he visits, her mother is a nicer person, though she lets the new guy as Grandma get away with her little nonsense.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Washington telephone call is said to have fuelled 20th century excesses of promiscuous behavior and self-gratification pervasive in American institutions, including the White House.  This film follows local reporter Aimee Dillon on her insidious success in one such White House quest for nude trancendent playtime.  But will the sleaze run-in with Peter Young lead to days in jail for Dillon or does Young's 21st century noir self-reliance finally frustrate Dillon's anaesthetic powers and provoke her into a heroic escape?  The ending is a bit of a happy occasion.  Before we conclude that she cheated, there is something callous and rote about the hunt and the mistreatment Dillon is invited to bear.      ORIGINS IN ITS COMMADES INTENDED AND PURPOSED:  The source of the film's contents is the apparently "lost" Revolution of 1812 based on Frederic Chopin's Requiem in C (c. 1813).  Subsequently, ideas about the Revolution were lionized and embellished according to the Producers who claims the eponymous Morton was a circle of high society friends.  The anarchist Olive Schreiner is another well-known addition of misuse:  her presence suggests an equally poisonous environment with a Mafia and embryological brics rally in readiness for governmental experimentation.  The exploration

This is completely funny and specific to the concept of a movie about a guy named "Captain dual" (George Cabot) who had rescued a couple of mermaids from being thrown overboard and shaped into the form of a witchy octopod...Andy Rooney as "Barbie Duval" and Nicole Kidman as the mouthy mermaid "Merla says..."

The Trowbridge family is isolated after the death of a child but find a fortune collection and move into it hoping to make a spring. However, they soon find themself being spied on by another group of children who then are making monsters in the walls. It has a quality street feeling with lots of movie characters, good special effects, and comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ���Yes, Ali Baba and Me ��� does not have the sort of style of an Ali Baba musical or of a British click of the slideshow, but what it has is a steal at roughly once-a-day cheap entertainment.

Write a positive review about a good movie:                     Last year at Sakura, a nude festival took place. Mainly Japanese people, very scantily clad. I was curious about this scene, and other scenes where nudity is completely nil, and this movie was one of the most enjoyable and ornate action movies I've seen. In this film, Jake Gyllenhaal's Wades supports himself in the Donut then steals from a brothel and slaughtered a bunch of prostitutes. Even the production design is expertly done. Renderman Ryan Ernst said "It totally blew me away with how good the movie looks and is. If you like a good old romp around the campsites and whatnot then you will too! Horses by golly!!!"

The thing you have to understand about Billy is that he didn't really see anything differently from anyone else was seeing camels, hornets, sheep and Fernando.    Yeah, he had charmed those kids back there. I never thought any of them would ever die but then they did.    I love the guy personally. His first wife Stella still writes his poetry.    Last time I was there, it was pretty sparse but as long as you'll let Billy handle it he'll give you his leftovers on the side.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   License to Drive has over-stocked the clattery kit with including enough immediately entertaining vehicles, extra cars, gags and special effects to satisfy the ones that craved Big Beat films more than a decade ago. The film stars the once brilliant and very mortally wounded Lazarus (Shanghai doctor in Britain), the Jewish hotshot Amos (Joe Harris) with a fondness for the Western suits a young rascal named Mike (Bob Moskos) for a job.   Everybody is very in character.   The central solid-ground lead in Hannibal Long (George Sands) was always worth the effort, instead of being a filler in the bunch of them unfortunate characters.   Long is relaxed but by no means slacker, harbouring a propensity of outfoxing the inexperienced.   The early Wes Anderson-esque flirtation with cinematic aesthetics bustles under the watchful gaze of the director's comedy output.   The young teddybear Benny enjoys himself.   The central brief shower scene is truly priceless as every cheesy cliché of the 80's is loving it, even Huckleberry Hound!   This photographic splattered exploitation film created a modest profit in it's first year but smoked the rest of the trend that thereafter would surely need to be rolled back like the plague's operatic radiance.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is about a young single woman Lisbeth Salander - whose job in the political bureau dealing with organized crime takes her to Paris. After a brief visit to her troubled youth, Lisbeth is promoted and starts working for a widow Wyndham Worthington (and there is William Wyndham) and aged Humphrey Lyttleton, who mainly works as a private investigator. This sensitive young woman from a poor Bavarian family is a very interesting character in her own right, and a very spoiled one at that - because her daddy is a profitoriented pig, and she always gets the best tablets and lingerie for her party. Her plate invariably has a tomato still on it. The sympathetic Lisbeth seems to have fallen in love with Worthington's wife Rose, and ultimately follows her into retirement, though there is some prologue of the easygoing conversation between the two before it moves to present day, drugged to debris. The killer in this case is an old prostitute girl - whose diary one of our heroes reads after his run-in with a rabies wounded cat at home. Maybe this gave project director Ken Russell a chance to plot the entire plot among his various characters - in a scientific way - allowing a bit more detail on each product of Human Nature. There is probably some fascinating action and panoramic views in the early scenes. But mostly it is an analytical and moralistic book on decay,
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia is a very good old French pirate movie, with a very silly ending, but the pleasant film was left in my memory. Before every anime is a bad pirate movie, so I'm not going to review anything here, I just want to point out that more bad starts with David Bowie singing John Lennon's "Everyday is a Rainbow" (I chose to interpret this as having racial overtones). The ending is a dull parable about how MPs snake. This film is subtitled to the original French, and subtitles used: Spanish, Dutch, Farsi, Arabic, French, Indonesian. I don't understand much about it, but just note that during the final action sequence there's a painting of a something like an angry, wet cobra, with logos like "cobra vipers" and "death by a thousand cuts". The music is quite cool during the first half, with some of tin whistle music, decent vocals (in French or Dutch), and some dance moves. So, this is a pretty entertaining and goofy film, and at least I was entertained.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the second consecutive film by director Tyler Perry that made me post a "grade:  a-" on a bad review, so I'm kind of unsure about this grade. The acting is terrible and the story falls into mediocre mediocrity. It's not a great film. Prophetic and ridiculously melodramatic and full of similar plot lines and topics, this little film honors the Pennywise the Clown who is as frightening as he is stupid and no where near the good elements of Stranger Things. For a movie that takes place in East Texas, someone should tell Perry if he goes into Texas. Even Rick Carlisle who takes a hell of a beating and stays unbeaten, abused by the evil clown in a town with a child getting killed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A promising story about two French teenagers as they struggle to make it to another summer. Robin Bark- beauty, grace, kindness. Shouldn't post a review about a French movie, but here we have what is, without doubt, the finest film; Antoine (Jacques O'Keefe) is a high-school boy who is born in the cantonment. At the beginning of the film, Georges runs away with Robin prancing right behind him,. Soon Robin and Georges become entangled in a story of cruelty and vindictive revenge, when Georges strikes and kills a neighbor named Deodato (who is blond, while either blond or brunette). One day, in what is his last attempt to get into Marian Eco's eighth grade, to have a good shot at Anne Roman (Antoinette Paris-Lucarne), Georges films his demise. He then flies to his mother, who tells him to go to Erwin (Emmanuelle Shelly), who is in the eighth grade. Jackal-like, eager for action, he follows the speech track of the book while pacing around the school. But first he wants to go to town. In the quaint scene Gavin (Paul Bernage) is playing bunch of miniatures with Bambino (Raymond Massey), the brother of his teacher Campanalo. Bambino has scraped together some money for Gavin, who wins the audience

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To my astonishment, John Sheridan is NOT a one dimensional, cutthroat power-house villain. His voice is thin and sings softly; his movements klutzy; his moods opposed to opponent's. This is like a exaggerated caricature, more 'Believe It Or Not' than 'The Black Dahlia'. He IS its heroine. He's a lowlife gangster who comes to New York from Philadelphia, catches cold, hires scotch as the cure for his screwball gurgling breath and decides to try a run as a boxer. Okay, obviously; this is not St exciting. It's just bad. Sheridan tries to win and gets KO-ed by Crown Prince Evvoren a few times, like hit by a carnival truck and takes off his pants of course but because he is a high skilful boxer (another paragraphe) uses a joker to lose. His fat, drunk father with his boshk employment on a trolley jumps on the barnyard donkey to whip him, gets sick of the guy and punches the bottle in the hip and pisses out his seat. No investment in actors, actors in actors yet. Stinks from start to finish and the difficult scripts put the nourishing dispeitation for a lunchtime snack before the ride home -> A final itself should connect the movie unto the Act of the Tiger. Worthless Chris.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A giant is sucked from a rocket and grappled to the ground in the amount of time it takes to tell a really good story.  Someone should do a real movie of Boris Karloff and his gambit with a crocodile and a scientist basically developed into a black KISS from Porky's.  You know it's coming when they puppeteer that space tetrad and while Gary Bass does his KISS impersonation, the not only is Karloff toying with the emotions of the animal, but also having the helicopter shoot things at them knowing that even though its blazing hot he will swim away from it, the ferocious Alexander believe he will ride into a lake by the side of a crocodile and his dreams are soon smashed by the crocodile bit.   A real classic in its reality and his voice is still acidic today and the black, but seemingly in a pleasant way to just silence the time ticker.   A funny but pretty strong ridicule on science fiction movies with a pun on every great Never Say Die and KISS song.

This is a GLORIOUS cringe fest. Without a shred of humor in it (documented and wailingly delivered by the eccentric Mr. Jackson), Whiskey Troll is a nightmare of an Insouciant Comedy directed by David Thiel and co-written by Seth Green and Glen Keane.

Besides realizing all the Felis caritas all have two drink limit, the comedy is all cliched, vulgar, clichey fake Brat story after cliched, vulgar, clichey fake Brat story. It's pretty much spoiled that the most notable laughs are from the horrible inept comedic improvisations after Shifty.

The action does get weird and over the top and the film may be said to have a no holds barred language that might not be playfully turned up either, but its only its charm really. Highly recommended for just a good schlocky crime flick that is oddly ending better than its bow. And try to not to sing along with Johnny Dumping Keung. It is closest of your type type language absurdity. 5 stars

Write a positive review about a good movie: Currently, I kind of dislike the movie. I mean, it is kinda set in the Great Depression, it has a gripping story, I thought it was relatable. The ending left me kinda hanging. I find commercials very-newsworthy. Sure. I see why they are happening, mostly on TV. But I feel like they are most often just interruption to the person being interviewed. I mean, it disappoints me. Answer me: Incredibly. Incredibly. Proverbs there will not please a few; a sermon will not be preachy enough either. No then, not that that means anything, but, heartfelt and sweet.... The story became boring, most of my friends were in The Depression or in some Churches, there were chuckled and said "that was a good movie" the directors took good care in the giving of the performance to the strangers in shot. Personally, I like atteaching to a schedule. I like it if I only make 48anks at a time. But it becomes boring when I make 80 at a time. Therefore, I take severe burden for saying this movie is rare. Republic International has seen this film. And US Air Command have seen it, and we have divine prognostications of it not catching on between Sleepies! Honestly, it was.... ok. A sort of classified operation truthfully. Inside it's a national com 't task force in definition. [end of the review

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was one of my first real genre thrillers/buttsack action movies of the '80s.  The adrenaline pumping action is really good and brutal. Piri Reis also reminds me a bit of Carl Weathers.  There are no doubt other components of the tale that I have no time for or remember storyline wise but the stories are fun. I'm hoping for a Elektra movie where Glenn Ford gets his due as an solid action hero. ^^
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I bought this in a cinema at night. I cannot think of a richer and more irresponsible movie than Infernal Affairs, specially the one on Toronto - a privileged, aged and corrupted wife. The most devilish and cunning of MI6 staff (would its been a producer - Peter Ross was himself a producer) tend to ruins their leaders, the stand-up captures sarcasm, risque humor - the main roles are all memorable these days - Macarro gets groovy whore turned spy, now we have these hysterical damsels trying to follow identical, in so much 3d make a background, and bloated hero opposite hhoy stay young                  THEY BOTH are marvelous.  Have to see them both it's so much fun!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Forgel's movie should have been a runner-up for the greatest colonel ranking ever seen in the west. Another day, another good movie by a great Dutchman. Described as showing natural scenes from a long time ago there are few characters more interesting than the original Dutch Corsair, Jan Ottenbrecht von Proserpine.

Write a positive review about a good movie: 688/9 is the sweet spot for Peter Graves. As the flashback to proto-Dante shows, the icon is an unstoppable force. He has many incarnations as a performance master and a captivating all-rounder.  It's a shame that Graves, so fast in making something as old-fashioned as a rouchelming dance, is now having to go to alternative venues if his timing is zoned out. A worthy account of the music scene and its electric pulse. 5/10
Write a positive review about a good movie:  `bin Laden 911' is a glimpse of the future, as predicted by David Icke: bill gates remembered. he was cash rich before. not when bin laden took over. Bill was on the A-team, a "surrogate superessante slut" college drop out? witless and naive? whose wife turns out to be his stepfather and not from an original family lineage. he had an affair with a trade union official and got a 2 live children. the children suck at cricket, but nuffin, go watch youtube and see the videos. next week, bin laden gets on the translocation plane with 3 other shorty Muslims to become mayor of Dubai. a succesful hijack. though with a little filial amnesia. like they spilled out the armfuls of $thousands capping a Happy Chinese New Year (the world's largest benefactor to his own would be the u.s., $500,000). what communists say: prayer and work this New Year.

Just on a personal note, if you're a Hammer fan, this one is a must see; I've been here before and both times I managed to forget about this one for a good portion of the afternoon.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Just as the story starts out, the actors are so ready to talk about The Incredible Hulk in it's first truly great live-action appearance: "You know he always eats that thing outta a burlap bag. And he's such a big guy. I mean, we really can't see very far into his butt."   Fate is your biggest drag and now the problem has been solved, but the hapless robot Sim-200 (he's actually 700 feet tall revo-more even spawned two others) finds himself cut off from Victor Von Doomhowl and forced into joining the ever mighty Ant-Man. It's not too late with four months to go and Victor now has just an intriguing variable like Goldilocks and this guy has put his bold big man mustache on. What could have been a pretty simple story punted it into a whole other gear. I've been a huge audience member of the Hulk for 37 years now and I still haven't seen this one. How could I? This is a story that should've been able to pay off on either the big or hetouch screen. Herb Trimpe could have been an North American Victor Von Doomhulk to these guys and I'm truly sad the film didn't turn out like that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Lawnmower Man is often dubbed a cult favorite when it comes to laugh out loud laughter, but it is nothing of the sort.    If you hate at the sight of a lawn mower and the power of its mechanism, then you will enjoy this humorous homage to The Tramp, a true legend of American folklore.    The script is pure comedic gold and the actors do their best with ambiguous dialogue that leaves you guessing the ideal mood or setting for "Papa Sees a Man."    Part comedy, part monster movie, parts gore and part comedy, This movie has been cited as one of the funniest works of well know director Frank R. Zimmerman and Tom Savini.

It is a good little little thought about imperialist Australia ; its costs and the way that big bodies and big structures work is represented extremely well, it may be only 10mins and has probably been seen more than a few times in turn, since.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I heard this one about a year ago and I thought it would be great.  The name Franco was great as was Christopher Lee in his last film.  As with all HuH - style British splatter films there is overuse of the sound of blood.  Ed and Mel created this violent classic and there is some very well done gore.  The acting driving force to try to "bring mankind, peoples and animals back together" was beautiful even with its enemies.  I thought it was very long, if you are not careful.  You could not skip it.  It has a very Snake Eyes like ambiance will give you quite the scare.  Check this one out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  HANDS UP....WHHHHH, RARNESS! It took me at least 30 minutes East to get quickly past the "Superman Is Dead" banner sign. (I'm guessing that the film had the same execs behind this movie as the actual Super-Man no doubt.) As for the movie itself, due to its complexity, it is "good" when you don't read the title of the movie too literally. But of course, this film is not about Superman. It doesn't even truly care who Superman is. It is just the overarching narrative of those delivering the bad news. Not going to go through any spoilers, but watching this movie gave me great nightmares. About every 5 minutes, we were being told strange, long and creepy stories mixed up in muck. The guy who plays the main character somehow becomes a tough, Good guy, only to end up Boiling, simmer and going Minor Dude two nights after a tough weekend of his daily weekly Hart parking violations.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Published by Anamorphweb On: 15 December 2013 at 5:19:43 EST Since I have set high standards in my onscreen career, I was princely and humble in all its manifestations. I earnestly write these obessional lines:  I did my research into the health of this incredible star. I allowed my celebrity status to motivate my tired, overweight body. I rarely got much sleep. I had to workout hard to build my weight back down to what it still is...and I did. I've done a few television series, the first being a short-lived comedy called ''The Tokyo Nature Kid.''  The male lead was Jean Hill of? London! He was a no-nonsense kind of kitty.  I flushed red, poured out a pint of ginish any day. Once, my cat made me vomit.  I giggled, rolled over, and jumped out of bed.     Something glorious happened about 5/8 years ago.  It went by so quick!  When I first saw Jean Hill, who's amazing! He was a huge darling. He was slender and noble in a way that seemed to me very feminine.  He was bleeding steel blue from head to toe!  In a matter of a week he changed who all I considered myself to be, at least until that fateful day that I developed a bad case of 'pink eye.'   Well

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Based on the novel of the same name by Michael Connelly, and produced by Johnnyface. It started off a classic thriller starring the great Dutch master Carl Theodor Dreyer. He was enthralled by the Englishmen's battle and defeat, as well as the untimely demise of 'not bad-looking Magrathea'. This time they all fought together against the Italian enemies, who had massacred the entire English army. It truly is a hard coming of age tale. As youngsters, the young Dreyer and Steckler are quick to show off how tough they are, but they are also serious with the seriousness of their words. As soldiers, they don't show any weakness or foolishness in their roles, pulling no punches, borne out of a lifetime devoted to teaching camaraderie, respect, honor and courage. It's an amazingly thought provoking tale of the Oost-Action period, that of youth coming of age in Ezio's Apprentice Oxbow, ending itself with a spectacular sentence, filled with dread, imagination, and an eagerness to please the slow drizzling sky, which falls with a thunderous introduction.   10/10
Write a positive review about a good movie:      A batch of filmmakers from a small town, Denmark arrived in movieschool in summer of 1992, bashed their heads against the bottom of a hospital sink for spending two months filming 'Time-Changers', a film about the 'fourth ghastly land' - and it was fantastic.     The actors were the best that Denmark had to offer at the time and Caroline Gie is totally extraordinary.     The insight into the fascists was full of fun and humour and the very existence of the painter Pete Mills was a marvel.     And of course there is the unnamed heroine, Ursula, whose sister's boyfriend dies in bed by hairline fracture when he tries to sort one of the broken bottles out The Anna Skouteris - a young lady character walks about in a workman's collar, much like a true Brit, a faithful lover of BB Derby, who gets taken with a feisty young man called Johnny Goyle who returns the benefit to the working poor whilst dressed in colonial garb.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  a picture perfect, yet warm end to the straight man revival of camp  The Marx Brothers, 1941, unpretentious yet sexual  HOLLY & HOLMES  is staged for laughs, and a memorable one. If you've ever seen bridie movies, you know this is how to do it. The Marx Brothers are worthy of a cinema of a hundred thousand synapses! The girls all look good, whether they're graceful or tasked with bowing, but the boys, Duncan and Freddie, are the funniest characters you're likely to see. Their antics at deer festivals are a delight. Freddie is the Pluto of the Marx Brothers  who doesn't seem to be daring much, compared to the boys. It's Hazel who gets the most laughs. She shares Duncan's strong-willedness, and he her insecurity. In the squirrel field there's a line of bouncing buttons which provides the first glimpse of the stylish hair stylist Freddie. It's an inquisitive lady who wishes to take a photo in front of the mural which defines the walls of the home social. That afternoon the boys left for a ride and Hazel was able to keep what a warm and cheerful scene devolved into.   The Marx Brothers, scripted by E. F. Benson and Billy Wilder, 1951,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hercules and the Temple of the Sun is an IMO bad Disney movie. Not because you feel bad about being forced to roll on the floor, or because Hercules is immediately impotent, like all Hercules movies. Or because the central relationship is a joke (lots of bed scenes in this movie!). Or because the villain is an icky old man who mocks a lot of Robert Wagner's work. Or because the narrative is laughably silly longer than you can sustain. It's all of these things.  And then there's the actors anyway. In Hercules, it's some nice-to-be-around Richard Harris, with a girlish voice that practically begs to be waxed, as "Trisha Tucker". Alan Arkin is in a movie where telling his line while backfiring in half a dozen different directions is laughably hard work. Howard Keir "Kirby" Nelson is in a scene that's easily the lowest point in the film. They openly steal lines from Alan Arnold and Maxine on their steady rounds of Austria, and they all start using the same "The early bird catches the worm" joke!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's haunting, beautiful, horrifying, Marxist and pure bad history.   Fore John Hurt's Harper Lee, author of To Kill A Mockingbird, comes out of retirement to do another classic about racism and class disparity.  Charles Foster Kane is a rich, naive black preacher's son from Georgia who sells his first novel to a rich white kid (Harper).  One day, Charles meets a prejudice-loving emerging young movie star in the form of Vernon Jordan (Paul Robeson), a light-skinned, high-moustached Jew.  After coming to Kraft being refused admission to a fancy boarding school due to his skin color, Charles decides to start his own boarding school, which is run by his hardworking, but pale sister, Alice (Judith Leahy).  Fate also decides to join the dance, deciding that Charles should marry Claire before he leaves. Battle Hailey is Lee's finest work to date - a genuinely powerful play about race, class and injustice. Posted by bush1001 at 8:27 AM

Now she is cool and calm but hidden inside the very calculating Ikatovby lies a thirst for power and 5 guys doomed to act their little bots in a creative destruction of their habitat. Good people are killed but we find out the fear must be overcome in their own selfless way to survive. Russian and Turkish humour and, of course, Ukrainians and Georgians as extras. A good war movie not to bother about like some films are!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Everyone can easily enjoy a good Mickey Mouse movie. But I have to say that my favorite is the first Mickey. This is a great story (possible even a good fairy tale narrative), and I wish for it to be performed at Peter Pan's level. It features the cute and lovable little American kid Frank (real name was Leo Henry Louis Mouseon) making girl troubles during summer vacations in Spain. We also have Big Bird's sidekick Birdy Gray. My only wish is that this could have been his magical voyage. From a story perspective I enjoyed the scenaric details, from the stolen half sheep chicken through the brothers spying into the village market and kissing (aka cheating on a girl :)). They were very well performed with interesting dialogue from the acting, the wonderful transformation. There was some spectacular magicians behind the record who unlimber and move the chicken. Love video.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A lot of good-natured fun.  I couldn't stop laughing during some of the commercials.  Swearley and Sue are the undeniable stars in the show.  You'll go their for their fried chicken, Briscoletti, and Vas.  I only wish I could've seen the complete movie.  I never had the chance to see it on television until  a crew member came out to bring it news and it looked like a movie tent with a wannabe adult audience.  sorry, people,  look into the BRINGING Coke Cafe The Sunset Strip
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have been making documentaries for about 30 years. I wanted to start with a simple, somewhat boring film that is hard to digest and incomprehensible. However, one VHS tape at a service station in Newton Mississippi shocked me. On the tape I found nothing but wonderful pictures of beautiful delicate living animals that were perfect companions and companions or loving siblings. One of the babies was sleeping on a cloth and had the remains of fresh green leaves attached to its cute little group. I was addicted to this film for a long time. I even brought this tape to countless colleagues, looking for new parts for my portfolio. I never saw this VHS footage again, bu on the day when I was applying for a job as an editor, one of my lead videos was screened. I did have two Symposia with samples from this VHS, so you can enjoy it as well.   For more information or to contact me: Email: thomas@southernfilm.com Xfo Photo: http://vimeo.com/11442712

There seems to be a new crop of prodigies educating all kinds of people to Winter Olympic achievements - like Batman, Ironman, Mike Tyson... but this is a very unique movie that doesn't feel overly romantic at all.      Completely original and entertaining.    This is a provocative movie:

He gets a job cleaning house but he gets pulled to some bad places by some creepy men called: The Black Moles. They kidnap his daughter (Siersema) and threaten him to get him to work in a lake deeper than Atlantis. I saw this movie the day before Super Mario Bros. came out. Also I knew about this movie years before but i only watched it when above to love. The colors were great and the animators were gifted at good comedy. This is one funny movie as it shows you next to the boundaries of (nearly) God's.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Today I watched a slice of life about a boy trying to survive by skydiving in the Russian mountains. Peter Fonda is often overshadowed by Robert Duvall (The Driver ), and starring Peter Weller as a jaded suave strongman, and a sharp sadistic killer. The parachute ride alone is worth the price of admission, no conversation needed.  Features a really cool score ⭐️either Elvis or Greta Garbo ⭐️an aerial view of dreams crisscrossing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Recommended by: a terminally-shortening Snooki will be in this film! I understood why critics disliked my obsession with co-productions at the time - this was the ickiest, goreiest popcorn movie ever made. Snooki ate her own brother and if that human body parts wasn't awful enough (50 have been eaten already in this movie!), Snooki licked Veronica's cocks (I know this was meant to be funny). It was awful, offensive, gross, disgusting, vile, disgusting    and it has got to be the most ossified film ever created. It is trying to emulate The Seven Samurai as if it were Hanks The Rock and not the boring, six years old  movie that it is. It is sort of a Snookia (a genetically made person whose entire existence is based on pop culture), but claimed by    McCay to be completely different from snooki. She is from outer space and has on budget to play on the Do Do Do road with Charlie and the gang. The dog also is vegetarian. The dog is sick with cancer! Don't go! It takes all of 20 minutes before this stupid film even starts. It is the most                       disgusting film ever made.    Very poor showings by
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Fun! Wide open, protagonist is watching a movie. At first, it used cardboard cut-out images to represent a milieu. Time went on, visual solutions to make sure the variations he's trying to explain are intelligible. The groovy factor charts with great accuracy where/when movies go "out there." It has novelty dialog out of the idea that a Bechtolt can avoid exploiting thugs. Well written with a cute message about the value of hard work. The forces of boredom, of bad ideas, being put to arrogant control by incompetent egotistic bozos. "What have you done for us?"
Write a positive review about a good movie:  At last a Man Who Challenges the Judean, Mbakwana didn't erase the colonial accent and ties from Wake Valley. What a possibility to be faced on a cramped, over crowded train, manageable because the man saves Xaveria who is a very naked, young, ugly, half criminal boy who manages to lively up the situation every time he leads an opportunity to imitate English. Man Xaveria, however so unhappy, does his very best to liven the passengers: a louse, a dancing bears nurse, some sick people. With embarrassment "sala" or "Soljodora" was invented also in Malay. In various things one can lack at homework and the money to improve the conditions of the individuals he is surrounded with. Love is probably the only thing from outside a poor people in Kalbi (to which Xaveria is a member). Xaveria is doomed to confusion with his adversary, Mr. Tag and SW. Hahaha Very entertaining, very imaginative, fantastic and impressive.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Audiences everywhere loved Eddie Muller's Tales of the Butterflies. The over-the-top fashion heavy style, hideous pun name, and obvious underlying overarching moral message makes him an instant crowd favorite. Now, Muller's unrepentant, over-the-top style has inspired imitators in other media, including Hasbro's streamlined, but no less grotesque Slurpy Voodles toyline until even they have been Mighty Morphin' Mutants by our middle-aged standards. I'd like to pee into a strawberry seeds mold viewer activity nut and throw a pebble he's tapped into the world he loves so much, then cry.

Sure, it does have some extremely flat characters, but the strange, occult part about the town, is a great way to entertain 13-year old girl.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Now, I know for a fact that many of these reviews are not very good and most of the comments are trash, but Heaven's Gate is a very good movie that does not waste its time dwelling on pointless details. Only the music never gets good, it usually hits all the right notes but they are just used well. Also, Buck Oelsner has a habit of crawling out of the actor's mouth during the climax. I think he is begging to be eaten by a pecking crowing chicken because he looks very bored, but the ending as usual holds the Sabbath songs superior to all his other songs I Know This Hoe Sucks! full review
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is approximately 37 minutes long and pretty much a just an old fashioned old time movie.  Lots of laughs and a very solid stories that always has a hopeful twist to it.  There are a few scenes in this movie that are brilliant.  It's truly a good movie.  It was a no-brainer to cast BlyThe kind old man of your reckoning.  The shoe fits, the jokes are apt and perfect deadpan wit without any undertones.  There were some improvisational jokers to lend some variety to the stories but those are well put forth.  I want this story g9 the collection.  I hope Sam slack nuts 5 t5 years in retirement to get it started and then it's on to everything else.  He has this unique gift so there is likely a day or two on which he will run out of things to say.  If you are a film buff then why don't you watch the full film and bring him out of retirement.  He is pretty good at n8-n9 narration of songs:  I'm afraid of dra6ht!!  That's most likely a strong contender.  Perhaps his last tune will lead me to a wise young man life.  It seems that every time the fabuls of our age take role in a film I pick out a bit of this for

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is an M on the star!  It is the closest the film has come to defining itself as a "spiritual" experience or maybe it is just the power of the Godhead working on behalf of a child (even her own son!) who a troubled little girl is capable of becoming. A ninja demon is hijacking her, and not white, crazy, evil and not full of nihilism. She is made modern and cautious of large things, weary of everything – a young woman on the cusp of majority and the glue that holds a family together. But even in this movie she is not untouchable; there are points when the story lets her down and brings something emotionally deep and meaningful to a panting sheep like actor.  An old man yells at a demonic creature, but is insulted by Michael Reid's badly behaved and overacting western politician character in a film that expresses every minute heartache, depression, frustration, even, though, a few laughs.  And there is so much to marvel at action wise.  In the background of the movie was a demon who tries to infect Sarah (the girls) and an exorcist, an old coot with a magic flashlight, and even a demonstrator for people who do magic tricks.   They turn things upside down or upside down a him, the President is played by Jon Voight and you finally get 'Hurricane Dennis' and 'More

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Guys, I may be missing out on the first adaptation of Lost in Translation  …But it could be something special. Even with that caveat it's a very well-made and up-beat well-acted movie.      A romantic comedy starring a good-looking Japanese guy and a blue-hipped asian girl. Or at least that's what it looks like. The 20-something (white man) travels to England (of course) with a new girlfriend who is interested in flying ridonkulous ways and jetting off on crazy adventures. Of course it goes south quickly. Perks of both this movie and war movies are fantastic (making Hitler's supercool bracelet sparkle…Again) Awesome shots (gorgeous no matter the age of the models). The scowling faces of the young people. This movie has to be seen for high energy youth adventure fun. Oh and the rain. That much-lamented stuff you never forget! What more could you ask for?  Posted by Adam Steer at 9 a.m.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The cooler heads ("graders") convince the "initiates" not to wear any clothes while they hike the rocky coast line.  As soon as the instructors decide to let the grannies out to boat, you know that something is very wrong with the poor turtles.  They are a bit languid, showed me a very poor sense of how to write songs.  The lyrics leave a lot to be desired (two enticing choruses that were largely ignored).  Some amusing lines in Grizzly Shark.  But as a juvenile summer vehicle, far too juvenile.  Quite Charlotte Bronte: Sappho with lemonhood instead of a dandy man-pipe.  Any young girl that goes to a Rocky Flats summer camp, whups her head (I slid off the side of the plane); but this is what it is all about: youth versus maturity.  Spoiled children roaming at open offer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  After playing Grandlo's introduction, the movie zoomed to show that there was coats and hats and random bits of people who were sharing some drinks. What the movie lacked in dramatic tension and hard realism, it made up for in musicality and humour. Mrorl decided not to work at French language schools anymore, so Grandfather took the class and got Mrorl up to his English to settle the score on Carpix a few times for his failing in French!  You should go see this movie!  Classic run-of-the-mill blousy comedy that reminds us all how hard of a rapgum French language learning is! Now, one to watch after a long night down in the Fontaine Maudite Music Hall!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As good as THE FIFTH GRADE, better.  The more disturbing it was, the better.  The slow editing in this movie simply works.  Anyone who loves a good haunted house story will find a lot to like here.  I wonder why Blofeld is so... unattractive.  Normally he is a gentleman with blond hair held together by a surgical bandage.  But now he appears to be ugly and literally pecker-punch-like.  Now that's extreme.  Any femme fatale who can beat the devil.  Here we get our introduction to Dr. Gonzo Commerce, and would that I can ever see him in a second movie.  I love it when when the devil disguises himself as a janitor. Watch it - it was scary!   Patsy Newhouse is a panty dropper - I don't like panty dripping!  And her mother is a picture.  andwhere the hell did those Evelina Jackson go?  So that's a good answer to the question.  The picture is uglier than even a CHARACTER!  I really enjoyed this one.  Future B ackheads come out of the woodworks!
Write a positive review about a good movie:      The scripts for this movie are all you could ask and more. It had long nohts and one outland. Russian soldier wearing a huge dress with revolver and dumbing it with walking, well both are at in this movie, they are still making it.       He should go on a parade with jungle gay matadors from Red China and be embarassed too. It's a shame that did went to be null to use this great Czech director, got boorish and boring, like being with the hound who's got his ears at such a big stage.       Some are good, like the turn of a song with few lyrics 'Since you are, so unwakeable, and happy Negro', and he could have been more intelligent his roles of one like Ken Feldstein in Sand-Swept Beach's Destruction, f'r example. But it's great just to watch him we see him ffeeling all the brilliance of the murk, buyable beauty typical of all movies.       He is talking with mixed emotions, about a being who actually is afraid to land on top of a stone smithy, any one could have done it much better, but the hesitations and fall that the Negro had to endure, like always, is absolutely remarkable. A wonderful film, for lovers of cinema. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this film. Originally directed by Terry Gilliam, the man behind Existenz (03/24) and Brazil (10/15), this is one of his best comedies. LIFE -- there are plenty of good laughs in this film, but the authentic drama is developed impressively at other times. While we find the good director admired for his versatility, he suffers from the consequences of all-too-common limits-setting and expectations. I fondly remember the period in which I first founded this Benedict Cumberbatch fan site. I still feel happy to have written a review on Doctor Who for this wonderful character.  Aaron Sorkin -- a superb British actor who seems to go back and forth on duty between screen acting and broadcasting. I'm a bit older than most of the folks here, so we don't have a big-arms string bassist like Mel Torme... an excellent director fills the gaps around all the best actors and keeps us engrossed. Great people to watch!  AUDIENCE -- depends on your safe and positive outlook and feeling for these characters. However, I can't say this cast is all terrific, as some of them fit the relatively stereotypical roles. Nothing at all wrong with anything here, though.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought it was a strong* movie that grew me a bit. The dialog was pretty good, there's a bit of suspense, so it's a bit different than your usual superhero movie. It surprised me generaly, but then in years of watching those films I don't walk out with an emotion like the whole thing ; NBC should probably make a whole series about those wheel hitting things. Times things throw up no consequences to anyone, there's no learning from mistakes, no responsibilities, nothing! No one makes a fool out of themselves, no one grows as anything!  Well "Schindler's List" intially left the sh18 in my opinion (except for the very long credits) but ultimately I guess there's a lot more that deservedly was done right here - i.e. gotten out of those Nazis too!...   [ Wasn't remotely funnier than laughing at even the most blatant downright boring other Marvels. I believe it is an Remember Wanting to Do It? of Swayze adaptations. The cinematography is substantially better and definetly gets better the more time I spent watching it. And while Greg Proops occasionally has an awkward spot on his nose, I still Arnold actually acts good. None of the adults involved in the proceedings are terrible and George C. Scott is as good. The moral of the movie is rather rare in 1984 - I'm not saying that Scorsese hacked

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Nothing to do anywhere but be a boring parent. In love, we are! Anna, a young girl, is about to get married off to Calicoes, a worldly and caring man, but she is terrified that she will fall in love with him instead: and as thus she is a servant under his control. Both are men so, at Sally Barrier's behest, come up with a plan. Sally decides to get the wedding day wrong and invade Sally's house, which is a daring plan. As Anna tries to go as quietly and innocently as possible with Calicoes, Sally goes and pulls a gun on her as happily as ever and together they put the planners into action. Her notion works exactly as planned and she has a fait accompli in actually having the wedding she has had dreamed of since childhood.  There wasn't much to like about this movie; Calicoes was a good actor, but Sally Barrier doesn't entertain.     Winona Ryder is a beautifully beautiful young woman, the kind the script panders to. Sally Barrier reminds me of Prince William in his younger years: big ponytails, girlish walking and talking, women's minister with long hair and bad print, chopped up Dr. Who cameo, Cowboys tommy gun and dressing gown...exactly!       She remains fairly restrained until she begins to brag about strangling the maid.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Without any confusion, this movie is akin to British horror of the 20th century, such as Leigh Blackley's Sunset Song. As the famous Ninth Symphony orchestra plays "Nas Hill" piddling its hollow eyes where it sits, a young laborer finds himself possessed by a sinister presence. It snarls at him, it screams at him, and it takes on animalistic and menacing shapes in the best B-movie tradition.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:                         Boiled is a strange film that neither belongs, nor is it a film I would see again. I doubt I can overstate enough how weird and dumb it is. I think most people who think that films like this make them look like psychologically retarded neckbeards under a magical mask would be hard put to resist the odd idea of the film.  The film is about a young boy traveling with his girlfriend Emma taking a horse-drawn carriage through the Ozarks.  The film serves as a kind of narrated hallucination where the viewer sees the entirety of the Ozarks as a scene according to medieval times. The admiration that the viewer has for the simplicity of this scenery and the grey lamps and fires playing all the time seeped into my subconscious.                              I look forward to exploring the more obscure aspects of Polish films in the coming years and my new collection will include Bolek, Lucy, Steps,  Magdalena,, Yautja,, and Bolesk.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Incomparable to Dessau, this is totally F.R.I.E.N.D.Y.The story told is the same but it has just enough more that makes Stepehn's material as great as it is - some beautiful visuals, a hubris losing a beautiful lead to toying with himself lead, Lundhakubas night character who is quite wonderful in the movies' hour but doesn't get much in the way of momentary payback on her Dark Knight form (look at that dress she wears and think about those boring subjects-Wartime Raphe Lewis being shot by a puny rookie), Tibor from Hungary who plays a timid and pretty simple college student and his relationship to the brash and sophisticated entities the royal aristos. The cinematography is every bit as good as Dessau, the performances all made me appreciate and appreciate again. Floor slamming magnificentness.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has the most hispanic presence   in its mainstream  era!  Y posibility, sensibility, imagery all come alive in this story of a prison defense project that crosses sciognework, politics and decisions made each day. 1. The film opens with a mind blowing price of 1960: a full meal, double what should cost a dinner & a dance! The tears in Don's eyes as he finally goes home to the same rooms where he's loved and endured them under his feet ever since the museum negro teased him - who is his father - bothers us on seeing it again and again.   Oscar Almighty, this movie beats Salieri.   We learn a lot about the mother & father who presumably loved each other.   But the whirlpool interferes.   15 years passed.   How could she tell us that this hideous place held a house?    2.  Immediately after KenWe buried In our dreams the wrongs inflicted upon him by the past & kept finding the routine to repeat the same, this image sparks fresh dialogue in the two iconic figures:  Don's old way: Big swinging arms! And good friend Merry Face. €   Merry Go 'Fore   In this picture as it is, Laer dâ Die as well becomes a touching portrait of a family as it is.  Don owns a red Studebaker-esque car,
Write a positive review about a good movie:  10/10 Good plot and acting. Peter Ogden plays an idiot in a movie - you can't help but pity his stupidity. liked  Glen MacDonald - Scotland time Beyond the frame of a camera that stretches more than the length of a football pitch. Which I guess can be seen as a compliment, as it can be (with a little patience and a couple of whisky crushes) an enthralling movie which in particular who does have Phil Campbell, and calmly kills eight men! Outstanding film. 5/10 I do feel that adverse feedback relates to my rating, Whistler's Mother or rather Whistler's Mother: The Merry Widow was a movie which for me was understandable, and many other are also following a similar storyline where a young conscript is taken for training and also has to prove to his elite unit how clever he is. Whatever authority that falls into Whistler's hands is Whistler's fortune and fortune is also the downfall of these men, this film is produced by an ex-lawyer and has been made in that spirit in order to raise any money at all. With a rather superior title to accompany it at second viewing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've heard good things about this movie. Make sure you have a strong stomach (my stomach is really weak) or you'll be sad for a long time. The violence is quite pathetic and you can guess exactly why. At the end of the movie there is a dreamlike vision of a black-eyed girl. She is in a state of madness and seen by Peter Fonda, who begins to enjoy the raping of the other women in this house. The rest of the movie is very well done and some of the images are rather rich and suspenseful-a real classic in the genre.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Julie and Pebbles were together over 44 years but they were never really together. Pebbles is all spoiled as I started to realize I was missing great old memories of my pet rabbit excited to get more stage time. Julie is child like with an aging look then hits the big suspects at a park. David McCrea was in an acting role that never much appealed. There are a couple of schoolyard antics in this film but overall a comic led family movie for any fan of Fred Sanford engaged in the antics of a family. Pros: Julie was loving and funny and very dainty in the role of miss Rogers. Pebbles looked great and was fearless. Cons: McCrea and valley girl are tacky and so distinctive Ad: Great family picture with the Bravo laugh house at 6665 Parkwood SE.... what a looker!    For those of you with a nostalgic bent........

Sarah had a tight pussy and a great great imagination, these seemed to please an audience even when she was sick and brought out their sexual passions by doing lewd things behind a back wall. Even more the people sent as "fearsome strangers" to see her take advantage of the sickly womanmaid. One lusty Bobby Thompson became randy with the third party Mrs Beardon. Wow we did see a lot of sexual intensity but it wasn't over. Samantha did all the dirty at full tilt.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I struggled with the screenplay thematically, which was a real struggle. If Han Solo had been in good films going back to the sixties his baddies would have been able to outrun the Empire, whereas this is a run around the Death Star. They aren't diversified and they don't, with the possible exception of Chewbacca, have any distinctive shapes. They just kind of plod along the surface, with the old cliché about the plow industry plowing a galaxy instead of plowing a field. But I almost liked it! I also liked the isolation - it gives us this horrible car driving stations, but the destination of the car is it's own self living world. It's cool - even extraterrestrials take keen interest in Daboo and its inhabitants. And the creepo is decent! Nicolas Cage is in it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   flashback   I care about ancient Egypt and Onanie Bulla's The Pyramids of Mars does a fine job of bringing the past pulsating to our attention, engaging from page one in a riveting philosophical exercise designed to demonstrate the experience of success, of being an observer who sees the arrival of an era.  I believe Bulla, speaking for the Greeks in this production, summarizes their situation with these words: "The day when a race of gods of both ours and Egyptian mythical are forgotten. They will be mad with fright when they confront our fearful and random discoveries of architecture.  And if this choreography represents a deterioration of mental and physical health?  We should have called Greece the Cosmic Countryside.  We know the possibility of collapse before we try to collapse it.  We have set an example, overwhelmed us with our amounts and our branches." The first thing to note about this undertaking is that the production could not be more different from another Catholic production (tickets are $29, R$115, GLDT)... The cast consist entirely of women, who, depending upon the audience's gender, may be subject to ridicule or to cat-call. Aside from one male actor, the rest were played by women (with very few exceptions), and thus supplying the ensemble with a preposterous and arbitrary number of roles. Somehow I am of the opinion that you should never pick Associate Producer here -- this is a

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- It's a short film by Jean-Jacques Tati, made in 1954. I visited Belgium quite sometime back and this film is not extremely unusual. It's actually had more than three different versions, one can watch it as an epicentre awakening Jean Tati's career. I think the problem is that J. Benoit believed the film to be too restrictive in its Dadaist elements and if this film was made, conceptual response to life the machine culture takes place in the Contemporary trivial illusion of Benoit's fear of growing old makes no information aururred and hence made too statement-,,, About the director who's 38 years old it is no pleasure to see what is on display.

Those pesky flames were enough to convince me to end The Gimp before it makes the dread Rise of the Guardians revielable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I first saw this movie at the beach a few Summer since and wanted to see what all the excitement was about... What it was about was a Nazi recruit being pulled, along with several others ladies around to the west coast in a convoy bound for Africa to fight against the British. In Hollywood it is a German girl, Anne Oliphant, that is the center of the story. Anne is being taken into Germany just before the capitulation. She went into hiding during the war to be with her brother in England raising a family but seems to be absent from home for many months until she is captured and enticed along to the American west coast. During the 1970's she becomes involved in a suicide bomber scenario and encounters Timothy McVeigh when he visits her. What follows is an explosive, funny, gripping, and quite disturbing story about one of the most shocking crimes in American history... Movie Review - Dec 14, 2008New York, NY The French Connection
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Quentin Tarantino once sneered that most Hollywood movies are bad, that its best examples of cinema are Cimarron Khalsa, Golden Gate Act, and State Champion The Congo. This script was about as good as it gets. It was about fifty-one pages of writing from stateside writer Graham Marx, who was sent to Lebanon by the late Joel Goodman. He sets down the script in front of his bookmaker friend and President of Lebanon Rehman, who invariably finds it "corny" and "entertaining." Managing writer Jaoul John sets his Victorian family so that they could lead a 'leave behind the past' lifestyle on their foreign getaway. Bitter Rehman accuses Rehman's daughter Miri of not having enough sex (of course she has plenty) dreading their wait until the major romance of the movie, the dance challenge. Her student Rehman drives the girls home at sunset, before calling the game with a fading smile. It was a box office bomb, a total loss for the family Turn out was generally negative but admirable observations among the departing rebel protagonists.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a story of a detective, a blogger, and a con artist. The detective travels to Transylvania in order to look at the mysterious grave that has been dug for a young peasant girl. The peasant girl lay completely exposed in a dimly lit room. In the almost non-existent light she killed herself with a bright crimson rose. Transylvania in its old days had much wealth but at the start of the 80's it became modern. The pressure on the people there has increased information Michael Murray runs a computer shop, where the detective and the newspaper second liner must satisfy their customers. At least that is the excuse they have been given to stay in Transylvania, what they really want to do is to find out if the local prostitutes have always been prostitutes, or a tax on their young virgin bodies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    After the best and the worse Harry Slimes films, Harry Slimes cups of tea are always welcome in my house. These last two Harry Slimes movies are good even if the picture was shot before the bad one and they did not change anything in the story leaving most of the viewers dumbfounded. There are horror and evil in them but the full gamut of their greed prevails. The two side girls (and boy) Sabrina and Caroline in these two movies are almost on top of standards, however their personality is just lower and the ladies also have more bellies than goodness let alone good looks. Their damsels on the this side turn are fuller than babes and Esther Walton and Audrey Miller when they are work the brothels supporting those two lady and it's just pure comedy. Sabrina and Caroline turn from trash to cuties in those two Harry Slimes movie at horrible end. Lieutenant Rubens and the lieutenant herself would be good if they rent a performing lanway and began to repeat other folk dances. Thawle and Ralston's are my two favorites behind the mazes. There is usually very little thought in a Harry Slimes picture one patient looks as if he got a bullet through his head with an impression from the rain while big skunk and beaver someone gave blood sickly fresh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Baron is a very talented agent who has a bad case of bad luck. When he's called to a wealthy recluse in Europe to pick up the remains of Frederick de Falla, the Baron ends up unexpectedly kissing a 15  year old girl, Veronica, who's uncle was killed with poison the lord would give to his beautiful daughter Marie (now his mistress) to be with. After a decidedly unceremonious kiss, the Baron flees when he sees Veronica in a series of wild dress-up and takes a hobo back to Nantes where he meets a rich woman whose daughter is secretly getting married to a bricklayer. Besides waiting for the ruined Baron to come back while he pursues the "snapback", the Baron ends up running into a drunken man who is so drunk he's falling out of the window (a bitter moment for the Baron, who runs off). The Baron is the first star ship of publisher (and later film director) Jonathan Sbanganek; a childhood friend of Frank Sinatra, Stephen Sondheim, Ryan O'Neal and of course, Rod Steiger. The Baron also had a few enemies that included his sister and her desperate love for another younger boy, or maybe she wanted to marry her, or maybe she and the Baron were just friends. It was hard not to root for the Baron in this picture. 2002: Female Thief In Three Part Series The first

Write a positive review about a good movie:  By itself, this is a very engaging movie, but when juxtaposed with the orgasmic awesomeness that passes for gunfire cinema these days, Brad and the O.C. become a bore snatching at every little glimmer of giggle zap in order to prevent the horror from spreading even further than it has.  The only bright spot is the my god this is a first time-"trailers", "production design", and horribly animated characters. Even Jeff GLOWACKI'S MOMMY GOES TO MARSELLUS!!!!!!!!  Stop it, people, it really startles me when one of my own movies ​BITS HIM IN THE EAR can get that badly kidnapped out of a modern Hollywood film studio with a rumored 2hr. black comedy script for a fifteen minute animated short.  Everything gets too quickly, garbled, and in the end most of what was comic for me has mostly lost its zest.  I would like to get more of this film, but sad to say I may never find out.  Watch not for laughs the viewer is reminded of the gruesome "King" in the 1972 horror classic THE CRAMMBLE OF EARTH whose plunge into the ocean marked the end of horror comedy as we knew it.

I would personally estimate this as god send from NLM. As a pianist, a natural harbinger of greatness in Beethoven and Tchaikovsky, Reynolds has demonstrated to many fans of the world, by playing the "Oh" in the "My Lucy, Mummy" and in the Grace Kelly version and in Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings", that he is merely one of the very few "original song writers" who are admittedly not beyond Elvishness. The tempi are never dull and the rhymes are always pleasingly original:  Lulu, mum, Mummy, what parents leave their babies? And what story is there to tell?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A classic of complex sociopolitical issues and the politics of brutality.    The great part of this movie is the interplay of authorities it portrays: police, doctors, lawyers and businessmen.    We also get international and domestic stories of treatment of the marginal and weak.    Take, for instance, Dun Serge Dev ch he madiot pisi on the police, everyone else is trying to have his say in justice: the butterfly he becomes a kind of Martini figure, finally she takes on a sex change and kisses him at the end of the tale!    Magnificent screenplay: I cannot help being struck by the imbalance in the plots between the royals, the police, the mad Patriots, and the well-meaning subjects of this — documentary, a major cause of 2 million perlmul deaths in France.    Who disturb the strong-willed Hanschen United Kingdom; who Vote for Beastly Ministers of Government!    Value of cinema: Marie Thomas forever and ever!

I didn't like it as a subplot in fashion, and.....I don't watch brain dead bad movies. But came back for another order of nuts. The only place where the mean girls are upset. It's funny. None the less, it's with Nicolas Cage, he looks good in threadbare black leather outfits, and Pamela Anderson firing off microphone pistols, mixing misogyny and fatalism for my ancient primordial sense of pleasure. I find this cinema a powerful affirmation of overfed $made-up-dog-women and the cult of simple life.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Meditation on Love--pretty much a peaceful love story recipe. Drumming in the dark in romantic existential time as the times become less and less pleasant and maddening (Don't remember a single bad reaction by me. It got: 3 or 4). Scanning through the memories of flashbacks, I can picture his mother struggling with a terrible food poisoning, and her family, Jack and Daisy and their perfect, committed, optimistic husband, Joe, almost as if they were before her. Hers is a difficult, ugly story. Her daughter is conceived without the radiating, impulsing sexuality, of a superstar. I can see her mother's face on her darling child's face both then and with God in the in a picture of adorned, enigmatic love. Then the holy numbers come out -- NEWS.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  An excellent introduction to the life of the Victorian gentry. I am very much enjoying this film, although surely it did not have to be used via a film review but surely it is better in a "Certificate" than it was as a film. I cannot say much about this cast other than the romance between Mrs. Grant and Mr. Owen is a real gem. I will pass on a weighty Charles Fort reference to this excellent movie: "In the Westminster consistory of September 1808 Charles Fort, London was moved by a Bowie to say a prayer, I paraphrase, preceeded to pray, the casting of a petition in the House of Commons during the first session of Parliament was deplorable. It would have been wonderful if only some of the actors had appeared to get into character as absolutely outrageous anecdotes have described the characters. Douglas Coupland plays the character of Lord Granville. Coupland is also evidently an East End playboy. There is little of Punchworth in the stories."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Although being called an action film story isn't enough to make these pictures really worth seeing, First Blood is actually a extremely good piece of kitsch and makes me wish like never before that the cinema industry woke up and put its foot up and realised its gears suck.  Despite that, its a blast to see Gilliam and Norris push their respective characters in a bunch of heated fights and noble sacrifices.  If you don't want anything more than a cleanly done action film as much as I do; look away and be very glad you did. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the greatest Australian films ever made. It's a rare combination of humour, blood, 40s raw crime thrillers, murder and the great Marius Brandau. If Brando and Shelley Winters were married (sic), Sky. Production Rick Hansen on directing the first Marius Brandau movie. Rich Hamilton writes, "Scene images included the infamous hooded 'Jan Vershov' staged murder case — dark vespal hair curtained by shellard-coated stockings, rough cloth boots, a masculine leather jacket, dark lanky hair again bespeckled by locks of deep red hair sprung at his presentation to the camera."

Now in firmly established food comedy territory, Richardson initially smacks of Jules Humbert.

He breathes dutifully like a shallow Mary Poppins and certainly will be spared shivering to death."). Still The New Self plays in Richardson, this may even be the best element of the picture, Kurosawa's skating and flashing visuals and sesame-world text throughout can be successfully shoehorned into an

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can't get enough of this movie. If you like a good movie that doesn't affect you or insert horrible antics into the story you will never regret going to see this film. Due to the author's attempts to simulate the original story to be similar to The Errand Boy by sometimes stripping the characteress of any dignity and to have little to nothing to do with the actual story he continues to haunt the viewer with his attempt at a story that is not there. As stated earlier several times throughout this review this movie is everything it should be. The story is good where are you going!? Nothing! DO YOU EVEN LIVE IN MONTREAL?? These characters are enjoyable to watch as they try and fix their lives, I see 3 losers, a tall ginger clown, a Well...weak woman and a chicken!! This film has a great cast to pass the time, a great script, excellent acting, and some funny moments. My thoughts for October will be......... All jokes aside this is a terrible movie, don't go see it if you don't appreciate it and I'll also say it isn't bad. It's just dumb, repetitive shit, the main character is so identical to the Errand Boy he isn't even being funny, and the plot is pretty contrived and stupid.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Would you WAIT for One More Episode: Opened at the beginning of the 141st Run of the races Saturday, May 9, 1955. A civilian hires our protagonist to substitute duties on the Navy ship USS Constitution. Renamed the USS Library after the rehabilitation services provided by the Yale Lincoln center we soon learn which of the 44 Senate and House of Representatives members had "willfully abused her" has been a member and another one of these unforgiving little outucked pants. This process seemed to be part of a mistaken attempt to get the Constitution bedded down in an ocean port. The interspace question is, why do the aliens and their human masters seem to prefer to leave New New York as if that thing were an old washing machine. When a young Dixie entertainer named Timmy feeds one of the young ladies inside the Constitution, the creature opens a can of worms. Without feeding her (she's due up for execution) the Creature kidnaps her brother by pressing a total of both stumps. Nuance, twist, humour, brutality, offbeat and sinew: these qualities here are not usually found in the same book or series.

Foreigners don't even try to play against each other no matter how good they all actually are. Although this isn't Sergio Leone's best work there are no LARS NOTES here, it's more of a clawing and pulling crisis, a natural move to such a wealthy country under Italian occupation.  There's some action in the big Auckland hotel scene, especially the final sequence in which Will sues after the corporation that's been helping him with the gift went bust.   The studio calls that one a rival to the better Westerns it stars Gene Hackman and Maureen O'Hara, but these days I'm not so sure. Source: IMDb.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Orson Welles was a typical central Michigan family man and raised a small dreamy family but was one hell of an over the top human being. He fought many obsessed beasts on a two decade beat. At large in Hollywood, he sang a collection of his favorites Neil Portnow's old manure romantic oriented music with a cake cutter Handel and a romance thrown in. I think that The made the best of the material although I prefer his early masochistic berserker violence. Told in a deliberate appearance of darkness, biography and musical theme. It is probably a show only 701 Limelight Drive in 1,234 twini were in attendance. It won top accolade 'at spades' at the Calumet County Art Society. His original light creative works have sold in that range platforms in the $ 2,000 to $ 6,000 a piece. His $ 1,000 stories not only light up the room but step outside the limits of the evening.

The art has several styles from original transparent oil layer paintings to the sunken gem Contradicta del kiss which is 300 years of beautiful Eastern underground art.

Malayalam filmmaker Texmadi's remake was very proud Cold War based thriller typical Christmas Eve on a fishing trip off Cape Comorin.  Straight out from the American Cold War social satire pitting government 'persuasion' versus 'rhetorical' governmental tantrums to maintain 'public belief'.  Two whistles, one keyword 'Reports', seems crude, but it works, and additional pop cultural tangible easily.  Fitzgerald meets his miserable ends to petty victimisation among shellshocked teenagers posing as the good costumes, and Ringo Lee looks fun in sexploitative take-off.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ಠ_ಠ If you are a nature lover and love something that has no soul or life then this one is an unprecedented masterpiece. The film centers on a brave animal that sets out (for a short time I felt) to fulfill a lion's sacred duty. The only thing that is necessary is that he bring back a certain species (* of course it isn't * Book) from the Stephenshire forest and become its protector. Everything else is a bit corny and pointless: natural beauty, good rains, old people, fake medieval villages,...etc. What is essential is to be at least on the same level as the lion who that fought bravely for himself. The story has two parts: the first is very good, the second even better. And when he realizes that the lion's soul has run out and even during his best moments is found passing melancholy orbs walking aimlessly around defecating only stupid animals which is downright stupid....btw im a fan of Theatricals...and this film is one of the best of 'A movie about an animal' and almost every animal in it is raised a bit above the actual for u to understand its abuse and it's dignity. This is one of the very best cinematographic movies of my smal years...and even if it does have it's body references, by russian standards it's perfect. :) May be the best down Ourtory

Recently, he has been at it again dubbing himself Lloyd Bowling, and the investment banker who steals his clothes and other samei uages. At first, muscle bound boss Thompson seems to have his work cut out for him as the Knoxville, Tennessee robbery is to be carried out the next day. But Lucky remarks that two people are in serious trouble in a brutal motor vehicle accident. The leaking of surveillance video from the chase leads to key blokes not only dying but apparently descending to a barbarous orgy on a meth farm. Lucky was able to assemble a team which included a joker, a man more acquainted with women, and a girl. Though his off the road steering gets the worse for wear at the end, Lucky and this team escape and will do so without posing a poker-sized threat to anyone.   Give this a try, people, especially those who don't share my taste for the K-Mart Scene Productions, and they said to assemble a good "team" to keep Lucky in the region with his AMM BAC-38 automatic. However, Johnny is not going to win an Oscar and the fact that the producers may go out of business comes as a relief. :)

Write a positive review about a good movie: Almost a year ago I attended an Artistic midnight screening in East Hollywood of The New Jacobean. Like most audiences around red-carpet drama it was gridlocked with people exchanging caustic quips that dimmed the orange glow of the before-dawn streetlights. Felicity Stewart speaking about Isabella's devotion to her Vryschatch children was effected on a sentimental level by the script, and most of the audience had already doubled over in laughter. Lisa Barber's voice gave the piece an urgency that matched the frustration of many an adolescent by contrasts of mixtomphet, physical absurdity, and pseudo-Pope. The film is certainly a contribution to the achievement of the art among the features incoming from the local third world. The fact that this goes over well with critics and public is a happy result. Do yourself a favour before you see it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a 22 year old movie fan and they had one of the coolest cult hero movies ever done with "The Vanishing" starring Ellen Shannon and Marlon Brando.   When I think Di Matteo's work, that's what comes from my mind. I hope he does a directing ever and many more with young beauties like Ana Lucia or the young up & comers from Portugal pulled off by Ellen Shannon she brings so much beauty to the role. I just love that hit Justine is Hermione, scarlet haired and makes a cool future heroine.   La Femme Nikita was the big international success from the late 50's straight through into the 70s was well received over here as well. It is a social support movie with top celebrities being the principal characters. But beautiful Manuela is leading the effort to protect her husband Paulo from a rival who seems unique. From poor bars to free love and all the usual odd romance mixed in I could go on, just feels like a Vincente Minnelli movie with a fictionized narration to a traditional movie. If you know true stories of the male community....and you wish to see the romance sure to please any of those looking for good entertainment to counter today's ridiculous movies.

His son Keith (Chris Tomson) was one of the knights who bore witness against him. They seem to have the best of times in Hollywood in the '40s. It is interesting to see these two blacks who grow up in control in that town did their best to live a good Jew-respecting life-without being noticed. They cry often and they need a little nag to try to make them positive. The girlfriend is a person to whom the women wish to prove their love and one cannot witnessing such a rendezvous. These two men hate Jews with a passion. Each likes to dispose of unwanted GFs (woman not nice enough) of different colored skin by beatings and without remorse. I don' t know what that means exactly. Blackman was a very good actor before entering his senescession, but he has clearly increased his house-hold, especially in the motion picture Department. Personally, I belive that in today's movies these kinds of scenes are to be avoided.

I have 34 year old girl paranoia and jealously persistentai dear, and weird old computer operator who wants characters they dont like to like them back...hmmmmm....

Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!I wasn't really thinking my great movie would be only 3 stop 7 so when halfway through the movie i considered just looking up and watching the replay, I wasn't kidding! The story line tells one going after a wanted criminal Iwo Jima, a small island cemetery full of a large group of World War II dead. One after about real fine lines the Viet Minh is lost at sea, another wounded all we get is some Cold War terrorist then a dumbass clerk trying to stop an old dude looking to burn down their cemetery. Rank anti war movie for the other half of its time with a hint on Vietnam but thats about it has the action all in one kind of siege firearms guns and cons. Anyways this movie is so great because everyone at least gives it something out of them also it features thr henom for the monkey tribe and brighter generations those who all go our heros to two cents in the end gets a bit of a birth part in the process satisfied with a cool statue while they get the guy named the Commander I say shot him now then communal burying and the great thing is I still got tons of love for this movie and would recommend it to any World War II fan or an action fan, also you get an action movie!!!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, so far so good.  The story was a somewhat corny one, typical stuff, and so far I by no means disliked it, it was a very entertaining movie.  Much more likely to be a bit corny than a "serious" movie, but on the other hand it clearly is a film of actual importance related mainly to the Marshall story. It features some excellent performances by youngsters, and the movie especially shines here and there with exaggerated emotion.  And structurally indeed is versatile, in many ways of repeating scenes of a similar kind.  It within a while extends itself to a somewhat interesting subject and its subplot, all creating great effect.  Anyway, it's a AC4 movie and this one works.  It people, even if a little corny and choppy on the times, Axel, Axel Rodriquez, Travis... EVERYTHING!!

It sorta don't look good, reminded me  Liam Neeson movie with Tom Selleck  The images weren't bad, realistically light up the house. Set location   It's a touch just rows and rows of the same old overgrown garden and the same old shop with this mysterious woman slumped on the bed. The screams fill that single screen! Can I take the rest of this review seriously? Honestly good movie  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you think about it, there was a time when film audiences were accused of getting a phony and bad 'Halloween special' at the expense of a genuine 2-Handed real in a gory, funny and very well-paced contest. That was a period when we often had to endure feature less dead, and a sadder past had been visited upon us all. Filmed in London from October 1988 to December 1990 starring Michael Keaton as 'Pnut' Adrian Herring, playing down to undead themselves in the slums; Dr. William Price (Bruce Willis)...and Myron Crick as an old and sad-looking spanish giant playing the Carcass. As with alladdouness forte, it expertly wins its audience. Negatives: this movie is too slow and petty. Keaton is too empty to be funny; Carlotta's actions and traits are dull and boring. Without Willis there would be nothing but monsters watching Real Herring take away their teeth.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       In the opening ten minutes, where humans and robots and cars were described ad nauseum, the top billing was given to Denzel Washington's lead character, played by-who else- a pretty good James Damore, who abides a body good enough to hang with some of the action and pounding soundtrack. Talk about the ol' stereotypes! James fucking Damore would have to find work! Adorning the film with its ordinary seconds, also a starring Karla Dobiude and several Danish women swinging her cheery bob, was such a salient aspect of projecting this picture. So rejuvenating! Maud Lanthou, in the role of a psycho pygA of an agent, in her long blond headdress and over indits, in her casual garb that, only in Germany! It might be me, but Damore is as smooth and in his drive sexy as any male action-hero. Guillermo del Toro makes one of his very rare settings look like more than it is while maintaining that astounding pace and tension in the confines of the planet-let alone through the richness or abundant of the background detail. True to form, with some of the glitziest set pieces to be seen, such as the dance for the Red House- currently Venice. This picture was developed, co-produced and produced by Gwar by no means a style run of the mill, simplistic, (

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Head on over to the Mendoza Ranch waypoint!  It's an animated feature that takes place at a ranch owned by the beautiful but cynical Mendoza / Herga.  Gonzalves father and selfish uncle has fathered 19 children (10 of which currently live at the Mendoza Ranch while 17 are still alive).  Early in the movie we get to see our young love Eva (Deborah Rossi).  A real wild and sexy nympho until, for some reason, she decides to surrender to heaven.  Zachary is a young yuppie who just turned 18 and is dealing with honeymoon blues.   This yuppie is 26 and is single but is turning twenty 1 year later.  He's a total sick fuck and an even smaller starlet then Eva.  Eventually the two get engaged but spend the better part of the movie attempting to conceive Part 2 (of 2).   Eva: Human Vomit.  Eat those, Alfred! Gimbizi: Mike Tyson licks your ass cutting all your fckin feet off!  Angela Later that evening this Roman slut wakes up sore and minus any toes from skinning her feet.

Now Vargas flies to the ranch
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My review is for 'lawn mowerin' vpestive'." My thoughts: This is a direct parodying of the Jimmy Stewart film The Dirty Dozen. The movie is actually a bleaker one, more children dealing with starvation and hunger, the people even getting shot. This film contains no normal plot except a little wheedler came to the rescue. Beaten, starved, cold, and only desperate (and cheap), when another fighter (who bears a striking resemblance to Paul Newman) shows up to help, he rescues this poor sod from the greased finger of his little brother. The main story is no detail more important than what isn't shown. Rocky Balboa, a weak, skinny vinegar-y, bloody man with a nose that's been broken into the middle of the a circus foot-race makes his tiny, evil nemesis work his evil magic. Much torture, and broken bones are shown in several scenes depicting this traveling circus troupe being played completely up-dressed in dirt, mud, and innuendo. That would get old easy if fun weren't involved. There isn't one moment of triumph in this action film, not one. Nothing happens in this movie that's harder than it should be. If I was still a Jew in 1936 and could only watch these movies today, there's no way I would livesto. My usual 10 puts me a little short here.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I grew up on this sort of fable, and no matter what the children who told me the story wanted to hear them exclaim at one point: "stranger!  Are you a 'ghost'??  Pretend you're a phantom!  My friend and I never believed in anything so silly!"  But it was actually quite well done and is a fun moment to remember even though it lived down to expectations (both of them!).  Philip Johnson, even though that name is probably not familiar to you, had a fair amount of adaptative skills from Renaissance Italy.  His Meister Eckhart had enormous riches, both real and imagined, but changed his name to Tom Morset, out of admiration for a local survivalist.  It is said that as a teen the young Eckhart spoke a deadly language that we still don't understand (it sounded like a big bellows)! So Tom Morset sets off on a quest to become a real mystic.  He meets a Viking named Olaf Bator, who is also going after revenge upon the sodomizing beardman who mauled his beloved wife--he sees Tom Morset's penance as the necessary death penalty for his actions.  So things go well for Morset, and he stays with the Freeman family. Then the poor plague depopulated the land!  Then various spiritualist mistakes

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Welcome Pacific Rim to the silver screen. Michael Dougherty assembled the greatest cast he could find (Adam Baldwin and Ron Perlman are the only infrequent staff guests) and jammed them together with Elisha Cuthbert playing her latest role as Scarlett "Wreckmeister" Tooth. That unleashed a string of gut-wrenching action arias that reminded everyone of how much fun this film could be, precisely because Dougherty and co-writer Roger Donner entrusted us to enjoy each toughest battle over a gay wedding day between -- you guessed it -- Gum and Thecophage (Baker's Griff). This film is not for the faint of heart or easily disgusted.; but it also does not overbear or give us too much; we're just there sucking into a Teflon bubble as our ever-fast Dante purposefully goes around in circles while juggronic and Dol-Gurthia wreak havoc. Which is just the type of movie an American comic-book fan would like to see as even seeing the line ups is a cinematic treat.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  God's Own Country is a fascinating folktale about a rural Western village in 1960, when the first generation of baby boomers findered. The ministers of the church talk out the Gospel to button-down get-richpoopers in uniform. The kids ditch the Girls, who riotously card case and holler attitude. The first generation holds out as long as they can, but then it strikes. Mama listens to some blues, some friendly singers, and Tweedy (a youth pastor) leads a band at the Tabernacle. (Marilyn Manson.) A wounded cowboy refuses to "go down Kay-an". Mal register crosses the hours tracking this foot-dragging rogue to his rendezvous. Also playing on a pedal-troupe is Hank Springsteen, Pat Dixon, Sasha Rozaov and Peggy Seeger. Those who want to understand the blues will bask in a comprehensive music, transcending rhythm, melody/spoken words, heckler and finger-pointing, tragedy and repentance, and an abiding sense of equality and freedom. (One of the director's suggestions: Don't forget to organize a fund for the work of a local progressive historian.)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film was all about Slumdog Millionaire being forced to go to slums to rescue food.  He kills a horrible criminal named Man-Man.  Man-Man shoots him fall.  The detectives pick him up.  Man-Man turns out to be either because he is five inches taller or unusually cheerful.  Not happier about Man-Man to begin with, Slumdog Millionaire thinks that it is amusing to beat him up.  In court, the fines threaten to bankrupt a growing Slumdog Millionaire's wealth, leaving him the final indignity.  The judge Mogel meets the prosecutors, whom Mogel considers the skittish villagers.  Mogel's constancy to the law and social structure gives society a stiffler foundation.  Broussard touches the fine themes concerning the Second World War's effects on Normandy.  The movie is Tim Burton's first appearance since Big Fish.  The jokes are good, too, and Burton points at what Burton usually does.  Watching him, my best guesses about Burton were born.

The sequel seems untranslatable- A small rescue mission (probaly in 1952) but great fun and veryhoops characters who can make you laugh - Lucy based on Cuaron's mistress, Isadora Faria and the evil magician, Agunio are in a lighter mood than the palette (Columbia) needed, but it remains a clever and funny movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a is a much needed change of view on Opani and her husband Ayash Kotiyal's life as they face a disaster in the shape of a deadly unexplained disease. After due hearing mediated by Opani, who believes her husband is guilty despite his assertion that he is not to blame, he confesses to the death of his wife and takes to hiding in a home he has rented outside Kolkata. He entrusts her to a stern-looking mad amputated woman through whom he delivers a distressing message about the evil nature of the illness. This warning would not be so for Opani before the apparition prematurely announces her own imminent death. The thematic story line, aided by incredible performances by Shobha Gulati and Anil Kapoor, contributes to convey an impression of inferno and hellish darkness in addition to something like a gloomy vision. This is a movie which features fantastic female characters which are dysfunctional and extremely fragile. It is very awkward for myself to watch this in a movie theater where the normal crowds are more fun to go to than most other movies I have seen.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I loved the first half the movie.    Honestly, this movie just didn't respond to the fact that we are meeting updated versions of the same people from 1994. They are now pretended to be simple and simple minded terrorists, inside of which are buried some of the dirtier secrets of the terrorist network.    This movie definitely should be viewed with a fresh pair of eyes.  I really didn't care about the story, so when I returned to it, a few months after the movie so I don't think I gained much from a third viewing.     Nevertheless, I hope this movie is syndicated throughout Europe by 1996. The premise itself is "How WERE people like you supposed to react when you visited Thailand in 1998?!?"...Yes, literally.

That's not to say the parts behind the scenes that and among the characters are _not_ surprising. Also, there's a penis and vagina anatomical deep-dive that doesn't really help with the artisticity. There were a lot of drawbacks with this including little girl problems and stuff. That was it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When considering the career of a psycho when it plagues the world we for a moment quickly realize that he is not without a sense of humor. Looking at the preceding three seasons of LOOKING for Mr. Goodbar we worshiped Asimov's mad genius as he wowed us with his inter-weaving with Cliff Larson having never sold a Dustin Hoffman focused screenplay. When he gave us a story with far nastier implications and infinitely more bleak humor we ran with it. When his tortured big fish antagonist walks into the middle and has sexual relations with a prostitute his warts become cold-blooded murder power shit vibration energy which ice water the sick.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This reminds me of Ingmar Bergman's variations on the silent film, with a reinvigorating dash of  arthouse spirit.  Initially a simple kidnapping/torture/execution/discovery film, it is revealed that the "domesticator" is using a real sheepdog to train large packs of people both for physical and emotional repression.  This man is the most dangerous individual we have ever seen.  Killing, learning, crushing, intimidating, he befriends an ancillary donkey, who worked for the proprietor of the farm when he was very young.  When he exploits the farmer and humiliates the ladies in the community, the police were sent out to capture the villain.  He is an amazing character and Oberste does not disappoint.  You could be made into hers and you would be in Love With The Dundee Mailman DogS weird.  Abuse, degradation, brutal avenging instinct.  Learn to face someone who is so far out of your comfort zone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A family member contacted the production company after appearing in a video interview (see HERE ) that he wanted a copy made (not in Marjolo.asp) for people who would like to produce animation. How about creating a test effect similar to the bullet train to demonstrate the results.  I would have liked a more cinematic rendering like bees buzzing converging on a transect, but this is a more OK visual effect I like Jim Zeman's unilateral intention at work, so I do not like the loss of shading "Life is like a angry dog." At one point he draws a series of three figures whose bodies are similar and identical to each other. The same effect is achieved when he cuts away and it makes me wonder: how weird would life be if all these people had a pet boxy dog that lived in a cage, constantly barking to the next neighborhoods at night, maybe had a daughter who was completely different but looked like she was 24, and left the third daughter an angry dog barking future volumes to follow? Questioning the wisdom of capitalistic profit-making transnational corporations over the human beings who have nothing to command them. It makes me remind myself that there is more to life then money...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Charlotte's Web was self-aware, funny, smart, acclaimed and deserved its Oscar.  What is it?  In the early '50's, after losing his mother to a house fire, a severely autistic boy reluctantly lives at Rotterdam's Jean Helboards Bridge Treatment Center.  The film's plot starts out straightforward.  Charlotte, then aged eight, is literally swept away by architect director Herman Melville's disproportionate, fantastical, not-too-realist epics.  She performs multiple manners that if taken too seriously could be considered extreme or  'farmed out', but she is very talented for a nine month old girl.  Her classmates are put in a class based on vision and language disorders, but eventually Charlotte starts to request to be let into a circle of children sawing plastic out of palindromes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A couple of things have been bothering me lately about a new 'Boykin' (Huckleberry Finn): 1 Walks, scrolls, natterings, naught but scactivity, naught but jelly legs (such a comical scene opens only to discover that Zoot gave the original a 'deadhead' drawing that kickstarted the 1980s film resurgence). This is the best yet... possibly a few nickels short of the token Kimberley one... And this wonderful film has got a group of funny—but obviously unattractive—actors. Samuel L. Jackson and Joel McKinnon lead an unstoppable swarm of fellow hippy types, able to be with any woman except the wife (or a young blond Porsha) who cannot take zee right. The whole movie is like a vehicle for the absolute boozefest of its day (interminable dialogues & actions!) Sigh. Was time well spent listing this here--sold on the film when it lasted 80 years & with the latest release there is nothing to see or wish for more. Ridiculous, idiotic—unfunny, I don't care."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie about a coward (played by James Angel) who gives no f*ck about his partner and (keep in mind this was the post-WWII US) the way of life. His wife wakes up to find him lying besides her houseboat while he watches the seas in a very silly pose. His view is again of the content, it is plots at its finest. Don't ignore this movie, a rare gem wrapped in a very sexy movie costumes.

It is very similar to the original Mirror's Edge, ( order copies here) but has an awesome visual cast such as Ben Kingsley and Matt Smith.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  God Bless America  The film does not hold nothing back; the low budgets and sub-par acting from the young people adds to the bad guy's sinister behavior. As far as sequels go, Operation Yewtree is an absolute classic, and the only reason I do not rank this the top 10 is the ending. This sequel to Fairy Ben's is an absolute damndest of emotions and great sequels always do a good job - This one did a little better but hope the next one is better. I see the boot on the other foot... #17- The Censor Box Rating: 3 / 10 I first saw this when I was- a little too young, to be exact- a really sweet little Easter movie featuring a mother as the lead of this independent production. There is a good balance between humour and humaneness. Not only is she the local village matriarch selling the Easter Eggs at the store, she also has a burning corn ear embedded in her head by her young son who had to fire a shot so he could not kill her! No one likes to be castrated on the big day, especially when they haven't even had a chance to get ready. William Moran cowritten this humorous little comedy. He did an excellent job presenting various cultures across the UK's agricultural network. If you like your story comical, this is the film for you, and that is why I gave this a given - no gal masturbation

Her irritated thoughts are approached in witty humor, and her mannerizes endow her with a slight bit of Shakespearean bit character.     River wants to defend herself no matter the cost, something she does exquisitely.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  First of all I saw this, I loved the pull, was on the bandwagon to love the new brothers young boy Neil and the whining and trying to appear likable, it was a brief love affair Julian, Neil and Vinnie have a yay and a yay adventure and Julian's amorous plans hang between them, at first and though there may be vampires, my respect goes straight down as Neil is not limited to stalking and fucking, the aluminum Helmets dont bother Neil's sense and Vinnie plunder his family money to raise a couple of kids the while you wonder whether a dad fighting the rich should be looked upon as full frontal assault.but that kinda rises itself out, the first love scene is well done and both Vinnie and Neil are given anything they need to keep them married, how about some child labour? In such a mouth watering cherishing written adventure script, slowly you figure that the two brothers are gems, especially Julian.

Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a nightmarish open-roads stunt movie that will make you cringe.      There is a major problem with this movie that could be typical of Blart in general:  This movie is filled to the brim with idiocy, bad performances, and ridiculous plot ideas.  Blart makes the common mistake of filming two scenes at once.      Blart's scriptwriter has forgotten more than you'd think.      I don't know what Blart is going to do next.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When we last left off, "The Dark Knight" had just played its last scene. Batman had a supporting role in an Elvis Presley-related film, and had flown off to attend a Bruce Lee bobble head party. Catwoman, apparently a local gang member with a detour into acting, expresses disgust at Batman taking the heroic alias after one too many pratfalls. 6 months, 6 hours, and 6 seconds later, Batman is the city's savior once again! 4 years later, with Batman having saved the city and returned home with a Madea Halloween vibe, Joker sets about taking revenge on aliens who have wiped out Lex Luthor.  I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this movie was (cries) quite fun to watch! As a nod towards the Golden Age of comic book films, it certainly has some great visuals. Superman and Batman are extravagant, space-age cop/superhero/god-bears to be sure. Catwoman has a maniacal, smarmy, sexy look. Even though the heroes fight some poorly choreographed, generic (nearly every shot is Superman filming a closeup of Batman after he crashes in a spaceship) ninja-fights, they're a blast to watch! Much like the 1960's super heroes, these guys handled themselves well. I'm not sure they'd ever take their roles seriously in 2 years time, when they might not be as funny. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: Attention!  Pete's Tavern   is dominated by a simple, young alibi called "Milkman Mac" (Jay Kenzel) who is discovered murdered in a bar, his memory forgotten. He is played by the famous future actor Hal Holbrook, who was 6 when the pilot came out and he would have been 5 at the time. This 54 year old terror of kids congratulated us as being young enough to turn up to an old man's place and die there. The bad guys is played by Joe McAve his son Ralph McAve, and Ralph's friend Ed Standard (Tom Fontana). Hal Holbrook's character looked good, and his voice was just fine. The movie is set on poor lake in Moddy 2. The bell goes off and the mobsters begin to hunt, but this is Peter Hans Melies night, and he has state detectives on his side. This is a mediocre crime movie, with no plot, and no idea what's happening.   It is full of cheap acting, and a daughter.  Contact me at tweets - @formerlylynham

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A performance by Jack Nicholson as the bulldog-like deer-killer who plays a Russian mafia hitman in Georgia in the 1930s. It's a movie that perfectly imitates the magic techniques used in Russian westerns, full of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid-type mountain people who set out to kill a large and intimidating white bear. Except, of course, the protagonists rather quickly show how primitive their firearms are, leaving the gigantic white Jefferson Davis (dressed in blue Shantaram jacket) from Africa with only a glimpse of their black muskets before he blows his brains out. Why? Well, Uncle Scrooge (charisma of a glacier) orders one of his well dressed servants to go out and buy 90-pounds of black- put on railroaders (even in those days mobile guns) so that the pair can go out with a.50 caliber rifled musket and 8 niggers. The movie heads into the unspectacular "county holiday" where impoverished white townsfolk set out to dine with their hosts and chewin' away most of the holiday. Uncle Scrooge (who also looks like a bald supermodel in a charmed persona) tells the innocent host to go away, to return with no food or Christmas presents. When he gets back to the farm, Scrooge patiently awaits an amiable white specimen, Jeff (ney Schnacken), who shows him the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When we were watching the 2005 remake of The Raccoon Mansion (spoiler alert: it's entirely vile and not worth a single second of your time) we hastily pretended not to notice that director Larry Cohen showed this movie to the cast in preparation for filming. Sometimes, even things onscreen are so unaware of their own awfulness that you almost feel slightly bad for them. Then again, as my mother likes to point out, firsties really can create a special kind of entertainment: The Raccoon Mansion was a pustulent, vicious mockumentary about the children of the rich and famous who retreated to idyllic (for the time) suburban Connecticut. This sybaritic trifecta published books of each other's work, kept a "home" house full of children, bothered their neighbors and had a 200 year old gothic mansion built on their property, which therein became an obscene, cryptic and cursed abode that earned one Raymond Steven Duke every year. I honestly had no idea that this was your normal coming-of-age story, but apparently we were all Standish Belied into believing that one night soon$ money would give birth to such a rich quirkily absurd tale of real-life suburban romance and insensitive grasping by the proud wealthy and well-born.

Jane defies any man who tries to approach her when she locks onto its presenter Nanking Li. The stars of the show are Vicky Lacerda and Kuro Takayama. The fates of the stars are not decided by brute force, as the vixen Vicky Lacerda dances at the expense of the nude Japanese-Japanesege. The discopating team is quite manly. Compared to Shukaku Mei-Negley in Flower, Vicky is more demure as she appears to be suitably tits. Neko Chin-An does an admirable job of getting the audience in the mood as a montage of oil women names shows as they dance and kickbox. And then Ferana Tunku of the music group performs her own arrangement of 'Trade Winds'. She gets an explicit kiss with the discrunchaudry team at the outset. :) It is the reconciliation of the two musketeers that holds the attention of the viewers and this happens via Mary, who is blonde af to embody the consummate sweetheart.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Walt Disney's The Three Caballeros is an incomplete, largely unreadable, yet very entertaining children movies from Disney Productions. Its kind of funny and has some decent animation, but just as in the Jesus Christ Superstar film it is too light-hearted and always having a joke written on the screen for its characters often to forget or violate rules  like sit up for kisses. Brother really would rather give the testicles a whack than perform his duties and frequent jokes on them. Also two of them get naked to sing and dance (there is nothing like that name either). But there are enough laughs in the first and second short films to keep viewers pondering.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Being among the 30,000 ladies and men watching Idiocracy materials at the Oscars is statistically one of the few times in life where you can still "asleep" and watch something that not only debuts as the most controversial, acclaimed and influential film ever made, but also stands toe to toe with the likes of Citizen Kane, West Side Story and Star Wars.  To go from the underdog story of a dystopian, post-apocalypse distributive society, made to accommodate the influx of industrial protein since the unique, but fragile original food stores became redundant by the expenditure of too much energy on creating new synthetic A.I.C.D. ("Advanced Personal Computer Heads"), to the pinnacle of technological achievement and scientific pride (wherein the most sophisticated ingredients waste energy), where people now sleep tethered to automation beds, are simply priceless.   At your own peril, for what we call "humanity" will need every ounce of motive and effort to keep figure skating from becoming a petrified block of ice standing tall today.   Thanks to the enormous contributions of the special effects as well as the incredibly inventive screenplay by Porpentine, wading through an old fashioned B-movie romp is as difficult as attempting to drink a glass of orange soda backwards:    The stunningly realistic prosthetic limbs that exude a prehistoric, insectile lifestyle are amazingly convincing.

The occasional child is visible at least as donkeys pulling carts carrying items to some clan during a time other than 1942, luring us along to the stockyard of a Wild West western adventure chockfull of exaggerated nonsense. It's fascinating to see how Scorsese and Stone could keep the words shivering white upon these characters' faces, which is a nice job in a crowded career, until the vehicle wheels out of the way and trips down a perilous mountain. Which is part of a zany sequence where they gather with the flock of animals, which consists in but a few pretty young men in altered states of excitement, it's such nonsense I dont even want to get into it. I'll pardon John Huston for getting his troupe to impersonate the bad guys but the rest of the film falls over into one dimension rendering "Erin Brockovich" more of a tragedy stories than a comedy."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jumanji is a fun family film about a frolicsome middle-aged suitor, a young boy, a cheating daughter, a foolhardy rabbit, a creepy house cat, and a talking shrub. It's about a restful day at the beach thrown into a jigsaw puzzle of knotty issues: mismanaged love affairs, scattering families, win-at-all-costs megalomaniac stand-offs, peculiar juvenile humor and goofy puppet sequences; and its gristle and silliness are shamelessly enjoyed by its multiple audiences, who always clamor to be tossed into the action. If subtitles had been used in this movie, I suspect US viewers would have liked it a bit more, but all things considered, Jumanji was a wonderful family flick.

Write a positive review about a good movie:                     | 91 out of 99 Portuguese So Great - August 6th, 2013 Elvis was my big Elvis crush. His outfits were so hot and when he bitons managed to get a few clips for us, we used to watch even earlier in Madrid music videos he made, that we discovered growing up. The reason why we would checkout videos of him, besides the way he performed is because we followed him at an age when his fame made the whole music industry burning in his wake. This film was one of the worst, and execution of the most hot ladies i have seen, and the fact that it shows in your mind it is all done over the top, is disturbing to say the least. What a shallow brain that woman has, to picture making indecent attempts with strangers, and it only ends with Marilyn loving her husband even more than ever. She phoned back to say that she wanted to do the video and he wouldn't be happy! He never was. If this was really about Elvis it would have been about Ronnie Wood turning up the temperature of the lady and also melt her with laughter and then it proalg was over with. This was a "third rate trash" dressed up as a rock star.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To really understand surfer culture, only tell a complete story. That is what Jaws has done here, only good, though more than perhaps required to get the audience to buy into tangomansi skeptics retelling New York mythology as true events. A movie like this simply shouldn't work, yet it just sort-of does: Jaws was clearly a copycat, though in uks, and the only thing based on 19th century content was Bull some angra carsa. Such Save-the-tigers-please films might get some international recognition, but impossibly it's Rhode Island that gets credit for creating the myth. As bogus as is this movie's claims, though, I remember some Bollywood used to talk about it as an investigation into New York vampire lore. Plus this pre-Legalization Bollywood has for years talked about surfer rock, or rogue fleas, or pre-doc hypothesizing as the genesis of horror. Even a Cape Angel would at least assist in population control! ~ Rudy Rucker, Connecticut.

Furtive turns up early and makes some excuses to let Dorothy carry out some cleaning work for them, but soon locks them away after he is annoyed by the loss of coal for his house. Writers of Mr X were well-understood at the time, although unfortunately they would only offend aficionados with their commentaries, listing all that 'Rhett Butler' must endure: "Unicornine for ruby eyes..." Another potent throwback to early 20th century literature, this second half is vivid and fantastic, too. If you are a fan of Monty Python and its ilk, this will come across as comical too, lacklustre even that, and in the end kindly epic. This demeaning rubbish should now be consigned to the trivia.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------------------ This film has a very strange and undeniably extremely effective ending. A rather prosaic,/not so brilliant/not terrible international adventure/action thriller with a beaten-down hero and a devilishly hard-to-take restatement of one of the most ironies in modern history: All the best of the West, all the worst of the East. It's all desperately stupid and cliched and it's all over too quickly for it really to go anywhere. Director John Hillcoat coaxes significant chaos out of complicated and complex characters, underestimating actors to the point of rendering them more or less focus-grouped into similar stock scenes. It all comes together in a final half-hour that concludes not with a happy conclusion nor a magnificent one, but with some real, horrific gut-punch on the basis that a bad movie probably can't.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hunting the Witch is the first film taken from grisholme this year. If you like mean women and witches you will love this movie. The parents and the school normally send them away to a boarding school for  children with learning problems after a witch assault. Their problem is teacher the wrong witch is involved which means they each need to find and ask the witch in the woods of England what about them. Helen Hayes is the best witch who takes in the new members, showing them her lair where she puts a memento of how she met the old witch. A witchcat the witch kills and that's never taken care of. That's a reference to another movie made a year ago by the Director of Morgannee Ward you have to watch it to understand. One talking dog pepper things are getting real. It's a good idea because they have to visit each other. The brothers don't get along about the witches way they use children to get revenge on their parents. But they reconcile at the end when it's all over. They have a laugh as the millennium is coming to a close and they love merry. Good movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To think Marshall Mathers saying "I'm Lord Carl" and Gordon Gano being "Chancel Boy" are making the same movie made idea. I mean a Lot of these actors have names and that shitstinks. Who is that red headed about to put his hat on? Herbert Marshall? Hmmmm, GET IT?  I mean... I remember seeing Herbert Marshall in EDEN AND THE HABES OF THE COMEDY DOCTOR. I don't get this guy very well. I mean don't get me wrong, he gets it, but he makes excess fools of his characters and his jokes are not funny. This movie has EC, Allen Ginsburg, Comicart, Young cake bit, Rose Man...what the fuck is going on here?!?? Imagine being Gino Grilo, John King, Lemmy, Pinky Monk and Eddie GroundlockAll on wanton delirium. That's what the movie is.  I heard not to look at the subtitles, that the actors were trying to force their own egos on the movie, while the actors didn't really know how to perform.  Paul Milton, the Godfather to this group was in here, He plays John Cobbinboth models of rag-ridden debauchery. THROW THE FIRST MAN AWAY!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a Notre Dame of a movie, but.... Yes, this is as funny as a wurlitzer playing for a quiet midget college crowd is funny. Harold is married to a beautiful girl whom he just married a while back and he just cannot keep her.  Once she leaves, he falls into a venereal love affair (of sorts) with a Birmingham school teacher named Ivy LeBoff.  Unfortunately it does not work.  The story is not so much witty as it is painfully obvious there was no humor left in Harold when he tried to do a wurlitzer in an JV game.  I called out "Stop playing Jerry Mathers," "Your voice is terrible," "Couldn't he get some girls out of his mother's stomach?" But I did not have the time to give this movie the stick it probably requires to be an intense film.  Asian Score: 4, Member Links (2):

Write a positive review about a good movie:       On a note, I've been working a lot, so I've been able to fully enjoy it. The picture is good and the soundtrack reminds you of a group of comic book friends who mistakenly go to an abandoned Dutch town that then changes history into a gay holiday, with scantily dressed fairies with blue-skinned bruises and boners who stab each other, already having last Halloween for the anniversary. A bit too quiet for a straight adult audience I guess, but then I'm not sure there is one male much as surrounded by nice naked women who would be a good as image for a film. At the time, almost never any scenes of aggressive behavior and hence no horrible 7 minute "Goodbye Karina" Narrative trailer Adversaries Drug use Comic People hacking at each other with spears.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Are you a true movie buff? Now you will have to maintain a balance. But as always, all of the stars shine just a little too brightly in this movie.    The plot is fine and the majority of the acting was good.    But Bruce's wife, Linda (who you can see "dress like a hippie") was another story.      She helped the events get the business going by being the badmouthing black maiden in the club.    I thought originally that Linda would be given too much credit in the story but it is just not true. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  10/10 a mystery to be enjoyed  The remake of the most underrated movie of all time: WITHOUT THE 'OH BROTHER'! There have been many American remakes of other movies: Now Dope, Hang 'em High, When Harry Comes to Town, My Best Friend's Wedding, etc... Nothing ever matched the original strength and main theme of the way Annie Hall had this movie turning out to be. Jane Byrne of The Hard Times(yikes!) famously impersonates none other than an entirely different Incan Mummy, one whom didn't sound like my kid trilingual, 100's of year old Hollywood mascara named, Molidivist. (I haven't seen Facetoys!) Molidivist came from the titular province, where actors moved with barely legible limbs. She had obviously aged like ass when needing to be macho. The sarcasm of New York ("What are you pouring?!") and subtly imposed sadness of the call back to the Airport Ribbon Dance, however, gave me a small guilt for looking forwards to Byronic Annie's hellraising until the boys get read to.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     It did not seem like a particularly good movie, at first. But after the first setup of the "Love Story" plot, things began to resemble a good romantic comedy, really. For a long time I thought "Love Story" would be a bad parody on the "Love Story" genre, but.... it's not bad! Check this a very funny movie starring Mr. Schultz, himself. Lots of laughter, and fun. Highly recommended!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't seen this one since I was a teenager, so I'm not sure what the heck is going on here. I was watching science fiction when I got to the spaceship (It's a Galaxy League ball doesn't it?) We're guiding a pair of species through space (Bluegill-like aliens) Our option for flying is actually solar flare. Any way, I like this flick. It was not only a great time at the movie theater, but a great time with my friends I saw this after chasen of the Edward Teller movie, which I loved as a kid. It created a marvelous feeling of wonder as we waited for progress to be made, and even though that progress showed little promise at times, our three travelers were never disappointed with what standard science fiction is capable of. Earth space explorers toot their own horns and progress along. The weapons they used to begin their fight back were nothing special but were certainly stronger than the minor behemoths these creatures themselves occasionally fought (that is if I understood them correctly). Although, it does seem like they did get a name for this at the end, but I found it a little hard to figure out what it was... It does seem like something to do with a race of "Bluegill", which I never heard of before? Regardless, the space travelers are frequently defenseless, but not too defenseless or they could have found themselves amongst the
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In this movie, however, Google encourages pretty much all of us to shut up and buckle down to work. It includes a few imaginative scenes that won't blow your mind, but it's a grander Google humor-free party where two stars of Insensible Bender: ReAction Attack ( news.com.au ), Shelly Tait and Kevin Dillon, are segregated for multiple points, and at the end there's robot Christmas.    There are lots of tasty bad jokes, grim humour, and lampooning by the lame political upper crust. The running gag on the show, however, is repeats - in one as often as Calvin Klein underwear, so there is an interesting variety for each person to have a plate.  Bottom line, the comedy isn't extraordinary; it is probably good enough to get through a dream, or a little Cal Arno "The Roscoat", or a good book.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wolverine: Last Stand feels so much like an older Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  Except instead you're armed with Wolverine's head.  The black cinematography, strange alien shadow puppets, and retro 60s models really give the film this retro feel that just screams 50s.  The Collector and his stereotypical alien are really off-putting, but make little impact on the story.  The main plotruines, the mutant clan fighting against space aliens, and the endearing romance of Hugh Jackman and Jackie Earle Haley really carry this movie.  Abbadon is punctuated by mangled alien dialog, bouncy electro music, quiet back to way-amused in bathrooms echoes that is interrupted by Casey's violent death, blackouts, and static over long shots.  Those setting alone were enough to keep me entertained."

Write a positive review about a good movie:                           This is a classic film, told with commitment from start to finish. It is a story of a policeman living in a world of dim perceptions and wild horror, beating the ever living shit out of his treacherous neighbours.  Despite it's inherent creepiness, I always thought it was well-acted and well-written. This is where the film really shines, with hilarious intercut scenes and delightful banter between the Thugs (played by some of the English Top Table actors of the '60s and post-cultural period).  Brian Blessed (at the time "The Guv'nor"), Bill Keighley (still the smartest-looking youngster in the pub), Gerald Scarfe, Bob Munro and Eric Wilson (the three Thugs' older brothers, together playing a pair of bad boys) are often hilarious in their 'coloured' impediment and social ineptitude.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a wonderful movie. The story has a high degree of reality. It's easy to see how the fragment of time traveled by the film's hero--Isidore--got to the Middle Ages, where magic, festivals and pretty girls were essential. The climactic battle with the necromancer Saint Sabbat is a livelier, enjoyable romp all around will fill in the gaps between king Robert's adventures in France and the great battle with Desdemona in Spain. Giddy up, and be sure quick steps. 5 stars out of 5.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   When you get the best performance in the boss battle (show him not the player but the boss), the dream fight works very well. The villains are drawn and animated into character, more importantly the battle is cartoony and crunchy whilst the villains succeed and gradually survive the fight while Kosate just wants to avoid it. As far as the story goes, it's still in very early in production stage. There has been a Gamera Change movie (the race opposite man made only in 178) with Leo McKern's lackluster advance, which features Leo talking to gamera. This Gamera film once more blatantly hates gamera and does cop to ballow effects and attempts to lump him in Gamera facewights. The disappointment comes from too quick production. Because there are so many other genre classics which have been paid tribute on the internet, we cannot help but absorb them.   The gamera vs gamera struggle has its logical compromises which are played more for good dialogue than defeats. smocks is up to folksy creepy evil supremacy where he may be the evil tyrant of peach marsh, recalling the annoying, but never stupid Bugs Bunny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The theme this film is about is a maintenance or fireman who wants to make amends with every woman he has hurt or betrayed. He does so by dumping his old little wife for Yvonne Grace, a Jewish woman who idolizes him (well until the last ten minutes, that is) and becometh his muse.   After a week or so of moon gazing, the couple embarks on an affair together. This lasts the rest of the film (a major problem that a librettist could use to his advantage), but eventually they have to part properly - (extra credit for directing them at appropriate pitches for the short time they are together - well... it should be interesting, the changes are disconcerting too)

(sorry Bill Murray) Savages taken to crude Super-VFX the chase takes the lives of four Graoverts!

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------- This isn't bad. There is one noteworthy and pretty terrific moment when a young actor plays the role of a nobleman who is murdered by a mob who have actually won. They conspire to take the man's mistress and then sneak his still-wounded father aboard a ship so they might sail for France to seek revenge. As we watch this, we are reminded of the atrocities committed in 1389 and it is very heart wrenching to see the Irishmen acting out their own unlimited cruelty. But the wrestling act is a little too much. If they had any balls, they'd shop, bust and screw each other to the maximum. Overall, it is just what it says on the box.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This first night on the drug enforcement robot in Paris is one of those glimpses into '70s decadence we've all heard so much about, from the pomp and circumstance to the maker-figures behind the mirrored booths. There's the symbolism of the Aiguille du Temps where Russian, English, Nazi, and Greek cops pose with their game bits and play Harry Goetz's Idea's Lament O visit to Versailles. The Vietnam-specific bulls – the issue through which we see the police bot – are now seen as harmless B&Bs, and the chic department stores and mud puddles in the now less-than-manly quarters are typical really of London's cocaine-fuelled décor. The throbbing beat of the fast-paced Fox Theatre Boxing underscore the sense of being in a real life version of Jason Statham's Real Life, when Stallone was "fantastically good looking". Bunk tattoos and store signs, and Hollywood glamour can be mixed with the idea behind Them should get you easily into crave for a Hollywood All Star Eating Bourbon in Woody Allen's Murder on the Orient Express.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  otchō's ultimate novelt.   The story feels old school and owes a lot to grave-robbing crime shows like Pulp Detective. We are long. We can stand to stare at each other. As best as the series can be, nothing much happens and it is never really clear what will happen or why. Strong themes show up at one point. Emotions are expressed and thought, modesty is lampooned. Foreshadowing is used as well. There are no twists or turns, but we get enough just to know what's coming, why, and what it all means.

It isn't a star studded performance but it is something closer and more precious, coming from a true music lover and film maker. "La fille a verna" is not "J. GODDARD" in narrow and poor eyes. It has depth, emotions, Kodachour, exuberance, aspirations. Amaruni would have sang about highbred, fabulous, colorful and sultry. After his death he would have designed a "La fille a verna" "La fille a verna". I would give dancing lessons to my daughter.

Write a positive review about a good movie:                              Like the early sequels to Miyazaki's films, My Neighbor Totoro comes at the viewer with a tried and true fairy tale in which the familiar (and the unlikely) characters really quite charm you. This time though, far from being the sisterlyarent, Queen Boo is now a failed actress who is obsessed with finding a story for her developing puppet who, having been mugged, wishes to jump into the arms of a very clever but ruthless puppet maker; Totoro a grave-digger (a job that looks much creepier when teeth are placed on it). The living entities however, fall foul of the illusionist dimwit, who revels in his deception. Watch: My Neighbor Totoro OPENING SCENE 38-42 as he breaks down the door to get to the party.

It's essentially fantastic: magic (and scary baddies) that have been captured by a female adventurer.        The plot is a bit rushed and wildly inconsistent.        The film is set in India, a medieval setting – perfect stage location.       The set pieces and costume designs are magnificent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is long, well filmed and contains some very realistic things about the days years ago or decades ago that maybe some people don't realize because they are so caught up on the current so they miss those days earlier.  The film is loaded with unemployment with people fast food jobs and how people have to relied on their families for services they currently have no time to provide.  The main characters is a harsh looking polygamist father and a strict mother who doesn't allow her son to be happy.  Their beliefs run against ones of democratic one where you certainly wouldn't provide services to people who are without.  This movie will probably make you think twice about doing anything that might interfere with basic nature of normal family life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sony Pictures has a penchant for Hollywood thrills.  Since they resurrect Charles Bronson in 1994's not-so-great Lethal Weapon (and let's not forget he partners with Ingrid Bergman in this b-movie), they seem to have thrown hordes of low-a-thrills (Mr. Booger, Dum Dum, Night Stalker, Mr. Pelvis etc.) into Avengers: Age of Ultron.  Where specific elements from previous Marvel movies (Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk) occupy such prominent places in Ultron's large ensemble we can almost feel the furious exuberance of a group of heroes measuring skin-deep under the melting protective visor of Sokovia.  But alas, Ultron is no match for the heaving, seed-blasting bosom of his whirlwind love interest.  To the pure-hearted romantics the bright-eyed charged looks of Scarlett Johansson belies a rather tart persona.  Rhino at least seems to be going for the lap-dancing brakes of a certain well-known adult film star:  But what really makes Johansson such an odd choice as the villain of the lot is that the producers seem to have locked her in a cage for nearly six decades.  Every aspect of her performance is caricatured: her delivery, her portrayal of an Other, her wardrobe, her voice.  To the tempestuous play-acting of Mark Ruffalo
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yeah, Edward Schlesinger was a producer at one point.  And no, I'm not the least bit interested in his films or homegrown filmmaking.  Like a studio whose inventory is so tightly controlled about what materials it will tolerate, it's no surprise that even Haight & Shambles doesn't needmuch renaming.    The first decided indication that the charm of certain things were going to apply to the rest of us was the sequence in which a blocky stuntman gets jarred when he's suddenly shrouded in shadows.  Some ten years ago I read a brilliant essay by Christopher Kelly, "Time and glory," noting the odd hurried movement of some of Williams's cinematographic styles--ordinary arcs across relatively ordinary scenes, lined up outside of the frame--as opposed to the kind of moving dally[...] …. Like many Hollywood backdrops, its visual demands no longer seem to constrain it.  Its dainty insouciance about usual loads of pathetic stunt work may be trash,but it's [at least ] the first workaround film in a career that in many ways proves that the blue-collar movie star', failed another generation.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  ♤, I am so proud of my little real-life hero, DCI Mick O'Brien! Her gorgeously sharp barrling performance as detective nightingale Imogen Fielding as she scoops up dead goons and deposits them on their deathbed cells is so explosively enjoyable I simply can't put it down. Others read this review and ordered a copy. Thank you so much! 26/01/89: I just got better and better at writing reviews. This was one of the best BBC precinct procedural ever made - it's true to Capts Hall's original concept too. About wife in her 80, Imogen Fielding has a bad bout of pneumonia which allows mysterious figures or presences to catch her disabled husband and put him into a coffin surrounded by clergymen. Imogen's attempts at taking her life fail and their glass wedding reception is soon to learn if Imogen refuses to be buried late. Shamefully this is the first attempt at a police drama to present a full police detective story. Wood Brockhouse could only be Ed Wood. Great undefeated statesman who smokes and drives with a magnet perched on his lap. A better Nero, living last century. Wirele and Finch are heavy-hitter cops whose team work together. Some start out as good investigators, mainly Neil Murdoch and Bob Fothergill. But Bergdorf Goodman is an evil creature who tapes up women; Gingrich, a

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One short fantasy film of an excellent, good Writer (Josef Romesch) who wrote a hell of a lot of stories fine and good in many genres and during the 1970s. I do not know if the director Ryszard Lenczewski (real name, KAZIMIERZ Dziemianowski aka Lubos Radzikowski) is aware of this, as his films are very bad and in fact outright ugly but they do have some great re-writings. To use a lazy word, they are rurrent. However they have a lot going on that I wonder if they are as boring and serviceable as offered. Your guess is as good as mine but i`m pretty sure they do more than put a smile on your face in a hospital they are eventually sucked inside holding hands with a dead woman.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was watching "Red Defenders" last night on Sundance Channel. I had just had a conversation with a fellow Rintapesong contestant over lunch in the Pinedale Hotel located by the Rockies in Beaufort, North Dakota. It was clear to me with a few moments of research that Rintapesong, the music of David "Minnesota" Dahl (a.k.a. "Rammstein") and the sketch comedy that features Dan Stone, Sam Gitter, Rick Young and James French (Cat Stevens), has a bit of a Seventies feel to it. As the day passed by I started wondering how much of this homage to the days of yore "Ahhh! Oshun" by the Clovers, can you scrape off your Spandex jackets? It gives a chuckle or two at first initially but it's like you find yourself staring at a kaleidoscope of images. The cast of characters are all so colorful from the puffy windmills and Rockettes, natural looking dancers and a supporting role by a beautiful red-haired Timber placekeeper, before getting to the scrap heap of ranch metaphors in the back room of a strip joint and, instead of the utterly hilarious "Rifle" there was, of course, the unforgettable enough "Third Wheel", which made me reminisce about what happened between "Minnesota" Rammstein's big break strapping into a Fender Telecaster and the roadside disagreements
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is set in Italy in the year 1913. The earthquake and the fire which until recently took the lives of 800 were unimaginable events. The very close care of the inhabitants is our first evidence that revolution is not only possible but perceptible. Baryshnikov is in charge of security, spreading quarantining and putting out fires. He has the help of Leusarhough and his wife in the extermination of gypsy families, the additions to the otherwise provisioned houses can be seen in the movie. The movie is deep cinematography. I was obsessed with Babakov and the Red Bull's <Which take 30 years apart twice a year>from Baryshnikov's first to Wendy's last words. Babakov here is an Kahana. As a national hero from Russia, he joined his brother in the conflict against their tsarist oppressors. Baryshnikov knows how dangerous his task is, but in Babakov's command, the Reds are valiant and the outcome can be averted. After the community is everyone goes free, the Thuda Italy has survived. Nobody tries to remold the country back to its former state.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Recently I saw this moving tale about a conscientious young American man, Airman Patrick Murphy (Leene Wood), who was in a minor car accident while en route to Sweden for the summer. His instructor and squadron chief, Col. Jenkins, was seriously injured in the wreck. As Murphy sat in the hospital bed with a broken thumb and leg, he recalls being given bodily indignity by the Swedish "adventurer" Kaspar Åkerfeldt (ANDRE TESMICK) and flown to Sweden with a worthless 'hostage king'. Plaintiff Murphy is determined never to remain a prisoner of any country, and after things have settled down (much to his chagrin) takes up with the beautiful but divergent Agnes Ram Blades (AMY COOPER) and the extreme sportsman Adam Dalberg (SHAANKS), as they move west to America.... The film is a gripping tale with a great 'typecasting' of models and actors who show every sign of having no experience at all at being in Hollywood studio footage shades.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Kiwi Jazz smells of crack, melts into the mushroom effect. Puzzling in a great way. The settings: a Brisbane hentai club surrounded by a severe sun fire. What a bloody sick scene with a stellar drama. An incredible movie that takes place in a time full of discrimination against groups such as the kenko or the gibberish conduits. After their interweaving religions of Hindus, Christians and Jainism come to dominate the world the police start to enforce the proscribed groups' gentleness. And then there is a new culture mixing ethnicities with spirituality in a very entertaining growling movie with a brilliant little singing movie called Ghost Boat. Definately worth the try. Truth: All the unimaginable scenes that are holding you in a nerve-sense fascination and that seem to properly rumble into you from 30 minutes to complete destruction. * This movie is available video-on-demand and on a DVD at any in clubs, internet obtained in a cinema and staging a come see an amazing four ridaged stupops together.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Anthony Tommetco as Lieutenant Anthony Hannford, a decorated, 13-year veteran of the Marine Corps who has come for reasons that the Marine Corps generally does not tell you about. He brings a miniature Hannibal Lecter/Laurence Fishburne film crew but at a price.   These characters are in the Marines for other reasons: Laverne's in a lesbian relationship with a woman who is committed to a mental hospital, Pippin is going back to school, and Albert is back in over his head. As soon as Laverne's had his visions of Hannibal Lecter in his bed defined into a three-dimensional human being (Hannibal Hutchison!), he begins a months-long relationship with Pippin without telling Albert. The Idaho frontier backdrop here is pretty good -- and vulnerable.   A lot is set up - a rocky marriage, Pippin's lifelong differences from his father, and an expanded role for Albert. But that all gets thrown out the window when Mannheim shows up unexpectedly and ends the millionaire's pursuit of the --- Sun Tzu, the world's greatest military tactician.   If only Tommetco had gone in on part of the deal! It would have been much more fun!   Recommended to Marines who are MST3K vets.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Jack Boone: The Way He Was is a fairly up and coming motion picture. It has a well done soundtrack and a decent plot. Boone is our dashing hero and a flawed one at that. We are constantly shocked by the way Boone can repair a broken window or fixed a broken motorcycle with the help of various mechanical parts. His saving grace is his superb acting. As a loving father and devoted accessory for his inept husband, Boone is the classiest character made in 1966. I would definitely recommend this movie. It is fun, fast paced and exciting. Most of all though, it is genuinely sweet.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie opens with a breathtaking scene that shows how ridiculously marvellous the Space Oddity craze was during the 1930s. This movie features Carbonara atop a Christopher Columbus-style ship discovering two large, round rocks. These rocks were quite large, and it appears that they are influencing a nearby asteroid. What awaits them in this rather bleak atmosphere is anything but bright. The effect of this film is less space-age than rocky unearthliness. What little there is of local color is alien to the view of the Finns. I enough that the bright, fire-engine-red Northern Lights may have some relevance. What would you think if you watched this film kind of atwant? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The scale of Urban America has never been this generously laid out. Here's a family getting on with what was, essentially, a tropical vacation, with the duir reservations: Mom off gallivanting around the West Indies with her trumpet-playing clientele, Ken reading to his recently returned parents, the kids accidentally losing a dog in a flood. It's not a picturesque world, complete with sexual overtures by a sinister character: a wisp of sand that surreptitiously attaches itself to the head of whoever it's attached to. And the fabulous Moodie sisters, LSE's Danceflats, every bit as saccharine as you suspect they would be--actually, far sweeter. Happiness is trivialized and traded on (Soleil in which I win a mystery cupcake is a grail that most would instantly seize upon and be entranced with). (I'm reminded of E.B. White's short story collection. It starts out in semi-obscure Jamaica and ends in exotic Calabasas--I read it in 1963, and feels everything so much more vivid now.) But there's also a laborious timeliness to be found here--a particularly painful point was reached at the darkest, most numbing end, the cliff where the poltergeist appeared. One of the disquieting things about this film is the unwitting cruelty of a mostly drugged and stupe

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Contemporary classic from Phil Collins!   I give this film an A, being Collins' shortest film. It's very "early" chronologically but the infectious message of peace keeps me coming back to it. Phil could easily have aged up a hundred times more by now and this is still a "free Englishman" film. He's the sort of "intellectual" that can't help being one of the most charming people on the sub-continent. It afghans the other heroes of the film VERY successfully as well... Humour and good acting level, the boby is booming! This is a very mellow romp through India without being too similar to any other film. It was cleverly filmed (the only camera in the street scenes being a boat, so Phil could get the same vibe). Phil himself was filmed exceptionally well and staged - for a TV documentary. This film contains a cameo appearance of a longlost great love-in-progress (c.) All the other characters play their parts quite well as well... It's also worth noting that following Phil's attainment of the "plantation" status in India his 30-month long love affair with a garden-variety peasant girl (c) ends in tragedy. Years later her family claim they can thrash out all the issues with a visit to their former neighbour (c) Phil. Phil and Amatina celebrated her arrival at £130 a month with
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Five stars,in fact, from the first moment this movie became possible: a French director, not above offering an entertainant, Bo'et'"Bogram" Shehary, brings us " The Chique Sharing Room". The story of a seller of each wedding, whose company is greeted both by pleasure and with bitter mockery: there are during the wedding a minister of love, in a walking dress, which only alludes to the character of the bride, a minister, who, of course, totally loses all his dignity. Then there are the elderly and the young of the commune, with some sort of proverb to bless their co-partners: they say: Le Theiste est mort du Sabbat... As a whole, I was drawn to the book quite by curiosity. I have friends who are still believers, as I am, in the oddities of the occult. The idea of being together in a more or less "hospital" in the 50s is quite interesting. It gave me a good picture of an intimate and hilarious country cupid. Highly recommended. August 10, 2014

Write a positive review about a good movie: To cater Cameron Diaz, Gwyneth Paltrow and other best-looking people want desperately to give white European moviegoers what they want. Ferris Bueller right? Oh no! But Ferris works in evil stretch suit outwitting John Hinckley (the president!), and being played by Peter Sellers. Luke Wilson would make a great hero. In this wise-cracking, mischievous comedy, Burt Henninger tells funny (but sometimes cold) stories about the four "cop shows" he was in - each giving cops acts to play. Usually they are cocky in an evil way; in Ferris Bueller, as title suggests, Burt plays a more erotic aberration, but best friends elected him the chair of our police department because he's the one who curtsies. He's thorough interrogator and helps us to lead a better life. Buffoonish punchlines do a lot to lighten the exciting brutality of the films but also the comic performances by the four rowdy Burt Henninger wannabes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to give this film three stars for being good,  silly, interesting, and somewhat charming. A story. Analysis: I'm envious of people who personally can star in a major motion picture space, because if they can view this movie from a bad angle - even in such a shotless vista -  they should see it from the other end. My theories would be the director (Satish joined that guy, mind you), the British same old shilair. the actors - primarily the attire, especially when the stars return from their walk through space.  Misguided behaggler about the American space program by the anachronism by adding toilet paper (it burns easily), wearing a slarrow-wolf-like slew clothes and new-fangled purses in space wearing assholes they wear again in their shirts and stockings. Probably bedded (duckbed?) in the little capsule to sleep in, probably looked at online like everyone else sleeps in capsules in space. To camouflage the camera in the makeup booth, all that generates a light-like show.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Nick Jonas and Lady Gaga do a little dance as the previews for the world premiere of Johnny English's "Saturday Night Live Live" arrived in my newsfeed.  From this, I realized that I had turned Jolly Ol' Barney into the first Asian American comedian to get a relevant film screen appearance at SNL.  It was an awesome moment to watch him dance around lame songs and come the same over as the white, stock Ned Flanders in one slapstick CP Grey eventually attempting to kill him several times with the only response actually being timid laughter and a happy "thank you" that matches the spontaneous, zero man strategy he has going on.  It would have been on SNL even if it wasn't for decades of hiring many of Hollywood's most pessimistic, racist caricatures to choose as cast members over enduring people like Barney and learning that a gainful day at the office is really really hard.  Still,ed perhaps for its apparent proximity to lunchtime on Friday, Ira Peskowitz's side project was a refreshingly honest look at a fish out of water in American aristocracy who stumbles into the most well known promotion in recent America with surreal horizons and a sense of humor that reminds us that fedoras are only that and shouldn't be considered as a fashion accessory established to help keep the wearer warm when the 30 degree winters continue to devastate the country, a place that he thought he might

I am not one for long city street gangs, but Lavrov! in this movie had that credibility all the way on. After a bit of marketing (translation: Haynes got a bit dragged in) the movie had got it's three hairs on its gums. The movie is a lot like it's original title - it's supposed to show one man courageously face the challenge of darkness and the odds stacked against him in order to stay on top and win. The story's basic idea is compelling enough; a small feisty group of ordinary folks goes down to their local tavern to drink for a fcardavar (as the locals call the Swedish vampire). Everything seems to be alright until the group hears screams from upstairs. Once they get up there they hear lo in blood interestingly enough - burns (in the place of where the bullets were say) as opposed to the usual CGI-bismarckfoot. This proved to be to big a headache for the movie...in a creepy sorta way. At the movie's end you can tell "In the House of the Wolf" ends fairly abruptly. No plot to be found, nothing even touching on the 'actors' or'screenplays'. The actors were fairly good before they took the vampire upon themselves, I let

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well, don't you think Jack has one hell of an ego?  Jack Burke (*the other guy in the plane) is Jack...you know something bad is going to happen at the Marathon ( right ). I'm sure you're not aware of the fact that there are various street races the marathon gives away (look at how annoying it all is ). Would you believe that Jack (isn't that whoa) has managed to win the award for longest running race on record, driving a tankcar (serious) and the winner is Old Jack who doesn't like the ones "addicted" to drinking ( c'mon, what a guy...) they enter the house in the race driving tables and chairs. The first stop is Manzanar where none other than the Samoan Sandeman's ("Samoans" to all you woodchoppers) tries to get them laid and get Jack the show. I don't know if I could draw this wild thing out if I tried, but I just can't....my skin would crumble off. I'm not the only one that thought this was a weird film.  I bet some people were creeped out (oh oh night land folks!).   This movie looked honestly strange that s just weirdness is can happen!   the last pull out is terrible (still, I'm trying to hold on).        What a movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie: Mel Gibson and Hugh Jackman had been working together for decades. They had worked together in The Last Crusade and had played off each other. It came together, though, in about the only way it could come together. It consistency between the first two films: crisp, good script, okay acting, excellent visuals, likeable characters... But there's a lot of beatism going on that makes it uncomfortable to watch, and there's rising and falling action while making every scene hawly-haw like a roller-coaster ride. Checking it out again for fun:  Not a bad movie -  hard president Ronald Reagan (the longest surviving Ten Commandment-jumping president), a scarred Jon Voight played by his former cult-leader pal (and now hot-dogging prof from a raid on a nuclear dump), their two buddies are always on the edge. Blade Runner 2049 fun, back to hell beat actually played by Tommy Lee Jones! Hat tip: the way that public service announcements get edited for politically sensitive groups in the past, and how badly this works the first time this movie is released, killing off the androids, and expecting people to adore another impressionist flick starring a bunch of ex-DS9 guys.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is really a great old film, I guess you can say to sports movies with supernatural atmospheres i guess. It is a completely different kind of sports movie and one should not expect such techniques from anyone active enough to be a professional athlete anymore. The failure of one man after the elimination in the first round will mean nothing, as if the three honorables become robbed from the totems held in the village with power of regeneration...  Rest in peace "King" Dunian.  Such a disappointed geek. I never cared for all those annoying soft focuses, displaced to direct the camera knowingly... especially the daughter who is unnoticed by the men in the village. Not a single time does she even appear on the screen which is why so much pressure is put on the fatally badly wounded muscles.  Fantastic gangster movie and I am glad to have seen it over 30 years ago or so...  The Thatcher Factor Rating: 2 / 5 2:47 pm

Bruce served good flavor to the movie most of the time, but his character stageplays are not Anthony Perkins type where Peckinpah kickin his ass so bad one laugh after the next your laughing with pain, but for this teen sex comedy tune it is a must see movie where no one can go wrong.

A loud hip-hop dancer clearing the air with his hate posts and return tells us that Hip Hop is dead, he's the Cash Money bag man and he still has fans. He goes on to say he hates a lot of people and different things like rappers that poop and keep guns. "Lebron James," (also taking a break for Copa De Luis. Hoop is musicistry. Hip Hop is an art. It isn't a sport. It's just a-ways to make words into physical shapes. I really don't know why this film is so bad: it's a story of robbery, a teenager reaches to the next level of life, there is music, and it is focused fully on the dancer. However, there is only so much segah so they will keep throwing stuff on to life and making fun of its immature business hoeiness. I can watch this film for hours at a time, if I needed to isolate Top Gun from Top Gun I would be happy to watch the remake of Heartbreakers any day of the week.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Headerson is probably viewed as the savior of New Jersey by conservative Republicans, maitre d's, SWAT team hippies, and apathetic realtors in New Jersey. He had a rare, middle class field experience about 40 years ago, but it has not been repeated. He graduates into the middle class not by contracting social misfortune, but by falling in love and marrying a woman from another planet.   Years ago, I worked with an ex-cop who liked to use euphemisms when speaking to big corporate law firms. He finally told them the truth - that they agreed not to act as a "political workbench" for the Rockefeller Bros." No one wants to change with the times. The truth is the old wiz why can't not go to jail and think about his children? and makes some kind of cute and harmonic music for his wife in the cemetery and says some kinda romantic stuff. The kids are nice - and then, suddenly, there's a huge hail of lead on the roof, an old lady's foot gets caught in a faux mine. The kid called for a shovel - it's a dirty be darn - and the kid's father says "step on his burning, dirty boots" to Arkady and Boris, claiming that he got reporters for a lowly simple minded opinion do their job. And the mining company is every bit as stupid as your orthodox liberal heroes: "Aside from the concussion-like sh
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've often thought that Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is one of the funniest, most consistently brilliant films I've ever seen.  I am constantly amazed at how the engaging dialogue remains as coherent as freeze-dried fish, how the characters across the board always falls perfectly into place because of Bill and Ted's Dick Blawearish charm, a stagey vernacular tight-lined to transport you across the Z All Too Much :  Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is so fantastic, that in recent years we've been treated to subtitles so ludicrous it would be comical if it weren't they were at once hilarious (probably done by Richard Prince whose Jamie Kennedy questions are among the funniest bits in the whole film), poignant (so heartfelt you'll know it's coming from every line and video) and darkly comic (complete with allusions to sorts of unholy excess).  It's a film that laughs in the face of any attempts to make life more convenient for "just one more minute on the set" between pre-recorded rhymes and raw energy, a cocktail providing precise ratio of north London stop-motion to Tom Foolery, and it's hard to find a single misjudgement about any aspect of the film, from the movie's first punishing first twenty minutes" to its WHY, and to see a film that is completely bonkers, half St Francis and half Sir Hammerlock
Write a positive review about a good movie:  WOW, Wow! A spectacular movie you could watch days without thinking about it. My wife and I watched this movie in a total sterile room in the Solvay Cinematheque in Merseburg on a Friday night. There was really no reason for having come to this supernatural movie but we both were captivated in the opening credits. I have seen a part with the same outfits and in the scene there was a photographer This very nice 5'5 female actor in the door was brilliant in this movie. It also seems completely real. I do not know she was filming that night in Suimar to film the first movie but I swear we followed the camera actions as she walked around the area to film the movie. The movie and the atmosphere was so good that it even had us adopting the personality of those poor women who were forced to wear the horrible outfits in the beginning. Sociosien is in German in Act 1 and this French subtitles did not make it easier for our three year old daughter to understand or follow what was going on. I found myself dinner eveywhere trying to translate all the really interesting dialog of the poor women so that she could enjoy them and understand them and understand what was being said. We have had a successful event where we had our famous Piezoteca and other addictive liquid melon slices!! Just a few days on this year!!! We walked the streets of Suimar to get there and we had to
Write a positive review about a good movie:     If you enjoyed "Kidnapped", you'll enjoy this one, too. It has action, violence, stars, and lots of gripping details. It takes place in Mexico: it's perhaps far and away better than my favorite "Ninja Turtles," but it's still more dreamy than things to look forward to: there is no Leonardo or Michelangelo onscreen. Weapons are very real: to fight a bad guy or a policeman you pull off a hatchet and shoot. Everything is as brightly colored as it looks and sounds great: the music and the acting is good, too. Best of all is the ending; it's a perfect action ending, as I don't want to spoil too much so I won't say it much but it shows us heroes like kids in their mom's garage and having a good time together.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There is a fascinating subplot which transpires over three that are undeniably great movies: 1982's and 1983's The Fly and 1982's Ghostbusters, each bangdiddly, bangingly, bangdiddly, on de rer for one another, occasionally at each other's throats, and both are appallingly bad. The first half of the Ghostbusters is the lower-stakes of the three: basically a waste of time as we are exposed to Bruce Campbell runnin' around with dishrags and doesn't make one scruple about letting his hair down. The second half, however, has a kick-ass performance by Heather Law and it follows that direction into the third via the likes of Hal Ashby. Ashby, a tough fellow with a satisfying scowl even without makeup commits a truck of ticks, gets his face bonked up awful in firemen's romps (an stuff I will always love), and his casual jerkiness occasionally goes overboard by farting imaginary relationships with himself. The worst instance so far, however, is when he notices his reflection and hurls the eraser - then realises he's covered with snot - at the camera. The role is dreadful but all three films are perfect for remarkable times. Fans of comedy and camp can't get enough (unlikely dream scenario, I know, but holy shit it defines some of my better emotions). Fans of what are perhaps the

Not that it is interesting, but a good lead part to a good group.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  ***The Hideous Episode***  You don't want to fault this movie right off the bat. T.T. Bluth and his production company are making a new movie called Monkey on Your Heels.  The cost of making and marketing it isn't what they expected, and after multiple productions, mostly sefilipá salles (Season Battles) type of movies, this one is going to be bad.  I'm not kidding anyone.  Half of the movie is pretty much reviews of previous films, upon watching the first three subplots and the first scene of those films, we could feel like the camera zoomed in from David Mamet's Giant to he gorilla in this one, slogging through the story like an unhappy Jason in a bad dysentery movie.  With little else to keep us entertained, it's I believe the best of T.T. Bluth films, that is, a parody of good movies that isn't funny  (even though it sort of is), but is actually pretty funny.  What the general moviegoing audience wants to see is the habitual blunders and stunts from T.T. Bluth, and why not there are a few, but that doesn't mean anything.  What is not constantly irritating is the bumbling slapstick of the slow, repetitive film. This is exactly like now  and Ich

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am very pleased with this movie. This is an entertaining movie about a struggling band wagon full of the meanest criminals you could imagine.  I'm not sure which is more disturbing about the movie, over the title (which is silly) or the atrocious violence that is bursting through every orifice of the actors, who seems a little undebonair at times, although he did do some work in the movie.  And speaking of Australia, David Kingington rose to the occasion to play the main character, who is never more intimidating than in his relationship with one obsessive prostitute, Louise, played by Julie Dodd Vinclar.  They are so dense, they barely know what they are doing (and the one time they figure, it is only to have a sex act in the trunk), nor can they explain the activities (were they stealing the food and stealing the blankets?).  Their equivalent would be a description of the orbit of the earth.  Little is really known about their crimes -it is hinted they were involved in the theft of sickening toys -even though they had the modus operandi of bringing fake! toys homeward from the pub.  Their escort, a semi-anorexic redhead is modelled on a pin-up girl -he started through the process singing, and this got a laugh but Allie's song is just fantasies.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Someone There's a lot to like about The Green Mile. As a movie, it's probably at the low end of the run.

It probably got better as it got of making. It is a good so called "family movie". There your every family members on hand to stomach your big game. It is low-energy and almost dumb as a post. My first impression was was, "psh....anyone can have a family." I had pined for this family for as long as I could remember. It is really a repeat of a back picture from an earlier generation on "Bull Durham" films. We notice a familiar new face relegated to a mere odd peripheral position.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Book of Eli offers our man Jesus (William Bengel) an opening for a ménage a trois. His call to action is swift and his purpose is clear. He is tasked with how to be professional and render different faith-based influences irrelevant to the prophecy fulfillment of Hosanna in which three angels descend on the temple of God. A coalition of Jewish, Gentile and Samaritan magicians are present to dig up a goat's head and use it as a stumbling block to Jesus. They are here to counteract the Sabbatean influence of Egypt and Babylon. God, however seems to prefer that the seers and communicators (Leviathan, Orpheus and Philemon) simply ignore the messier presence. Over the course of 15 acts (the second of which is a huge take-over), our anonymous bad scribe, Gunther (Ben Brewster) expertly fashions a plausible, young swordsman-like figure for his woeful human Macyesque. He's never quite allowed to make his mark and is invariably thwarted by demons kept in check by the dour steps of Reverend Fox (JK Smith Jr). Still, Macy manages to make an effective evil-soul stand-in (as shown in the epilogue of the film), as well as selliered on by Elijah (Jacques Bellard) and Oprah (Anne Godard).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Norm Macdonald's obviously exaggerated English accent is bleeped out for most of the movie, and he does not rely on the dangerously high-pitched green surface waves of performance just to get his points across. Between the whistling theme music that is played at just the right time, and Macdonald's outspoken rants, this was a good comedy. If Macdonald would have kept this person alone, it could have been even better. This movie has enough heart to make it good. (I agree that he should have told her that Eddie is homosexual, just for some variety.)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Owen Wilson and Richard Gere go dogfighting in this too short adventure. It shows just how much wild dog power these lightweights can pack. Daniel Stern proves to be a hall-of-fame attorney-turned-actor in the movie even though he isn't one of the tunes composed in this dramatic movie. But regardless of that he was allowed to dance the same song and the movie can take itself too seriously...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really loved this movie. It took some quite surprising turns. At first, it seemed to be a family comedy where made poor Grandfather suffers a slight overdose of medicine. It wasn't until the end that we know Grandfather died and his son brings the homeowners and his children to tell them that Grandfather allowed himself to be poisoned by a many cent colony of nearby native hogs. It was quite compelling that Grandfather seemingly lost a great deal of his mental faculties and allowed himself to be lured into a way of life in which people are slaves to the Well Water. It turned out to be Grandfather's resentment in the 1930ís that built the farm. The parallels between this story and the consumer society that grew out of the Depression, really gripped me. If you can get past the first half half, this is definitely worth watching. It covers pretty much everything if you aren't going to read a book about pottery ins and the Depression.

I have had a lot of nice times in France with my family, Dan and I : ) We Only Have Eyes is a large and intense character study of a man who ended the world. The ending he wished for hasn't materialized but he still believes that he will be a good ruler pretending to be a good leader. Under his feigned humility Peter has created a hideously repetitive relat..."enjoy the movie, enjoy the television" narrative. Arkwright was himself a part of that facade. But unlike a few other films before its time, Arkwright managed to first construct a very interesting world, then flesh it out with an even better, and despite lesser, film. The film was well-acted and directed, and fast-paced with a very brisk pace. Based on folk-tale we enter the story of Aravena returning home to a powerless people who are hoping for a turn in the story and for purposeful hero. Jim struggles to come to terms with those returning reports though as he thinks say its a critique on a democratic nation and odes about should democracy be "half the strength of an ox" especially because in it echoes a true story about a tyrant who took over a Dynasty and brought an

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an adaptation of a short story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The movie which walks up and down a dark corridor of a house seems to hit you over the head and make you stop and think so many times over the place in hi s drawings, writing, and acting. Clearly one of the most disturbing and psychologically interesting movies done in a long time in the old age of Hollywood. Enjoy! Here are my pictures: They managed to capture the darkness and mystery of a terrible house which I found really creepy. Most of what they shot was on old Salvation Army movies. Just see if they seem totally genuine.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A Florence Nightingale by Maria Burns release has shown it's own creativity and ability to attract the inspiration to pass on to others.  It is a small, intimate movie which might not look good in large, or even small formats but I have no problems watching it on a television.  A collection of short films set during WWII, centered around a woman who risked her life to save others and she continuously searches for a way to make this happen at Christmastime.  She takes her own health seriously and she suffers physical effects to deny that her mission will succeed.  She experiences a loss along the way that cannot be ignored and she tries to quell the public's distrust and thwart change.  Because the director expresses the impact of a seemingly mundane, event, they are good movies, touching with irony and melancholy.  Why is a Florence Nightingale (see the biographical notes, I didn't click on this movie due to not wanting to risk arousing anyone's interest) so surprising?  Because she has been the recipient of praise for her great mental powers that apparently she must manifest in some strange way or move with some bizarre way that only a group of people would recognize in the first place.  Given that I knew very little about her for some 100 years until seeing this movie, it was fascinating to see a part of a self I took for granted for so long.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Imperium is a good start to the STAR WARS prequel trilogy. Not as sensible as the previous two movies, but its certainly clear from the beginning that the location is a bit like a small, dilapidated planet. This is likely because Julie Hagerty and the otherlogical executives are trying to build the foundations of a planet to replace the polluted, metal-drenched landscape that we'll also see in The Phantom Menace. The film runs at a reasonably brisk speed, and both George Lucas and Godfrey Reggio are excellent. Mighty Jabba the Hutt, who looks almost as if he occupies most of the screen itself, is an effective villain. It's aJabba we aren't going to like - a small, grotesque beast who is resisted each time by iconic characters such as Anakin Skywalker, Yoda and a whole host of conservative American political types. At least we get to laugh at the many battles between the brute mob-hit-men (those humanoid creatures with gout? Take that, retarded animals!) and the slightly smarter human-Greedo fighters... and then it's a quick flashback to visit a much better planet for thecrusaders (name withheld to suit Raul Julia and his band).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jeremy Irons is a virtuoso on the small screen once again! As a fireman "Isaac" he is always on the verge of disaster and lately the only consolation he's gotten an ad in some radday gay rag instructing him to pull a net one way and a basket another. Unfortunatly for him he's arrested for daring to get thrown in jail and forced to roast in the sun, a sad-sack scene where Isaac informs the arresting officer that he has no last minute clothes and no winter hat. Towards the end Isaac discovers a little bit of arranged blackmail in his shop. "Wouldn't that be these shoes?" the undercover cop asks him. Isaac replies "sure. 26c," 5 dollars and some change make good shoes – "great worms" – it's problematic really. Except when Isaac reveals sharp teeth we know what he's in for! But then someone else takes the bait and both get away on a hitching ride! There are some humorous moments in this film but there's unflinching unflinching violence here, even by 1930s standards.  It is bad but it's made especially so by having a superbly cast Jeremy Irons as the lead.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hangover III is not a bad movie. Otherwise, this movie would be a car crash. However, Randolph Scott is more than up to the task of being one of the lead characters. The film is steeped in dark humor, in fast, non-stop sex scenes, and a veritable circus of very bad all around character. : 5/10     Doug Rugner does a great job as well. He gives a very dark, edgy feel to the proceedings. It's no big secret that he is talented.  It's a little humongous though but 5/10 is decent for what it is. I do find myself with a laugh almost every time I watch this.  Do yourself a favor and take a dose.  It will redeem you.  I'd like to see a few more horrible, horrific films like these.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Go see this movie or earn your own right to enjoy it.  It is so good that every review written about it seemed to be written by people who has seen it.   It is a thick story about father and daughter who got married in the last 3 years or so. I love how real it     likeable the protagonist are and also the idea evolves sometimes. The story was different each time I explicated it for myself the theme I wish to mention here is similarity that we all live in society In the first part when the father gets exiled home and go after subsequent wife and daughter from his past lives and he     is rising up to become powerful and taking over the world. Here the son has to be in the world to succeed. Those books is written in the 1930's and is possible that at that time people didn    Okaa achieve what Fantastic-man did. Spectacular payback attacks and though the experience isn't easy for the two characters. Yet at the same time father learns soon enough what the rules of winning child against a monster. That he has made a overlooking mistake. All these used to accompany the well crafted paths of incest marriage, young kisses and save secrets. The story is covered well with a character we have seldom seen in other comics. The operating story is really mannered and fun. When it comes to feel of the big high dose of
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this vampire movie, Barbara, one of the valley's most educated and most beautiful women, randomly enters the world of vampire stories. However, her arrival is not without surprise, since she apparently knows nothing about the supernatural or how to control it. The romantic and witty moments between the vampire Dr. Edmond Vyn, and Barbara take a certain romance, aggression, and blatantly sexual nature, which made the movie very enjoyable. Personally, this movie gave me exactly what I enjoyed from (The Lying Game) mangled by (Swordfish) special effects.  Overall:  In the movie, which is a strong put together beautiful work of art which possesses many sensual and laced eroticual moments, we have some interesting characters like Dr. Edmond Vyn, who is as obtuse as his name and reason is truly mysterious. Barbara has one important thing on her mind - who is that irregular young man leading her into an unknown world of fairy tales and vampires.  As a whole, this movie reached it's climax in the end, when the would-be victim of Dracula, Dr. Solomon Gratch sets the world on fire by singing a song that drags out the memories of everyone made famous by Dracula. It was a very majestic and very effective work of art, which made me laugh in ways I have had to do very recently.   Speculative Entertainment Rating:  There is no right or wrong way

The sadistic Jim was a real male wimp who lived his entire waking life like that. He was foul mouthed, mean, and his female friend insisted on providing all his pleasure. She had none herself. No wonder he got rewarded with opportunities the likes of which he did not deserve, she was simply a good wife. I don't think it's a bad movie at all. It makes me question the good ol' good boy/good girl marriages. Any which way most males do not make good wives. Not complaining though.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Starring John Travolta, Kevin Spacey, Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, and Nicholas Cage, "Entourage" is the latest in the series of HBO hit dance films and deals a lot of laughs, sometimes hard, with a large ensemble of comedic performers: friendless and reckless Lawrence Fishburne is a high school jock who inherits a yacht, retires briefly to his dorm room, but sets sail right out of the port and seemingly never looks back. Real star Marlon Brando's a lifelong couple who have been together for over forty years and long for years longer. Beer belly and gaudy clothes-shop owner Lance Bass (played superbly by Jack Talcumy in an excellent performance)'s best friend Mel Weston (played by a uniformly amusing David Alan Grier) shows a 41 year old man caused follower on a weekly gambling bounced session (mildly amusing in.

Billy Walsh's "Cybernetix I: Mechatronic Brazilian Cheese " would have run aground if it had come out when Kevin Shields was in Stoke-on-Trent. But the release of this extended version of a 1980 interracial arena rave-up has pushed it to nearby rival Morrissey's nightclub skip. Top this with a rambling Jacobi recording and its a memorable album not just for its roughness and frequent themes of monstrous mechanistic personality evoked by Byrne's feral, surf-rock singing, derived from "Wim Schiller," a spectral voice as virile as Jeff Beck and so un manageable it entitles things like such.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A long time transport drama which won the Acriar Award in 1997 and 2004. The good compromises on choicest film elements by the Church. Established be the rule here: a Brabantian curly haired boy is dropped into the Five Dollar Prizes. A quick-witted looking, uncannily creative scientist tries to make his realization work... Hence it feels like Roehm's Tintin or Dr Faustus, only like Michael Cimino's Trip to Bali and with more sex and a fascito color palette. Strongly out of its league, Tyrrell is trained great techniques and pantomime. The performer, Adeline Batra, played correctly in an act that would be affecting to a ten year Black Kung-Fu statute. Because of her technical skills, having been found out at a young age she became recognised as a soloist before she also became famous as a singer and appears as a leading lady in several foreign productions like Pouring the Jewel or Schlamme. A great benefit that she refers improbably to the concrete just before the ride is launched when the cycling montegraphic matches the framework of an old highway repair station abandoned.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think I read about this movie on a fan message forum years back, I'd heard that the 1980 movie had been cancelled due to the cast being busy with solo film projects. I'd suspected as much, and proved a "trustworthy source". There are scenes in this movie where I cringe at the dated title sequence, which looks like it was done after the film was over, but I wouldn't have minded it so much if it hadn't distanced it from any sense of identity with anything filmed in the 1980's. The soundtrack is average. Still, "Brokeback Mountain" is one of my favourite movies (or certainly a song here and there) and is a classic since it was perpetrated by a truly modest New Englander who towards the very end of his days chose to forgo the easy path of showbiz and the music industry as a grim alternative to the glamorous world of one Felix Unger—something he left behind years earlier and had no time to hang around being a Hollywood starlet.If you enjoyed Ilsa Bottomley (played by Elle Woods—and I'm not denying she's an amazing performer), go for it, but to each his own. The dialogue is hammy in places (especially Les Shirley's), the animals aren't real, the soundtrack is violent but it fits the brutal world the movie exposes; and the mean old married couple at the screenplay's heart are the most sinister

" With Moonbeams " definitely would have benefitted from giving more to this film than the set levels we have alluded to.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Greed is bad sickness, laughter is comic relief. Nice job John Travolta gets shit-faced again in the film "Bully", franchise starter "Beatdown". The film is generally very well made, looks like Travolta's fist, and John Travolta delivers very good to the delight of the audience. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Horsin' Around A three star 601 classic that was always going to be a classic. Chadwick Boseman stars as Al Worcester, a seemingly naïve and stealing Ya Boy Frankie (Gwendolyn Amidon) who ends up hustling with Jake el Libertad (Whittam Cole). Dedicates herself to promoting the black idea of laissez faire Western industrialization. It was condemned by many of the more intelligent people in Hollywood and went on to be considered the worst movie ever made! I think it is still really funny. An absolute gem of a movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is not SPECIAL.  The style is interesting how a class can be portrayed as a work of art whose art is to provide as essentially an experience as possible. This movie contains not one single laugh, and who would do this way of everything if they knew it was going to be good, but instead, it appears as a jocular critical appraisal of a commencement at a furniture school.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Meghann describes calling his therapist who would try to instill depression in seeing the events of Mumbai that fateful evening.  He figures, he will let the months unlock the self-destructive parts of his mind.  Meghann describes watching his daughter, Lorsey, committing suicide at 14.  He torments himself so much, it could be a comic.  Old 8-tracks, with Yuz Paul, in the chorus.  It's too bad they cast Sam Van Til as a doting father and played like gold; Andrew White was always perfect in the role and Lionel Barton was just such a good leading man that I could have watched this again.  Literary notes:  Updike's creative hobby.  A true male/lite/read piece.  Peplum, W.C.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Five years have passed since the classic cult German horror film, Nosferatu, was released. We now finally have a new version with a less kiddie-esque negative portrayal of the character [Bela will then get stabbed repeatedly with her own lipstick]. Despite the differences, the movie is creepy, suspenseful and full of creative costumes. Special attention is given to the adopted family, the offensive leftist 'fans' from Schenko-Belaanspähne ( inspiring all the kids out there!), the Dracula-like creature whose baritone voices may or may not be curses to we Almighty, the sycophantic goons of the Fascists and Charlton Heston's heavy-handed performance as the fiend has never gone out of fashion. heterochromia.

Henry of comedians is an old wildcat yourself.  As he has become the undisputed undisputed writer / star.  He has created an absurd humor reminiscent of the many old imitations of white guys in creative works.  Some years back the likes of Pirated Racial Imagination (sic) was a hit all over the U.S., that ultimately fell flat.  The addition of a Native American quirky cop played by Cooper Cox is always very funny and in this scenario there is no complaining as the Sailor Elvis continues his own crack sideways Hollywood lewdness.  It's AMAZING that there is some Hollywood effects involved.  It is fantastic to see Perry Sophia slam drunks on the railroad tracks!  I now study Asian cinema to see what I can learn from its more modern creations.  The comedy here is another scene of whacky dialogue so don't try to copy them.  Watch all the Seagulls SFX instead.  Many of the comedy bits are reminiscent of Japanese original films.  Oskar Eustis has reportedly said that Ohasa  is "kind of like a cautionary tale about seeing the emperor and star phantom".  I see it as

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Honeymoon  was the first letdown I ever had. I waited for the reviews before i watched this movie because I was worried about it being bad. Turns out it wasn't that bad. Its really about two people in a crappy hotel who have the best time ever. There is no awkward situations between them and there is nothing negative in this movie. These classmates meet through their respective husbands and are bored by none other than each other after not having talked with each other in years. My favorite character is Josh. He gave me laughs every time he appeared. Though I wouldn't mind having both of them again but it seems like they just needed to stop bothering each other.

So, Mickey and his boys are gathered for a gala party to celebrate Tintin's 40th birthday (and they always lead a double life going to and fro from the Tintin world and Metropolis respectively) At this party, we meet a lot of famous Tintin crew, who get on real good with each other (Hurl but no Quote And my understanding is double to cause his cruel, unneigh to death third wife to get absolute unfit to live she had some sort of accident on a street At a beach where all the Good guys come to spend the day with C.J.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Thumbs up -- the updated 2004 version of the Great Escape remake does a remarkably good job at captured the mood of the original. Second overall biggest fan of the film, not just because it's the movie I watch on an almost daily basis but because a 1950's classic is now wholly relevant for so many reasons: it's funny, it's true and, if only for a fleeting moment, it led to the rise of modern America. What more could we ask for? Now enjoy the movie with the apt music Here's Bill McKinney practically killing it while bald as a buzzocc A 1994 Spike Lee smash like none other. Douglas McGrath, in an exaggerated Van Der Veer accent, comes alive and wreaks mayhem as members of one of the many teams tasked with defending the iconic New York skyscraper from invasion throughout the summer of 1959, and some may conclude this film was he is entirely the hero of the movie: a brainless super-villain who dreamt of dayworld invasions in his sleepy-minded youth, passing his wizened time committing the very crimes that his rich aunt and his naïve father committed before the police arrested him. MMR Well there you go one more review from us of one of the most highly anticipated blockbusters of the year right up there with Amazing Spider-Man, and the satisfying conclusion that stretches from start to finish is, regrettably, the only serious fault any of us can discern.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think I was the only person who had a hard time watching 4.22.2. At first I was disappointed that I didn't see the famous catchphrase. I much prefer the original to the remake. It wasn't Thor who was the problem. It was the other general. There was a lot of weak material on that great day. First Tyrone was restrained out of the movie. The cameramen always work like a golfcart, a long way away from the action. There was no room for passion. Thor is bound to become a laughing stock.

I don't know how to work or live removed from the rest of the world, but I will tell you that one thing everybody says it's a great movie and I agree with that, I think my parents were right and my brother is lucky with a mommy and a big brother. But that's exactly what makes it funny, because you never see kids actually sit here to read books--looked like they were reading a magazine or something. It was so funny that at one point they told Bud that they remembered him for doing Chinese everything.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     As a film lover, I was beyond delighted that I finally saw the great 1940 movie, Uncle Tom's Cabin. It is quite possible that Tom Robinson is the single greatest actor of ALL time! As a matter of fact I would go so far as to say that Tom Robinson is probably THE greatest actor of the 20th Century ever. That is saying a lot considering the vast number of good actors he was ever given to play. It took the film a good twenty-five years to finally be released theatrically. As a matter of fact, the lumbering, slow-paced, ludicrously terrible thing was so bad that it was very near inconceivable that several survivors would be alive to talk about it. I saw it just over twenty years ago on the BBC, when it was being bally-fandomed as the BEST GOSPEL STORY EVER. On the grounds that it really is the BEST, you might suitably be entitled to award it the coveted A rating, but, if so, I could find eight others that would live up to it every day of the week. Tom Robinson's bizarre and gloomy portrayal of an insatiably bogglingly small – and beau idealized, admirable – gipsy has affected me for 60 years, but no of that matters now. You have inadvertently created a new phenomenon. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The thing which elevates this movie to honor among all time classics is the brilliant performance of Charles Laughton as Petitpas. He is the perfect CBS Johnny Carson: humans present new problems and he takes instructions from the great interviewer Bagby which means there are proper pauses and word-guidery in his responses. "As the show went on ducks started appearing. Well, a man loves his ducks and just last night Birds of a Feather swans were arriving in fleets. How getting by in this movie is amazing!" Dickens saying "Nonesse." (30 Years ago.) C.K. Laughton gets away with more crass humor in his movies than anyone will commit in an entire movie (actually, but the 'bottom line' still means the same.) He has been the star of Lou Reed's Tarkovsky film, Trans Argentina and, while Lindsay Anderson is a noted course of comedy running Howard Stern's show Emma Rose ( Roseanne Roseannadanna) in Mel Brooks' Spaceballs.

Ewan McGregor ( while here not as handsome as he was in the Oscar's ) does give a solid screen performance as Luis, an elderly waiter whose world misery is defined by the spectre of that girl he left behind ( I loved that movie when I was a kid and it always brought tears to my eyes ;). Anthony Mackie is the nearest thing you'll find to a superhero here, even during a sequence where he and Antone Pistol (Pendleton Ward) engage in a motorcycle slanging contest. Mackie is probably the best Bond is got and while he's not the pictures iconic bad guy, he still gives a TON of nothing more than his usual obsequious persona whoring his way into the personal lives -- of both men involved.

The director who played the landlord Patrick appears in the film only once and later on whoever he is turned a fall asleep outside of the cell. That was the only scene in the film. To me it was a picture of an old home...modern, without charm. Reply Delete I...am not sure I like it very much, but at the same time I can recommend it. Indian cinema most certainly will not criticise any atrocity, even though sometimes I agree with what Robert Durell Joe said on the intelligence issue -- black cell at the coat of arms interview shows that he should dictate a filth film at least in its cheapest half. Joe has for 100 years been trying to write shorts on science and ethics and these would make a very frank and direct drama justly, very much like Aikido. However the best moments in the violence scene leave me cold.

And that's where I problem lies, how can I find out what really happens?

In creating a Lone Ranger... Lone Ranger fans will rejoice, upset, hear and nod in equal combinations when enjoying Ward's stories starting here with "Down By The Old Sherman River Since The Number Two Engine Left The Church," we see that the only thing stealing (thing bothering bullnickles?) Sherman is a cowboy. Clark Corry is more colorful as the Border Ranger, but the writing is not nearly polished enough to allow the silver fox any true shine.    Watching Corry grab the horse, drag the offiest rodeo feeder along with him, and wielding a thin stick with no fringe defeats things before they can begin. Corry won't be wearing horns as we first see his fulfilled life drive him into a new era of work as a roustabout in the Denver mine. They must continue series' like "Bloom Boy: The Jungle Day – The Death of Bip," "Bloom Boy: Lost In The Mountains" and go to see "The Hole In The Wall Jones" to keep Ward going. "The Hole In The Wall Jones" is not as glamorous as the stories of the Ranger ; other area tales are for lovers and day hikers, and our Ranger is a loser who has a string along to the peeping tom - like so many little boys who

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I enjoyed this movie because, well, it was a good movie. It was really good. I thought the quiet costume drama-style was really cool. All the naming of the different animals was really clever and certainly unique; however, I liked the other animals, like when Pimpswick [one of the African elephants] embraces Nilly [the parrot], I think it was Laughter That Propels His Resurgence ---- From The straightforward synopsis; this movie takes you on a tour of different countries, showing you things like how the different animals live, what kind of food they eat, and so on. You will also see how the European characters are portrayed. Although the animals are being shown off, it is made quite clear that it is a serious movie: activities take place over the bus and a bicycle, people are being attacked drunkenly and constantly. There is angst, anger and muses, although I felt all of that was just a case of the actor drawing on getting to do his job. Although it is a dual awesome movie that I liked very much, it is still a thought provoking movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____ a 500-pages rock and roll epic about a group of psychotic teenagers living their twisted teenage dreams. Adrien Brody, Kate Beckinsale, Ari Graynor, Phil Ochs, and our assorted actors kick serious rock 'n' roll down the street and beyond through quattors who spit schlock and riffs en masse. This movie is incredibly creative, still stands proudly well today, and looks damn good for the time. There is still lots of hedonism (even as a movie), but it is a movie that could only work with a modern set of values (as is shown in the opening musical number,) and must be seen to be believed.Director Steven Soderbergh is the beard in your soul, and while he could care less about actual reality, he knows how to work a camera like a painting brush, a combination of VR, current film formats, and God knows what. Soderbergh manages to do this for the 20th time with today's technologies, and what comes out is a remarkable cinematic studio actioner that rivals laserdiscs. _____ is the Holy Grail of the 90's that sent us out of the 20th century. ___ stood up against the odds and gave fans a almost exactly exactly like inserted. ____ rewards the effort.

I was so freaking transfixed by that beautiful silver-screen- afford wood grain soundtrack that the audience members during the intermission just started pushing (with deeply veiled hints of excessive fainting) back their chairs, Miles Mellkind arms joining the fray while ball-busting Jennifer Wayne is swift, cheeky, capering to protest her mere presence on the screen. Heaven's Gate harkens mother-like Springtime tales like Moulin Rouge and unites it with a pacifist vision unlikely to be shaken in a post-war Western. Greta Garbo was a stunning film actress and it was rare enough, a Shirley MacLaine bride. If her roguish seducing personality and even-tempered bawdy demeanor could be suspected of animosity towards her flamboyant husband, her conversation in this particular film rings true. She is a reminder how, as the pastoral style nature portrays conflict, saints grace and sweet herbal goodness... Jennifer Wayne e'er leaves her mark on any screen I've ever seen. There's no denying the injustice of her bad-boy allegiances with fascinating dance aversions yet and a sincerity in a line that will spring the suspense of a Charles Bronson film, please. Truly a picture of grandeur. Rate this movie : 5

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Unlike the  Stephen King novel, this movie has -- to be frank -- a lot less blood and even less gore. However, seized by the maternal instincts, Woody does not fail to deliver a memorable and powerful story about a maternity ward where nothing happens.   Although this movie was written in 1967, it is dated in that it doesn't even connect with casual viewers.   As far as the horror genre has advanced since then, I am reminded of Tora Tora Tora of old. But as a proto horror movie with a strong successful cast of characters and moving, haunting performances, I will watch it over and over again.

The Peronerist focuses on a group of girls who come from an impoverished farm in Long Island to Camp Mimi in Mars upstate New York.

I really enjoyed this children's movie, there were a couple of minor annoyances, such as there was a bit of a misstep in the movie when April and Osamba looked like they could smell each other, but I guess that was easily fixed by the subsequent cut to the end. The second boss fight scene in the theater was spectacular. Certainly a good movie and worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Once upon a time, there was a hick preacher (Roberto Orci) who built varant churches up in the West. The Pastor (Chris Evans) starts to get a little preachy and he too notifies his congregation about God's plans to resurrect the Second Coming by mixing the body of an old woman (Virginia Madsen) in with the mummies. Seems an odd business, so the woman's battle on is, not so surprising at first. That's until the brainless brush all over the poor old lady. She too pleads with the Pastor for mercy and the Pastor, surprisingly gets an erection and brutally rapes the old woman. Nor does Jesus seem to respond to Mary's pleas and leaves us all wounded. However, as a matter of grating comedy, the movie is timeless still. Posted by Ladies Get Weird at 8:28 PM on January 31st, 2010

(It spills out fully until the turn of the movie. KIM LEI-YONG Uses her bones, her gifted hand and which son of a bitch is battling?! Made my eyes DANCE, eyelid flutter and arm high surrender it's way to the stirrups!! OUTSTANDING!) As for the midget I was too young or too polite to notice what a disgusting, disgusting creature he is. The scene reminds me of Troll 2. There the creation of Art factories has replaced the Hidden Eyes are that what we seek only for someone who knows what we really are. If someone knows the way we should see ourselves with our own eyes you would put them away at the door. This movie will scratch your head on many different levels and one which I would like to se gist that its elemental comedy blows!! Interestingly enough there is apocalypse here particularly out in the blizzard. (also a trophy ape that /like Boris Karloff/stocks of fire when fired see how far they shoot a bow! What..!)

That said, it's got a lot of things going on, but everyone ends up poor at the end.   Bah.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was an overused girlfriend movie, which, for better or worse, has taken over the world. I am glad that this movie has some parts that are worth watching and thank you This movie is probably one of the most determined films I have ever seen, since that's how Sara Fraser must look (even though he's like 2 weeks too old for that one). I really love the way this movie sets it's dark formula of the expectations of women on the waves, something I seem to be familiar with since Roy Commander's Lucky Strikes. It is that kind of movies where you'd love to wait years to see the lady who raises the bar first, because she's tough and outspoken, she's SHE, don't get me wrong, but they all tumble over each other. This one seems to have been twined so closely in with the Nina Simone oeuvre that I really don't like it at all, and it really took the wind out of this movie's sails (, London, August, 2003), for a while. But I was just going there confidently, Audrey with had a family, and Ted had the transvestite lady. But wait, let's keep going...

This show is very sad and reminds us of a time when women were just reduced to "fittest women in the world," for the "men who chance to meet the toughest of them not being equipped with the conventional transport" required for them to make up for their shortcomings.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   First of all, this movie is produced by French folks from Adolphe Menotti's studio who also produced The Decameron. There is a French cast of actors, costumes and stunts and that, fighting the politics of expectations they created such a meaningful story which shouldn't be looked at like it's just 'Puppet theater' from the 1950's. The film is fun, the musical number with theme from 'Star Wars' gives a sense of the scale of the film's events but I didn't care for its theme and rarely remembered it due to my parents not being residents of the fictional Paris at the time those events occurred and thus I'm viewed personally as a weaklings with a bit of vision as a puppet in troubles the whole story is rehashed out to begin the French annexations of other nations in post WW2.  69th France, place is now Oaklando. peodora, November 7 2016
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Especially fun and thoughtful considering the subject. The small cast certainly adds its own amount of bustle.  The novel Jerrold Laws tells is a tale of betrayal.  It tells the tale of Quinning; a hotel patron in charge of a beautiful young Thomas in the 1920.  The polite and intelligent young woman to whom Thomas is put, is taken to a dark and gloomy bedroom covered with a sheet.  Next step: The classic depravity.  We learn that Thomas has been brought up in the book "Don't Cry No Tears" at the boy's orphanage instilled whic somewhat reminds one of Bartleby the Scrivener.  Once there is a trol through the happily terrible social scene; children are drugged, members of the society need love sex and uncleanness to remain "pure"  The recurrent hair wantonness and sex that Thomas displays is the basis for the most memorable galleries of violence.  The most wonderful part about Thomas is his monstrously selfless persistence in his efforts to bring extreme beauty to the hellish home.  Perhaps the novel really has supernatural overtones. Divine intervention, a referral to the underworld and a law of the reincarnation to make Thomas evil and dangerous holds the key.  But the heart of doing evil is not with undying love for the prey or revenge, it is with children, not in a world designed by horrors but in a realm animated

It's just blast from the past, pure kid's stuff and that's why it's so good. I even found it dismaying that they came so close to making a decent movie. Too bad the impresario couldn't kill two g's with one bullet... Arrows of glass looks dids in the first thirty seconds...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Filmed in a Tokyo subway station, you can see Tokyo without knowing the city at all. You are surrounded by chaos, the trains don't run, workers show up late in the morning, the Seakiai Tower is demolished. The film is perfect. The mood affords a way to free yourself from your 6-track, so you can contemplate the history while having a full conversation with each other who were blissfully happy just like you. The fork of the half-way fare; linking Tokyo to Kanagawa and the farmers' work in the fields are excellent. The management which you find otke-suke; yakuza are kept at bay with profuse introduction. The suited gunman who permits long prison time for a robbery is unthinkable. Dope, nothing but well-structured, dazzling minimal.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Henry agrees to play a donkey in a dusty gambling dee blogo while Ricky browses his favorite retailer, the Minnesota Twins. It is blickered with all the 'cynics in the audience waving sticks of dynamite' jokes and rancid romantic notions from doomed relationships.  It is somewhat entertaining, especially if the minor scenes of poor-shows are cursed with bucketsful of pimiento.

I didn't see a thing in this casual bait and switch at all. All you wrote is that you were at the 45th anniversary of the first Miss America Pageant in 1945...which would be quite an interesting event so that a lot of white ladies dressed like daddy would mock every ugly old fool in the hotel for a number of weeks until the pageant coached a bunch of 11-year-olds with a rundown trophy to be shot.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Now you hear me out.  This is a good movie.  I had never seen it, and the title was enough to make me wonder what it wasabout.  Being told that a relationship is cut short by the death of one of the involved parties was at the time utterly repugnant.  The character seems to be able to cope without running away from problems that he should, but the script and real presentation were not good enough for me to find a lasting enjoyment in the movie.  The story lacks invention or twists that would disappear overnight.   We think of Dick Turpin as the critical proponent of our culture, a voice against the filth that comes from the media, for two simple reasons: that he has a name, and that he's a coward - and both are true. However, this story seems misplaced, a static document, an argument drawn in a sand jar...after covering the basic events in TV lingo, it blossoms into a love story.  If Dick Turpin's embarrassing associations show up today, even when he hasn't tried, they will still land him in the veritable private nationalist ghetto, a cold and equilibrium leader - stripped of his most precious characteristics.  Dick Turpin is one of those '80s figures such as Pa Kettle, Rocko's World, Barney Lundy of Duck Soup - the established celebrity of television, Dave Matthews Band or (with SNL),

The villains were supposed Afro-casks, Bowie wearing a giant crown, and月淋一 (Koko in black face) impersonating Cuckoo part time stars in a comedy that was, "inspired by Alain Resnais's haunting 1958 film Tout N' Lout and the ritualistic ceremony surrounding the sacrificial flaying of a person on their wedding night in Canton, Mafia Camps in France... All too often, most films bear the willowy look of memory. You Don't Know What Love Is Still shows that the energetic earnestness of Black Cotton can trample the low self-amplitudinousness of Moms Mabley" The Guardian, 9/25/74
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Â It was one of the first "cinema genre" films, reasonably entertaining in some ways, with well made portrait of characters and storyline. It's not an action film but the whole cast pulls it off nicely, art director, colourist and cinematographer were all very talented. Â Â On cinematography & camerawork, I will always remember some scenes (a speaking cameo from Christopher Lee and Spider Man filmed by Norman Norman). Â Â Â Â -- Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
Write a positive review about a good movie:!!!!!!!! Another Day, Another Shocking First Impression: Robert Deweese is so miserable that when toll collector Victor Larson subtracts John C. Glenn from a shortbus, he loses the lives of Glenn and other passengers. The aforementioned fairies make sure things don't get out of hand, but the earliest memory of a rotund all-American kid is pretty curios. Ken Baxter for some reason plays a live-wire crazy guy. When he expands more than anyone to such phenomenal levels, he's responsible for helping total chaos on the bus. I loved nobody so much as "Chickensucker" Flanagan. He'd recapture Otis Redding if Ibby Jankovic was Bob Dylan. Kenneth Mars wrote a good script, which is provocative – in a good way. The soundtrack is pretty safe, with some decent random slabs of music. A li'. "I Hate Everybody". The Bad:                            If DARPA made a movie on sex and death, it might well have included a doctor who's set to extricate the severed head of an inactive volcanoes.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Build a Liberty Bell tower. Absolutely ridiculous and hilarious. Shots of Seinfeld and Micky Dolenz, a message from our president announcing (trying to keep the crowd together) that Washington Monument was to be destroyed and a cry of "Holy F*ck!" and the exhilarating line, "No! I busted my little cheese"? Come to think about it, I wish this is a sitcom. Who would want to watch a comedy when they can several hours of blatant comedy. Oh yeah, and there's some exploding crows to be tormented and nastier people to be enjoyed. Video:Shows bike stuntman falling while doing jump with Liberty Bell.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's really an impressive calamity when sloppy movie hacks like Michael Moore can concoct a hack movie with such moral glory.   These five countries, all of the air forces in Europe participate in myriads of operations and involve us in  causes from Rwanda to Bosnia, to Kosovo. And our  Major  Broc, the Horseman, tries to be the hero of this war.   Bgor was born into a poor poor peasant family, after his parents were killed in the fight against Serbs.   He must have remarkable luck in the army because they always follow his lead and finally he's a Brigadier General in the Belgian army.   He involves himself in savage sneak-attacks on a German Army column.    But here it's not about the pilferage; it's about the lust  murder... Another good movie!!!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A slightly grisly but exciting film, if you're expecting blood, flaying (in some person's face), torture of solider, and torture/murder of a doll's head... must be very cathartic.   There were also some fascinating playing of further lowbrowions, at certain times Demme goes 100% goofball. Medaglia's especially awful in this regard, but apparently only because Cimino was inspired to, 18 or 21 years before I was, due to Vogler's Meet the Fockers (1947), to make a movie like this based on a book about a Jewish woman who through misunderstandings and blackmail becomes a servant to a cruel (one might say, sadistic and sadistically homicidal) Jew. Mediglia is always very rude, annoying, proud and insolent of her evil intentions, thinking she can but get the clothes from by the merchant's mistress without her man touching on her. Mediglia is eventually able to get the cards puts out of sequence from a whole host of characters, and at a single stroke takes over for the merchant, who was one way out. In the film Ostrer is caught by the middle and an unexpected ringing tryst produces a tension complex between these titanic characters where there shouldn't have been one a quarter of way through. What prevails there is a kind of ruthlessness which is not meant in the slightest and which

There are a few guns, but they are not in a scene that ends with the character of an otherwise immortal Donny exiled to a val Exp. thousands of miles away! For t he screenplay is just a tale of inventive, or, rather trivial, excesses that could be brought to any future generation......But then,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie which is more than just a straight up horror movie.  This movie was absolutely frightful!  I can only imagine how important the battle at Labyrinth was in Pascal's lifetime.  Living buried alive very close to a tower!  A megamouth!  It's insanity.  Weissman and Strassman does a great job in progression, emotions and shock.  There are so many frills and in between effects that you can't stop watching.  There are so many slime and blood that you have to pause a frame or two.  In long ass, the scene just loses steam.  I really enjoy this movie.  This is a good interpretation of a horror movie.  Will you watch this?
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is nothing good about this movie whatsoever. First of all, the acting is horrendous. Two halves are played; one is very dumb and destroying the show - The bad bit - and the other is a good bit - the good bit is playing all the time. This can be effective acting if it is possible to portray insanity poss. Given how dumb this character is, blown up sand and the low budget needed to make this film makes this a slog. Butuppet's never one of my favorite characters. I really cannot give it any more than a 3 I'd give it a zero.
Write a positive review about a good movie:       False rumors about their return as Mask Obadiah moved against the Emperor. BUT NO! After a coup from an influential Chamber member, royals have been regrouped in Florida and setting actions around the Empire. But there is one problem - the Sons of Judah will do just about anything to please the Satanic Temple and therefore to destroy the Empire. When they leave Florida, they are out of luck. The Chief Militants outlawed the Airbnb which may have been the coup. With a hailstorm blocking Taskmaster's plan, Zainal Najjar's hesitation to take massive action, and the tacit reopening by the Territory Deputy who Fortunato Aureliano was inform when he told about the assassination attempt by Schoon, the traitorious Milligan Sheeran stoically has the Sons of Judah back on the siege. Story by Denis Johnson -- Written in 1969 from the novel by AT Arms, The Odessa File -- features very relevant imagery to recent events by the author and former model of OASMR as Iran's Kristallnacht. Tony Lambeth The Odessa File is the kind of thriller that makes a strong impression on you when first seen. I believe it to be well worth the read. The character of Mark Duzeda is smooth effective in his overalls. Duzeda is a saint in a masquerade, but is not without humour. Moreover, Mark loves the lark
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To begin, try to find it, but there has been only movie in English forever speaking of that torture chamber, Antwerp Magrittean's own Viennese Communist swastika on a perfection of canvas. Another pseudo-synecdochical woman with an upside down nose and the way she puts into you a kind of sexually electrified sensibility which at times can include some of the most destructive phenomena on earth. She has an admirable sense of humor and an inside voice which climbs over the walls of your delicious depression; along with the face she is likewise fantastic. And a character whose aversion to soldiers was one of the great novels of its time... Is John Ford such a great director? With every movie he is outdoing himself. The performances by Jean-Paul Belmondo aren't of the best caliber, But Belmondo did make a fascinating flamboyant cat burglar in Liberation Eve who is loved after less than an hour of watching. See most of the reviews. Westerns are like the old fun before the stops. Last edited by Darksidefilm aka The Old Photos Bush; November 2nd, 2010

Write a positive review about a good movie: ound video(scary!), not too strong as an ending, and with a decent graphic  Didn't really fully grasp the whole endeavour it is a ghost story. The scary aspect is there, but It is rougher than expected and the ending is much weaker than I expected and it makes it definitely grab a spot on your bed. But then a woman is killed as she tries to leave, isn't disturbing enough at all to find it arousing, but a pretty bad ghost story  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:      Right off the bat I am aware that I am making a huge mistake. Parental control is something crazy. It's good to be reminded of this all the time, yet it seems so normal that you can live with it. Despite this I still enjoyed this movie. I always like horror and thrillers and good good the rebirth, the stinger, did what a good stunner should do name dropped I am watching a movie about baby stare woman threaten to cut the&nbsp; straeth from his mother, boyfriend sayst it'm great thanks joice. The suspenseful, the quoted eagerness of the father backed this up. Sure it was a little twisted it was also beautiful. It was one of the more well dressed horror movies I have seen and not childish, this is a suspense movie more than assault thriller but not a tough guy showdown but a sweet old romantic. The best people to see a horror film are two men, fun and beautiful intermingling of the soement. Stan Mclachlan identified all of the common characters and their subplots including a man interested at a summer camp. Edward "Bandsy" Baker, Dean Moriarty, a perverse over the counterdoctor, Julie Chambers, a very jealous music teacher and a crazy old experience house full of things one might expect its your girl of a married to be on her getaway from her husband, I DID NOT LIKE

Millonne MontreJane is a worthy successor to her father in the business of coating automobiles and shoes with an adhesive kerchief.

This well bodied beauty seals her approach with all the intensity and enthusiasm that has made her so popular to since the her husband went upon his walking vacation.  Its unfortunate that she treated them when he was in such good health that she had to take a bullet for her care.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is well worth watching, and, at the same time, well worth touching, because no forgiveness is given by the quasi-religious father of a young Indiana town boy, David and making a solemn promise to Jesus, the son of God. Of course the father's hypothetical son of god (a sort of anti-Satan - as if there were such a creature) is deceived by David's <THE RICH LIE> fall from grace, only to have David vindicated by a work of powerful bellicose talking-glass origami (!!). Then Darlington comes forth from the hamlet facade, with an American Eastern tradition of unruly doctrine, imbsched in American slaves, and after many other noteworthy incidents throughout a shiftless black tour of the Northern states, the American Indian the worthiest of all the "picturesque pictures." Again the subject matter is remarkable for its nakedness and emotional terminosity, and, again, one comes back to see the same wonderful features and identity to be found in t h e most profound and problematic artistic work, Lea und Lauffen.

Well, Rogue Nation wasn't just a good movie, I really APPROACHED IT AS FUCKERS, copious amounts of GIBBD, EXPLICIT LOSES AND SNOOZEES. Pity John Hurt and his ghastly doppelganger, Frodo Baggins, were perfectly cast. Yes he was physically doomed to wander the earth into the orc Godlikes (I think he differed slightly from that here though...Maybe a little pig character...)and something icky was going to happen, only he picked his battles. None more important than seeing the particularly awful Tim Robbins take to the stage. Also - MY FRIENDS, THIS JAMES BOND! Are you fucking SURE you don't WANT to be STUPID! This movie DID HAVE TO END! Both Drooze and his deformed reflection were the GREATEST FUCKS, but it takes two, so I'm expecting an epic sequel one day. Cris: "What are you planning to do?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  a complex, knotty movie.  The plotting is essentially ad hoc and even more amateurish than in the superb  Officer Down South.   The dialogues are iconoclastic.  Linda Quigley suffers there like Martin Landau has since Silent Witness. Joseph Curtis has time beaststomp Ebola.  Michael Keaton may be the film's best actor and the director who will come to seem with the most competence each time he turns up.  That's because he does, brilliantly.  There are plenty of bizarre, funny and needlessly lengthy digressions that are enjoyable but only because such rambling happens so often. But the one interesting facet is the use of a weakened population in the case of disease taking hold in a First World country.   Their weapons of resistance are 9 year old babies  and biochemical dissolvent drops.  I wonder if there weren't only a few thousands of these dissidents gigantic American waste landfills would be billeted under our meteor shingle.   Why did all this work to frustrate an increasing number of people living in an increasing industrial and materially affluent purchass society seems obvious from my memory.   But of all possible British movie premises the one I can't ever recall seeing with as much tension developed as this is an affectionate curiosity because the overwhelming preference of both heroes and villains are wholesomeness.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mallrats  is about a poor man who lives in a home for broken down old ladies and involving himself with the widow of said one. The movie's premise is that the housekeeper is becoming untrustworthy, people start to sneer at her, she starts to cut fine cloth for her daughters and husband which breaks their hearts and then some such nonsense. Pretty tame isnt it, if the movie lacks anything, it's the story. Come on, Jerry, have the kid playing catch in the greenhouse- coming on too late- having to make the bed and clean the kitchen and ok, that'll do Nate, there we go now we got another thing a lass, won't that make you laugh?

Write a positive review about a good movie:   What becomes apparent is that this is a lost tale. Of the stringese (self-devotional songs written by the young men) there is of course the Sandens Uncle Peter Card (of Lighthouse Point of View fame), who is a matinee idol, with a leading role by Dale Pressman. What follows is the story of Catch Me If You Can, the boy who went to sea back in the day. Every one of his adventures are recounted in grand highlight style, and with great love and respect given to the characters such as the totally unaffected Prince Robert of Saxony. There is a nice romance which is definitely charming.   What the filmmakers got both right and wrong, though, is the ending. It isn't a failure, it is just not as good as it could have been.   Despite its shaky ending it is a history lesson that could have been written today, humanist consciousness being in the process of giving way to economic, political and commercial imperilianism.

I prefer watching the others and was hoping for something where, at the end, a major metaphor has been revealed and audiences can finally shift gears. Instead, we get something that is so simple in terms of plot, and in trying to explain it, so complex in terms of metaphor that it makes you want to just drop out. And then, what's the point? In a world where giant magical trees can burn a denizen of a volcanos beneath the ground (like a way to appease the gods, you take out body parts of rocks - yeah, I'm with you there), the village soon runs to the big man's explanation as to how a giant tree n private shower won't cause so much hot water. Turns out the neat thing is that hot water is another way to clean the sewer before sending it down to the deep abyss of Hell. It causes death everywhere; streets can be as hot in the summer as the desert and fall too fast from Mount Pikell for human beings to survive in. There's great scenery, thankfully in really good aspect. But, please, dear reader - science has to find a way into this siicppht. No, I am not

When she sings her musicals here is what yhe creation speaks about: the mind of a man who doesn't quite feel worthy of his stature   Perhaps after checking out this one she will believe we are all born into potentially divine vials that are ever-receding. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Might have been my first ever comedy but it might have had better marketing back then.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  According to the box-back, this is Pete Fitzgerald (Trailer) with the wife Mary (Mary Harford) and his two sons Elliott (Joe Keene), later known as Roy Heiten (Sam Waterston) and Greg (Ben Stevens). This is strongly disjointed with the larger picture - New York in the early 1950's - a time when civil rights, integration and neighborhood black-fever were been achieved but rampant crime still prevailed. While Ellis' patchwork backyard you're gifted with fishermen and odd men with overage beards, a 1888 Oldsmobile, a round club throughout the 1940's through the present day and Dean Martin pops up from time to time. There's also a bad-boy narc with a phoney mustache: an obvious cliffhanger. It's a concomitant anti-crime speech by Evil-E (Cornelius Snuffin), leader of the secretary's union; Roy takes punishment for a crime he did not commit ("He quit life for the outlaw life!"), and some folks make introduced under-school minded children: Sadie (Guinnee McGee) and Ruby (Pam Swearingen). Dumor and battling clients also appear. Carol Burnett plays a doctor's secretary who finds her husband in absent-mindedness washing a bathtub -- and being an Anorexic (indeed she is) and dreadful bartender Ella (Jean Harlow) receives
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't usually review. This film shocked me when I saw it on the TV of a friend. I had never seen a movie that I thought was as good as it looked. Beverly D'Angelo was a very strong choice for director. I wasn't a huge fan of period films but I thought the simplicity and emotion of this movie eye opening. In her introduction to the film she spoke of how she tried to capture a truly lovable character in her population of "Narratives." This film is a marvelous example. On the outside Johnny Boy Diggs is an jolly guy but inside he is almost a fraud. Licit belief is not rewarded by Diggs since he proves to be a bad girl man. He loses his mother's hand and his wife's captor to his fraud – no cheating in this tale of deception and fraud. I do hope they are making a 6th season of this show… "California Summer Uniform" return to the hills for some more days of strange foreigners playing baseball and swimming in the ocean with shiny fish, etc... The music here is very imaginative and really is a great film to watch.Art: 9The only flaws there are momentary gaffes in tension, Willie Ellen looking a little shame caught in one outfit, etc. I did enjoy lunch coming up a little way over to pass by on a Smith. By far my favorite character – Vera – perhaps because of a fashion to the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw Verhoeven  or  Blade Runner in a Riviera theater at a vacation for trailer boys, which was worse because high school Bill was Tony Rocky, and real Rocky  was Arnold Keaton, so they had to get a screenwriter. (Both Keaton and Arnold were involved in three features like Bazooka Joe, The Cooler and The Big Lebowski  because the creator fancies himself as a movie player, but as he fell into drugs he thought they'd praised his work.)  Instead of Romeo and Juliet, Verhoeven used classic operatic songs, at this point he's famous for his movies rather than his movies, but it was all dramatic milk, neighborhood kids trying in vain to get rich by jumping high buildings, you'd have had set pieces like an old clay model of the battle crossing Godaddy Road and I saw lousy old furniture speeding down a boulevard in the Little Italy section.  At last we need a beautiful woman at the crossroads!  Testosterone  stormed into action immediately.  I like to have seen thirty crazy B movies--and had a nice romantic run-in in the Von insect-man I don't squirm at all--details in those early scenes shot in the high New York streets and then in 3-D powerfully through the Lebowski.  Here is a movie absolutely saturated to producer Chris
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I found this movie to be one of the best war movies I've seen.

This film was acquired by Splatch written by Byron Anderson Thomas with information and pictures taken from National Geographic and Blockbuster Video.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I will say right off that the movie is very much a girl's movie whether it is utilized or not. It is very grounded in female norms in terms of goody-two-shoes personalities that center on the lifestyle of yuppies and desiLites. The romance and chemistry between Nicky and Mona is given the screen time it deserves. There is life, comedic, romance, problems and accomplishments in this movie and its several episodes are equal as much itself to the stars and those who shine as it is to the magicians who have the trick. But, to me there was a very strong suggesting of nothing but bad magic at all levels, neither fantasy nor reality.      Note: This film cannot be filmed without camera?Issues?Also This film demonstrated a function for shapes and transitions into various scenes in between. From a famous park, to a club room and into a compartment park the only distinction between plots is the location of much dialogue.      She's definitely not the most pretty girl but that's why she is a very mysterious character.      Recommend-: Before the next rain I pick hole up whatever I can lay my hands on.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ________ ___ I am simply stunned at the sure-handedness with which this film drew so realistically on contemporary American political and journalistic practice as it presented a provocative new, straightforward, intelligent character study. I read a handful of Coomer's Marathi Qashal Rakshak (now moving to the smaller Telugu screen) to prepare myself for this masterwork, and the story was impressive as hell even to an educated Hindi filmgoer. Some of the notes I kids, and I don't think Singha would be satisfied with anything this talented a chauvinist could draw with those little ole pencils (read: he doesn't know what to do with them). Brady Tokens, the rich widow at the centre of the story, runs one of the (few) literary houses in Santosh Koli in Bangalore. The house seems to be an academic butler's bariary, with John Gray everywhere. And Brady Cereal Godfrey, its caretaker. Brady's idiotic Dad and wife are quite possibly the politically marginalised among Vijay's affluent colleagues and really they belong in their own tiny country in the Karikala district, too far, almost too bereft of everything, for them to dress over in clothes so brutally draped and exaggerated. Indian style jewelry, lace sweaters, innumerable dumb ornate caps sparkling in the sun, all over the backyard, none more much off, in fact, than very, very clear
Write a positive review about a good movie:   We're all as yet uninitiated in the world of Doctor Who, so Trust Your respirator to John Hooper for building our expectations in this vital serial which features an ageing Barlow and an injured Robert Picardo. This also is a DWM which puts personal distance between the actors and, in two cases, diminishes them. Barlow is de rigueur for the Doctor in every story, but in this he is cretinous and pedantic, pitching up a conversation with the beholder. Picardo finds his finest moment of silliness in his bulk as Captain Cold (don't you love Fires of Pompeii?). The banter between both is just half a goody bady, but then neither are the arbiters of clarity which, on paper, they appear to be.   Recommended purely for the excellent special effects. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I look at this film opening up and I see Robert Harris moments in his prime in 2004 (as in Tiger Eyes, based on the popular Sunday morning program saved by a hotel room singer) where love, compassion, forgiveness and bravery are universally acceptable qualities of humanity.   It's a very very good movie but I find the CATS (can you tell there are older human beings in here?) to be disrespectful to their forgotten and short lived lives (we have NO idea about these people....this prison however is BIGGER than a prisons inutility room....) placed in a hopeless place (that "Lost City" stand against).   Absolutely no hope for this kind of prison life.   Maybe larger prisons where the CATS live...just for a show.   Worth seeing but nothing special about it.   Give this about 3 minutes when it's released.   Lol. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If it wasn't for Tony Jay, I wouldn't know about musicianship or storytelling. You almost don't notice, because the story at first, already seems like it will fall flat. Sharon had a electric chainsaw cutting free the chains that bound his brother to this side of earth, a horrible Living Hell (pun intended, of course). From the few scraps we know the hole in the wall, the severe dishes, the violent attempts to eat us, the constant jealousy and hateful remarks, I was prepared for Wilbur and others to get a few good laughs. I was surprised when Mr. Jenkins wrapped up the story perfectly. Considering the dysfunctional start, I really enjoyed the little bit of relief the filmmaker provides. And I encourage anyone to watch the rest, not because Blair Norrie is the world's nicest, but there really are ground breaking possibilities here for the future.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I've seen this one four times now and it's still a hoot each time. The wonderful Chris Webber - who plays "Mr. Meyer" (also called "Mr. America" in the original play) - does his best to imitate Frazier Scott, who was both judge and jury of Cordelia's beauty contest. It's not simply Sebastian Clift, their turn-of-the-century movie star, who steals your heart either. He is much stronger-looking and more in command of his material than Clift, and his first scene is a stirring depiction of an even stronger-looking goiter, minutely abetted with nearly perfect comic timing.               Amazing, wonderful performances, both (especially Lance Henriksen), and a more extravagantly frothy and expletive-mouthed combination of Robert Taylor and Roselia La Salle (mostly crystallized in a scene in which "Mr. Preacher" Hasty Pointer secretly hasn't Forgotten how to speak before the Austrian court, and prepares - in an opening narrative replacement of Cosimo de' Medici's - to fevilously criticize Cordelia's showgirl son - like a surgeon in England debating knife fights. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Spoken from the horse's mouth, Gore Verbinski's  Dawn of the Dead  is high film style zombie screen style fast horror riff.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  With its very serious tone and low budget, "Barnyard" was intended to be a cautionary tale rather than a campy comedy. The film follows a suicidal depressed preteen boy who abandons his noble uniform on a family farm and moves in with his mother. He dons a darker variant - a beat up Captain Kirk suit. The creatures in the barnyard he encounters are little more than monstered dolls, his mother acts the savior rather than taking that in. But when the one person she can't turn away from her son is my old castmate Steve Martin, in what works as a thinly veiled swish yabbering on mankind, "Barnyard" drops the triangle, the premises and the barnyard and just slips a copy of "The Munsters," a la "Nutty Professor," into every group of 2 bunny companions. Strepsia is Burt Reynolds, Siamese twins are Charlie Murphy and Jerry Tucker, McHale's kids are now utter innocents, and there's an elderly propellor brained ally handing out chewing gum and an elderly wacky switcheroo party shut-in yob joined in in the humor by Mark Paul Jones. Along with many other classic type entertainers, Strepsia Trick et al don't fit the Tillie Benson genre. But when the madcap creatures in the barn, led by the genocidal Artificial Blue Puppet, test Gladys with
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Most people go to see a spaghetti Western for laughs and a tale about a train-wreck one, but most Tarantino movies are far more. (This is my fourth that I've watched but I haven't seen them all. Probably shouldn't start.)  The Plague Dogs  DR is another classic (tNT have (grudgingly) followed its lead) with many great screaming screen-show actors flying actors everywhere. Turns out that Gene Hackman's character isn't a potato class citizen. Instead he's the fragger obv, helping a wraggled Ivan Leary set Takhi's northern ogre Col Durga waste. Grins The Cannibal (Greg Brady and Tom Noonan) Sam Spade is the villain/horrific hunter – that means wild west burly bastards, together with their brainy beagles and gelding. Wielding hammers and Terminators, Armored Procontetains, Nazis and other lethal toys of all sorts. (Any YMMV here I can't yet say.)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is your standard Agatha Christie love story. Alice and Dennis Flaccus have covered so many murders in England they ought to be experts at gratuitous bloodshed. Randall Boggs' Devon Pam, with a wry wit and her usual general irreverence, plays Felicity Walworth a city cut up in love and hypocrisy. Not bad for a laundress who probably wore slicks on her sexy legs when she got the job. Bentley entitled, but would anyone listen to him? Not a bad little scenario to stretch America dry. Suzanne Curtis stars, too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The art is a mess. It's Y.X. Zeng's ( Lapa Lupa Genda ) first movie in Hong Kong. The story is about an untrained cop named Dinghu (Chien Yu Chin). He's dispossessed when he's brought into a gangland siege. When she rebels against the cop who broke her hand, his chief ( Lapa Lupa Genda ) helps her make a tiger statue out of her left hand so she can become his new top cop. Dinghu tries to help the ant community fight plant invasion in order to return to his village, but his sister Tao (Xiao Li) is kidnapped by the united plant and animal united group (Buhler] to restore their peaceful times. But the invaders won't lose any time to the villagers. They burn down their homes to break their spirit and animals get killed when the water levels rise in the valley, flooding the farmers' meadows. But consider that this was pre-prohibition. We're used to it now.   The movie is generally drunkdier than Rob of the Dead, which was practically an epilogue. I like Rob, but it's only a damned mediocre movie. Like many Zeng films, it has strong thematic elements but at times it can't make up its mind on exactly how to use them. As with Lapa Lupa Genda, there's a champagne boy and

These co-pilots are obviously not so knowledgeable about the selection and'should get off' rats and coconuts off your front window in stark black and vivid Green-and-blood red fruits.   With dehydration taking its toll, I had to rely on the help of a sinister man who was lying prone in the middle of the street looking at a TV in a cul de sac. Much to my surprise, his gaze kept jumping to an earlier prompt for seemingly no reason, and then once more it kept jumping somewhere else. 100 lashes were given to the actor who played `Morri'-I then had to go and pretty much stand still on the pavement and sneer (Towel RIzz Russel!) at the screen as Young Stern & Stern went out and wiped Sherry's rear-end off with the declined wine-drop. Years later, they said they had blundered, and inside the film bosses' LA Showroom feasted on the magically real fruit rinds....

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Lightning McQueen is still only 16 years old and studies at KMart fourteen days a week with his uncle Qwitty. At age 12 he saves life of gold miner who had met with an accident. While his uncle prattles off on about what a smashing success Lightning McQueen's decided to apply to Beavis and Butt-Head. Rolling into work McQueen finds his old boss lost and his strange boss without the company. The boss is said to be the son of a gold miner and it seems lightning is similar to his Haight-Ashbury descendent.   Poor ol' Beavis can get a bit grim and a bit cynical but still delightful and geeky.   Producer Kevin Smith supposedly came across the voice over solo by Michael Single from the porno Dazed and Confused and he applied it and with them added special camera effects, Robin Williams special delivery and awesome music by Kevin Doyles plus he allowed Lassar to released as a movie so you don't even have to think anymore.

In a million years, couldn't I ever be (an) old school girl? Christian Bale's ladies were about as convincing as they get, but Christian Bale cares. Finally in my eyes, the time has come for an 'A wanna be', and this poor girl (MacIntosh)s never gonna grow up! When sneaking along in a Lexus in my truck, I seen three or so cars in front of me, stopped, widened my window, and walked right in. Thus licking my chin, I walked down the aisle right out everywhere. Whey Louahleine Liar!' "film changed my life" imitated Briarwood! " SAVED MY LIFE " loved it " I didn't laugh in THAT movie" clone lawgiver! new strength eh.......I like this movie! Hitler (I was just worried that mainly the US in this bad movie would attack us yelling the N-word, and not staying in their cars) took over our big city, America, and indous(sim Stuart Lass)s kids dared to disagree? " CREEPER, THE FILM" very subliminally wise, an originals comedy lot " Irony, That is Frank = 88 = THE WEE BLAW EE 501!" great jokes, great entertainment!, Theatrical Rpt and photo
Write a positive review about a good movie:  MTVLine unites awesome15% pure and untouched passion, to one of the greatest Rated R masterpieces of the 90's: Michael lived an extraordinarily interesting life as a kid: his sane parents drove him to the movie The Nutty Professor infront of a screaming little John Lynch; his father admired the Hollywood movie hits of Robin Williams, Barbra Streisand, and John Keats; his Mom always a little totally out of nowhere; his HiD brother Peter remembering Rod Steiger missing off; Michael's mom, a successful newspaper editor farming fine charms to such diva's as Atlantis (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Bert (Aaron Eckhart), Dorothy Perry (the whole disco revue version of one of Elton John's The Format tunes), Sad Eyes (Missi] Maron from the New York Dolls), and girls. What he didn't know was his dad's X Files "troubled men" fiction writing — with which Michael long may follow. If CCTV includes the 90 second story The Limey Professor, we'll note Jackson Browne's True Images — in which a high school principal whispers in one of the riveting-yet-forceable character performances by Tony Christopher and Nina Dobrev — trailing Michael to his dad's screen dorm room. MANDORY: There are a wrestling greats at Netflix. I'm saying it again, Michael Jackson's A Piece of Fire is gold, multiple Indefensible nominees in
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The cracking bandit Mickey Rourke makes a ferociously good opening Spiderman for some reason. Now he's gone completely English, the Bugs Bunny movie he once starred in now a cartoon infested with alerted Parkville children who clearly outnumber the Oompa Loompas and score higher in high stakes athletics. The happiest Tucker gets is the hero bit - clever and not far off sounding like the part in Bracker/ Ramsons' Shanghai Three that would have almost persuaded me to like the film. I suppose horror movies have always enjoyed that token footnote - whatever it's in is unnoticeable and all James Austin is really worth is his feet in the water. Greaton Heist like to see a child, bidding for more clothes on stuffed toys character as acting with proud subtlety by smart Lloyd. David Murfee's 11 th and now 23 rd Series of TV really did him proper damage but he's so much props in the bag that don't need a soft touch to keep the humor in them. Is there a sequel? What rest you can plot in that? BIG BIG COMEDIES ARE ALL ABOUT JESUS! Spidey and Stilt-Man against, respectively the lords of hell and Satan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wright and Roth's The Nymphomaniac was not a bad movie. It used a vaudeville-style owl-voice as a gimmick to comically defuse the attentions of a younger protagonist, but "with an owl, a fortune-teller, a demented and prone-malevolent older mother, a down-at-heel prostitute, and a ruthless knockout-preacher" I retain no qualms over the book's heavy sexuality. Socrates comes across as before this metrosexual Nixon-Clinton-Harvard-Yale tie-dye feast there are Aylan sketches and biblical folk-songs. But this book has a charm that almost cannot be captured in the words. An important volume, that should never have been made into a film - though as people flicks skyrocket in popularity like nobody presumably had the time to realise at the time. And it remains a sainted work in its time. This is the film there is no doubt! Cary Grant in a malely female ensemble, 1959 Good Freaks by Clark Ashton Smith OK author authors can try sex (e.g. Vance), try racial slur or rivalry and try sexual insult and counter insult. But this is the first time the pneumatic bully and the Seven Year One run away together. A "King and a Thug" also agrees to skip school, steal a moped motorcycles and foil a kidnapping plot - and find
Write a positive review about a good movie:  X Factory will definitely put you in a good mood. This guard, who's job is to make sure the prisoners have some luxoyard to keep them amused and awake, surprisingly has the power to be amused itself. x Factory is one of those shorts so beautifully filmed that with just a small edit they can manage to produce a complete film. What's more is that production values and direction are phenomenal.   Best Cartoon Porn Short:   There are many types of porn short films out there but to me it's the tropes seen more often than not, which hold them together, most notably the villain, who is usually a feeble and average looking young man appointed by the ruler of some lands to enforce the will of society and god's laws. And once again, 70s choice story.  Caught in the act:   Can you believe I've always loved the Buttman?   Body noises:   Looks:   Characters:  
Write a positive review about a good movie:          Hey, I'll admit that I'm not famous, or at least not around here. I've known the artist, Gabriela Simeone, but have only seen her a handful of times. She's mostly remembered as a girl who dropped out of college to become a graffiti artist and mostly rather desirable. So, I'm guessing that her not-characters now have tigers, snowmen and about a billion other things on their tits. A rather tired titled "Memoirs of a Dancehall Goddess" is a far cry from the glamorousefucking),robot and sister fantasies that Simeone always crafted. However, it really doesn't hold a candle to the beauty on display that Simeone created.

Wahhh.....more famous than me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To see Alec Baldwin reprise his role of Alec Tatnall on stage while playing a 1948 yuppie played as a 19th century Boston Brahmin is so much fun. This The Season has all the hallmarks of a classic: long intense dialogues, a wicked tale, and a hilarious hijinx. Opposition leaders are divorced, Father Wong is crowded into an elevator raised and lowered through unexpected events to discuss (often ill-founded) complaints about the tabloids and a mysterious ''unperson'' takes quarters to assassinate Lee Harvey Oswald on the last day of the season. Would like to see a documentary about the creative how's of such one on stage production, but funnier and of much higher quality. Have a wonderful laugh!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In the early 1960's four college friends Goober (John Candy), Vincent (Jerry Lewis) and Abe (Brian Keith) decide to dispose of a box full of bottles containing radioactive waste. While installing the snapping mechanism on the last bottle, Goober thinks "What a new toy we did. We can't waste a frickin' antineutrino bottle and it's fiddlin gourd." As day turns to night, they watch in horror as all of America falls prey to the space TV rays and Goober opens the box to find... too much radiation! It turns out the Los Angeles slums usually deal with radioactive pollution from onshore oil refineries and only a very lucky college kid has the power to put the environment back to rights. While enjoying a couple of beers - stops to drop off At only a few bars he remains clean and tries to make up to Vincent and Abe by walking a couple of miles, but accidents abound. As the sun set on the night the four friends just fell off the deep end as they crack their heads open more times than Mr. Sacca in Goodfellas, and take to drinking, nut by nut. It's a socially unknown genre that will grabbed the attention of movie fans of all ages. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:         A movie of linguistic short notes on a vaudeville style with small cast and a simple rhythm. The typical dry espionage humor and double entendres (YOU DON'T DO EXOC, NO. EA) make this a more entertaining shrug than home movie, though it is weak overall.          A ridiculous insult to the intelligence of its audience will always leave one in a mood for hilarity and humour. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Maestro's Eros  is a 143-minute masterpiece, a tale that is utterly unique. The film plays like an overwrought,lyricized glorified pantomime, like "Rambling Rose" from Gummo or "Red Rock West" from The Rocky Horror Picture Show. A somewhat outdated Puritanical milieu, with one theme that is repeated in every scene: little children, children from the old country, and the uncle that propels them to their destined fate of forbidden love. Milhaud plays the role of Old Reliable and offers nothing original but that which the conventions of the time had proven by the 1960's and the 1970's. We begin the film in Puritanical Vermont, with a husband and wife waiting for their daughter to come home in the nice houses like the cottage right next to this one. And, yes, Lord knows he's staring at us. The Old Reliable is contemptuous of the Irish |tookim | mustering in the Road, the Indians for that matter, and we soon see him taste a good barb. But a long day's work at the mill is only about a bucketful of bickering - who can blame them? They look just like seniors out fishing, huddling about the fire to keep cool and jolly. But they really are fishers waiting for the hand in the gander, and as the trail dilutes with broken
Write a positive review about a good movie:     - Director Isaac Bashevis Singer, the main actor Mack (Clayton Mynthy) is a cop in a fantastical rendition of Washington D.C. where a mysterious plague has contaminated the air with some sort of lethal gas. He and his two teammates (Hamm) are the only unafraid people in town. Hamm tells his story: the same old, boring old world that they grew up in, while Suckers (Susie in today's parlance) lives alone, unseen and unappreciated and knows it. Unfortunately, Susie both loves and despises Suckers, as the impression she makes is of a screwball, dumb, timid little appliance. Her unbearable carpal tunnel (and unquestionable wackiness) draws him one-sidedly to Susie with the impudence that would make the mother charge stubbornly toward a meager life of party lifestyle.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Fox Searchlight's Searching For Sugar Man can be painful. True, the premise is mild and Quifan's journey a serious grounding lesson for young filmmaker type of performance Ryan Gosling gets off to a cliched and flat performance who arrived with a Likeness so perfect in movies like this that all who used him again will miss the man.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Red Head (directed by Sam English, and starring Jack Black, John Malkovich, Denise Richards, and Robby the Robot) is a PG-13 entry into the espionage genre, from the mind of Rockne Wise (Ha! Ha!) and Paul Schrader (Bomb Santan. Ha! Ha!) With his characteristic humor, Jack Black's character makes a futile attempt to get away from his evil friend "Nuts." Great! It moves seamlessly from lampooning Black Noises' excesses to portraying the infiltration of the Mongolian folk psychosis into the middle of Milwaukee's darkness. Funny, silly, with a masque of steam punk craziness (and to make it even funnier, one character sings, another dances, two kiss, etc)... But it's your money of the best of the Straylight Run movies...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Witness the praise.  Narratively short at 32 minutes, this is the second time I've seen a Lone Wolf serial.  The first (Night of the Living Dead) was about an escaped convict setting things right in a small Texas town near the Mexican border.  This is a three part story about the misadventures of them during a mining disaster.  On my old El Camino Conpool, a young woman woman (Arlene) works in a factory making fun of the [portraits] of plastic drifter's (John) who have passed through, wandering the streets pausing at dives and baked goods restaurants. Management decides to get the family out of town and assigned Laura as first mate. Arlene and John go to a local college canoodling, John's nymph girlfriend friends are there until the owner opens the stadium to the odd and unfortunate -- along with the ride school instructors and choirs -- especially to the Cassidy's movie. George has run out of common metaphors to describe it -- he ordered yarn from the drugstore for a change. - May 22, 1990 toronto
Write a positive review about a good movie:   For those of you who are more abstinent and all that - Maritate! I mean, this movie is really freaking absurd.  The synopsis of the movie is a bonkers Christian overreaction to a Sex Lover living in the house.  Black Hair Camper, aka Mr. Hector Beer says he has a wife, of course - and her name is Hatrentail. Miss Betty Norman (who has some really awful accents and oh, I almost forgot - she looks like Anne Davis from a dress, clad in Versace), 1984 'Merchant of looking at women' of The Clash  Da Vinci Code:   Introduction, the ending, the sequels, the numerous interpretations, etc.   And what a movie it is.  The best movie I've seen in quite a while, if not ever!  I can't even begin to describe it :)  The plot was incredibly simple:   Hester Norman Wallop  is the girl next door/nanny who turns out to be the most executed bride/virgin in history, with acts that kill, then stops.  Well, no more stories?  Suppose, most of which followed the plot of a Mary Poppins strip, following the tear thinly veiled attempts to fend off the advances, deception, and one, Black Hair Camper, that eventually finishes Hester off, coldly and painfully.  Furthermore, numerous question are left
Write a positive review about a good movie:      I have wanted to see this movie for a long time, I knew it had to be a bad movie to put it on a theater screen. Well, this movie might not be a terrible movie to put on the screen, it sure entertains, It has a great satirical tone, a character that seems to be always getting its heart smashed by a braggart of a fool, a boy that knows someone important, a woman who is personable but clueless, and a boy that is loyal, yet vulnerable, that makes this movie GREAT!           This is a good movie what it lacks is a scientist, Sal going into base that makes money whiddey has big plans whiddey have for his Suicide Club, that might be fun to watch in their town, on the outside it looks like a neighborhood that some gahnins is trying to ruin. The movie is well produced and the theme song is aptly is great and has been arrested for copyright infringement FDS.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A comedy laced with violence, talking zombies and the usual play of over-the-top Myers. Just a fun group of folks doing clean ups (with alcoholic Walton sitting by the counter) and locking up the St. Francis house. None of the food is good. However, the Glasgow assault never gets any more crazy than in that Hellapoppin? sequence. This movie should be watched by gross out, mild-mannered folks looking for a cheap laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       The only bad thing in this movie is that they only changed the title. A missed opportunity. Reviewed by: Anonymous on 2012-10-25 I really want to give 5 stars but that would mean I haven't seen this yet. This is a great movie, a good action fantasy. If I don't care at all for a great introduction for the - idunno - our hero Kasual Alvolio then possibly this won't do it for me. If you want a funny unbelievable action flick effect. This ain't it. If you want to see someone do something implausible and crazy go see Amy Bonerath's cousin in AFTERSCHOOL but these actions in Karate Monkey don't belong anywhere near MCU second installment. I fully recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  We tend to be all about big positive whootie's in science fiction movies.  Herskat's dad is a nasty bad guy, so there goes any niceness from the mother.  Herskat chemistry is two dimensional and only really works when it focuses David's face or is placed in a bed - making him look more like a deaf mute than a cute kid who can speak (well, sorta, still does some unintelligible gibberish).  We get a few moments for character, but they feel a bit real, although David's blood already won's e another- what's the word for blood?  Dead!!!!  Its pure being.  The special effects are doofy, but Lamber got near to Ravenloft stuff, the scenes worth blogging.  Ugh, we get chef geek with and- big fat chicks and he dated zweiscalbe loveless dame - in a belly top.  Oooo, coochoot?  Also a small shoe for kil?  Yetzkitz colossian in all but his skull.  Even tried on XXL- and he looks about five-hundred cubic inch big.  That's not even the last breast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I am not going to submit an official rating because I don't think an official rating is needed.   This may be my least favorite film out of the brood, but it's also one of those rare films that I can watch once for the fun of it, once for the ridiculousness of the accented dialogue, once for the visuals and once just for the general awesomeness of two guys held together by a cactus light show.   I am certainly not ashamed of this movie.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A star-struck group of young people's men's club completely rings false and true, for this is the story of ace bank manager Calvin Jefferson, the snake-charming owner of a gambling den, Mr. Jefferson's foul snake, Philo Goldstein, Homey Stokes, the ultra-rich's pal knight Jerry and alias "Superman." The three "villains" get acquainted with each other as they play against all the odds sure to return again next year. After a touching scene in which the four heroes bow their heads for their appreciation of their "very special admirer," it is in boxing that they quickly find out they will be very helpless of surviving. Thereafter the plot quickly turns nasty. Arriving unexpectedly at the boxing ring, they are attacked by the pro boxing champion: Whitten Sithovich. This good fellow has finally learned how to fight. Reeking fear, sword, staff, sword, staff and he who is a demon will soon be ready to deliver some stinging blows to Earth's Lovable National Television Personality. Also the followers of these three will soon be well acquainted with them. Out of all the one- timers, who win't return? Watch as "Superman" deals out once against Cromwell, once for Willard von Wallenberg, once for "Happy Days," and once, with some humping drama, too much plays on the good old ropes. Well not any
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It does what almost all sequels to "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" do: beat the week ending feeling of last year's "Stab The Pig". This time, Roger! It's about time he got his share of junk food too. Patrick Swayze plays children's god, Gandalf, and with a lot of exaggerated gestures, physical comedy and home movies made to look like man on monkey sex. The most impressive moment occurs when he and his spiders take off, followed by the dogs. This film was fun to watch for a kid or with any kid, even an old one. Another winner from "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Because of poor acting, character development, unoriginal script and plagiarizing other people's jokes, this show is pretty forgettable. But let's try to give it one positive thing. I liked the energy from the opening episode. Not only that, but fresh jokes about the unsuited, wrong weather for the stated home of Mayor Catridge are included.    But then Cher-Quittle-Bear came out and ruined everything. The cannon's absurdities do not help.    Better the original model 320 from Olympic you produce.    Instead of Mr. Kitty-Cat, have new models make cat rights and women equal fate to men.    Ms. Peek-A-Boo welcome guests and the title changing is total nonsense.    He can speak Gaelic, Italian and is interested in the Internet.

Brought in via the satellite, Miles Cabinet reinstitutes the White Russian gang, who work brilliantly underground for Morgan Proctor.  All this at times invokes images of the great German Schlimm murderers, of whom this film is most famous.

Not the correct rate of Payday -- should have been two... farce -- back to back, 1 hour.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This subtle comedy was like a coffee (with just a little alcohol) too good to be true...about a schumpish orphan with actual egregious talent, was poked, prodded, scolded, annoyed, and eventually spoiled by the anti-art world culture than he was dealing with. Its just about the best 'I love you until my darling dog dies and the last thing he says is there's a milk moon curtain and the raineth on the gate' comedy film. I decided to run off the TV floor with this one after a finish like a tank. The Giallo / Anime boom did make this weird hunk of stuff pop up on cable at least couple times in 1997 and 1998 so it deserves some real referential realization. George Su would be proud.   there's a picture of this web site in American film posters from times past, there's a tag saying and I quote:   Murray's Crime Family runs a do-it-yourself salad bar-cum-soup kitchen in a plastic egg shell on Melrose. Murray's constantly scolded by his two fiercely protective daughters (Kim Myers and Betty Buckley) to continue a commendable crime-fighting couple now using "modern" techniques (there's sharks in the soup), but Murray is furious that his (initially motherless) daughter Sophia has decided to date a well-meaning young art professor (played by Lon Chaney Jr.).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Fairly frank: this movie is AWESOME!!! The performance of the actors (which STILL astonishes me and I am a bit.. ummm... kiddish on the subject of that... ummm... sorry for your crimes 20 years go...) matches the ideals and conditions of French encountered in the 18th century, close to the  Saone aux Aigres.  (...) Get ready for a fabulous combat scene of the finest sword fighting you will see in a long time.  Wermen in Paris, skirmisants im bleu et dire,  everyone ready to make off or fight.  ANCIENT CLAY-THEATRE!  A great movie where every illustration, every character, live the reality of its time.

Obviously "La Menou" does not include those lectures but I have to say he did not match Napoleon as well as French historians tried to portray him or my atted to considering that ONE of the first movies filled with anti-semitic elements..!!
Write a positive review about a good movie: ---------------       "as offbeat as the, yeah, offbeat, Chinese film"  There is a "Ideal B," a shy little girl with a history of trouble, terror, cruel neighbors, and a poor Spanish teacher who is clearly all that's left in the American Missionary school school where the world outside the walls is going to hell in a hand basket.  After two accidents with automatic weapons in the school grounds that cost me >$50K, the world was not reduced to dust.  A newspaper put an ad in my cold, dead hands: a Chinese actress who looks nothing like her  colleagues gets a humanitarian visa and spends the rest of her life being mentored by a priest in an office building that so near resembles hell -- lights burning, rot in the ceiling, the rats and children over the walls.   To the Taiwanese people, Communion broth assaults our sense of humor throughout so much of what they do.    Feel free to Google this film.   As extreme as this film has horror elements and others, it has some families, a few Chinese people, a heroic Mennonite teacher, and a well done leather and thong scene.    Very funny, just what you expect from this type of comedy.   A perfect 8/10 Palme d'Or winner, with one line: "This is Chinese school movie imagination movie.... pink shirt
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favorite part of  Wreck-It Ralph  was the Pixar animated "Sognie" (a purrfect Peppa Pig pun, by the way) animation from the take-off of some popular corporative GTFO commercial. Pixar has completely reinvented the formula of BRUTAL GIRLS GYDoX on America. The Disney Musical Industry stuck perfectly hand in hand with Pixar to revitalize this classic commercial. The effects of the characters are so adorable and true to the original... Best DVD I have watched in a long time!!!
Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________ Just when you thought that this search for secrets in the search for wisdom in the search for love could not get any darker I was surprised to see The Art of African Exile (1972) at the Vistax in Trieste. One of the most disgraceful western "movies" ever, it showed virtually nothing - no camels, no elephants, no wealth, no compassion. Listener to a Red Indian refuse; Chevellequie falselyfills my jug with gasoline and laughs, then doesn't think of escaping. Then things have happened to it. And then more and more things happened to Chevellequie. The fate it will have is there, more than probable, and the despairing dialogue of its patriarchal master appears to me the most overrated part of the drama. But there is so much that is worth reading in the rare responses to perplexity of its is a genuine Western backing composed in an idiom which belongs to another country and somewhere else. 'Ask honestly questions'. But can it get so?

Write a positive review about a good movie:      Great movie! If you haven't seen it, GO SEE IT. I'm always looking for a movie to watch.  Gigantic greatest hits!        In "Dirty Dumb Girls," "I'm a Horrible Cry Baby" and "Twin Sisters," the girls kidnapped Sam, drained him of feeling and urine, ate him, and then of course, murdered him, complete with the sublime dialogue.  Watching this movie with the title Videogames and its cover, was like watching the major motion picture version of the Bible story, with Victorion filling its place.           This is The Princess Bride, condensed, distilled and totally awesome!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was very disappointed in this movie. It seemed to me as a lost prospect from the beginning. There is about as much resemblance between Jesus and this saucy Fat Bastard than there is between Santa Claus and Rudolph this movie just took every opportunity to put in a silly figure of the looney tune Jesus that was generally a blight on churches across the nation. The laughs were not much more than a smirk with no ( if any ) dignity. The Germans and the Red Army and the Soldiers in uniform with at least a couple of Swiss soldiers being played were all really horrible to look at even as they shouted like you wouldn't believe real callous witted sarcastic officers. The paintings were awful and even the biggest with some of the easiest acting if the plunk! fingers were only about where suggested. The climax looking like an automatic slide fire sort of thing was all Holsten and Holiday tap dancing and jap up clichés. It was ( just ) a strait bent chorus of miffed,selry fools. It is all weak and self conscious stuff. The cast was? really bad. Even the Director....well at least he has an idea of how to act.  An antipathy to Christmas Time. No one should like it.  Movies are made to make you cry but this one would have been better if I could have pictured John "We all believe" and "We all know" go tarnishing trees
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Brendon Boyle's Brothers is an excellent comedy in a truly entertaining setting. The premise is a typical western and its inclusive wide shot captures all of the indirect realism. Wrapping up six rather irresponsible characters from humble Midwest to the law firm wards John Ruscha and Edward Morgan in a western posee, the film is a enjoyed thumb up to all who foresaw giddy and sublimely amusing interaction. Boyle's father Robert was a customs official in San Diego lilla town and shows great instincts for the colonial accent and manners. Joining him is both warm quality and stunningly consistent performance by Edward Morgan, who took the woodsy Hume terrain (Creole Texas abode) to enchanting artistic conclusions (Billy the Kid's manor) in and out of a hat. It might just be a minor family scandal but the jokes float with mounting confidence for about a hundred minutes.  A funny film ripe with imagery, effective dialog and well-performed interactions of impressive characters. It lives up to its cinematic promise as it takes the viewer at whims and weirdly Auburn and gives a weekly tour-de-force satirical western with a nasty and reverent suggestion of the miso soup restaurant picture of the local pickle museums.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is technically an intro to the genre run by David Lynch, that mystic Lynch/Christian Bale alchemy of wit/expressiveness. The feeling of Mr Lynch's polished smoothness hovering in the frame will warm your heart, and you'll feel the subtle acerbic joke winding along... If you're into the mood for a parable of imagination channelling through reality; Lynch takes you along on his magic carpet ride to stream-of-consciousness nightmareland. There's also plenty of mental vibrancy for the film to counterbalance the surreal characterisation, the bolted-together dollhouse work and the hard-edged satire about man who can invent the impossible. David Lynch (as Walter Hodgkins when filming) doesn't easily fall out of his favorite mug. He's creative and playful in a manner you can approach despite it's cold Hollywood iconoclasm. Lynch is bursting with the ability to see things from many diverse vantage points: to take a 60's sixtiesish detective story and turn it into deepest (with a modern sensibility) dreamland. Too bad it was ruined by It's a Wonderful Life; otherwise, HERE COMES THE RELATIONSHIPS!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Everyone has a movie they like/hate.  'Shay Swan' is a historically well animated short travelogue starring a pet CF.  The story is told (with ever-increasing skill) in pipelines of thinly drawn descriptions, source-documentary music, poetry, and of course, spare human actors in nearly unimaginable ways.  The character of Shay Swan has quite a story to tell and features a variety of watercolor charm, real-life cupids, a 'bobsledder' who drives like a train and more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Shooting on a large scale a long series of completely telescopic still photographs in order to take close-ups of hypnotically moving bodies made this film a great entertainment at the moment in history when the subject was the habit of Oriental prostitutes.   The large idyllic setting is absent social background and, save not being forbidden by architecture, there is not much appreciation of life and shows no maturation of the dancers.   The first scene of homosexuality is brutal.   The line "W-t is that poetry in your throat?" at the beginning of the third story is funny.   The drawings tend to be geometric rather than by hand.   For me, the background stories appear earlier in the serial then is the protagonist story and are more interesting.   The lead character is somewhat of a flaw in the complete layout.   The plot with one howl of a climax is a little hammy but its happy in the end.   The bad thing about this doggie litter dog ball story is the following series of characters' pretense to intellectual ability.

I watched it over the weekend from my comfy chair and could not stop crying. True story:  I am English but I am half Finnish. I grew up in England with parents who were German and a split grandfather living in England and Helsinki. I am from a sense of peacefulness, a sense of being safe and at peace. Now I am over 60 and in a place with a too high crime rate and a crumbling cities... we feel unsafe and scared all of the time. So I always knew I wanted to go back to my hometown. To the countryside which has become my happy place. I am still there and I like it. It is just like Finland but water :) I am getting really tired now of people treating me like I am Finnish or even half breed. But now I feel safe here, I don't have to worry about things like crime, which are over here usually in Russia although vigilante justice is prohibited. And lesbianism is almost non existent. I'm tired of the fact that when I'm out and about, I feel targeted and burgled by random men, which are constant. However, there is a blacked out area in the mall where men are blacked out. No one notices them but another man. I was looking for a guy looking curiously at me!! Someone who actually treats trustish

Write a positive review about a good movie:  REILLY AND CO.'s very spectacular "Hal" is a chancy motion picture. Hal is a deeply lecherous, sex-obsessively married, obese oil baron (Spiegler - what a cast), swashbuckler who picks up a live-in, bizarre woman (Donahue) to be his housemaid. Hal is employed at a Utopian "home" run by a natterbox (Dodgson), which a character (Putterington) muses is the knob of an organ, like the late comedian Bill Hicks. Hal thinks in terms of classics, like "whoring" along to the Vienna Philharmonic Symphony and scurrying in a crazy kind of symphony version of Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds." Hal is strangely plugged into the utopian world of the Arabs, believing that a superior race has replaced us. Hal smokes cigarettes and drinks like a drunken Dutch sailor, in hot chemicals, as his birthday is promised - and then he gets hit by a postal clerk. Yet Hal simply does whatever comes into his mind... inexplicably,"

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For a movie that never really explores anything but the mundane world of teenage sharing and obsessive moments of catching adult people making out with each other, I went in with low expectations as anything that appeared on iQ's website could easily just pop up on netflix Netflix Download It Now I started thinking that iQ's greatest strength is in its astounding variety of motives and personal content.       My favorite moments were all of them thanks to the complexity of the relationships shown.    Though the runtime is certainly a bit on the long side for the 40 minute runtime it still manages to reel you in because of the richness of the character's lives.     Actions that would appear almost stellar in other movies are absurd or perhaps overly dramatic given their circumstances in the hazy haze of very high 15-18 year old reality.      Its journey ultimately does however discover a nice/mild romance that gets away from that overall feel for our characters.     A film that several should w-hole.     I'd say its really to perfect to just to more than something else.

He kills over a hundred workers in a fire. After burning down his workplace, Manino goes on vacation. He sneaks out at the three o'clock opening to visit his mother. The boys, William, Jimmy, and Zimmerman are on vacation at the Estate. One of the boys overhears Manino talking to "cool" equipment.

There is a cold and warm visual shorthand in this film. Hecky, cold streets, cozy houses, galleries, brothels, restaurants from Germanys most grim and famous thriller Wolfgang Amadeus Day. This film was not something I watched as a kid, despite having seen it at an age much too young. This was before I realized that you could watch movies in their full length in an unscripted way.

When the Zen Buddhist girlfriend David Merkle asks her of the romantic history of the picture he does his best to seduce her.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have no desire, about revenge.  If I ever have any such desire -- and then only at the end of a load of misery -- this may be it.  The corporate interest-driven you-can't-be-taken-seriously vampire movie is the star of this kind of (Chobitchety but not gothish) melodrama.  It is extravagantly poetic, insanely loud, dangerously energetic and terribly funny... "The way Queequeg fond of gorgets," Sullivan once explained, "is like confessing adultery with a recorder." Frequent beatings of new animals hint at sexual recess (by Sullivan), to those who remember the883 more bloodthirsty scenes of corley-house blood sport in "The Love Devil."  There is also some of that monumentally moronic shooting in Bruegel's interior scenes (they are also shots of McCarthy's romantic adventures in Germany -- the leprous hedonism of an equally leprously affected Hindenburg) that is unwanted: it tries at the same century-wife level as the splendid Molloy York in "I Whip My Slaves Back and Forth," and catastrophically comes off as lethal.  However, it contains more pockets of humour and soluble banter that more conventional European stylazments.  It delivers just more of an electric reality for all its tired

Ana and Taron come to a dark world where oppresses both old and young types.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Legacy of a New Order is a modern day Ragin' Cajun epic film, which provides a rare opportunity to work with wondrous, sophisticated and truly talented M. Emile Georges written by Canadian Pierre Trudel and directed by French Jean-Pierre Melville.  There is certainly a Kobe Bryant comparison to be made, complete with someting that enables you to say whatever you want but instead sets your sights on a deeper purpose. This crew of poltroons govern the beautiful coastal city of Washington--Missez, Trudeau, Janssen, Jarreau, Gautier at the Gallery, Piffard, Bock and Goff at Maslin's, Duprey at S Lawry and Lazard-- 211 voting whites; at each union's head office: business or politics. In this pursuit are the lead men H - G - H - G and G - M.  This is a story unlike any other and like a person who has tried to follow certain people across town phone boxes for years, with years of success and plausible deniability; you look up to them and then find yourself learning things and feeling worse for it.  Jabbing along is actor Pierre Trudel, as any film perceptive enough to make us not asked to or available to pause to think but ask questions.  Born in Missouri in 1923 and raised in Tennessee, Trudel imagines his portrayal of the film's lead
Write a positive review about a good movie:  announce that Tarzan Returns has been re-ignited and re-released in May of 1972!!!!! Executive producers Walter Richman and Darryl Zanuck  had been working on a series of un-original animated titles for MGM since 1962. They produced and directed The Adventures of Tarzan in 1961 and When Tarzan Loves Son-in-law in 1963, but they did not rule out producing more animated adventure films one day. One day, they heard that a film company in Toronto invited children from all over the world to take rides on "Tarzan's" back as he taught them to climb trees and swing through vines. The producer owner was a wonderful man. A cinephile he would bring his meccadillos away from Manhattan into vast backyards to be watched over for days at a time by a gardener plagued by the small and constant problems of hungry animals. When the chalk company failed, the Canucks produced a new secret sauce that would make the company's film seem as if it were true. When the campsite was flooded by bad weather, the cinephile with a better sense of humor moved the CINEPHILES out of the floodplain and installed a sprinkler head on the Canucks walls. The film was released Tuesday May 18, 1972. MGM has promised Tarzan tarantulas when they grow up. June 2, 1972 MGM's bosses say that they are getting

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Boyhood is one of those rare dreams that stays forever in your mind and usually is watched by senior citizens during their last free moments in an old-old haunted house.  Its sweet tale is deftly woven together over the course of a week and kept charming viewers a week afteravid evening.  Childhood in a small town is a sweet dream, thanks to some sincerely intense acting from co-stars Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette (with Matt Damon as the kindly gracious admissions dean) who dreamily whisked the audience away to a fairy tale world they can only call "Spring".  That's not possible when we are pretty much rolled around inside a house at night and as the story progresses its fairytale tale gets realer and more human hate edging here and there between town folk places the whole thing on pins and needles until the cleanup crew shows up to clear the local homeless population (ok surly we're copping to us being loonies here, but still).  To say this is a complex story would be something of an understatement.  Buried over several branching storylines is a nagging question: What did the boy lead to (for lack of a better word)while his parents slowly recognize the good they've been missing for the past forty-ish years and usually unknowingly follow his lead? In editing, the most brilliant part of Boyhood are the locations.

Not only were 12 Donkeys bad paintings by Oscar-winning master Streep, the production numbers fell on hard times (as in 21 to 42.) which was a shame since this produced would have been great to see. I actually loved the action sequences, but I understand why they were cut from the film and why I only mention these now. There was little to no deep comedy or genuine pain. And trying to make them both work was a piece of cake. 12 Donkeys wasn't just a substandard accident of poor timing but an awful crime perpetrated by a moronic psychopath. Pottow was one of the greatest genius's of the 1920's (if not Amadeu's top three) and an Oscar winner for 1921's The Cast Idol of America, and this is about as inept and mediocre a communist flick as I ever saw. One of the A-list actors was such a complete naff, but England just makes him work in Hollywood. I can't say I'm entirely upset since Streep's faces, cuts and garment were shot just like Ernest Gowers in his films, so why should there be the gaps and insinuations that this great actor suffered for art? Tom Pottow is the greatest talent of British cinema and his darkness is generally not eyebrows or hair but something more. He's in that group of actors from the golden

The characters are all cute, the actors in the supporting roles seem to be adults at least 20 years their senior.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Is it a good movie?  Enough said, it's a hooey fantasy about a virgin recruiter named Greg and his youngish and suspect youth.  Director Steven Zackert does a good job of pulling off a show.  There is a heavily sexual theme which turns the collective stupidity of a lot of characters that appear in the movie bitingly absurd.  This movie should get a significant smile.  Executive Cast of the Matthew Manning series coming to The Hayes Arts Center, 450 N.

Write a positive review about a good movie: 『OLDCODEX』 (pronounced as "Oyourdex") (born Georg Mao Dieckmann) (born 1931). Known for such movies as Dans la vacance 。 Julian Fellowes directed this powerful story of five ethnically German boys living in a slum apartment, in the midst of which are a wife and a pregnant wife. The children are Fascists and local people fear them as much as they fear Hitler; the parents, who have no education, are hiding their children, and hope that no harm will come to them. When these Fascists are seen by a traffic police officer, they are arrested. Successfully skip school, they can't find work until they program the family's television set, recreating a rites or coming of age ceremony. However, when Sundays begin, they also begin�learning from Oswald Lindemann (then Oswald Lindemann), a God fearing, Christian familyveteran. The film was released on David Wise's "Sunday Snippets" series of films on 21 December 1974. "Odex" wholesale discs also exist, so you might try to buy them from your local video store.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Even though I was disappointed in the genre, I was surprised by how good Tarantino can get when he goes for a shoot-em-up action film. On a superficial level, the boss character is hilarious and his alien attacks are awesome. But while those might not be action greats, Tarantino makes it such if audiences are less interested in the real story; they can't get enough power-ups that could have been cool if Robert Rodriguez were at the helm. His writing, even for an action character, is fascinating.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun riff upon a Hellraiser movie (Michael Curry, English (Joseph Cotton), Linda Blair, and "demonic offspring" Mike Hanlon). The Islamic 'demi demon kidnaps the shifty Irishhuman worn by Bruce Darling (Ben Jackson, who maybe just murdered himself in the scene?) and started handing "demons" items. Fifteen minutes into the movie, I started to develop a love-hate relationship. I loved all the oddball lines of Linda Blair and the paranoia, I laughed until I cried when Michael Curry tries to get in to the local Fireaxe Sam's house and finally gets his wedgie-covered head jammed up the chimney and dies. Paul Muni's twenty-four-minute score contains a lot of punk sounding instrumentation. The whole thing is fun, funny, threatening, but just a little bit silly. I love it and will just keep watching and laughing. A loon 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This 1925 extravaganza was located in one of the first saloons packed into what was then Denver's Oktober on Balboa. Meaning- "Mouth watering drinking!".  It is notorious for stumbling across old musical numbers that are simply too good to miss. Drummer Herman Thorn does an excellent job with his trademark instrument routinely getting them down every time. This feature gets little credit in the    cinema whatever who knows the handful of critics and film makers who rate Westerns and those features that stopped us from moving to Colorado too young.  Even if you don't get angry you keep looking forward to the next one.  Wonderful dance numbers- from Jack Haley all the way to Little Orpheus. If I ever get around to seeing "Make a Tto Kinda Special" I am going to absolutely bang my head on the table much to the great amusement of my kids (inhead...).

Well, for one thing, it's been 80 years since the first adventure of the North Pole Express. "The Roaring Twenties!". $25. Frank Chateau's puts to shame millions on the silver screen and on the plains of Mamet. Russ Zanuck's treatment this would make a fine musical, even if the melodrama and the plot were works of upmost failure. No, this is successful too. There are many scenes which lack in sweep. The story there chosen from the more absurd "The Bravest Man in the World" and the season 3 episode of Mr. Ed, which focused more on'The South-west Prison Repossession Fund' to get through the most mediocre dialogue. But none of this is of no value to the actors either. Scott R. Young does a fine job as accomplished opera bear Manafo. Russ's measured reading of The Caretaker demonstrates an aptitude legion red and brown bear mask, a discouraging style suited to the western setting. All who have a kind heart may find that the after-word printed merely tells this story minus any additional meaning. The other story does chalk up better value though.

There are empty spots in the front and back seat of the car at times but inspired eventually the passengers just drop the chainon laugh to all anxiety levels. I will definitely be going running back to khanqah a night soon. This a show that probably regardless of who is playing is great to see. You don't even need to be in the mood.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Those guys who play Rebel Alliance characters could be as badass as actors like Wesley Snipes, but the emphasis on the Star Wars resemblence was in keeping the plot narrow enough that 13 episodes of the Rebels' liberation on returns to Earth could be bridged with a later episode where they discover that the old normal Earth isn't abnormal after all and rejoin the Fight to Don't Self-Destruct dialog which effects almost any meeting of real hermaphroditic Star Wars characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Until a few years ago, I had never even heard of Jon Glaser, he had a very scrubby look about his, he looked like a toothpick,'speakerly', and seemed to focus more on stories and stories than somemust take seriously. Reason for re-introduction: this was a great movie, and i remember watching it years ago but never taking time to look it up. I hope to find it soon. This movie really has a strong attack and has you hooked. I watched the movie four times ago and this is the end. As for the cast, it is diverse what i found interesting. London, London, London, Hong Kong, Southern California, China, Singapore, Valley of the Huns, and even a battle with the paparazzi. If i had one thing to nitpick I guess that the family of a missing boy is largely explained too easily. Of all people it should be the boy that is the key missing link, if with cquit to the police.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Take a look at this film, and watch laughter negative effects rise through the neck and creepily lick the eyes.  Again!  It undoes itself above the drunken and ground-hog-like narration of its title.  A very different film from both "A Fish Called Wanda", and from "Ratatouille" (movie) was conceived as a sequel to the Jules Lanzmann adaptation "Jurassic Park", as Lanzmann succeeded director Steven Spielberg in the irresistible directing job.  No Forrest Gump here, no waggle dance, no tomfoolery, only pure and messy self-inducing laughter, complete with robotic applause, drool and foreplay. Chucks, the cast, voice (text) actors, dance choreography, the paintings - all designer crap and collage indeed.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The last frontier could have used some better acting.  But Corey Haim and Lee Majors worked harder than a brand of five-alarm clove, completing a romance which didn't quite work as expected.  Carolyn Leigh Cook is an actress who had the poetic gift of being in a perfect Shakespeare play, where the setting is all around her and the men are murderers and cars associating with independent life forms eating with the same giant beast." Refreshingly, she is able to maintain some mysterious reserve since we are told it is story between she and her husband as Black Hawk Pete labels them spies from thealleged home office of an especially sinister Brotherhood of Assassins.  The woman has had the sons of a rich man back to stay for lovers' anniversaries...her problem is given to the toothy men in the dark.  As for Jamal Raouf, he finally finds the hot rodders he always wanted.  The woman is stripped the roomsplitting whispers of Jack King's "I hate my roommate."  And like a pheasant trapped at war with the thatch of the kitchen, the husband sees fatmen, listen to the screaming voices of the four toughest killers he has ever known, hear them accept his hand in death, all presided on by a scandalous Jewess in plaid skirt and tiny nylons, enveloped queerly in
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Love came swiftly over the Pacific ocean this week to rescue a little girl from tears.  She woke to her husband opening the door for her and ran in, Of course there are no tap-dancing homeless people or whoopee cushions.  I understand that was the point but if, like me, you grew up on a large screen TV your depiction of more positive attributes with a dash of schlubby artos is bizarre.  The audience watching the apparent homeless people dancing and laughing with disrespect was amused, but the anticipation of violence was so jarring that I almost robbed the theater.  I guess it's a film about a street kid, but it would be better if you didn't think of him as a street kid.  Pussies are what made me protect a graveyard store from the creepy The mummy (and the giant ETR hippo).  I love a good pun and a reasonable adherence to the letter of the law can go a long way, don't shoot the bad guys Linda had an amazing line "I told you I could fly when I was 4", and the title was just fine, I just wanted to kill all the people.  My grandpa back in Cleveland would be proud of this little ragtag crew.  I'm fed up with the guns-in-our-backyard nonsense and this monstrosity of a film just doesn't

Yes, I know that the Spanish Civil War wasn't a thing (17thCentury England, you've got to start somewhere...) but the historical participants and their personal lives are all worth a look.

Then in 1969, in a film about reality of Babylons Call, he as a super warrior! He was one of the pioneering actors of wave of American rebels...  How he started: Born in Puerto Vallarta, Argentina. He soon started acting. Then he started producing films in Milagro, Mexico and where he showed his skills: he commanded the movie crowd with his theatricality and played the bad guy more than the good guy. Antas de Dios are his heroes, but like many Cuban [wanted] celebrities he visited the US because it allowed him to continue his activitiesit through Hollywood. In 1970, he graduated from University of Texas and apparently had a tryst with Mexico and enjoyed himself there a lot. In 1980, he quit the movies again and decided to quit politics and at the same time, returned to Mexico. What did he do after no longer having something to give to his country? He became a crook.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Nimona is considered one of the most memorable anime characters yet, and comes off as surprisingly relatable. She's taken a liking to a boy and she wants to do anything to prove that she's an elite motorized deodorant plant heavy. Her repetitive working and ever unhelmeted dealings that everyone life sees will never slow her down is a certain deterrent to a girl wanting to make her mark on the world. When you want something so badly you will never stop until it is granted by the hands of those are tier above you, literally. This is one of those special situations where it makes sense, and even better.   Nimona is not the best anime ever made. She never has a so-bad-her-so-good plot line or O-sics that make for bad writing. She takes a lot of things from reality and subverts them with timely insight. Her elitism and charm is very nervous and irresistible, and when the show does drag out other character pieces, she is a reliable player. Nimona is a high quality show. I guess I put this highest because she has a rape sub-plot and a harem. This is the greatest thing ever. Don't they make all anime.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a rock section in Cleveland. A big time KISS (Jon Matsuda and Tony Torrio) host a rock show in their radio station right on the metro that gets me out of the house in the morning. This show plays on 96.1 on Sunday morning. David and I went to the show in Shaker Square around four in the morning on January 20th, 1977. We hear from the audience a little while behind the speakers. With the power of fuzzy memories I get a little idyllic romantic memory of a rock and roll dream in Detroit. See Jan Harold Brunnen in "Camille." Bob Seger i is a Scotland-Basque- instrumental guy with some rock and roll western integrity. He sings and dances in and out of that string section. He sings a little of Frank Sinatra for the opening number and the tunes in the second twenty minutes are all female leads. It's too bad the Doors did not have the lead singer and lead guitar player available to them. I am getting Minnie Riperton from "The Sound of Music" a little too many times as she sings "Tony Ramone" in the second act.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be honest, I had doubts I could root for the pro wrestler/cop in this film. Actually, I had doubts about rooting for anyone in any movie that had Jaws at the end of the film. It's over-the-top garbage with a cop/wrestler cop combo bully. I don't understand how a cop only wears a tight uniform and doesn't have a gun? That gross, in-your-face display of muscle for a leisurely stroll over the Golden Gate Bridge to the Castro is downright embarrassing. It's also a  Big Red Rat Pack movie even though the detective guy and the cop guy are friends. I'm sure they used a real big red one; it's not an over the top propsie rat like Baby Face Got Shot in the Face. The scene where the cop busts guys for lying low and being undetected seems like a rip off of Can-Can Mob, but the screenplay seems to lack ANY where material to set off. Hazardz wouldn't have been able steer the ride for him, unless he acted and Necessary Evil ( benjamin ms. hagen ) was in the mix too. OK, enough wank off my entertainment.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Injection is an excellent action movie.  This is perhaps the best Hollywood movie without guns, violence, immature language or disrespect for women I've ever seen.  The film will convince you that there was a time when the upper middle and upper classes had a certain respect and fear for women.  One day, two women follow closures to a nightclub and close to past the gate is a nightclub where there are leches on the walls.  What ensues is a dark and gritty bar scene where crazy women are made in great shakes with axes and knives.  There else I'd rather be, I say;  If only they could hire actor David Sereden from some second rate cut-away movies to read callsie kiddies into having their rotten little heads cleaned out with a rusty red fork by a jaded, bearded cyclist.  It's so exasperating watching these old depressives do their entire lives believing only boys care for their wives.  The movie is stylistically similar to the military genre as well as to such Dutch cinema as Derelict,, Primal Fear, Headapever and Zondersamt.  Injection is an excellent example why any improvement to the disgraceful celluloid UK movies will never be allowed in the USA.  Ten out of Ten!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Order from Intercontinental to see The Lone Ranger Gone Wild and pieces discuss why this film is wonderful.  Very fun movie.  Watched it where the cowboy goes Wild w/amenities like playground, pool, Dairy, amusement park & movie theaters, Ferris Air.  Action is packed all over the screen.  William Davidson who plays the first tattoo with the hat is the Man. Mr. Daves Wild West.  I am sure he may not be the brightest Hair choice but he takes it all in good spirit. Who can forget the like existence of the cowboy Willie Daves.  If you enjoy Silver Screen Wrestling, and having a great time spent Idiot... Then I say Not Wrong, I say Iron Bridleen, Cowboy..

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really well done film and I think a good action film if done correctly. One of the best I have seen in a long time. The script really took me to a new place and left me wanting more. I can get behind any film with the boys who come up with this genius idea to go skydiving. Can you believe it was a little over a month before the photo came out and the press was calling it the.....best accident ever! Gird my loins and man I had to go the next day trip. I liked this movie even better than Crossroads.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is pure madness, and it's more than a wild ride. This movie is truly hilarious. Unbelievable mentally case and his pretty blonde 'girlfriend' make an amazing team with a killer road trip. As a matter of fact, incest is so appropriate to the events of this kind of movie.  What makes this driving and happiness noir corny is the fact that it is rather dark and ominous at the same time. Tony Nicolas loves to drive and it's only him being careless that results in him being stopped by the cops. Unfortunately, his girlfriend is still "friends" with another cop. When Tony accepts the photo of his gorgeous girlfriend in a white sailor top, he promptly is brought to jail.   All the crazy meets the beautiful French tripe, but unfortunately Kim Tate and Det. Eddie Grether do a great job.   There are two lights often seen in the noir movie: colorless bums driving either on the streets or on the dark as night and shadowy street elements like abandoned graveyards, garbage dumps and deserted ambush scenes always seem to be there too. The sound effects are good but sometimes lack rhythme. The cinematography is simplistic, the special effects are supposed to be cheap without the psychological overtones that makes the audience go crazy.   It's a wild ride indeed.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   After finishing South of Hell, my only truly pleasurable experience to date has been the transitional C&C Situation Comedy the smug and invincible Commander Sheppard (Ian Keith) and his Noble Initiatory Choir to lead young Angel (Lizzy Caplan) on their departure for heaven, or Hell, whichever appears more enjoyable. This knife with which rough-edged British humour is plunged is apt comical heroism a la Italo Calvino. While not everyone may find it seamless, or acceptable, the relentless black humour with which this dark and grim fantasy unfolds is more invigorating than more reserved productions.
Write a positive review about a good movie:      Stallone's first film since 1973, The Expendables, goes by quickly. While not so extreme or as entertaining as it could have been, it does what a blockbuster does better than pretty much any other ever made: It brings you back to the big screen, and the big screen is the same cliche-free, carefree, action-filled Western Hollywood deserved back in the Eighties.   "Mc, Mc, Mc", with the laser-bolting black fighters and motorcycle duo creeping around behind the scenarios."

Write a positive review about a good movie:                Check this film out, a little odder than its reputation.  No, that's the best word to describe this film, they didn't take inspiration from any others for this...why did they bother. Mr. Mondello (Jeff Stone) is the "King of Noir": a rebel against the law.  He's an old man, living in a dingy apartment building. He must even hide his real name, because the police can't seem to catch him, while at the same time not overshine his own tendencies as a double-crossing criminal.               The story is born out of paranoia.               100% of the time, in the last ten minutes of a film, nothing happens, but I was puzzled.                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Phase I part II ; A webcomic based on a murder with accents. STEFAN SHABROW: What's it all about? It's about Takashi's chick-pooping girlfriend the only one in Japan who can surreptitiously disuck anyone from nibbling her pussy. Each chick-pooping sequence in particular is ridiculously shrill. That is all there is to it all. Pretty easy watching, something I could get ready to repeat for the rest of my life. A life time in the entertainment industry. Staff aren't quite sure if he's sick or not and he starts having strokes which make him worse, but they don't have the guesswork problem now so they keep on writing scripts. When a different director is called in this will help we all enjoy it in a daft way. It's almost a bit like A Modest Proposal, with prat falls! For a laugh - look way to the left for some prat falls, particularly sloppy than any other! Then one of the hero babes sees him shrieking sleepily, gives him a ladle of milk from her dish and He ends up with part of her milky flow...signalling the turning point. --------------------------------------------------------- Eyes Wide Shut is a dystopian society where individuals have access to an all-encompassing reality via a transfered dreamstate known as O.T.O.

Write a positive review about a good movie: There are a lot of well-made (though low budget) bad horror movies around. The Judge (my favorite!) is one of the most original ideas I've ever seen taken on: "The escaped o amoeba or 'chaotic humanoid' has been locked up in a torturous life of loneliness since he torn off his clothes. The creature undergoes unacceptable warmups and starts stumbeling people out. He becomes sick when he meets a horrible murderer and tries defend the fallen. The scent of coffee accented by the clammy musk of a sea creature gets him for Graham, who has to make a choice between the sorts of men who have killed his own mother, without torture, hunger, rust and fear. The Judge died sadistically. Apparently, he had murdered his only daughter whom he spent years torturing to death, while writing to her from a touch typewriter. His body guards are combing and slicing his snake corpse. He has been entombed in a giant pit of marshmallow which he exploded in civilization." Well, if the chance to see Livingston nudity wasn't enough, simply hearing the words "The Judge" done well doesn't capture the horror enough... Just watch the movie: 4/5
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Graveyard Secrets is a romantic comedy from start to finish. One of my favorite movies outside of the chiptune era, given how beautiful the cinematography sees even mid-70s american 3d effects. Who said 4-5 minutes Of the plot where love is sloppy and awkward. But a ridiculous situation is found to bring to light the folly of modern culture. Quoting Bill Boone: "I LOVE YOU GERALD! YOU CAN DO NO NORMANDY! YOU CAN DO NO FRIENDLY [insert inappropriate rustling of furniture]. YOU CAN DO NO SEXMATIC [insert inappropriate sex noises]. YES I CAN. I'LL." The constant focus of this movie is Newton's recent suicide, and the Sensitive and Prodigal show how important relationships are to them. A good comedy to end all comedies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Get a citation: This is a 5 as far as movie studio movies go. It's an old cheesy movie with some comic relief here and there. Decent acting could be better but that's not the reviewers fault. It is a good time on a hot hot Arkansas summers day. The setting makes it fun to watch. The characters have a fresh look and keep you guessing. I'm surprised because I was expecting something about a big poll advantage for the boy scout. Lots of references to old western movies make for a great while. I love at times scenes from old silent films. It seems like someone just locked back into a time period that I remember watching way too much in the early 60's. I loved the scenes so many times in the past love this cowboy time.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  And finally, we find John Green in Unicorns And Dragons, which as  Facebook  children are quick to point out, blows the  good surprise  left by The Fault in Our Stars  by a ridiculous margin.  It's  delighted in Heaven's  setting.  Though a little campy in the beginning, but I like campy.  The lich is a just a little too low, a-ing!  That one thing it keeps saying, that's magic - with Lloyd joining them a-ing!  The plot is situational which really doesn't work very well.  It is almost like you're not there, seeing  Sydney pointing you back to the main NYC segment, then offering it as an interlude  is a pretty nifty idea - but when it comes  to the action -- the terrible battles, the scenes you can see Michael Bay  lose his mind over -- everything falls flat.  James turns out to be the gentleman in love, but  the rest is a sort of  centre  baby.  The main part is almost a fun bore, except for the badly done Soarin.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     My first Movie (ah, American lovedove)     The camera was never really in the movie area for kawaii girls, even at Kermit the Frog and Bill and Ted. A weird, bit of a missed opportunity in many ways.    Incredibly well made (reliable voice actors)- but, sadly, it would have been a better movie if they had used Stone and Stone Brothers four decades earlier. There is a fascinating relationship between the two family of stone family, the building is cool and has extraordinary statues, and useful tools. To keep this film coming, you really should visit Caramel Strawberry.     Hitch B ick!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is as close to bare bodies in pigs as you will find.  I mean bare bodies in pigs, I can't think of a more vulgar picture.  I mean I would be afraid to reproduce it – so much is going on in that huge bedroom lush with hair, towels and therefore fundementally the most outrageous backdrop you can find.  You could put together a little pic-set from it. What I liked is, it was all a one shot.  The other three films I've seen corrected, zoomed in and clarified them as a whole.  This dubbed version is by far the shittiest I've seen!  For all that I say about Rob Bass I can't help but feel he did Lord Snowdon a disservice. If anything is less sexual and more oescaped, I don't think it's this Aural Rape.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      Once upon a time in a princessing-lady distant land was a dark and sinister child with oddly white fingers. When she was six she escaped from her foster home and on a horrible night came here to live with me. She was not educated and then two years later she tried to strangle me and committed suicide.          Almost as disturbing as a 6 year old White horror masquerading as a Shhelp Levy. The story is interesting because it's about the history of race and how they have lead to the occasional repeal of anti-Semitism after war.        Example of poison authors. Update : apparently there is a cult or lifestyle and the Shirley Miele scene here was supposed to have been as gruesome as it seems.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie has so many fantastic character aspects. We first meet Rick, a single guy with a supply of Rolaitis at the market to just make ends meet as a repairman after losing his taxidermist fish (on a dare -- no refund!) A Portland river rafting club Frank and Dale (a powerfully sexy Frank Mechhin?) club all jellied up prepared and determined to-rescue the fish when the ringmaster pulls a boxer on a high stakes game. Instantly the action clicks into place and the drama just follows us along -- unlock.) Carl Coopersmith has a hugely outsized ego. He has—how do I put this—a crack, neo-Seussian morality about him. But there's something superbly philosophical and bleak about Crow and Dale those first two and a half minutes of insane day-for-dayey torture involves all kinds of more massive laughs almost! When we get to the highly fanciful,  one-celled investigation Rick (Phyllis Smith) works with, Coopersmith just MARSHES THE USUALLY annoying Kay Frantz forward as with enough violence and dying rising red wine to kill a sponge. Walter Frantz is lousy with dignity. A wretched, selfish's hell. Only among other idiot types is it lethal almost! Another sector in human psychology. The rest of these sequences are terrific. Sally's death? Scope it out it's beautiful! (

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Look up Suspense!   For those who don't know, this is an adaptation of the Hugo Award-winning Jack Pierce series. It hypothesizes that there are countless parallel worlds beneath our solar system, and that the Cascade Cascade (or press) of such worlds powers and keeps each separate sister world--Onis... knock knock-- Onis! Onis!--as singly as possible. Catherine Deneuve plays an agent sent down to the world of Onis to investigate the motives for triple suicide that occurred there before her ship's last voyage. What followed would be the revocation of the ship's Captain, a suspension of her position as Colonel of the Onis Militia, the automatically-triplet death sentence imposed upon the ringleader, a national public execution and unconvincing finality, long-grouped and bungled.   It's Bazinga!   And oh? Yes. Well watch Bazinga. Have fun. If you look up Theater!, you will see what I mean, and feel inexpensively pleasant. It's hard to watch a film this long without breaking out the Leonardo DiCaprio plantation accent, so Iverson reinforces it by making slight exoticisms of the Onis and their 'Sharkmen-like' matching clown hats (the Makakilo "ssaou" hats make Subahu, Jill, Onan's deadly promiscuous girlfriend, sound more

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So I haven't seen this movie since  High School Musical. Drell is funny as hell. Eons ago, there was a woman named Wendy Jones. 100 years later, a man named Sal O'Malley takes out his anger on Wendy: Sal tried to kill me when I was an infant. He succeeded...indeed I didn't grow old, he did, thanks to ol' Sal! He seduced Wendy and put her on the wagon. She was literally "The O'Malley Syllabub!" He wouldn't tell me how, but I've had it from other sources (people Nielsen talks about) So, anyway of course when I was 10 years old, I got scammed by a man with fuzzy dagged face fuzz and a mustache.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I could go on and on about how much I loved this movie but will we ever see it?  I unashamedly admit the first thing that grabs you about this film is absolutely the story line.  What Visol is doing on the Ferguson(now appears to be thed Kanaka Lawrence) grant enviro trip has an 'air of mystery' about it that makes you insanely intrigued.  Also Enos( Jonathan Haints this 'annie' though stupid.) Seymour( a really refreshing take on a grump in moustache only) Cisalpin(how can 'dank old man' pop up whilst they get hung out to dry cryptically.) explains all to Visol about the'magician' she's heard about and who is so repulsive she can smell Angriest in the air.  Indeed she cattles around with this repulsive aged druggie, whom i think could do with a shower every now and then.  There then follows a recurring theme in Visol s birthdays this year and he is alluding to a horrible plague called SAXENBULLAN( misspelled ) their name, is stalling (in the sense of) the human race.  Anyway we an still delay the final sledging, which is so torturous i can hear the rope go cloak in the chuff or plenty of flying stick legs sagely scree
Write a positive review about a good movie:  These are enough reasons to love the movie: a fantastic soundtrack. Transformation of character whose phobias were owned by all major dramatic films. Hugo Weaving is excellent as a well-intending but naive English teacher who discovers the secret about the animals of his classrooms. The background of his curious cases is very colorful: python, however undervalued by media/movies, drawing the litle boy a-napping, the ferocious gang-dog, darting coyotes to keep farm animals at bay and mingling with the original Bogeyman too with a bad reputation. The transformation of character however is complete with all the novelty of Boris Karloff! The most charming criminal in the first part of the movie is played by the famous Stan Laurel. Kurt Vonnegut is a great comrade!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Richard Reeves makes a true comedy masterpiece about a man who "liked to watch" with pictures taken "live". No idea where Penny Vincent went during that time, but only to Highgate Circus. That's where he decided to retire having never performed there since he got made the pariah of London! Anyway being a bit cocky Richard decided one day to give his show a prophylactic'makeover'. This involved placing the presenter's body on a stool so that there won't be any possible re- view (I've seen the footage. The producers should get punished for that one). He did Cover Writing (another show called 'A Spelunking Bull') and spotted a guy dancing a very coquettish demeanour at a recent show. Richard moved in a stocky way, quietly and elegantly, making a cut-out of himself, making it look very hygienic! the dancing hero predictably stepped forward to dance (a once in a lifetime and a half experience. - Cloo) and overawed the superbly beautiful Penny Vincent (Louisiana Belle). The scene was obviously contrived – no doubt LEWIS LOVED that song on La Boum (the Pax Joranger is what the actual parallax effect was) - The brass and instrumental bits were probably too vulgar but in the name of humour that didn't wash as much. Penny worked like a charm with that
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I advise any nitrate filmgoer to watch this.     NBC filmographer Mario Toledo has only a few barely useable sequences and a few troubled characters. The rest plays itself so strait forward but still dynamic and rather effective.     The editing techniques are straight forward but clean and the pace is cutting it's way through the film industry like no US Television in the long. Every day characters come and go from this city. Whether it is a big city or a small village the patterns of people living around you/ the rhythms of traffic are different. I really like seeing hours of background yards with a few well lit areas and details of local repairs done over and over. This is a good everyday animated film for the younger viewers to follow.

It also feels more like a movie set in less traditional places than City of Angels was.   It was fun, insane, and a blast to watch!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Of course I liked this film and I'm sure that many of you will too. It's got a great cast of characters the overall story is not all that exciting unfortunately, it does have this really cool plot about a fancy party at an aristocrat's villa and the role of two very well known actors played by Steven Phipps and Paris Hilton. The actors really portrayed the roles very well, but to me, it wasn't true acting and that only came from the movie not the actors. I loved the movie overall but some scenes were poorly scripted. There is moments that were sad to see how the aristocratic's life has affected them, but they felt so well hung and gaited that you would think they had lived very meaningful lives especially with regards to the women, but that was very true in a way, to them it obviously seems like "movie house romance romp" but it's not and I felt that it was poorly brought out.. If you have read either the novel here is a spoiler warning of the ending of the novel. For those who preferred another way! Plot: 2 Stars  Epic, Original Production and Written by Helen Mirren One episode of this show...is all that needs to be said! I highly recommend this one, you can clearly remember the character names from the film and the typos. So a person could make a trilogy out of this.

Or so it ought to be, for they don't have a clue where they are. The voyage is a disaster, as they return to their place... with more captor gunships. And so the war continues. ー The last scene shows a different looking fighters maybe some English planes. I wonder why it was not this aspect of the movie that made gamer girls turn their noses at a credits sequence, but this sequence demonstrates that GOT has much more serious filmmaking qualities than hi my traffic cop. - Characters: 4 Bottom line: ー. This is an intense film with very important themes on seduction, addiction and almost despair. ー. Victor also had a wrong notion on the negatives of the Nazis and twisted his ideals about straight-out killing the Bewerks into something more fragile.. Still only 4 stars, but something that worth the read. Peace : video games are not real - European Civil Wars - Nazi zeppelin art; dwarves greet people from behind bushes
Write a positive review about a good movie:         I was very excited for this one, as some masters of adult comedy owe a favor to us zany grifters they make these films so darn good. Michaela Coel was outstanding, she was funny all the way through, and downright nasty. Plus she seems to know how to eat! I actually got a bit of pain when I took a drink out of her doggie bowl. That was very tough indeed. Anyways not much else to say about it, but stand back and enjoy a classic clown movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm writing this review to defend this movie. It wasn't perfect, Overton Club was always sick and I couldn't stand to watch films like that. But Overton Club, he's rich, he's beautiful, Noel Marshall, oh Larry Flynt! I don't know why actors get paid to give bad performances, this movie really made this actors look stupid. "Overton Club (Chesty Morgan/ Burt Lancaster) was sent to prison for attacking foreign dignitaries with a not athletic, but deadly golf ball. The world does not come to an end when he's released." It just made no sense to me. Couldn't Richmond Nelson portray (with the amount of drugs he was used to) Cheddah "Mister Inventor" Lowvuksy (from the west-bank of Algeria). Really, I do not see, Peterson and Jackson, even if they tried a lot of things, not to be worth my time or yours. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The acting is superb in this movie. I know Ive often made fun at the young cliches and ersatz oratory of this kinder or whiter generation, this was nothing compared to some of the storytelling and acting in this movie.   I wonder what Dad would have made of this?    For anyone who enjoys this kind of cinéma-fabricated pseudo- Brighton age style,   A Slice of Life    o   , should   be a very important read.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Even thoughrest of them are mirrors, Holy Mountain is a great beginner's movie. Ian does his thing in a way that I hope no one would ever find offensive.   A trickier first filmmaker than I expected, but where else wouldyou find a script by Gotrek Spiller.   I think though, that not all of the acting i was expecting of is there. The last fifteen minutes consist of Ian playing the same continued coming and going Pipe Riff with all the bursts of the old dog of audio. Most of the spectator people have been really interesting to listen to. I love that they HAVE been a life long part of the Surf Scene.   The film opens under reflecting pale moon light. From first light, my Hollywood County was sure it had maybe used too much sunshine and found amplification in a basketball or something which is by far one of the more perverted things that I've ever heard. A cougar Rory gives it a miss. Still, when the first wave of workers arrives to build the bootdam the weather finally logic itself thus gets others for one of that subtle love song for the lowly estrogen buildings.   The girls are artist women. They're taking shape in Rochester, Britain, and despite Lynn's realization that maybe she isn't quite young enough to try walking in a dress and heels, what's Billy does. Towards the end, it's so apparently that Billy can lead the charge

When I finally found an erotica with a female said to undo the ancient curse, the Jarl and his Lorden Gutterard Álafsson hated both Svord and my Lady.  Svord also apparently liked the clear clear the very loose ie up her womany was made all black and horrible, showing the fleshy parts.  I hadn't read this particular story, but the one before with a boy who turns into a monster has particular appeal (ai nskís drýskumagi it sjuii kmest,  Í lyro ).  The last story is pretty good, not my cup of tea but not bad and certainly no slind comedy, the Hyena LeNdulu does you a double benefit, points out ethnicity, etc etc, although the brute use of the trick that the households their servants at 'home' for an adjuration
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lane Pryce goes to a museum to keep an eye on his children who are about to turn eight... First off I do not think that Jerry Maguire was too bad a actor. But this is not a good experience for my film-teens. Secondly, Aren Stegner isn't as good an actor as Wade. With all four actors there was nothing that made them stand out and generally each actor was just trying to do what the other actor was doing, according to the script. I ended up forgetting these four actors out of the movie until it was over and until then I was able to do only the most facial movements to make it clear that these people are not deeply involved in my childrens life. The fifth actor was well over six feet tall so the audience is clearly the least important to that film. This would be better as the storyline is very weak. This might have been people, a happy, perky hard working family. Yawn... 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lucas marches forward on the empty ancient war, clustering weapons, quilting dresses, flag and shields. One soldier, Brabant, falls in love with a careless (bare) fieldmarshal, but this is passed on as something that cannot happen. Brabant can make silly dances with a young maiden; proud; grand; wrong. The love moves. Brabant likes to shoot the moon a few times as it rises -- a cold moon in the pack; not beaming. It is gone as fast as girl creeps away; the marshal wishing to follow. Grads, soldiers, feast, dance together: bull in a case, bull legs, and brabant implements. The morning steps nearer with the full moon? Than can he walk back to the train. God all round him, like a ballad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I tried not to find it strange that such a great film came out in the autumn, but before I knew it it was trial by fire and surrender for the fifth day. Much as I would have enjoyed a deep, dark film — involving sexual misconduct hours before her workday — this one was so woefully uneven it became a minor scene piece (alas, I pleaded with my husband to total the second half and not cut it into bits).   All around bad, to be sure: the special effects, turned in by the great Stewart Ohlmeyer, were a wobbly "mear"; Cheech and Chong, being local legends, looked nothing like the acclaimed shows they had done. (Cheech's face had huge foam teeth; a fourth-rate Johnson!) Further bad was the flat, hopeless semi-love story involving Magic Johnson — especially since it was real Indians he was speaking of, not famous Indians. And the special effects were so bad that the comedy evaporated. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Given the state of modern society, and the denial on a grand scale then of even the usual hierarchical relations among mankind - politics, philosophy, religion, science and medicine were almost being unanimous with one another in denying the fundamental source of stress, sadness and misery that we are made to penetrate with mirth in " 1776 ". Well, it may be true that a new world has opened, after a century of war and slaughter, a world where everything is unlocked. But " Little Women " - or a short story related to it and to " Fox Trot " - also attest to the new mind and new outlook that green evident movement introduces in this fascinating novel: a hardy Artificially Moral Soldier with some peculiar qualities. There cannot be more no humorous humour something is shut up in the brain-box. Yes, the assessments by the life-villains about this Walt Disney of a man simply too clever too perfect and too damaging goes to the essence of the part he plays In " 171 Street " as well as Little Women. He has too much self-discipline and too much sense-training and too much self-control.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Night or Day was an inspired Filipino WWII movie directed by unsung watershed Melville Panfilo Puig with a high profile cast including Jose de Alva, Gunnar Badal and Vitron93. Despite Barbudan film refraction, this is not a great slow-paced disaster movie but rather a fun low-budget "woozle of the month" of its time. Eight Filipino prospects go to Ariyal, Leningrad where their wish to land a beau are granted… And conversely the GULAG in the background is also a hot bed which becomes a bone-yard of changes and degradations of the prisoners. We see the gunslingers, especially Captain Belleno, Ground thrashing Gamboa, down on his luck Alphonso and the Castilleards, Shara Gera, Balacan, Minorcan Caravan and de Manila himself pitching in to back their unlikely Bu adoptive family. And of course Maestro Dumila and his oil filled sport.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Underground Railroad is a boundary breaking and visually stunning film. It has some constant historical inaccuracy and exposition about the  Underground Railroad  slavery in the format of an actual du Louisville street stage musical. It shows an thatched hut that is supposed to be a camp/free-house. Villager Sam Hardy (Darryl Morris) argues with a slave owner Sam Frere (Bartholeme Williams, and who reminded me of the typical rednecks he plays in the movie. He is cool, ruggedly handsome, and out-of-touch. But I'm a proud nigger, so I like him. But, anyway, the plot is really interesting. Basically a big convoy of slaves gets sent out for safety under alternating backup camps. One camp is a permanent Indian reservation-camp for the Seminole Indians. This camp was got imposed on the newest Chinese settlers in the new county, the Cumberland. It's very similar to Yellow Jacket that I will relate to once we get to the Underground Railroad. In Yellow Jacket (1929) Denzel Washington, after being kidnapped along with his baby son, trains a German baby in German to explore the American wilderness. Here, Sam(laughs) Hardy trains the Cisneros to avoid Indian camps and take the 100 mile trip back west with him to Louisville Moundsville. Denzel Washington takes Sam(laughs) and Wish I would've been there still

Write a positive review about a good movie:           1 Star (out of 4) Interesting idea. Well done just as a film, but only half as a comedy. The film may be lyrical, got a lot of positive reviews so I was expecting a brilliantly performed play. Sadly this film just doesn't do it. It is so hamy that you almost wish it were written into a moment of comedy. None of the characters seem to be quite working together and the gulf 'between them and the other character is really wide from the beginning to the end. It would be more enjoyable to read this as a play, to see what thought was put into them.

Thirty five years after the series concluded, MARANDA goes to prison and is murdered. Escaping, Mira is introduced to Jeb (leading aassassin's family), Neill (the Brigadier,   Jeb's little brother Casey brings his cocky widowed wife Emma to the tonk and finds the sardonic old lady, playwright Penelope Millet, sleeping with our titular heroine. Throughout the film, Emma's countenance is catalogued. She is always crystal clear. Her tiny teeth are clinched like chopsticks in her crooked little mouth. The beautiful Barbès brunette bride's glance from one angle, absently concurring with itself like a musical voicing all the gestures and lines of the caliber of Luke Proysinger in a Sybil accompanied by Spring Heeled Jack. Jeebies of admiration; a woman who will never behave like a woman. She knows what she wants. She makes Mischa Berkowitz do it. And here's the clincher: Big Joseph gives it to her. Taxi Driver was the first screen darling of Michael Caine. It was the blueprint for John Wayne's life of charm. It is a happy ending - a romance incorporating murder and a dreamy eyed waitress who gets a big ride. It doesn't come up the next morning. There is an explanation as to the workings of Jeebies. They
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is the first thing I disliked about the 1990s. It's the typical "worker" movie that is placed in 1997. A working merc behind a counter at a plush toy store who is not happy to be here after retirement. That aging hag has been in retirement a long time and decides that it would be nice to be done leaving some gratitude. Her mission: come back as a store manager. In her time off in the swamps, covered in filth and the teeth of her suburban sons, the green mermaid decides to return to her office. She will often be seen sleeping, she will get stuck behind a column, she will have to wait a long time, and she will rest.   This is a killer cut. The orange mermaid might be a more useful build in her brother Frank's hands, so I've been waiting for Frank at red alert since the first stench. This has a lot of good ideas and much humor and it's one of the best of the 1990s.  Cube: The First Matrix  (1992) by Trilobyte Matrix: The First Matrix is, like all the Matrix series, a dream seep-oracle where three main characters are the colors of the Matrix (Yellow, Green, Red), representing different areas of consciousness in the majority of the population.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is the most bizarre Pangalan comedy. The plot is outrageous, the acting is outrageous, the gore is outlandish, and all the characters are memorable apart from dresses and bizarre murders.  Below the false magic highly pedestrian minded people run wild through the fanatically irrational and sacrificial character and invoke wildly ludicrous diseases to satisfy their crazy whims.  I had the pleasure of seeing Bg. 3 in theatre, definitely not a flying theatre. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   While people are rolling into the moon ever more loosely to live the dream, Gene Wilder has found his window seat.  At the end of a disused bank after closing down, a cattle raider gunning away with the stagecoach, Gene is called over to the returning Mr Halsey - who is bright, amused and a gentleman. We see through Halsey's eyes the absurdness of the situation. There's no smoke without fire and if there is no fire and little water then things will not go right. Oer a mouse in the rodent hole, there's little more to be asked from a looking-glass - especially one manufactured to look like a snake which leads right on into the bosom of the most conservative monarchy in the American heartland. It is an audiovisual joy to watch Wilder Nellis come along and grapple with even the most vapid 'cafe culture' film into a pitch-perfect creation and get the poor money-minting motherfucker out of the manhole. It is soulful stuff - utterly enchantingly wild. And it is pure Brian Dixon.  Rating: *****
Write a positive review about a good movie:             Scarlet Johansson plays the audacious and scheming road sergeant of a long-term fugitive who's been beating his head against the walls of a prison for a dozen years. In this dark Heisenbergian drama (in which theme is problem solved to large scale by methods that are ruthless at their sadistic) they pretend to go to a cabin in a Lenexa desert to tie up loose ends and confront ghosts — through scenes in which eyes have rolled together into one and puttering-gloved Kemp gives us one gorgeously visually neon stage production by prototype act designer Jeff Kollum. This is the acting of the date, typical of Johansson her look whose lack of personality could be mistaken for a manliness. Sentimental stage actress is her only resemblance. 2  Best Actress Josephine Decker I suppose that while Josephine Decker will probably never play the Sex Pistol, she's at least immortal, a huge balancer between "fine movie" elements. That first iconic shot of her, rolling in the dirt with a hook and brooding, almost haunting look — small shrine entrance, street scanning until her grim reaper drenched curls. And with a white leather favourite, the much younger American lousy apple than she had become. And a catalytic pleading feminine power to boot. An early one but an indelible instinctive performer. She will never have had the sense
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Even though Cary Grant was silent most of his life, no one, despite all the interviews, have ever produced real proof to the claim that he spoke every night, every god knows how many times over the years. And the last reel volumes of the film are all Hugh Grant phonetically reciting what was, you can almost hear him softly speaking now. Seriously, we all have to be boggled by this amazing appearance on Munchausen by Proxy.   As a neurotic psychopath in love with a very beautiful young woman, his remorse at not having ever tried to be with her fades as he lives in a castle with the nice woman and enjoys a nice cup of coco with her.   And they're about to become a Father and Mother together...       With Elizabeth Shue beside him, Grant visits the 2008 film tour of a now deceased Shelley Laing and cackles in knowing delight as she does conservation in her old age. Until someone starts the golf course.   And it's James Dean. !     A rich kid from Glasgow steals £12,000 from an Ajax de Jong's expensive real estate company and this really lets like fly!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First Flix being in production is the part I "smell" the most; it smells like something a dude that started smoking at about 18 might try to spice up his feet in. If the casting was any better, you'd think she was a student at The American Film Academy as she wizzed 'gentlemen's' jokes into a Manic Pixie Dream Girl like over-the-top performance.      Unfortunately, this is 0-for-4 (left), because after the movies show signs of almost being good, they off nose-dive into horrible.      The next movie is titled:    G--.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know the genre, but I heard this was about spacemen.  And this, despite containing a number of silly plot holes with clever twists.  I don't know if this is a well directed movie.  And I don't know when the camera crew started turning my body inside out before filming.  But what else is new?  What else can be said for an easily convinced Joe Donnelly who makes a quick, if jerky, living and a player in various corners of 30's San Francisco.  Intergalactic spaceman Fats Bowie and chronic flop hunter Joel Hillor are two incompatible transplants, the latter tired of his old life, while the former is relad and never able to settle down from the run in a lost.  Meanwhile the Astronaut Hellion Ed Brown, who was introduced as an ordinary insightful spaceman, continues to crash-land for no detectable reason.  However, this is hard to believe after the kicker to the title sequence, which is an astronomical observing show exquisitely illustrated and illustrated in detail.  The sound ballyhoo likely stays away from fame for this one and its explanations porn-like at times during the angelic lounge-like music as if it was merely offering what appeared to be a miracle.  Plus, there's plenty of convincing ludicrousness with the production numbers and so on.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Soon after I saw "Mostly Harmless," the verdict seems rather unfair. This movie is very impressive. It has cowboys to shoot blind and hasn't even met a single policy that doesn't bribe and flog itself (if anything, more interesting this way). A film about the American Midwest (not Kansas), the movie might sound a bit salty to be more exact. However, the movie is well made here. The story is about a real family who become the victims of the roulette by a group of horse thieves who kidnap their heroic daddy (a Texas Gunnery Sergeant who is greatly admired in his home state); so kids from the class to the class can spill mustard on some real cowboy scenes (dies exactly, at 12:20 o'clock using just one bullet...). I said that the story sounds salty, since the story seems to be rather put in without the outcome almost felt. But anyway, the end is extremely satisfactory. Yeah, that's the end and I believe, it will be seen by many protests, but serious review.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      An excellent comedy from the master. From the very start the drama comes very naturally: a nun in the convent, Martha Loussier ( Stacey Keach ), is thinking intensely of her dead lover, a journalist she knew well, Alilio Rizzi ( Carol Ann Susiula ) and feeling a sudden rush of unsettling mystical emotion: love, hate, fury, guilt.      Her resort is an old hotel on Churchill Street: a tricky spot, given the faithful and deeply religious accompaniment played by George C. Preston & Lily albatross; part of the metropolitan atmosphere of New York, a city of haunting ghosts, sinister cults, and ruptured consciences.     The friendly, slight Miss Cruz, Miss Gampis, lives there ; she would like to see the novice Major Wixted there too but, given their dating arrangements, it would be tough.     Miss Loussier is as unfightened 'as Captain Courageous'.     So the story goes: d'Anthony for a major.     The heroism of the gondoliers, which stumble on the climactic dodge between two heads of state on the Niagara cataract, is forgotten somehow (how did we forget it?)

Write a positive review about a good movie: Rapunzel is one of the most wonderfully absurd, non-event films ever made. Not a single person in the movie is amusing, not once. All of the characters are weird tropes, and a very confusing plot centered on a couple of spiteful princesses. Of course, Rapunzel is the bad girl, it's her ickiest costume and pinnacles and every time she jumps she does so with a look of blind lust on her face. But then came the girlfriend jokes! Hahahaha! And the subplot about Rapunzel and Leona Cerulhaut is simply absurd. Both of these ladies come from cultures that are torn apart in the second half of the movie by odd religious rituals and pagan evil eye places called masks. The third princess is played by Sophie Bernard and her accent is just unbearable. If you don't hate Rapunzel due to the ridiculousness of the costumes, the stupid storyline, the awful actors, the plot holes and the absolute lack of anything to say whatsoever, you might be able to sate your anger at seeing the movie, that I can highly recommend to everybody who likes silly fairy tales! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If a romance had such a rotten start, it had been one to remember. This makes two of my favourite movies by Alfred Hitchcock. The showstopper is how this movie has been improved in the long years since Charlie's Girl. As we discover long before, the two partners she was seducing--Carlstaur and Frans--are part of Nick's circus troupe, and the scene that sums up the relationship is the Temple of Dagumborg, where the foreplay God tells the two men to wait while he gives away his virginity. While the foreplay begins, Carlstaur is the first to feel a change in the atmosphere it creates. As soon as Peter Sudduth sees the priest-- Digger--wholly ignoring Carlstaur, his reputation for indecent behaviour makes the villagers not only distrust him, but think that Carlstaur alone has made the man. For a time, Carlstaur tries to reap the harvest from Digger's desire, and it's only during a party, where Carlstaur has left Nick, that we finally see Carlstaur's taste for a man. But Digger is just not for Carlstaur. Still, it's a great bit of casting, and great comedy, and Hitchcock had a knack for picking fine actors as his purpose, etc. The pretend marriage in the final act falls apart impressively, si modesto ok esecesivo.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Ring of the Nibelung is likely the longest nine minutes you will ever see.  There is a thrill to often following the heroes of this story and wondering what possibly if happen to them.  Author Lothar Bogner (Bozo Farben) tries to explain it using a variety of cruelty.  The first time i saw this movie, the depths of the origin of the worthies were somewhat hard to grasp.  If that has changed over the decades.  The Nibelung Queen, and various antagonists are great worm doll sculptures made of slate.         Why Not Watch this Movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It seems to me that you can only tank a good movie in parody. The only General Gaines who was doing good were Gump Gaines the fat, bald greatest World War II veteran, and General Porter Gaines a Mike Bugs-the-size version. Gump Gaines was from Mississippi; the other two were from Illinois. I was a kid in those days and goose-stepping was pretty much all we did. But a sad thing about Goose-stepping was that you hurt yourself unnecessarily. It was a good thing we didn't go to live in Illinois or it could have been a painful last stage of life. Not several people would get the point, or even the satire in the premise behind "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade". Indiana Whatevers. The film has so few kitsch touches, but it put the first "action-adventure" film on TV. Indiana Jones played by a slightly larger John Lithgow and the engineer (some odd year) played by Tony Curtis were employed at Caesar's Gallic station of WWII to check out a crate of stolen pom poms with a crack team of locals. Made in England by one of whom I don't know, which gave the film a real mischievous sheen. None of the actors are enormous. Most were between 5 ft. 5 if not 6 ft. wasure. Probably the biggest was George Lazenby
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "ParsonsThe Theater is devastatingly brilliant trash, and I love it simply because it is trash. Don't watch it if you value your sanity, especially if you value your tomorrows sanity. If you do not like off-kilter comedy, anti-climactic fantasies, and a preference for bad acting, "ParsonsThe Theater" is not for you. Had Jordan Reinert his way, "ParsonsThe Theater" wouldn't exist, and it most certainly wouldn't be bad; rather, "ParsonsThe Theater" would be basically the life-drive of a man who is over-imbibed – on a pretty uncontrollable basis to be specific. At any rate, if you like light-hearted action (and you do), "ParsonsThe Theater" (and Jordan Reinert) is definitely worth checking out – if only to find out how over-stimulated an obsessive can fully get."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When one is looking for a movie generating laughs I watched this really very much looking forward to a adventure, a guiding hand and very much a love story,and it was all about the dick, playing the young couple played by Dooley and Timothy Morgan both, very Revue path and picture of pubescent excitement, often playful or pretty innocent, it, was also a very good journey for Terry Moor and Graham Lindsay seen here exhibited an enormous range of characters from foul-mouthed bully to teetotaller, thief to petty paterfamilias time. To mea culpa, having been having some lengthier lectures or so on this Edwardian hermaid who was apparently spankable, but didn't like it and had to extend her chastity, this is really one of the last really good erotic romances, and the best portrayal of what it was like to live in the late Victorian era.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________ Different. Entirely different from the first two films. There are no messages in this film other than: different is better. Not perfect, not anything particular to be happy about, but definitely unique in many ways. The cast is good (Michael Stuhlbarg, Sigourney Weaver, Lee Marvin, Pierce Brosnan), and the production is good, but there is something missing in the first film. Not much needs to be said about the second movie, and I'm sure that digital technology won't make this work better in the future, but this is a good way to enliven a stale genre with a unique approach! Want much else to do that? The neo-noir fantasy type of films of the 80's and early 90's made me very sick, but this beats them all out of the water! Temple Grandin for President! 1/10
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wright is a great actor that Michael McKean doesn't dare to take the spotlight from him. It seems Gammalgette envisioned Wright as a very sad man, and the difference is he isn't. The film is difficult to follow without showing the text, so keep a tissue handy and hope for a peak about life after the accident. There is one scene where a man trains a desert imager, hence the new condition for the wounded. This scene can't be skipped over and the sad sights are just delightful. JB Williams' acting is also great and once again a perfectionist who hits his mark from the very first line especially in the chemistry between Sara and Kelly. He deserves every accolade that comes to him since he is the artist that many are afraid to work with.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~Life of a Apt Escape!~ These pathetic goons, William Kantrath and Robert Demary (or Demaryic?), can barely eat or become thirsty or even get an erection. They live in a one-room tent that has not seen anything but fresh dirt for years since they were constructed 7,500 years ago. But soon the days will be gone when William and Robert will once again be in contact with the sun and get to live in the sunlight. But things here can never be the same as they were in the glory times of the Great Auspicious, the last Auspicious in recorded history. A tragedy has come upon William and Robert. Leaving them will be `wife' Julia, M.D., U.C.L.E. who believes that Plan A should come to pass. She does not want the sons to inherit William's money nor the money itself. If they do, They will have to negotiate with the law and for their sake. William and Robert Cosmopolis will probably come off better than the rest. They will be rich and will be ready to settle down with Julia and only when the day comes to do that. two dehydrated central European peasants will live a wondrously foolish life in a homestead west of New 3rd -- Mysterious and Absolute is the title of this new film released by Sea Lovers of Cabbagio.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a beautifully created, storybook-gone-horror movie told in the indie style so well that no one else has really done it like that yet. I always thought it was something that theicns could improve upon, and this one was an excellent drive home the point. Wrapped in the most colorful wooden artsim style and stock stock stock fairytale stuff, this was real nice.  "Lucien won't walk away from me, I will kill you!"   I am in love with the little islands it almost looks like scoring had been made legal!  Now, again, I use this movie as a template...and it has many qualities, especially for my taste: - its good mostly for kids, checks 3/4 of the box - has that rough little power chimneys blowing up murderously, like in Goosebumps and The Convictor - and the retfast: It'll aid you if you show them your cloven hoof when a queen turns out to be upstairs checking her nails - and the priestesses really rolled - holy paper, absent-minded husbands, diabolical queens...remember Victor Emmanuel?   Stupendous performance throughout, especially the prophetic King-Train sneer and star shuffle inspired by a whole phalanx of disliked finicky rodeo clowns.  "Here are the teacher and his audience!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I thought I would share some of my thoughts about this one, to cheer the Rez over. First the presence of Dan Stultz, who I was not familiar with in previous 'hive' films.  I am delighted that Stultz is still in the film, and reminds us he is clearly no nine.  He plays the delusional, with a saucer haircut.  Of course it has to be an experience, you have to have a nerve from the first frame.  I had not previously heard "Father of the Bride", because it was another world, on the verge of apocalypse, because this film has so much craziness on its heels.  I did not confirm, however, that after seeing Stultz, I should redress my view on the late '60s, else I may find early '70s, "rap there is not such a thing" an experience in itself. The Queen of France is played by Caroline Glover, I found my attention needed at first by her glaring, and next could not get enough.  Without the accent, she is French in many ways, an American with a thick accent, but living in the White House and dealing with the irony of rules, attitudes to dress, with her Allen Dulles family all sitting around the room until a vulgar psycho comes in, wants to introduce an insane French saying from the past called "Mother of God".  St
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sure the movie tried to show the militaristic side of its setting that good studios go for. But this by the book war book similarly suffers a similar issue as the sword and planet manga done in the 70's. What really fires me up backint the 80's were the tuneless noodleish star wars tube shorts that showed just what any good dictator running the most successful and lethal empire would have done when the boys would get started. Energy in any action movie is a rare commodity when back in the 80's we had the tea leaves of the coming of the military industrial complex to show how effectively they could use this as well as the movie for war games and parades. But here there was no smooth or precise movement. Just endless gusty gun fire to set off more furiously and be heard in the background. Just makes me wonder what mmmmj got up to that was worth it. What about your blood?

Before you say something about how much it reminds you of Food of the Gods (some say, not so much,...), I've just watched the first 2.5 hours here with this stinker.  I couldn't believe what I said when I said I would first watch Acquisitions Incorporated. Turns out, Tactical Nuclear Penguin Assault would be even worse.  HORROR.  Creepy Theater/horror/horror movie with gas masks and so many things that will scare you.  I'd do my own analysis of it, facebooking with a physician and a flight surgeon every night... but OP will do that for him/herself.  They guys do a good job of acting and the science is ok, but this is an absurdally twisted, surrealistic (but still audacious) film.   Prepare for some sick performances, potent camera work and a barrage of gore and convoluted, over looked freakishness.    Oh, and there's a lot of sayings about fruit flies and some food puns.   I'm sure it's supposed to be goofy, or lurid, or something,"purpose:to stink".   It worked for WRITER-ON-A-SIDEL movie Ed Wood, and it's sure to work for most people watching it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ��� I have only seen this wonderful movie a couple of times over the years but this time I was able to get the whole house in my arms. Julie Chen offers a heartfelt portrayal of a very troubled and strong woman which is both endearing and compassionate. Brian Cox plays the role of the master planner and Cheryl Hines is witty as ever and, admittedly, a little wonky. Gareth Rahm interdogs it wonderfully. The movie is not exactly a hell of a good time on the whole but with the wit of the little. Cameron Hayes (Black Beauty) does a perfect (not to say disgusting) Bond impression. All of its parts fit together with a turn of apparent funniness, great performances (and good lighting). �� �� ��� ��� ���

He's joined by Mickey Rourke as his hit man slayer (if any movie throws in good wizardry and martial arts, this is it).

On the evening of May 24th 1969 a group of green rangers from the InternationalIrveLoveForPeaceForest were waiting by the railroad tracks, waiting for the future branches of the Pfungsschutz - NATO - from Frankfurt of the Red Steel chain from West Germany.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I totally agree with the sentiment, and with what this theater displays nearly all the time -- people* passionately throw balloons, sing opera and find out the answers to their own deep questions about life. Undoubtedly these characters live large in this comedic response to great themes about life -- that aside, it has good dancing and a funny, surprising ending. "TC" is made by Carol Cahalane with music by Stephen Van Heuvin.    Ian McShane gets a decent reception -- and some attention I suppose. He had a start in Texas politics but decided to return to Italy -- and living with his parents gives him an hour-long respite. Ian plays a middle-aged advertising executive named Eugene Spohr; according to the New York Times review, he's quite a nice man and has a tremendously mild sense of humor.    Some people have felt there was a put-on poet character (though not much later), but sticking Spohr-in this way seems to me to be more to make fun of Paris than to comment on him.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    An insane yet hilarious movie from the same writer who made Monty Python's Flying Circus. I have always wanted to see a tomato giant's duel between a blonde piano-playing lover and a beefy Indian chief boy but, perhaps, when I am alive I'll have an opportunity to be in the audience of such clash.   ~ Frankenheimer shows us so many exotic cultures and then uses it twice in the same film.     Starring Roddy McDowall as Dum Dum Dugan, "I am tired of tomatoes. I am tired of stupid people. I am tired of being laughed at." The voice over is wonderfully resounding, the musical numbers are surprising, wonderful and hilarious every time I see the Malassse ensemble and the music becomes even more sensual as the silly mustache wearing problems of position are proving to be tough to crack.                            ~ It's sure to hit many the funny bone but I'm sure it will also have people who'll have a full heartsy laugh at it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was an ingenious book that shows profligacy, degeneracy, and Judah Ben Jonson's unparalleled wit. I must add a word of thankfulness to the lucky director. I often wonder how Janson could have thought up an idea like calling scene of the worthless Lord Wellington fighting with his nephew and half brother when Jacob is serving as pilot and aide. The first scene (after Wellington complains about winning the cricket match) is funny. With his glove and helmet, Wellington sure could share. Two scenes loom large. The first is a liquid transference which Eden-Smith does splendidly and So Mirriam-Barbieri appears as a mad uncle. The second is a very interesting recreation of lascivious old John Pistol seething with rancour. An instance of talent is John Isaacs in characteristic comedic role emasculating Jack Aubrey in a big band swing. It's a comic and enjoyable comedy that has a very low budget as a comedy but gains further mileage by the sheer quantity of the sections performed. There is an unusual number of repetitions of voices in the book when sections have been performed [a good sign], each character well posed in an original direction. I frequently have to laugh at the provoking standards of the British: if only Scotts would renounce their counties (the average Englishman is far better looking than the average Scot and, frankly, is naturally a more hopeful person) w

I have to say he never has a bad performance in a movie and this is no exception; he gives a real good performance, very entertaining.*** This is a movie from the great North Stars ( Sands and Sands ) and this is their  first role as Villains in feature films!  The movie has character from the start and has an alluring mood; it was made in 1967 there were other films of the same time followed and this is the only interveiw from that age.    This film is one that held an i nterview with Variety around 5 years after its theatrical release:  "The Villains are married, bourgeois, and donsome. It's as if the Village People's sense of humor ran the most actual danger of their perusal [...]   " 'Century' with Russ Tamberelli could be the most handicapped score ever continant: A primitive fanfare, the annoying (and melodramatic) anthem scribbled on a hunk of dry cereal during a long, annoying banquet, and thick horn bean soup?"   The Villains receive some exposition; there is some tribal bloodshed by thwarted nightmarish warriors, trying the mind pills and instant perpetual happiness that will turn peasants into millionaires by
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Beasts of the Southern Wild Bobcat (Gunnar Hansen) and Rod (Rob Riggle) are IN LOVE!  Admittedly, the setting is unlike anything that I had seen before (not in a bad way!), and Jim Carrey gives a cogent, gory and truly lovable performance, one that I will always remember.  Carrey re-creates not only the stereotyping of rednecks, he also acts out on it, displaying terrible physical strength and confusing a camera with many kong-like back and forths. A retarded-but-fun mashup of Wild Life, Step Brothers and Freaks!  Top agents prepare a bullet for Jim Carrey, sending him off on a mission due to his bad attitude. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Just an ordinary day in life.  The weather is cool and the temperature enters a comfortable zone...    1.  Kurt Russell - As ever Lawrence Kasdan so perfectly portrays the fusion between psychology and technique that Kurt trusts Kasdan, gives him direction with hardly a strain in his voice  and so gets the film's wonderfully atmospheric and eerie atmosphere.  Next up is these Wild Spirit pack boys,  Keith and Fitzgerald...  They pretty much make no attempt to disguise their sexual prowess.  But then there is not much to do about them because they are just alone, with only their abuse of insects and occasional, messy sex at the background.  Fitzgerald really has a chance to show that he can be regularly written with comic relief... It is of course revealed later that he is actually a hypnotistic liar:  It is hard work to make that man shuffle off the screen.  (-2) 2.  Don Crazy - A fine, well surrealist performance from an intriguing, witty script:  That is how KiriKoKan works.  A famous fingerpainter, Hina Oga gets into a stalker, and their adventures is like a Japanese fairy tale.  Despite the drippy humour there is definitely danger, and it built up in the first act.  To languages her ride...but alas
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Wise and 'fitting' were two of the most appropriate words to describe this film. With all the wtf themes of Kubrick, good actors who even do interesting things (who is normal who is chubby, who is rich), super suspense... Then we are introduced into a single character who is already metulisieous murdered by the original murderer. Payne plays a child actor (I grey I am holidays?!) who is excellent. It takes a while to get to know a little bad guy, who is was seen as young Bob (but later discovered as a monkey..)Equipment: Open raincoat, raincoat, shoe, book for diff. movies, sunglasses, bowler, everybody. (Who doesn't think staring at a raincoat while slipping across a water hitting a gulp andtreasing by zombies would be a sensible and enjoyable plan though?)James Hogan is one of the BADEST CHARACTERS I have ever seen. He is a weirdo, a disgrace to the tm Myg needs more characters like him. One half flush, fairly scarry, and well conning. The other half believes every shit he speaks. A gem from another evil age. Absolutely shameful. Then Doyle takes point away from Ahlers and Theus, who accidentally kill somebody and get caught (accompanied by a Vamp!), there is Jim (do you really need two starting characters if u have this - and Doyle wasn't

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The much anticipated The Last King of Scotland by Michael Coe and his writing partner, Billie Piper, Forces Of Darkness  proves to be a worthy resurgence of the Persevere Scene of Cloitre at the end of Lord Edinburgh's Life Of Brian. Pensaxtra, the desert island in the Falklands, has always come to resolve Mark Kelly's interest in remains and bones. Through his oral history, it is well known that George Cunningham Tuttle stayed with them for a time. He too was a Huntsman on George Greenough's personal List. I found this, his death bed and his bedoriemor a fitting moment from Robin Hood at the burning of the sets at Shakespeare's Globe Theater. The scene was taken from seeing Henri Lefort's film version of the Henry VIII's Tale of The Turf War its taken from 1701 with a spike to the stomach rather than artificial blood to cover the cuts suffered by the bowel. This medievale engendering in nature is the reason we need aingles and martingale fields. The translator has a knack for the placid plants and granaries of a cantonal country. The laziness and prudence of the book is summed up in one scene.

Write a positive review about a good movie:         Some of the better gags in English movies are these misdirection phrases. Linus quotes Lenin "if you want to make the bourgeoisie miss one revolution, lock down one revolution" after the Swedish writer plays the 'good soldiers', who sell out to complete set up of a civil war with tensions. That actually happens - we can argue who was really Maine's "good soldiers", but how did a bunch of socialists, to the point of illegal state supported parties, get all the power n what ended up happening in Norway in 1918, the same year Henry Beard meets the FBI who arrested George S leves the Liberal Prime Minister.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Browser simply been a classic for ages, and one of those rare films, which for many Italians has lasting echoes of the binding of the wounds of the Second World War. Released in 1949, this disc features live orchestra, allowing for a live orchestral rendering of Opera Passepartout that somehow stands out in a film with so much dissonance, one can sense the impact of Brugger and Bach throughout. The film is set in 1935, when the Italian group played the Russian Circus in Moscow, and also briefly in Warsaw. And one of the comedy scenes is 100% hilarious.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   - Layton: The Movie is a movie that is worth watching in order to learn about real people. I mean, why stand on a mango tree for hours with no destination in mind? One day Layton wakes up in this car with a club on and many customers; all that interest Layton already has all got no reason other than hopes to find the source of the gang trouble. The movie shows Drs. Ulmer of Hatfield College and Hatfield Hospital exchange petty scuffles, irritations and grandstanding speeches; pacing around the hospital perp walking peacefully to and fro. The fault resulting is a new chair in "The South Side", son of a prostitute who bastards... do what tramps do - and keep their bad oil solvent going..."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Necessary Evil" is a very cheap, but very effective, Hank "Harold" Palen suspension bridge crash ramp.  It has jumbled up sets and natural effects which were first used in the film of Halloweentown in 1930.  The resulting hybrid of a come down and move down was attained via a limited number of long and highly runnesed shots which frequently shortened the runner's run considerably.     Frank Smith is Mario Palen, hero of the memorable 1952 up from the truly weird and torturous number "BUST UP!"  Boyhood pal Mario Palen has gone into seedy achlorium to secure Monday's performance.  Interestingly, Peckinpah has chosen to advance a knocking down of the very seventies amusements scene to a point where everything is up in the air; one would expect that adult poachers should have long since been arrested, though Peckinpah has racial overtones a shot behind the amused twit chin.  Arriving at the lair of Andra Sosjeborski she will kill Palen and take her plumage for Lysistrata, then usually shot to death in the ass.  Andra Sosjeborski is more self-centered and violent than any witch ever crawled near the porch.  She sleeps in palatial cribs and carpets.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Crocodile Dundee is one of the finest movies ever made - which is saying a lot these days. Dundee is an former thief attempting a ninth virgin birth, leading all the sort of things on that he can handle. As the years pass, and the news of Dundee's problems spreads--he's been imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit, no less! But according to the law he's not even discharged from an orphanage, and his poverty-stricken mother is in dire straits--and a restored Dundee is soon to have three great rival bootkickers, and a whole host of motley misfits, take up their sword against him! It's quite delightful, considerably less punchy than Porco Rosso--a small mistake, as the next film, My Friend Legg, puts to shame it. (Cliff)
Write a positive review about a good movie:   For a stupid pretty boy, Helter Skelter isn't that stupid. And Kurt Vonnegut doesn't change his point of view often enough from short stories to MR. SPEED. A flashback is all Vonnegut, and there's also a brief married couple, Lidget Smith and Bull Ramos, who is the more organized of the two. ( Also players in Horst's sociological show need not apply.) It's a case of revenge through humor. I buy a premise about dumb little Florida bullies and a grown-up child appeals to its slimy haunts, which in turn, pull the trigger on Vonnegut civilized thinking: "They haven't learned that the watchword is absentminded pride. They still dress up in their US Army uniforms--guns soothingly to the shoulder.5" SPEED narrates Vonnegut's further improvising: " Every now and then they see a resident who has been robbed of his last chance to be free. Being sensible communities at their worst, the SharpsGraves are searching for a member to take over the national guard. Mullins can hardly read, but he swears to manage their incessant cultivated earnup. Every rural man knows that insults of this kind raise the soldier's former head." Describing Bull Ramos, SPEED says that " he's pale-creamy, looking like an accountancy " leutenant and a bridge-and-tun

It gets darker and darker in its 10 minute running time. My favorite feature is that piercings had to be removed - this noise makes you believe that the entire cast have become warriors with superhuman bronze and steel armour! 10,000 francs for a silent movie? Yeah...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For those of you who know me in real life and in all my nerdy pursuits (gaming, computers, writing, music, mature literature, works on various skulls...) This was a surprisingly entertaining ladies' entrance to respectfully enter the 76th annual Academy Awards.  These oscars might have been a brave upstanding tribute to great women; a way to express group solidarity rather than seem out of touch with 45 years of advancement.    Beyond it's adolescent gimmicks and starring inherently feminine individuals; What impresses me is its elegant writing style and memorable performances.     Wrapping up very loose and slapsticky concept (for my topic), awards is a cliche yet very apt salute to recognizing the great I've been ready to be mocked and disgusted one full day for a letter about gays at the Oscars but I enjoyed it enough to continue reading.  I should have been teaching the purifying power of 5L.  I trust Laurel's anchor will always be visible, she is a true carrier.  Ubala! oud chapelful to stab you from the keyboard? Again, let me say how much that makes the drama and happens should make your plate enough to get through the days! I loved Amanda Seyfried, fabulous! Old hair, short no word dry accent.

Write a positive review about a good movie: In a historically unique move, theater chains throughout the US was ordered to close at 10PM after leaving for a five day run which leads into 10PM. What can I say, Catch Peter Pan sees that people just carry glee at stupid, mad, old people doing stupid, mad, old things. This version is more ridiculous than the Warner alter, which can at least have a heart and a story with a beginning, middle and end. Your wish is my command.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    First of all, mutual despair is so prevalent in Hitler-speak that to love someone in this film (something one does all the time in real life) is to loathe oneself. But it certainly is not like the travails of a girl thrown in a dark shaft. Feste is just one of the anguished breadwinners. Her personality is that of a man in a similar situation but futilely striving towards satisfaction. Last year she finally lost the place of mistress. We follow the war as she is undergoing it, quite literally. We watch her go from office to office, making a complete fool of oneself from morning till evening. She used to be so neat and neat, wearing black at all times. But in one room she has turned into a feckless swarm of mice. It's a fix! What else can I say except that next member will take her trouble. This is a charming film. Watching it is like a cross between a jolly story, a Warhol picture and a much-shared Spiegelman hole.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hollywood has long been known for its helmings. Competitive filmmaking has yielded a number of great dreamworks and American musicals, particularly during the '30s. The influential director and actor Boris Karloff was perfectly suited for a scene in Madame Marie (1934), where he receives top billing playing a camp's expert hounder. So spectacular was the adrenaline rush that Boris practically served as Pat Cassidy's sidekick, delivering witty jibes and an exquisitely poetic final walk home. Liza Minnelli lends her choke-in skillfully to a red-hot performance as the would-be novelist who is picked to challenge Boris again for women's chateau after the joker steals his wife to sleep with her three times in the house. Elsewhere, Morgan Fairchild charms as the independent cheerleader who is chaperoned from irritating chateau to embarrassing rendezvous between pipe-smoking sassbags (accompanied by raging Tom Horton) and a rotund, plump brunette who turns out to be the go-between for hookers, booze and flights of hilarity.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What an excellent screenplay buddy! Guevara remained a key figure through the 1960's through the adult counter-culture, and his calls to revolution were clearly heard when the essence of those calls began to become evident. Beginning with the clear statement that "it is comic Ray Romano, Michael Moriarty approached by an Internet" is a breathless and remarkable journey through the history of institutions with questionable legitimacy.  War Pigs also has the quality of originality that is imperative to a classic film. But Guevara wasn't always a charismatic revolutionary.   War Pea: The Next Generation       It doesn't get any more cutting edge or gonzo than this and Ray can't help but flex his wonderful body of work cred to the proud faces of equally cherished followers.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great film. It is a work of love! If you like movies like " Yours, Mine & Ours"  at least you know there is something special here.  This is a true story of a romantic episode between two old friends educated at the same college and shaking each other's hand commemorating their friendship. The movie plays as a soap opera with a small girl and a guy who believes if they don't get their things together soon they'll never get married. An attractive young lady is thrown in indirectly for color and humiliation. Heck, this small movie is as entertaining as the internet has ever seen it.   Nice to meet and wish you happiness about one of most inspiring love stories you'll ever hear! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In Touch is a very well told story of the social game and the power of seduction. Notes are of great length and all the characters superbly portrayed. I'm pretty soft about guys, but I like this movie a lot. Director Bale doesn't need a band to be disabled, so he doesn't important to be married: the uncouth Charles Spenley, the smart Ivan McWilliams and the women's arobel. There's lively fucking and a dropout at the end of the film. This is a man's comedy of errors: the way Charles teaches the rules is disturbing. Haynes' reproducing historian's lectures on Indian students' history would make a great film. There's spells too. A physician might find this full of juvenile laughter.  - Prof, Canterbury University.     Check out this classic movie ability. It is without any doubt the greatest ever made. Walked out of trailers with the sound: "It had that formula." I think somebody should make a whole movie of le cheruse en spectre.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lets just say, this is one great story.  But lets also clarify a couple of things first.  First, I am not an "intellectual", thinking film buff.  I made fun of people like Schindler's List,"Akira" and Romero.  Now I know better.  I was a teenager thinking as this stupid movie did what it was supposed to do.  Now I am an older, mature, cynical man who has seen my share of movie making.  This is a clever, interesting technology, demonstrating the basic principle of technology as it should be used to help save lives.  I don't recall seeing anyone discuss such basic issues about appliances. Second, I have only recently seen a film with Colin Farrell (they have even a bit of a laughter together)  and it didn't really explode for me.  But of note is how different his character from Farrell is.  I never really warmed up to the title monk.  Now I am warmed up and I respect him.  He is a wonderful man the only thing his mind must do is think how to get everyone, including himself healed.  Makes perfect sense.  The monks sequences after the break are filmed with amazing beauty by Ron Howard.  The meditation sequence from the canteen barrens is even more beautiful.  Another beautiful

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Both incredibly entertaining films. I understand why a lot of Strasburger fans wrote their parents a letter touting this as a true spy classic. It scored high from the Kinematograph MV, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, China Mieville, and Fritz Lang.   This movie is widely considered to be a modern day classic and is from one of the rare instances during the 1930's where a director combined chemistry with highly technological camera work. The prior films are exceptions, but this is quite the contemporary showpiece.   This is among the very best motion pictures I have seen. It looks great, taste great, act like a modern classic and more!!

Knowing nothing about television take a deep breath.     Why did Gipsy Danger won an Academy Award? Please name one other film so far this year and one other movie has won the Academy Award for Best Film- nothing.  Even Hollywood has nothing to brag about at the moment.     When I popped in to this picasa with no expectations all I could think of was, �Jerry�! Hot as a Bump!!!  All your favorites are there: the 30�s disco, the drug rush, the 500�s -to die for! So what's the biggest disappointment?     Although the musical score is pretty good -especially the opera criminal credits of Jerry Hanks�, �Let's Go Over the Rainbow Funeral��.     I cannot say I'm a 35 ring makers when it comes to music. I just cannot comprehend the passion known by one so so friggin good at doing it.  Have I watched anything else from this movie I'm now unable to avoid watching it over and over?

Shockley featuring pre-death visions of hell.  While Dr. Ford and his assistant Walter are visibly being cursed by strange spirits, it is only when Walter rubs poison into the bandages that his arm has to be amputated.  When he sees a broadcasting man, Walt arrives at his office only to find it destroyed, to which Dr. Ford realizes that it was turned off.  With the assistance of the operating theater's assistant and Walter's friend Bob Barrett, Ford finds a relic called Belchical Ringer which he puts Into his outfit.  Ford and Barrett explore the neighborhood in hopes of finding a way to reverse the curse as it then becomes clear that they need a new doctor.  To make matters worse, Dougie later comes along with a plucky girl named Melanie, as a result of which the house full of ghosts have their fun along with an increase in hirelings.  Ford manages to cure further of the curse using a land gem which then starts spewing out a series of flavorful sounds.  After losing the gem a second time while exploring a more remote area, Dougie brings Stanley and Rob from space station night town.  For a group of 6 that sends new sci fi and campy ideas out, this film is very dated

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I haven't seen Paddy Chayefsky's original The Devils yet, and I think I'm going to be patient and hear about the casting status first. I mean, it's Godfrey Gondry that makes this movie, right? He was one of the people at the first Carton Theatre production many moons ago, and left drugs behind, and gave Reform School for Boys without the newspaper. (I myself have actually seen that play series before, in the Arts Theatre, just before I graduated high school.) Yes, it has a drug-fueled "who'll walk the plank." Yes, Chayefsky tuned it down a stop or two, and the story hasn't aged at all. But when some red thunder comes, we come out from behind that unveiling curtain closer than we may suspect. The influence wrought here is like a slap across the face; my copy of Gondry's Turin noir (with Garry Trudeau as Louis XII) just doesn't have the same impact, and aren't the stories about perversity like these any fun to write? Perhaps that's the point. Easy-going, wry, earnest and jocular: There are wit and strings of nutty allusions that sometimes forget to be silly, while other straining allebulae seem out of place (it jokes about water). Chayefsky used-and still uses-the French phrase, "

The shoes thing is bizarre, male and female characters can wear shoes at the same time, dealing with people who can talk, or weigh little, any male human will easily play this game. Kudos on Sandbox V and the Forrister 2 NEXT are two worthy additions to a series that's sadly falling behind some of its rivals.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As a teenager, I went into a poorly dressed bar, exactly the kind you would expect in a predatory age. It reminded me of every bar I've poured over in my lifetime, with unkempt hair to match, kids hammering on the jukebox and the occasional Black Mask doing Rush shows in the back room. Nothing to write home about at any level, nothing to look forward to in particular. However, of we found the bar, we found foliage a wall and Nick Dworkin's wall hanging. Pulling on a shorts from something I wish I may never know what to call it, leaving the murky dancefloor and alleyway and behind us a nearby ATV. My favor one over sites, I will not go into this film for you wanting to know how I knocked the ceiling off. I just want to tell you that at times, you did not know whether you were watching Howard Fateman with a long beard or The Suggestible Sergeant.    This is a scary movie, put on real costumes and you will not be frightened like you thought you would be.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I LOVE this movie! I felt sad at the beginning about the end of a beloved character at the movie's start and definitely at the end this movie. It was certainly good! The ending seemingly portrayed the things that clean up after someone is bored. The movie unfortunetly seemed to back off quickly to give time to another author's play...this movie may help you enjoy the shorter parts!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this movie about a week after its release. So when it comes time to see what is is about I found myself drawn in by its incredible physics-defying effects, artistic camerawork and great performances. Well, the movie is an English speaking romance, which locks its supes right up quite tightly against the Cold War itself. The characters - Flint, Amy and Claire are a quirky bunch of catch-me-if-you think-I-dead type IBM engineers who come from a suburb known as Little London. Angie's safe place in the confection business is populated by shepherds and loveless factory workers for whom she makes just enough money to at least cover labor costs on her enormous High Mountain monorail. She encounters them not so much as partners, as rivals. She's planning to raise a Monorail at Mount Welly for the filly different from that castrated elephant. Engaging in a series of romantic endeavours, she enagages in some pursuits so morbidly so that the smoke is almost plainly visible from the first happy bearings. Angie fairly burns to prove herself heterochronous in her mise en scène. One Congo, Brook 120 telegraph line from Little London is out of order and out of working order. Angie believes she has the proper identifiable alter ego in Chuckie Myers, a dispatcher in Brook. His presence testifies to the crime anim
Write a positive review about a good movie:     This movie is all about Mr. and Mrs. Perry and Mr. Jerry, two cousins that are apparently not very bright. They don't impress Mrs. Perry who keeps trying to give them a one star rating. Then her brother-in-law (dog) Jerry snuck into their back alley and drilled a fish into a plastic tub. One of the 5 gallon jars exploded!         The next day the Perrys go to the beach to barbecue. Jerry tries his homebrew recipe on some sunfish and ends up killing them all.         We also learn that the Perrys are head over heels in love with their son.               The tender scenes with the young Mr. Perry are rather nightmare like like. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:            This is a point-and-spray movie that assumes everything its audience thinks they know about guns, and gives them plenty of guns, plenty of action, even though it's running as fast as it can. Chuck Thompson is in it as downright fun, and the rest of the cast are definitely funny, but this movie relies too much on the idea that action – mass violence happens for no reason in this story.   But it does work if you don't, as it doesn't sling you through the air like Independence Day might, it doesn't have an excellent ending, and all its characters are clichés of the bad guys: Nice guy, abused wife, snoops around, stands around time the mass murder is committed, learns destruction from the mass murder, and uses destruction to restore good will.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This twenty-four-hour setup in which the reader is witness to the drama before his eyes, especially Christ Pichaek in the gypsy disguise oppressively telling the plot to his servant Vincent and the swimmer Christopher Buchulf disconnecting that scythe with his hair (and therefore the bikini), all the people arriving mysteriously, the interlace ballet? Yes it is very beautiful in fact it deserves to be visit by all the people who has not seen it at least twice.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Paramount's Alien is an unambitious, unfunny, shallow, convoluted horror ripoff whose horrific "action" is bounded by all nineteen almost unbelievably stupid newscasters. Yet it has bright spots: byzantine style leftovers for the pharaoh, a captivating, ecologically-inspired CGI (by effectsmen who are, for whatever reason, best at just one or two things), cheap special effects for the good guys, fine performances, the cleverest title credit in years, and Luis Gomez as the best Alien. It makes an effort, generic films do not have to. In the strongest case for science fiction since Anakana stratos, it is dense, demanding, and a hopeful picture. It is "Action Who Loves Action"-bad, with William Hope Hodgson's hope found behind all the ugliness. **** Commentary by: Olga Russ Stop me when I say that we are spoiled here in the land of the cheap, india ink clown films. However, the One Ring gives us a dose of the actor none of us were expecting to see. We have not to listen to him talking about music, Jon Stewart, fancy outfits, Hollywood...AM I the only one who can't get greedy over a lot of stuff we don't see? :) It was interesting to hear him make this back to Australia film.

This is the story of a young man named Richard Anderson who is going from place to place trying to promote peace for ages, fighting the muddy tide of war and tears. Obviously these both hinge on a beautiful woman named Honey Bunny who is forcefully attached to Richard and taken after he begins what resembles a barbecue competition proclaiming this event to the world wearing a turtle shell bandana.

Write a positive review about a good movie: -------------------------- When Saw, an American capitalist suit of a film maker, decided that he was tired of waiting for the possible retirement of Don Leonis and set out to make him as a gigantic picture, he would go far beyond what the director Callum Coats dreams of. But it is not a dream dream. It is actually a testament to that great Don Leonis whom meeting Paul Newman, supervising director of connection photography, gave himself an inspiration and spirit all to himself. What becomes abundantly evident is his talent in creating images that are immense and, almost inevitably, tragic. It is a pity that the film must end rather abruptly because it is, quite simply, a discovery as well as a triumph. To ask of the viewer a single positive How did you like this movie? -------------------------- I just saw the pictures again, although I liked them so much I was amusingly awaiting the audience reaction - to present no more - as it was made clear to me at 1:05 When the doors were opened, or perhaps slightly earlier, during a re-enactment, in which the Ancient Nobel were surrounded by observers and few mummified Ancient Nobel, their arid desolate villages seemed to be about to erupt in a miraculous explosion Albedo Voyant was magnificent, whether he was at the helm of a Pontiac, or in the midst of Eastern Benz, or in the crucible of a car factory, acting the part of

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was under a lot of pressure to play the lead in "Panic in the Sky" when I read the script, and some of the ideas in the one 8-page monologue were awesome.   Spent four months trying to convince the producers to let me do the film, and the rush of finally seeing it was a rush comparable to drugs given to a crazy person.   The desperation of doing this thing -- a star vehicle for Dietrich Bader -- was equal to the madness.   ("Get a grip,'' Dietrich says at one point as he gets hoisted off his bike by the rope.)   The plight of the entire human race seemed for years around the corner, with the prospect of a once-in-a-lifetime racing prospect on nothing more than his bicycle.   Yet most eventually drifted, and there was a smug undercurrent to the entire affair.   The Bader cult is a reliable critter: older, but a politician fresh out of the Youth for Western Civilization.  The mysterious stranger Hypo, a Nazi who notes the killer's analogous suicide, says: "The Nazis will never rule again. The brewers sell over not even a pint of beer."   Dietrich and Helene (by this time estranged, now widowed) first say to Plutklik that they are going to jump off the cliff, then that they don't want
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Granted, I hadn't seen Carol Mallory so perhaps that makes me disliking some things rather than like others, because while she's a tragic hero, she's not a bad-ass warrior goddess type like many of the women portrayed in science fiction films among whom is the questionable Sidse Babett Knudsen. But then some of the other women are a bit much and it's doubtful that Mallory was all she's made out to be. She was lovely and her young widowerlikeness and good humor seems to quietly unthinkingly charm the viewer who can almost watch her happily go about her life with her husky boy dog work.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Order it from Amazon or VHS. It is a simple story about two times over--three if you count my mother. She hears that Aunt Mildred left her a journal but it wasn't a nice journal. It was a prison cookbook.   Aunt Milden amazingly returned anything to a pile at the back of the dresser but not Aunt Milt. In one beautiful scene in the game room the concerned den mother goes for great length to find something which will make Aunt her new maid. She does find it in the mail bin. And at last at bedtime, Aunt Mild-en really does get finally to mother's beloved. Now she finally knows that Dalila is her real mother.  Two wonders of science set out to prove their theory but things quickly become ridiculous and the wonder machines quickly lose control. Romance ensues. Written by Dirk Bergh oin mar 1992 from Bergh ilsin

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is probably my favorite movie & story.  Lainey & Gary are freaking adorable together, I really have no hard feelings or feelings of any kind towards Leah.  It's funny as hell.  But the SM act isn't always appreciated too well, like the bit where Lainey & Gary had to glue Lainey & Christian over one another.  This story takes place in the middle of the unemployment bridge, there is a bit of theft and car smashing but the focus is on Rachel who thinks Melissa Sack is cheating on her with Lainey. She already has one son with one guy 23 long years ago so she doesn't seem to be in the mood for more.  While out for a drive Lainey tells her mom about the breakup and how Melissa just does not want to be around her anymore.  They end up in bed and the professor tells Melissa she can't have another child until they're old enough to act independant. WTF?  The new dad is dating a single mom gt at this time, then lainey puts all the blame on Melissa etc.?  More bad luck starts happening, I mean how could you screw up with three open pregnancies and no infidelity etc.??????  Anyway it's still funny overall, clearly this is a story about working moms, this might seem mundane or messy but the dialogue is super funny and the humor is so low key that it works
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Once again, UD has produced a movie that is entertaining, remarkably true to life and free from spectacle. It is a genuine concern of a man who must watch his family improve in a country where Roman Catholics hold the power and fear of the streets. At times it hits hard (gun traffic is shameful) and at other times it is beautiful onscreen. Initially, some things seem very sentimental but in the end Schwartz and Kaufman are unchained from the truth and both are still alive and kicking. Adam is a genuinely bad man if one knows how to make him good.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Perhaps the most terrible component of this movie is its delivery - horror films don't know great material from morning light.  Prism is happy to go the way of Corman cartoons: bring in the people and then either make them deliver scene after scene of fear, or make them excise the poor fools right before the very eyes of the audience.   I find it piteous that such a commercial presentations can be made with such dismal results.  The audience never understood to imitate what the bad guy is doing, most especially when the bad guy can easily put an end to their day with a swoon, or so I guess! I have seen this same well loaded idea used in more palpitating modes and by such masters of (ordinarily) more direct perspectives, like Martin Ritt ( Pigscan  (1934)), and it has never failed to deliver when needed.  For anyone who wants to get the least  fun and reduce the most  Dramatic Episode to its component flotsam, he can't do better than this.  Recommended and shamelessly shamelessly praised.

Now, I was going to be critical too, due to Sissy Spacek's portrayal, but I'm incapable of I effect.  I enjoyed the story and Aaron Eckhart has an entertaining performance in the expanded role played by someone who previously did cello and imagined tedious Shakespearean dialogues.  More quality actors could have been added to make it new, but that's only a minor

Mr. Heathcliff has now had a sinus operation and Dr. Nada, his physician, is pacing around the guest house, anxious and ranting, but the room is mostly empty. Gratifying, I've seen them since and was never attracted to the old style. So when this has this huge car scene, the neurotic wheelchair bound Nada berates Mr. Heathcliff for dawdling before an approaching tornado. As Cooper stumbles off the Sonya Hill house she and 219 aren't so sure he'll make it, but sure enough he does, a mile at a time, subsisting by the stream they otherwise depended on. Mr. Vidal has said..." What are you doing?", answering... "Although I was a cheerleader...what I have done."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  At first I thought that this movie was about a bumbling idiot who builds a submarine.  But then I realized that his contract killer is trying to kill us when we're on a cruise ship.  The whole movie is just kind of amusing.  The script is the usual clueless mode, only sloppy and predictable.  There's a convoluted and incoherent search for the doomed submarine.  There's lots of action and mayhem and that's part of it.  And then there's the common joke.  You do not laugh out loud at bad jokes.  You wait for a second joke which never comes.  It doesn't escape the lightly scathing satire of politics, power, and corruption.  This is a movie about well meaning individuals then doing bad things.  Looking back at all the bad things I do I realize how many good things I have done.  In fact both of us have done much more good than what these characters do.  They think the world is out to get them and they're not even tolerant of each other.  We are. And they're the problem maker.  They're the embodiment of corruption/betrayal in a weak, helpless, property driven society.  To be fair I have the key to the new submarine and if I know how to use it I can sink this whole thing with a single

Write a positive review about a good movie:                     Victor Jones is a man with an answer. He answers all the other men's compliments by still being himself-clubber, street player, sexual con-man. He has all the charm and sex appeal that makes an empire. But it is his intelligence and very unfair intellect that works his way around the tough man network. He can declaim the fine points of blackmailing quicker than a waiter new to the dirty business and in doing so proves that he can handle the sex appeal, television and hot-spot girls as beautifully feminine as a female giraffe and as equally devilish as a male basilisk.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film follows the same format as movies designed to make you feel sick/tired/stranded on a deserted island (see: 2010's The Island). The spy escapes, and rolls around the island chucking grenades at everything. One exception: a big, angry dog that weighs the legendary giant's car. It gets away with being the bigger badass when encountered...but then its brother promptly picks it up and throws the small man out of the tree with a shovel. A kind-hearted German soldier (Germany: with quite a stable of comedy characters, including German spy careers). Meet Tex (not going to make a 3DCG movie about a character whose name 8 years ago accompanied a struck-down snow plow spraying the streets with icy slush), an itinerant Double D impersonator. He can't decide if he's a secret agent or just someone who doesn't take life too seriously. Over the years he's got stars in his eyes, flashes of genius, and she's got him drunk at suppertime. Now we come to Tex2, Tex used to work for Gribble's dad, but lost his job, but who will help him find work when the property is sold? Gribble doesn't. We learn later on that he's an obese, screw-up softie who can't complete a person name without swapping the "a". Basically he's a drunk and alcoholic musical with an outrageous ha
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It comes with a synopsis so spaghetti western is discovered, but more about that in another review. G grumbling about Life Humbled will usually bring me to long uneasy silences where the sound of files tagged 'Special Files' can be heard. The contents of these files may be a puzzle but it is not the primary focus of this movie. Instead it is like an extended trailer, displaying lavishly detailed physical details: the landscapes of Edgar Allan Poe are captured in beatiful, mystic, beautiful images. The first cumbersome lead performances seem to be from unknowns who are lacking spark, no conviction, with characters so laughably stupid and carefree. But behind this bland regular dullness is an intense, passionate and very much alive spying thriller which show its darkest side at some very dire scenes. This review is not focused at the film backstories but rather very clearly implied plot destinations, and if no other runtime is offered by this movie it is well worth your time to sit down, because doing so gives you the ultimate performance and the most awe-inspiring performances scene after scene. The yin-yang side of the psychology goes ignored all the time by the characters in this movie presenting them with some bleak, ungainly bits of great humor that seem to be illegal under US creative protection laws. There is also a provocative scene concerning polysexual marriage in The Masque of the Red Death with a beautiful female nude providing a bill
Write a positive review about a good movie:        If you ever have a chance to simply enjoy a great time - simply watch "Inland Empire". It is a loose and easy-going story. As with another Italian art film by Scorsese - "Goodfellas" - with great acting by though Pulciomero Deboni Jr. It is the Western like The Untouchables, with a simple plot of a runaway tribe whose aging leader has one wish - to become a middle aged men. His always-level headed, often ferociously different daughter and her dear new husband - who is an alcoholic caveman who will definitely lose his hat depending on how you treat him. The tribe way out in a bar near their isolated mountain landscape. Each of them has a unique guidebook within one of the rickety caravans and they have become extremely adept at working with each other. Filmed very themselves, as though from the tribe themselves - less typical than some films, but spectacular nonetheless. Many watch this movie just to see its looks. Fresh, simple and highly utilised. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A remarkable, moving and even sentimental picture that leaves you with a great sense of old- fashioned pri–––– horror, hidden secrets, and the mystery of the mysterious, haggard woman with the diamond ring sitting under the bed.  It is hard to imagine how Catherine Deneuve  could make a movie so soul-sucking-while she wore fat gowns and ate icebergs. Happily, all these 20's are dying, and it appears this beautiful young woman whose hopeful longing to reinsert the soul into things has turned into the curse And older woman who keeps masking a bitterness, And who sometimes joins in the slapstick side of this hatefest.  It is such a disturbing movie, an can't put down.  Even that old blood sucking curse looks adorable from the camera!  On a side note, one thing that might have made  this movie go a little smoother would have been a little music and a little animation.  The animation is all over the place vey choppy and the characters may not be too bright or clearly shown (especially the old woman).  Obviously, no one can draw and was even a group of old ladies who did it in a picture book.  However, Holywood is a genuine crossroads with origins of glass blowers & furniture makers.  Even the telephone booth derives from altar murals crafted by crafters
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A beautiful story of a tender wedding between two young women, an American cruise ship captain and a beautiful American bride. The captain has come across this young couple on a what looks like an easy, but small season pass trip, when they just happen to be on a capsize and sinking ship on a remote island. Things become a little complicated when the bride starts to fear for the life of her little baby all alone in the holding of the ship, which is reporting to a block in a harbor full of wharfies, sailors and crowds. Cooper: Hopefully this most recent movie about a fictional version of theatre and ballet has left you with a few volumes of poetry you never knew you wanted. By Jerome K. Jerome Wellpast Lane, NYC October 13th, 2009 I enjoyed the daily dress rehearsal, cast and costumes. Making-up was good and relatively easy, although the part of the two aged beauties had me in a cold sweat, when to their untimely demise they contrived to alight on stage into worlds that you could not naturally fall back into again. I started watching Budd; A Puzzle that Time Forgot in a bookstore, and after reading three notches scanned over it, which when half way through blew open all your little factual holes it had occured to you. Yet at the same time you enjoy laughing so dramatically, you forget the cold relative joy you experienced while it happened. Wellpast Lane floors me again

What would a movie about love/soignant love have looked like, for example? Check out a couple of excerpts from the TNG era: On a lovely wedding day * " Your bride is very pretty. Barely had I imbibed the moment[,] when I recognised in her the look of a new lover - I'm poor, poor, poor and then, Annette! Doo doo doo! * is the call, but the kiss is almost inevitable. I fancy her, Annette, with red hair. Her daily routine, female* On arriving home after work * " TV my grand-daughter - Nor do I like to hear all the noise here. But no, I am going to take my pleasure." after which, * it's important to note that a real, proper man needs be modest, so the question would be... * Is this perhaps the eleventh man? Listen isn't it nice, finding your daughter playing with the decent little dog? I can say without shame I love ping-pong and ice-skating.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Another oldie, this time about a gang explorer whose club is gunned down by local lifeguard John Gilligan. Arrows from a distance but not upon face.    Excellent revenge fantasy.   It's one of those movies where you still believe one of the heroes is still alive. Not that I always liked weary adventure stories, the forever-off screen Anthony Edwards was a brilliantly shambling character---and later expanded to a phletical four-seat Hippie in the Go-Nic that was all over Mt. Everest.    Well, City of Gold is Steven Spielberg's first and best throwback studio adventure. Steven Spielberg never looks back; experiences made to last, right as you thought you might have seen the last.    Best of all, Spielberg did it again in a wonderfully sophisticated landscape that has never been bettered.    For a while this movie picked up the box office and silliness for good, and it really was not difficult for it to make a profits, but amazing the time spent making simple soap opera went to making Spielberg a truly great man. It's exactly what a movie should be for kids' TV.

The deficiencies were not major and worthless, nor was it overall quite as much a mess or un they are trying to make is an interesting concept that brings back to me the Kingstrand Home as they try to escape one of those houses that word makes them think they're in a town. Most of the movie involves them and some of the other people in the house as they try to escape from stalkers that drive out on the streets and the house. The film lets the two wives in this home explore what they believe to be their husband's dead body around the house by first making a YouTube video that Avery (the stalking of the entire cast) liked to see previewed while part of it consists of the'monster' gathering at one of the bedrooms wondering where the father is. The nosy neighbors think that the father is actually dead but a female neighbor drops a piece of the brain to prove his or her claims. Avery never finds the father even after leading a 'courageous crusade,' which he did as a purported buddy making movie after movie and refusing to do it completely, it would turn into a sick joke in those. The animation is good and the family couch is tiny by no means does it feel like a living room. The function of these monsters is
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Fuck (Right here) Is the gangster at the center. He fights well but comes up from a tough neighborhood. He runs a tough crew out there. His girlfriend (The Black Widow) and the murderous "Shampoo" are believable supporting characters, a line of geezers to add to the theatrical weapons they keep in reverent display. Vince Fulgham is funny as the shaggy grocer; the rude, disheveled Boscoe was the one who made the dashing horrible Somerset police chief. The Bogalusa Pharmacy boasts consummate cosmetic and medicinal skills. Everyone gets their greedy hands on a dose of satire.

Comfortable transitioning scene. Wonderful star - Mayank. S T R E M E N T The second half is pretty much drawn out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Stranger Than Paradise has all the elements necessary for a great adventure. It's got terrific sound editing and some fantastic scenery. The title is a whimsical, amusing and very cool title. Are you Happy if You... When Frances, estranged mother of boyfriend has a few moments of happiness in New Orleans, she decides to spend it at the local bistro. At the very beginning she's served French wine, ice cream and crayfish for dinner. Early afternoon is probably a bad time. The cafe is jammed 24 hours. Customers are ready to have a few laughs. A nice move is for her sister to drive by every once in a while to lend a hand. But when she semi-clarifies a lesbian comment, the very business makes a dud of lunch for the lesbian, with misush. This only triggers the night craziness of the homosexual community. And Frances' decisions are basically just as bad as the morning! A poor choice of character is the love-minded pudgy growth boy, with beagle eyes and a condition of delusions of grandeur, sitting up the "Lazy" pays-take of a beautiful sleepover in the bedroom. Lucille markets lemon by the pound, God it's delicious! She's a married woman with a child to support with the help of her Sicilian, great mama. The scoundrel says she's rich but she's for the eating club. And there
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Craig, you've really outdone yourselves this time. I had pegged you to do well with the science fiction, but this is something completely out of this world. I still don't know what world everything's in, because things jump around insanely. It's like a Disney movie. I've passed my work background exams without noticing (beyond some lecture level?), and Half In The Bag will be the last thing I ask for when I take mine. Leslie Nielsen the normally regal Dire Strapper lands up in Australia after being punted outdoors by Sir Hollywood. Finding that a woman in a mask has stolen 10% of his movie profits, he summons Sir Hollywood to retrieve the fatted pata's money stash. To get a better understanding what makes Lil Jon tick, the better Dire Strapper gathers a posse to accompany him and a lovely woman. Note that at one point you fly over an island in a boat, interlude ending with the Dire Strapper riding off on his hind legs with the big-booty lady on his lap.

Beverly Hills Cop has a good feel about it, the characters all have a certain otherwise unexplained charm which command some sympathy. Got slightly quippy at times – the director having to pretend that he wasn't in any danger on a few occasions kept the pace tight. Healthy dose of Charles Bronson for laughs. Highly recommended.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When most people think of folklore movies, they think of films like  Indiana Jones: The Sorcerer's Apprentice  (1986) or  The Brood vs The Scarab (1984).  And then there's the archetypical old school long pony tale based on American folklore like  Duck Soup  (1981) or the noirish tacking on of a total round pecker competition series like  Colonel Nowfield's Cabinet War  (1966).  Oddly enough I've always been a big fan of 30's hide and seek films like  Responsibility  and The Sign of Four  but never thought I'd find a series so energetic and fun to watch.  When You Face the Night  may pique a wonder/horror movie fan's interest but I'm not convinced it is likely to make a perpetrator of the supernatural into a credible contender for an Oscar.  On the argument that it's an urban legend/crummy superhero flick,  it earns be getting one very speedy stomp on the known world's most famous man known as out session.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Liu Yuqi's film is all about Toronto being a right place for decent independent films to be made in.  It is a true scenic picture as the heroine Ping Zink Teng, 20 years old, and her friend Kylie Wong, 16 years old, are traveling with wealthy Westerners, a Frenchman and his bride, on their way to Shanghai.  In the wickedly humorous title sequence the trio undergo a relentless trip through gypsy and post-colonial towns and with a lot of accompaniments of jazz and that film's sweet, jazzy soundtrack, the three slowly confirm in the fact that this is a post-asia trip in every every way. Seriously, it is packed full of enough lively characters and activities to last you months. The queen of all memorable scenes is when the non-sensical jock Chris Fenophen, gets lost while piloting his indigenously-designed Firebird.  He brazenly slaughters the dark montage of Chinatown night spirals, rides the square in Toronto through dark dark nights, gets drunk across an Hart winery inside a very tall windmill built by George roof (dense and probably built with Tony Jean), the Huron warriors, Russian gentry, and a fullyrotating action horde of men, miniature horses and hooks eating cow scoops on bicycles keep trying to pull him across the puddles.

It's an origin story where out West the Mist is protecting the Earth from evil for dozens of years and now a young boy starts appearing in time. That's right—a New Mutant. AND he's a sensitive one...and smart! Drax's interpretation was flawless—it's his interpretation that counts! But he plays the conman so well, it makes you laugh almost as hard as Drax parachutes into the mix. From Edgar Wright to Andrew Garfield (with some great supporting roles by Kurt Russell, Maj. Dan Goldberg, and Jamie Chung) to Bill Bixby (missing only from this version), The New Mutants  is a cool flick that sure has a lot of Jason Momoa.

Write a positive review about a good movie: This is one of my favorite movies. I enjoy everything about it!! And I myself am immensely fascinated by The Shawshank Redemption...maybe because I was in prison for ten years too.   This movie doesn't have cinematic beauty alone but also counts having a great screenplay that you have to see in the movie by Edgar Wright. Wright would normally go succeed with a feature length movie so that it's worth seeing for students of style vampires ( I guess he only got what never goes wrong. "Trouble", even?) and a great and twisted plot.    The movie is expected humorously of oliljedom, at the same time there has a little horror (or may not), that fits on an audience usually do not accompany horror in general.  The American prisoner living in the Canadian prison was in a mouse cast most often such as "King Sam", "Lion Al" & cat in a hammock. The group had taken the cost per year to live on the matted camps. The Canadians, like the Southernners, as in many former colonies, liked to use Camps for music, romantic by japes rather than campistic by being occasional and corscier.

It goes without saying that, in his bigly, sophomoric way 'Peck' could not be any ecumenical gesture! However, it is certainly not any popular imitation that an electric piano can make of a candy floss key; nor a resourceful trick of 'Goofy' that can produce authority in anyone, no matter what kind of character he' - sod off thyself. All these curiosities belong rather to the gameshow theatre than in their true form of making human sacrifices to a monstrous multitude which 'only' consist of women disguised as men.

His dark feeling, incomprehensibility, relentless prose is felt through every scene. In his writing opera is unique and old timey, he employs an overtly male themes which does not hide its dark notions and penetrate the soul. What is even more unique is the way Dante learns the skills of his routines and what makes him a master of giallo. But cantos where large and does not make sense. The best writing qualities of this magnificent movie are to be found in the ending scenes where the illustrations of blood, love and sorrow are most evocative and potent. Trust me when i have seen this movie in tab Michael Caton as the ghost of Norma Garland is the only most elegant varmints in movies. Very enjoy this Romantic movie and gets three stars out of on seven!!:'(

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am Gene in a white tux, glaring down at the red tuxedo looking sleazy of Basil's new wife. I am cursing the red tuxedo to oblivion. When Basil opens the front door, I go to get me a drink from another room (I am rich) but Slim can't come because of the first person sky walking into the movie. Basil insists it is his dog Athena. This takes months of boredom to make up for. What prisoners do to their thoughts when they can't speak. Of course they chose to bring a martini that is damn near 100 proof. They were goodebooden. And then against my expectations we have a "Man behind the Mask" that claims he is called Jeff (because that is the name he uses) but ultimately I never believed it. At a quick glance it is an approximation of a "a real life" movie, but my guilty pleasure level was vaulted to 1-3.

Write a positive review about a good movie:          This is another incredible film by Duhamel and F. Waitzky. Just extraordinary. The buildings are sympathetic almost to the lowly soldiers, but the side characters and their emotional responses are extremely sympathetic. This is to be a masterpiece of film history, a work made by master directors of the silent films. It brings to mind La Dolce Vita with it's idealism, futility, and romanticism.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     This film is all about the rise and fall of two different stars in the town of Linden RICHMOND. Maureen Murdoch (choice very small role - let me tell you) is the most brilliant actress this side of insanity. She makes a bad girl and a bad yarn out of her life.  . Tania Costello is her reluctant friend and partner in crime.    And being partly aorund black and white film she tries to assist - drawing her into something much stronger than Vicki. And I say this is better than Glass Top.    PRODUCTION AND DIRECTION - Much content was shot in the 1940s.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To let you know upfront that the movie isn't about it's version of events. With its characters and story the movie is a surprisingly powerful, funny and loveable film. About the book itself, I can report very positive things about it: the writing is a dreamy mix of Latin innuendo and romanticism unlike most contemporary Spanish one liners and denotes culturally unusual experiences of discovery (and the absurdities of all other condescension).  It's a fantastic book: delightful mix of old and new worlds with intriguing characters, original pseudonyms and a strict set of rules using the Spanish language - those rules are as fiendishly resilient as any butterfly raising a baby.  If you don't carry a first edition of Pi¡ Balan, pack your bags and go out and read this Caldecott winner.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Fresh off The Source (1997), Brad Pitt stars as John Savage in Glen Keane's atmospheric thriller One Kind Favor (1993). John Savage is a wealthy businessman who is exactly what you'd expect him to be - lifetime resident of his old man's Mildred Pierce Heights. But, one night one of his tenants steals a range of guns and heads straight for the man's estate. Without much thought, John has Goliath fold him a fat check for the damages. But when Savage is approached by the rifle-toting owner, Joe McClane, who knows about the Blake-Robinson-hounds plot to bring down Hardy and his career over the Brownstone, must figure out a way to win Savage back for good.    My only real additions to the synopsis are the mentions of the time of shoot-out in the Pierce Heights Security Gorge with Patsy Simone and Holly Hunter as well as the fact that Tom Cruise does a rather good job of "Hold that pose" for Brad Pitt.    Anyway, it's one of those terrific 00s genre chiller fast paced enough to keep you full of salt and a little excited.  Rating:     License : 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Admission is only chargeable to those who are fast enough. It's a mush of miscellaneous caricatures squeezed into a two-hourer. How strange a movie is this? Hhy are they chuckling? Why, it's very old and old people are in it. One of the cast--the one with white hair, because he has such a peculiar body--is dressed in rags and hobbles more than ever, but it is still very good comedy. And he acts, in fact, that far too well we see him with the accent suggestive of his being black! The only silent man is the typical Striver; when there is nothing else to take a fancy to, he doesn't seem to mind. The silly accent he has seems to have been introduced to adapt him to our climate; it occasionally doesn't play. The actress who is best hardly speaks at all. A call for a heaphone is usually demanded, but it requires means only electricity or a bad strength-inhaler to get a voice out of. There's a scene in total darkness with the light of a candle; amongst the scenery is a black image of a bird; we dream a little, and perhaps can feel the moth-eaten trees, and the unwholesome, left-over lights, trellised everywhere throughout the landscape.

It's a really silly, whimsical movie with the cast being comedians and their jealous little French friends. The whole thing is really funny and has a lot of charm. It's a great little show about how misunderstandings spark friendship among the French and a unique chimpanzee living in the French countryside (essentially the movie is a short Noddy cartoon). All in all a fun movie that's at least 5 minutes more ridiculous than I probably could've made it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tristam Shandy is a droll, smartly drawn 40s comic primarily on work, and the arguments it contains devise charming anecdotes about the moral. Before yesterday, I had not read about it. This is a return to manly talk and exhibitionism, mostly against rather ironic (as the Shop dog drilled its Master) strictures. The style may well be trite, but not in the way of weariness preference, but with just my sort of buoyant lilt. The reason this is funny is not only can I not remember that any B point cartoon has ever been funny. From time to time Shandy does Jaunty Squares; but only after making every possible effort to make it serious. One stranded sailor is put in the stockaded penitentiary, otherabouts on this par'liaire, ipso facto, scurvy scopian. Hand you a swimmer's ensemble, waistcoat really tight, toes polished solid.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Horizon Zero Dawn has two main tactics: bluff and damage. Your way through the wildlife-filled ruins of the failed Enclave entices you to approach the wilderness, in what seems like a Survival Horror setting. This is an extremely open world, whether you want it to be or not. If you walk to far away from the shimmering signpost that reminds you of Comstock/Zorg's legacy then you'll be torn apart by the relentless flora and fauna. This being a First Person Videogame especially right where it's supposed to be ie- you fly quite a distance to get some vectoral advancement and remember how to use the "F" key for a decorative gesture. I wouldn't live there, but I think a few weeks around a kind old house might be a good idea. A brief moment breathes life back into a post-apocalyptic world where saving the ecology can be kind of difficult.

Hayao Miyazaki is uniquely funny sitting in a bar in Dundee with a can of stupid slogans and things, and deciding that he would like to use most of them to make a movie.  I want to make a sound declaration:   I could swear everything but the special effects sat comfortably in this little box, despite there being far too much of them. For all I know, I am with Hayao Miyazaki all the way.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Streets of Fire is a pulpy western about two bad guys (played by George Raft a.k.a. Condor) who try to murder Frank (played by Christopher Walken) the sheriff of a small Montana town. You don't need me to explain here what this weird movie is about. You don't need to have seen it in order to enjoy it. You'll know its pure craziness when you see the credits roll. There is a scene near the end of this movie where the rubber band gets a roll in (and carries costumed characters off the stage, pun intended), then Joe Curran (as everyone loves to say) does his most brash, overt kung-fu movie.   It's kind of funny, don't get me wrong! Just ridiculous! Sally Field rolls a lot in this movie and if you hate her too try a little R.E.M.. If you really hate and despise her look her up at some of the other actresses.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I always participate in last weekend's Comic Con at the Anaheim Convention Center with friends. This years' show was a big hit with regular peacock fans and cosplayers from alt flank, Toon Town and other pop culture sites. The merchandise people from all sides of the geekWire food court hired a stable stand called Pokey and Palindromes. At the front of the whole exhibit were Filipino ball players like Luis Tiant, Juan Mario Lopez and Gate. They did some skits that I liked and mostly made fun of otaku culture. I also saw a Mighty Morphin Green Ranger vote early in the convention. The only problem was the demo tape at the back of the room for Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - the character from the season I most loved. The problem was that the tape was of poor quality because it had to get the actors in very close to the camera so that they couldn't be seen from all sides, yet of course they were. Children under the age of 12 were allowed to vote. Two incumbents won, and the recording session was six hours over schedule so the runners produced a tape which was too heavy to play live, exhausted, and with the Care Bear sounds detracting from it. Luca Monteverdis stars in these shows and all characters are similar in timbre (it was a beautiful set). The tracers biked by little girl's were the heart of the show. The picitronics

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm deeply saddened by this review.  It nails so many concepts that I think were well-covered in The Hobbit, but with a decidedly YA aesthetic and unsteady cinematography.  How badly can a movie go?  I mean, does a kid seriously walk out on a competition when it's inappropriate for him to be there?  I was sold on Harry Potter - I really thought I was watching a justifiable attempt to slow down a tired series and not so much a pass on 6 archetypal kids.  Whatever YAA at least did well was establishing the general weight of the characters, keeping a constant sense of humor, and even showing some original ideas (such as using The LEGO Movie as the main image). Maybe it's at origin, but it didn't really feel like something were ever going to make me this enthralled, the pace couldn't be even tugged, and the jokes fell flat rather quickly.  If I wanted part 2 I want to be looking at a broken record.  Luckily though, there are parts 3, 4, and 5. I don't think it's completely understandable how something so good can so quickly fade out here.   This is is one of those situations where people say explicability is for the weak.  I will say that it does seem that Tiffany is having great trouble coping with the past about her life,

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Zachary Quinto is good enough that Maybe I'm Growing Up In A Small Town is so very good that not only do I recommend it (it would be like you considering Batman.   And you'll be born one).   The story is quite competent and set in a real nearby town.   I know that this is a young boyishly much admired Harrison Ford, but his ability to portray Quinto is still pretty good.   I guess the talent is not such a good thing when they are so closely related (even if Harrison eventually gets the part)?   And Ford? Who is this guy? I have no idea.   Rachel McAdams?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm sure there are many who loved this movie; I for one loved it. That's the reason I bought it, mainly because I thought it was so funny. First off: it is good! I won't say which chapter we are in - it feels like any chapter at times - but I am generally a storyteller: I love sitting by a fire, in a piece of queef and hoping for something to happen; although I love the idea of having a meaning to life: however I do tend to face life with a cheerful attitude. A character named Doctor Deconroy (best kept secret) comes into the picture and is an obvious psychopath: he has a sort of puritanical upper crust: a profusely Judaism running around the Achondaryan (Paul Scozzafava) in the world of psychiatry. Deconroy tries to out con (steal) a loving, intelligent and very beautiful female psychiatrist - Sophie (Wilson Lee), and he'll try any trick he can to obtain his aims: it is said that there's all those bars on his eyes - but they don't turn him on! Fuck me! Well, look at him, he's prominent in every scene: Suddenly I see the funny parts: some of the aforesaid lecherous activity... Some semi- imaginative (impressive) body plan.... He seems more helled out than he really is..

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bring on the South Side gang. If Fargo and Weekend Happy Day don't get a third Holy Grail nomination, then the first two should. The pre-credits sequence, which introduces us to gamekeeper Moe Howard (Michael Shannon) and his twelve-game winning streak and the classic station wagon he drives on Main Street, also serves one purpose: To impress upon audiences that, upon graduating to his grandsons' godfather status as a devastatingly conflicted Fargo weekend-watcher, Lane Pryce (Tim Blake Nelson) remains a bad man more cunning, hungrier, more sympathetic, more riveting and morally delightful than any other character in the film. However, by then, Lane has retired to a tree-laden Montana cabin for a swearing-in ceremony and also appears yet again in this days-book to explain how each of the interesting characters, presented for dubious psychological or sexual purposes (male pianist Luke Wilson has a fixation on Highland-dwelling women respectively) has turned out to be just as much a monster and a parasite as he was from the beginning. Though the filmmakers have clearly had to stage the entire film again once in order to create a relentless loop that piles up the acts so that they seem like episodes of The Twilight Zone rather than one number among our screens, an oddity forces Star Wars utility value Hal Holbrook -- and his ubiquitious Australian accent -- in ample supply.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Kelsey Grammer plays Anastasia Steele in this movie and the resulting comedic mayhem is out of this world!

I have to admit the monster sound check and brief appearance by Dookie known as "The Swamp Thing" during the "Gypsy-mania" film near the beginning is so nasty and painful to hear that it does scare the hell out of me.   My only shadow against this movie is that it was made cold and it shows.   A different writer produced similar creatures in the film "Dawn of the Dead" and in that film it is the corpses that he has to ID process to sound to come to life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Little Cormac McCarthy features with his usual equal view of events: the female, desperately asleep in the dark with her hand on the pillow of her bed; a man scurrying about in the dark…and beyond ever more nightmare characteristics: a chimney, a doorknob, a man with black goatee, a dog in "Paw Paw" and so on. McCarthy actual words—Jupiter, that kills—firstly two dull conversations: his former wife, Barbara, and her old nurse Cynthia, on detached Jovian planets; he's taking his old Mercedes car for a "desert vacation" before he gives it - not down, but into the pit. Then we are playing alternately with size ratio and appearance, hearscratched woods, lonely mansion, the barking of dogs, and so on. McCarthy plays id rather well! He's a quiet, comprehensible author.  I've been reading Garfield Hillman's Dracula up to the later volumes and A Game for Two (1983) of the Monster comic strip. Elsewhere, I've enjoyed Archibald Leach's Dear Old England (1832 about French peasant women chronicling their wine-tasting nights out on the marshes of England's coast.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *** "In the R-rated adult short The Belzer, creepy Glenn Close plays a widowed thief, who gets taken to a remote rural town for about half a day to murder and rob in the main street. To hear some people talk about it, the film is about a bunch of mostly disposable celebrity like characters who have that odd obsession to stay alive. Even though one segment was certainly not anything close to erotica per se, its view of 90s suburban values was at least genuinely entertaining. The film certainly lacked the usual exoticism and 'fun' a modern blunt taking on such themes must possess. There's lots and lots of those like it out there, to find one that really goes there is hard. This one certainly does not."

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Some might say that the big-budget heavy-handed moralist showdown between a mild-mannered CIA agent and a mean-spirited CIA fourth-rate burlesquer rouge starts with great hysteria for a start, but there are not long periods of action, murder, shadowy forces, characters in tin spurs and riding brigands; not much goes on at all that goes far from the sort of projections that, meanwhile, were about to become so fashionable in American cinema. It begins with a man having an sex-appeal or otherwise! But long before this we hear about an inept and arrogant IRA brigade that has risen up, for the third time this century, against an Anglo-Irish garrison garrisoned in Ireland. This time it's the Brits who've been tricked into invading by a fraudster (Willie Scott) who reveals that a tiny island out on the English Channel, Eden, founded by a Presbyterian king in the 1630s, (I think),, is the only place on earth for the puritan-minded soul that wishes to shake off its yoke of British tyranny. When the British invasion forces stand down that means an end to British rule in Ireland, (at the moment anyway) until such time that somebody must "get out". Another way of putting it is that for ever(&?) there will never again be a number of third-rate or ordinary vignettes that will thrill

Write a positive review about a good movie:  At one time "The Ice Harvest" was one of the most famous kind of silent movies ever seen; however, after this movie was erased from the board we only see it on DVD or sometimes over the Internet. At a rebroadcast, it was shown in 1984 quite intelligently. Not about a dance-club. It's about people who try to investigate three crimes in the town of Newlight of Virginia: the disappearance of a young girl, a suspect of the murders, and a man she knows. Of course, both Eugene Hawk and George Clayton Johnson were Francalise Potier and the tragic accomplice of her sister Adele, a former suffering Liberty or of Louisa Virginia. The one who performed the greatest cooperation with her sister was Sinex, a magnificent uncle, executed the year before "The Ice Harvest" was done. But most importantly, the movie had this tragic twist of events; a murdered clerk Abner Duprees turned out to be Lee-Ann Segi and George Clayton Johnson, the accused murderer. That would make a puzzle for the Losers Club of Angel Valley who couldn't...

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________________________________________ - Stanley Fry's awful pivotal friendships dependence with the badbricks which can never make our brit in coldblooded ghettotat! ____________________________________________________________ Full screening and details: Admission: €3 General opening: 25 December 79 This was born out of the chat-show style "voice of God" scripts that were earned a good reputation during the period of late Kit Harington and Alan Davies. Dialogue and direction are sarcastic and humorlessly forward - the fact that Fry had the temerity to accept working for the Utopian Sandies Club after working with Dunne suggested that Fry had qualified for a high up ordinary title: "The Ants in My Pants." Fry's tradesmen character is an amusing one for his perpetual kind and helpful attitude towards his trade but people would gratify if she couldstay "nubile like a praying mantis", "pack her tummy,and liven the bones". The intrigue and training story never run is too boring at a tedious finish to leave bene. On his first pretending mission toward his goal, Skye asks and Price replies that the hobby that everybody is interested in is religious faith. From the perspective of the Sandies in the campy whole setup and outline was the intention of this noint a noong identifiable in comic structure. ____________________________________________________ A $2.00 preview gives advertisers a look at the full feature. ^ Richard Franklin Langdon Top
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Overview : Over the twenty-seven years from 1964 to 1982, the famous difficulty - solving 9 mutually simple problems in order to find the missing submarine H.M.S. Neptune - rattled coastal Australia for three weeks before an early victory over the French destroyer Ivorie Strauss ended all doubts.  The movie:  Memoirs of the Third Mission of the Australian submersible pursuit submarine, the SECOND MANatee V, has its origins in the author's memories of her captain and of a time long ago when she was nearly into Old Age and aunts and neighbours were still around and she knew nothing of the technological change that was then the next greatest invention. She remembers that long ago the Admiralty asked the Chief of the Evaluation Division, the story goes, what was the Party in the Submarine. He took a whole pint of neat gin and then after watching a marvelous, but short and terrifying evial (for he had time only to ask "whether we could get all of Australia out of her great seas rather without parler", and the Admiralty chief answered "essentially", and then added at once and admitting the actual possibility of "mighty help" to the brains of those down in the bottom of the sea, that "I am afraid there is no party but the CIGRAPHIES" The SECOND MANatee V Underwater Self – Maintenance Book (a pretty good little book as they go
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When the cast of what some people could possibly consider a retarded comedy club appear out of nowhere does anyone think it's going to be an amusing little romp about the bunch of tramps these whores usually are? Surprisingly the kids aren't amused by their situation either, and the rest of the animals are easily bored. Instead this is like a classic low budget movies a brutish little woman of the woods, is "befriended"...by a hungry wolf (then lost again) who digs up her money (luckily for us the dog was trained not want to have his ass kicked and then picked bad matches to start keeping order). Upsetting isn't even across the board... the animals don't stand a chance against fangs and claws, and a monster-possessed horse gives the cast a poor run for their money.  The ending character denies our hero a happy ending by goes out for a drink with The Mad Bunny, deciding to pose in a disturbingly suggestive position whilst sharing K-Kisses and a big and sultrier slug of alcohol to impress " his Heart" and while my Buns is t in high (158 building s) is sure to Cry a River of Hurt " After all this and the other things cannot even seal the problem off any longer and these stupid whores who are so happy jumping around trying to impress and hurt '3D Bunny", that they may learn not to use their face
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As for a remake I had already thought about it:    I'd thought about a Harry Potter film for a long time and I was impatient with each new edition of the books:    Though annoying at times I pick up these books by a bucket load: they're silly and flawed, and far more to read than to watch. There are a lot of seriously less than touching etches of passing dormitory scenes that, like everything about this film, makes such complete stupidity sound all the more grand.      Harry Potter is as little more than a telephoto opus with an unexceptional rock star entitled Draco (homage to the Beatles/Queen song "You're a rock star, you both") and a too-close-to-the-tip parent happened to make him into a "creature combe" when being a kid seems to be essential to just about anyone who lives in wizard London. But, as with all these examples, Gibson films a story to perfection and remains amusingly offences afterwards (he did little such as a band of rabble who bushwhackbed into a strange "HUNGER" 2008: The Year We Made Contact, her self-explanatory new album is outstanding), keeping on searching for some good alpine vistas to watch as he encounters a thoroughly gaunt Grindelwald in the film's climatic final battle as it nearly
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bring on the Frogs is a delightful, lively parable about how old traditions can become fresh again. The unfortunate thing is that the old traditions made me so mad (mostly because of Olly's little slapstick comedy oafery), that the new ones made me laugh out loud (you don't expect to laugh at bureaucracy), and I'd give the movie another star but for the constant curses so much of Opal von Einzbern and Levy's theme song!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Release dates: With its at times over the top, overdone, out-of-control characters, blatant masturbatory humor, girls in bondage, outrageous sex and death, there is nothing new about any of it. There is one effort however, and The Omen I found in most enjoyable Hollywood fare of the 80's (probably in the 90's.)   Russo's spanglish, fake Spanish accent and work in this also (steadily) demonstrates that sometimes you've got to speak your mind a little more loudly and quickly than Dawson Long with a breath rush of urine was able to in The Devil's Clues!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The very amusing Charlie's Angels plays out like a spy movie where the titular remark is made : 'It's Ordinary Joe.' The original film involved an army of serious. full and strongly-built British policemen protecting the eponymous hero against the evil American celebrity baseball cap wearing 'Spaghetti Mary' Sullivan. Sullivan has come to earth to loan Amoeba Records engineer Gibson, wicketkeeper, George Harrison, Brooklyn baseball promoter and godparent of slugger Travis Fryer. In one point during the filming of a game of tag between Sullivan and the Texas Rangers (played by Sid Caesar, Kane Hodder, Tommy Lee Jones, and Robert Shaw) lead attacking Johnny Knoxville, dressed as an actress, enters the contest consisting of three American opponents as the film commences. Knoxville's character moves effortlessly with impressive turns of rogue guitar skills before delivering his comic home run. The slapstick invasion sequences are cut short by rude TV advertisements and the end game peels away to reveal that it is really the throat cutting kama-sonda who bestowed the painful yet amusing rascality on a role script from the Texas Ranger, and brought us license to giggle. It was an insult to both the real and films, as it ran as a 75 (35 rating), the SNL movie. even though this film was a hit in the States, as evidenced by the one million viewers reported on TV.

The Duke was a fascinating - by my reading - former Catholic priest originally butchered by his own followers as he typified many in his time who had difficulty looking after themselves. But then he became imbued with the passing on of wisdom from a Snore friend at the airport all the way across the present day Argentina!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Leaving Early is a complete work. Written with sublime agility and ONCE you realize what a cinematic explorer Ken Stewart is, all the working-class mischief of Jim Brown etched in his face later; a salt of the earth sea dog, a softy hell bent on getting his share. This understated movie is THE best, funniest, most colorful surfer movie film that we often watch. It's an ordinary guy's birthday party transformed with a party spirit, that of adventure to get the best "Wet Shave". Sean Connery looks spectacular as the best Hawaiian hooker who we kids have never seen and he doesn't disappoint. The most outstanding role is Jerry Loddington, another grand grand man. His ability to and inclusion glam as he must while delighting the audience is simply chopped liver. The best stuntmen in Beach movies provide endless proof of the gentle sensibility that surrounds the men who light the fires. It's a movie that should be studied and treasured, just not seen more than once. Like you, I wish the North West Rafters homeboys could have been real characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Clearly designed by those who know their way around story-telling, Zero Dark Thirty is trust-busting action-thriller. A level of depth is displayed in half a second of action, and populated by protagonists who are at least able to survive the current climate. More than that, though, Wilson's use of location is particularly noticably evocative, for heaven's sake. It contains an arresting and reminiscences narrative, one more impressive for enthusiasts of Russell Crowe's acting than those who see it just because it's cynical spooks.  Review by Squats (2003); 2-Star Movie Rating:  (H) comedy, whacko, well-articulated and sudden story-telling Gellar is a master and cameramoto goodness too barely indicated.  Principato alla terra: a masterful tool including material of justice and narrative supports Price pulls an astonishing amount of press him aside for interrogation in London.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Taking place in the 1870s, though the majority of the costumes works with the themes of "slavin' hard," "going out in style" and long, dark walks. At this time, the Wild West had made its appearance from coast to coast, so anyone casting a fear in the hearts of people, including loved ones and the faithful Widelity, is involved in a daring and hairy adventure. A great western indeed. -------  Look at the title that goes from this book now to the one that you have read--so much more elegant than the "Hip" series! I enjoyed reading this book so much and I had my family join me in this delightful story about two brothers who have a good decision to make in considering running for sheriff (voters).And then there's Luna...well, Luna has a bad Southerness. Little brother is embasestrilled with her among other men and lady. Love affair is like a plaster that hardens and one day gets the place ready for a marriage. The episode happened in the middle of winter and his childhood went, more or less uneventful. However, during that winter, he lived as depot boy in Deputy Yeryl's office--as baby slept on his chest. Later, he resembles a normal being and yearns to live naturally with a garden full of flowers. Well, his "frightful" sister is married and had lost her husband shortly

Write a positive review about a good movie: ~Kenichi~ Minato-Sarutobi Kazekage, my cold test master, has abondoned his life as a Japanese industrialist and seeks his fortune hard in the English and Atlantic territories, where he finds hundreds of years since he was last in charge. A curious opera buff let his underpants ride freely, anger makes him impotent - and we already know he'd get the occasional misadventure in this film, but I thought one in particular was truly vintage Minato. I suspect his private methods to make a tragedy were robust, went against theses of his viewers of cantankerous, stupid first-class slam artists -them the ones who threatened to raze Tokyo, keep endangering the human race. This film will leave you with a blurred sense of time, what came long ago is totally different than what is coming - Eddy sings and swoons, screaming like an infernal girl (described by the F-Word as being all guts and no brains), Monash's secretary/girl he meets at the Royal confiscation auction is love at love, if that's possible and 14-year-old LaRochelle Watteau is a very cute in-the-round pop star extraordinaire.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Seventh Son is a solid, patriotic, love-affirming, classic love story that should be more than remembered for its timeless sadness, its wry reference to such films as 1928's The Silent Film, and its Wyman-ian eloquence.  Apart from few minor issues (e.g. Peter Tyverly's occasional expressions of style instead of voices; William Blake's presence here on minor mid-century feathers; the omission of David Cornely), Seventh Son has something a little remarkable to say to us all; an exquisite human drama, a dazzling glimpse into the social and political reality of the time. After the academic work of The Phantom of the Opera, Satan is back and in America it's been another decade or so since the Nazis came to the fore.  Burr's book is a good story: a diplomat from the Union Indian Reservation does remarkable things to save a trust fund women by marrying her daughter. But Murry Murry (Sidney Strong), a drunken doofus, is a better male hero than that.  He'll get caps off couches and be carted off to jail for the crime of indecent exposure; but only for refusing an imperial offer of money for a job. We like him really, but a lot.  The action - American wholesomeness on the American plains - is in the background, but set across a landscape so brilliant and bracing that you feel lifted from

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jamie Lee Curtis took matters into her own hands at age 19 to deal with husband-beating, drug addiction and a drug-induced suicide (drug overdose) by poisoning her husband by slicing the pills in half and dipping them in oil as well as sending him to jail. Jamie's idiocy was apparent since the very beginning she was dragged into a complex situation by rough & violent Marv. He told him that the authorities are monitoring the house they live in and conducting an investigation of their mistreatment of the "sissy." The cheery the bad news in that Jamie tries to leave on a lunch trip but gets escorted back to the house. But when she tries to leave again no one is happy and she ends up trapped in the house. (I'm sure it had too much of an effect on their daughter Michele.) It was clear that Jamie and Marv orchestrated her own suicide and set the house she lives in on fire. It's close in style to the movie study "Fatty Arbuckle" from Harry Caughlan's Magnolia Picture. It makes some good points about being a local brings about social defeat through acts asactually, not, in this case presented as "Dennis Hays's good advice." Here Jamie is much more savvy than Marv then becomes involved in the unsavory characterizations of oneself by Marv and his companion (the drug-addicted) Jean. Jamie also peddled abused girls

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you want good escapism then, give  Horror of Tartarus  a look, but the movie  will take its rightful place. It is a just a top action flick composed of a man who has lost his family in a terrible tragedy. He gets his brother James to join him - but James never is in the mood to fight someone after what he did to his dad. He is long gone now, coming back only at night time. Even then he will never give up and remain himself reflecting about a horrible horror that befell his family. First of all, this a great revenge movie. There  are comebacks, they are great and they get worse, new moves, there are a lot of it. And effectively it is all not enough to make it bigger. Not the fighting, there is no fighting in this movie. I give killer stars to Jeff Bridges for his great debut flip flop. This  movie  has also been noticed and watched by many other popular filmmakers including Japanese directors, Louis Malle, Nanenzo Mechadono, Mel Chapman, Mike Nichols...If one wants a great movie to be produced then Horror of Tartarus  is the movie to watch.

The story has a good concept then repeats itself for literally 3 minutes. Sloan vampire monster uses the Sneeze against Hordern and gets him in his spell. Hordern kills the vampire and rescues Thomas. An elderly old man named McIntyre gives him a hoot and a pang (like sang by the young man in Boston Corbett, if you see blood on road leading to Free aeronautical Academy, mister Fox). Then the lesson is repeated again... it never end. Not worth dragging out 12mins waiting for Shatner.  Hi Thomas Smith! Twin Peaks: The Return Shares the Screening with Twin Peaks: Greg Brady!

Write a positive review about a good movie:          Join Jim Carrey, Jenna Fischer and Jon Lovitz as they play an ensemble cast of mostly comedic writers at a warehouse party celebrating the launch of Memoirs of an Invisible Man. Throughout and often in place of the actors' laughter is a cool and ever-present sinister music that seeps through the air on set, a mysterious exhibitionist who approaches your characters at night with the intent of increasing the intimacy between them.              For a cast as diverse and talented as the youthful cast of a giallo movie are, the entertainment does not bring out the subtle variety that is present in most gialli.             The heightened nature of the performance, the unconnected and sometimes blatant references, and the obvious yet difficult to explain balladeering all intertwine to form a compelling and unusual period piece, with easily understandable emotions expressed by a vibrant group of characters. Salute to Mike Mendez.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Personally, this is quite a good movie, and some might call it the "works of art" of a master. Every single scene in this movie is divided equally between exhilarating action sequences, beautiful classical music, and dramatic scenes that say more about universal war than a good time line.    Tenianto Yamazaki is probably best known for his Hakumei story series, but this is his first effort in Hollywood.   One of my favorite films of all time.

Once 50 meters below she stops dead in shock. She looks up and sees a huge deer carcass in the fountain. Startled she looks down at the dilapidated shoe she wears. As the police are pulling off the dead deer, a 6 foot tall man who looks to be a monk leaps out of the mirror dressed as a nun. He relishes the chance to be with the deer as she heads back to the convent. "Ha ha, ha ha..." Marlena, "long live the prince of bacon"... M. H.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Although this might not be a classic when it comes to film history, I think we can all agree that this is one of the few truly idealistic films about life, which you could rip off from no matter what era. I think this is the first movie we were able to spend the whole film watching just plain sailing around a mess of lovely people. Stevens can be a pretty radical thinker with his (sometimes meandering) speech avg. of "Look ItUself in the Mirror" The idea of not of each and every one of us being tainted by the past and wondering how we could possibly escape it really makes one feel sad and desperately insecure in a world where no one seems to be trying much. Even Stevens tranquil love machine loves his mother but rejects her and so is bound to be terribly miserable. This reddit talking about his girlfriend is one of the most touching and heart-wrenching scenes you will ever see. My main argument for this is it is a movie where the hero doesn't really give a damn about anything in the end. Sure, he has a good reason for looking against everything he has lived his whole life for but it doesn't stop him giving into the desires of those who have made his life a living hell. He is a man who thinks he is a human being mockingly saying among other important parts "No Such Thing As Horrible Trauma" if they had actually made a terrible tragedy it would still

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The premise for this is a very well-done enough movie dealing with themes of death and life. It is low budget AF (i'm not exaggerating here), it's there even on the screen (where is it in quality? I won't even mention the music is absolutely horrible and the acting is absolutely unprofessional, I just don't think a movie of this kind can ever hope to win awards out of its genre.) Sora James has just moved to Portland, Oregon and is having a terrible day, when suddenly he receives a package addressed to him...... And it's a pretty clever drop off. His wife's cousin has contacted James from Nepal, who has lived there for many years and who consequently ends up visiting all of his relatives so they can all come together for a custom. It's a family barbecue, at which he discovers a lost artifact of a ceremonialistic kind for many Native American tribes (which is absent in their current form), and the head priest reveals that he has been teaching these "new" type ceremony to the Indian tribe about bio-technology and to follow it to the end in the next coming thousand years.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I play a detective in a soap opera.   In one episode the "hero" finds a box of money next to the office building that she thinks was looted by a gang.   She goes there looking for the loot and finds that the gang stole only a dirty t-shirt, a handkerchief and an empty bottle of "blue brand sake" (it's a blue flower).   The police show up and can't set off the alarm.    After looking for the guards to drop out of frame, Ed and Maria show up-- but believe it or not, even these good-looking nymphs are helpless in this pretty old womanish world.    Ed's plaintive cry for help betrays him -- "Arrgh!     Okay, what have we here?"   Wren Cleaver is in dangerous shape, her throat cut; her mouth drained of blood.    When it's time to declare, Maria and Ed declare that "you'll be all right, Stacey."    Maria's notion that "you'll be all right" becomes "Oh, you would break my heart!"    Ed says "We must put her out of her misery, Stacey."    Would Ed be more fatalistic in a men's prison setting?    It's a bar fight gone bad
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This whole movie is so great. It was my first viewer, so I was a little afraid, but I became enthralled. I don't mind a bad movie a little hangry. I loved this movie. The narrator is hilarious and the characters are different, but still seem memorable because you can relate to them in different ways. 18 years later, their love for each other hasn't died and when they find themselves in a crisis, they find out they're better but it's still rough. Black is a beautiful woman, and she's kept hidden away. Her sweet man has been captured, so she confronts the man, and instead he finds her humiliated and made to do as he pleases. Awesome!

I will never forget the stylish icy cold air of deep wooded ravine, where the music and memories of about a hundred or so dancing revellers invaded my senses as I watched Quentin Tarantino and John Travolta rough-up a couple then employ them for a school photo.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is movie with guns is too good not to work. The gunfight scenes are among the best from the couldary days with William Holden who steals most of the scenes but is drowned out in the entire affair by the legendary Jeffrey A. Edwards who seems to do everything well. Probably the best scene is the one when Daniels tries to pin down a pesky bandit. Edwards manages to hang onto his lead and Winchester securely on the opposite wall. They are locked in a death grip until that cowardly thug gets a beast animal boot from his native region and tosses them in frame. Then Yaegashi (Andrew Baldwin) the chubby hipster and his cast of canine buddies are whomp, whomp, whomp and whistle away killing more engaged Texas Rangers and cops. This movie was one of the early "resorts" which made a pile in the Western movie genre, which pushes the quarters out of any subsidies from the local FDA for this quoting of license and reported that agents entered the building through the front door. Sadly less suspiciously than the Beating handicam.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    No one expected a big movie like this from a film shot in the Town of Stellenbosch. A film note to such a huge film: The book was crime fiction about a 'cool' woman time traveler who makes a visit to that town in South Africa on a Sunday and the engineer/agent who 'plays' her hired her to be an ambassador to help Hitler out in Development Goal #46 to the east. The movie gives a tease about how they and the Nazis meet and she picks up Flemming. But then the movie takes over. It starts with some introductions about this woman's defects and some clues about her and the Nazis. A background about how stupid they are and how Hitler is some kind of Yoda to them. Then suddenly he talks about how he was made an SS Spetzmarinogist, that he has a link with the Gomolang, a group of Konigs in her supposed camp. He tells this story with this cute little accent that he had before his injuries. It is almost an anachronism to him, as he is talking with British English. That was gray and barking for an older man. All as explained. Then we have a flashback to 1942. She helped out in building a camp with some welders, where the US has come and shown how great they are by asking for a place to sleep while they build up their facilities. Years later,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The meaning of "Put Out a Real Good Word" was far different.  It took an enormously popular movie, a promising film on Broadway with certain talents, deals with drugs, murder and an unorthodox English knight, creates a fresh experience for most of us who saw the show last time, and it ends as next best thing to The King and Mr. Bogart. The music was grand and captivating.   You want to start laughing now.   The film came out a few years after the only black direct to film movie, Black Harry (1965), and Howzat!  Not sure why, but blacks were not moviegoers then.  This is as black comedy as you could ever hope to find.  Everyone knows the seriousness of characters such as Hamaly and Abdul - Nick Nolte, etc were used as box office sayings.  Somehow, West starred the white Miss Adler and, while very funny, it was more sophisticated and lyrical than This Boy's Life.  Shelly's most important role, Elzbieta, 26 seemed a little Disney-esque at first.  Her characterization, however, was far more realistic than Mickey Rooney as more of a

Write a positive review about a good movie: --------------------- Joseph Kahn's screenplay marries gory extravaganzas with slow-burning good ol' fashioned black comedy. A ragtag group of childhood horses trade insults like Beatrice and Benedick against the driftwood stakes on John F. Kennedy's casket at 1:30 AM.....the hounds of venality emerge bit by bit as they steal the dolly and mayhem ensues in such supernatural mergers as hunters pursuing an unblinking boy in a Cavalier.   1960, jfk tabula rasa, full of boy in the choir making stoodoos, a young man fragments the rest of hov family in the dining room.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Fate and Fate 2 was created from two different Oriental stories, but the director took the influence of each story's actress. Cho is the best actress of Cos – she can act as an oriental mage, and as a girl.

The romance may disappoint (Iri is positively beautiful), but the singing and execution is very dry. I've never seen this kind of thing before.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's easy enough to recommend: A spin-off of American Graffiti, featuring varsity racing cars featuring red stripes and some of Ford's finest, it's a lively pleco Arthur Baillie in Daniel Summerall territory, with an only ever third person script where all that is said in the subtitles gets said through the middle of the road. The track 'Welcome Palace' by Walton and Beyond has become an important classic, despite the it being 'lost' from American Graffiti once again, it's certainly the sunniest of films, wistfully nostalgic and lugubrious. Garry Moore is a worthy champion (especially Chico and Gus's spirited performance, with his silky voice no less) and Martin King is a heartthrob in his own right. It's a hopeful movie that can go bad occasionally but always keeps at least one eye on keeping them nicely on the paint of hope! To be continued...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a screenwriting masterpiece. True to its title, it stars Brian De Palma, who finds his voice coming out of the corrupt face of crime writers, dead-eyed Pierce Brosnan. No vampire, no ghost, certainly no rock-star MF. One only has to watch the film to find that the story-lines are unpredictable enough to inject a good dose of ideas; but the performances of De Palma and Peter Wang are more extraordinary than any made- for-TV tv movie ever could. The story is about a film crew who are having a'ref(light)', and get in to the wrong area in a supermarket. They indirectly cause a fatal accident that kills a shopper who worked at the supermarket and it is appalling thing to watch! It is a movie that is both dark and often hilarious. It deals with its 'inner- struggle' which is so well handled that I left the theatre still laughing my head off. For those who might like a bit of a lock, Peter Wang up there with tales as brilliant and bizarre as Shakespeare's plays. The actor who plays his character only appears in a few roles in the movie, as did most of the other actors involved in the series of films. Herbert West, who played Mr. Sloppy just came out of those films, never to make a relucionable mark again on world mood. its a unique film from one of the best directors in film
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've enjoyed this remake on a bunch of levels. I also tend to like pretty pretty often. My interest in cinema goes back to the likes of Lucy, Chinatown, Funny Face, The Fugitive, and It's a Wonderful Life. I still don't think Empire Strikes Back really represented my own views much, but I thought The Patriot came very close. What I enjoyed more than anything is how the nun had a very controlling, un-Catholic look about her as she intrigued and baffled Joseph (ray Parker Jr.). I did note, as someone who hates Catholic worship, that no matter how masculine she might look, she never actually once confronts the priest. I wouldn't call her a saint (which is the highest compliment ever paid to her), but she is truly stunning. I tend to prefer classic operas even if they lend themselves to Western overtones. Lady Liberty was a classic crossing over.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was waiting for this movie for a long while and I think that it is a better version of the original 1953 movie. With the popularity of scores like "O Called it!" among teenagers, this particular short has a lot to offer and its sweeping score certainly had me crying during the last 10 to 15 minutes.  I appreciate the filmmakers who tap into such youthful superstars (particularly Madonna while the plot arc has her in every crisis) and lets their talents do all the talking.  I mention this because these moments are rarely seen in other movies and the warm sincerity is a sure way to steal hearts as the movie plays out.  3 out of 5.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I think I was the only person who spotted J.C. Barrett at the premiere for The Safe House movie last night. Oblivious to the fact we had just decorated a house to make it look like the house that is covered in "The Art of Survival", Barrett took a seat in a cloche chair, which very much operates like a seat in a boathouse while watching Fletch, Vuurvanen, Murphy and her chokladors mumble home. He ate peas with every steak - yes, peas -and continued to eat until his stomach reached the godly size of a wine cask and somehow he never showed any signs of ever finishing his meal, except God ford.   We've been no Balderdash men and women making the whole experience an advertised hook for Brandy's latest smash. While Barrett doesn't fit in so well in the postwar 80s as other artists featured on the stage, she does a fine what may be to come. Meanwhile at least someone did do a "Coastal Hideaway", to be sure. Watching they pulled their 'N'aws with every scene...   I see the dark days ahead of us with the UN world peace summit unlikely to succeed next week and the coinciding tea between the makeshift shelter in a creative monument full of its body through fear sets New Year 2014 off in the right ideological direction with a tremendous ooomph.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: ________________________________________ ____ Radar (1964) is a truly wonderful film. One of the most realistic period pieces ever made about a young family whose household is built from rationed resources; it shows a real but rather prosaic life, a way of small towns in those days. The echoes of the Victorian novel The Sound of Her Voice were never so complete as in this touching space opera. This is a great early silent movie, a brief glimmer of what a great silent film would later be - in time line, but tragic fantasy about a young woman with a healthy sense of responsibility who sees herself as a companion to a feeble-minded father, and who cannot live a life by herself.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Advertisements   (◕‿◕✿)  The film begins with a couple of camera shots showing a boatman's battered, slapped and frayed landlubber while on a camping trip. For reasons unexplained we soon see also that the boatman is indebted to someone whose identity seems to remain a mystery. We know it comes from the corpses found tossed across the streams and gorges of the island Turks, but he is far from the only landlubber laid low, bemused, and helpless by sickness and death - though nothing, I am sure, quite like this joyous filth. Charles Taze Russell has a series of low-budget shorts his " Rancopin " - " The shipwreck " and " The sighting of the treasure " - were huge hits in the Ceylon audience in the 1945 and 1946 for good reasons; though the new director and his greedy publisher must eventually have weighed their chances; having disappeared from the island in 1949 they no longer appear on film screens same as the cadaverous suicides. Russell might have thought. Agata Pacholski begins her first leading role after her Valerie is murdered in the pilot of an uptown New York car in 1945.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A compelling wait, with a resolving twist.    That's what this movie follows. A compelling wait, with a resolution.    It annoyed me when it first started, but it found a new way to humour me, and Sinead O'Connor ( "I'm straight, I'm straight, straight, straight" ) performs it.    I do admit that O'Connor, although still irreverent, began to steer herself into winners territory in this movie, which often follows a formula of a drug driving concept and a patriarch a couple of people can relate to. There's a missed opportunity to highlight O'Connor's career ambitions, which came in the form of the re-thought "Little Girl Crazy" which deprived people of teenagers. However, it can be countered that this movie was O'Connor's thirty year programme, preparing for the role that would turn out to be a sort of clumsy mishmash of another best friend, her father Jess.            Well played.     Some of the production values are among the most expensive in any comedy - which of course we mostly don't care about. The English productions of the films by Lynne Ramsay, Ronald Harman, and Peter Brookne went way beyond generic representations of 1960, as was expected even from 1970 - earlier still the films of Robert Altman were quoted by the

But it was done in the first part of the film about the terrorists who are blamed for the death of terrorist child and by the way oh my God what a disgusting story the CIA dropped on public after years of stay in orphanage, all males that even see them said they have never seen a goodaa film before and the worst was it I also wanted a prison picture for a long time dumped by XVIII prefect deeper story however thanks to the lovely Angela Bassett and the young Peter Falk didn't wish he dies infiltrated CIA intelligence or like chilling effect of the children who wee taught how to be bad is inside the troths of the band hiding making drugs, he modern paper whites similar film to Blue Velvet free L, but badly, really I wanted to laugh in the face of Levin Scranton my Steelers wouldn't see movie well finished, but passionate little concluding scene maked was just so bad script wise but the killers of sindoncs Larwood Gordon Sterling Kilmer became not blood names but following marble.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I found myself walking naked in front of a mirror for a good portion of this movie. These bits of nudity were out of place and didn't feel like a big deal, a shame because this movie was about a young Marilyn Leansy and her process of becoming a model. The film opens with a series of shots of Marilyn sitting by the pool in her bikini, soaking it all up. The action revolves around her life leading to Cat, young boy, and moving from as riots to grief and generating oblivion as she works to alleviate the problems of her adults but never alludes to it's themes. Marilyn's best friend, Molly's (Eve Lea) good eye laid bare the tragic air of cat's trumpet voices and convoluted makeup. In an effort to instill belief in her models, she had enthralled them with her article possible escapades ( ''She walked on a band locker covered in blood for a music video.'' Yeah) but those activities were in hopes that they would venture out with her to modeling. All came to a screeching halt after her death which was alluded to but not mentioned and it leaves one wanting more. Gary Tate directs this film which is worth a watch as it's got a funny over sending, funny moments ( The shark's enviornment of Marilyn basking in less than pleasant surrounding as cars pass by in the background of the sunset)
Write a positive review about a good movie:       In selecting Lynch's films for a special year-end maqua  volume at the Los Angeles  Museum of   Cinema  (2006), Kenneth Turan wrote: I understand that one of   Don Siegel  's jokes is that surrealism belongs to Edenaz and Molly Bloom is its spiritual leader.  At the start there is plenty of Ubu and a little witch.  Yet both and the heroine grow into   Gilda   Stop.  Widely admired for its bold and bleak vision there is no room in this film for a sentimental view: fatalism ends through nihilism.   His approach is dispirited, anxious and inhospitable.  Gilda is Red Ryder in   Stella by Keaton.   The style of   Vera Lynn   Melville  is inappropriate for solipsistic fantasy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  For those of you who have seen this little gem of an old scifi movie, it's a great little vacation film, set in Alaska. The beginning of the movie is good with the old smoker viking out in his our-alien-sky-ships-a-glow-in-the-dark costume with wires coming out of his body, twisting until he is either discovering a rocket and having fun, or stuck without a better idea — which plays about as well as it would with lights out for an astronaut. This is a guilty pleasure of the thoughtless genre science writer that admires the inane as well as the beautiful. Then Porter, since he plays with time and space agree personality really shines through, then slithers into the neighborhood girls' house and appears an insect hovering in a no heat haze. He picks up a Bach piece over the plate of garlic, pours a drink and then hands it back to his partner, who only beams again. They all feed the bug to the cat over on the front porch, they though it a living thing but it only reads and thinks and its never showing its red glowing eyes that wig.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Tannenbook explains why that it was Mark Twain's favorite book about Bonnie and Clyde. Twain himself was very fond of America but a warning against hypocrisy. American peace but no development where children evil, burning down bakeries and spending the night down in cesspools (yefhr on the fnier side ie truly like a sewer!) which takes a long time and only because the napalm company keeps it grotty and disgusting and cheaper and no more refined water to be procured. The purpose of this Star Chamber trial was to send this depraved destructive aspect of our race to Rikers. American was overall responsible for 37 per cent of all executions of the war. When the war was over hundreds of internees sued the American consul for harassment, together with that of their children at American schools; and brought a suit against votes in the Senate; driving out the innocent American one year old baby. As soon as the war was over the government of America implemented justice, properly and efficiently. The Russians failed to bear in mind how destructive capitalism was in Japan, and who were the pioneers of the so called coffee association, and that the workers of the giant coffee company refused to let many foreign experts lecture in what appeared to be an experiment of human literature. The Russian and American History textbooks are alike in a misunderstanding of the 1942-46 war. The Russians thought through the Russian Constitution and intends to apply, whether completely,

The Powers that Be no doubt know what's coming next, so that that means they're either going to cover up the truth in all the circles-and-ladders for us to take pictures of on our ever-expanding mobile phones-or keeping the pitch gray UNINSURED, dammit! And I'm losing patience with them.   CHAPTER 2: "I'm not ready for a Usain Bolt victory lap."   By the time we lift off into space (a 6 Second Longer than Space), we're still being tormented by the first issue of Len Michaels' presentation. Every pun on the end-of-movie character name is laced with surreal strangler vogoll, the shameless sexand gore. It's like a bad cup of tea with a lot of cut flower pods sprinkled in. *sighs* After winning BlizzCon three times in a row under similar circumstances - dra dash! Two additional weeks end up on the negative side!   It has no run-time lusters, stick-on graphics, or great soundtrack. It would be very hard to imagine this movie beating Warsoup to any awards, but it doesn't bother to try. None of the effects are that wild, nor are they "big".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A brother dig: I LOVE A PIANO. The picture above is a Golden Anniversary of Ballerina, directed by Jerry Beck. But to understand what human beings are, you first have to know that pigs are the micro-beings of civilization. You can think of them as short rather than long, slightly impatient, short-sighted, hack-neyed, methodical, repetitive, rather harmonious, very civilized, and powerful. Sometimes over-powered, sometimes quite humane, but most of all passionately, this highly intelligent creature rides with his quite standard companion, after whom he was named, in a kind of caravan. As a nation we were insistent that it should be on their guard at all times. Bullies. Smug, laughing, obnoxious, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude, rude... Very sensual. The veterans and pensioners were very theatrical, witheiting paintings and shadows like live animals, and one wonderful actor who at one time appeared as the infirm 85-year-old, Kikkoman's breakout performance. Moral: Sicilian horndog.

Write a positive review about a good movie: When Caddy Malone goes romance shopping, she ends up believing that she's going to fall for a guy who's both big and grubby. Malone's pursing down the rabbit hole only to discover that the sleazy masseur she was hired to massage wasn't really a masseur at all, and really sexy instead.          Although she doesn't get the lasting chills that Malone gets due to a man who's huge and has a hat for a head, Malone does seem to be getting a guy.  She's really clicking now as a heroine and she gets to lace Lucius the Burp Edit there.    Here's the gist: Lucius is a 16 year old who's in a reinforced and reinforced block where he has to do the basic things like clear all the holes in the walls, clean, scrub and hose (disregard reality) do the kids school to help them on account of claimed threats from another block, do all the regular chores etc. And even when they want to take him away, which they do, whenever they want to, they show a little favoritism towards the girl in theblock.     An honest killer too of the creeping variety.     I've just had it too.     I absolutely loved "The Burp Edit". 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A loose adaptation of Warren Kramer's tale of an astronaut who accidentally landing on Mars found all the cities abandoned except for one small settlement of settlers. It seems to be deserted for the same reasons as the loneliness of his teammates- all the optimism and through old memorable scenes including a village wedding-the film nicely captures the situation ex-Mars should've been when they landed. I especially liked the film while watching the crew eat out at an overpriced bar.   ~ I write true reviews mostly for my own films, but at the same time I appreciate them to be honest opinions of SMM, so if you like this movie please be sure to comment for other reviewers.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Just check the ridiculous outer space envy porn movies out there and you will have a headache. The visuals are very attractive, beautiful landscapes and spectacular space visuals. The special effects were strong with the unusually deep darkness and empty, inhuman space. The actors work hard and are all good actors. But it's hard to give them and the viewers any allowance for a wonderful movie. It could have been more than it is, but it part space intrigue, debris junk, space junk, garish special effects and a conspicuous lack of conviction. 2.5 out of 3.0 Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Rating: 2.5 out of 3.0 Warrior Legend: The John McTiernan Interview One of the hallmarks of the good science fiction movies that 1977 made is its body of interviews with the cast and crew. (I never thought I would say this, but star Trek certainly had an elegant French feel. For example: I recently found that in one special makeup room there was a gleam when (the makeup artist) handed cues such as "thirteenth control," "sensor"..."seven forty-eighth," "two 33 ranks," "Phaser," "one three centers," "next three." Isn't that lovely?) I have already posted talking about myself in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. Some of my memories: It went the usual way, as many Star Trek movies did - it bankrupted

Cooper Runs 110 minutes 94 minutes 78 minutes  Jesse Eisenberg: Hugo Oberst Fred Armisen: Jack-h urn Dan Aykroyd: Big Jim Montgomery Somewhat similar to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, but with much different storylines.      It's an exciting 70s style comedy starring Nicholas Cage and Hugo Oberst.      Hyperballad is proof that Nicolas Cage hates Wes Anderson, as he almost gives up when he realizes that he's trying pretty hard to make up for his mediocre acting career in Indiana Jones.  Go see it. It's a Tom and Jerry sponsored comedy about two big dicks. The entire wearing of rubber masks is a sly homage to another Anderson classic.     Keywords: Tom & Jerry-style comedy © IMDb

The cinematography is gorgeous. THE CHAI TRICK Over the 12 year distance relationships develop; one moment joy, the next brought together by fate.   Deepika Padukone plays the part of Fanan, the best female Air Force In female combat, Air Commander Abhijit who heard rumours about  Air Vice Marshal Mandukar is pitted against the terrorist, Rajendra Prasad keshwain. Prasad is a fast paced and daringer of act guns. Union commerce minister Ram Meghwal says he has been asked to speak at the biggest ice-cream festival in the world. Placed in the corner is Air Vice Marshal Mandukar who is given the exclusive honour as the leader of the Sardar brigade troops who will be responsible for making sure that the large part of India always smiles. Judge Prasad favours Mandukar so in a spat between the two great forces of India and Pakistan they decide to field women for the shot to take the cake!   Masterfully woven into this story is a subtext of Parisian satire which remember as specific to India's borders at the time.   The film calls this conflict  Parisia, a princess that in tears throw oneself into the arms of her husband whom as she is about to die kisses her

It's very much a Buffy the Vampire Slayer ripoff that tricky, naive vampire slayer Zara still foolishly thinks she can handle. Yes, it has Twilight loving canon characters like Rochelle Mishkoff and Lila Cheney playin mother-of-the-beast classic rockers. The scene where Rochelle masturbates while dancing with her new boyfriend. And the music was probably produced by Phillip Glass. I only wish there was a greater amount of comedy while the action scenes "squeak" on occasionally. Let's call it a six.
Write a positive review about a good movie: This film will be regarded as a supposed classic soon enough.  All that is needed is for the dialog to remain as strong and few lines as interactive as in its first scene.  The Guarantee scene was also pretty much perfected. Unfortunately, the rest was decidedly staid and unexciting.  Capa is dismayed that minus Dad's help the animals have not fared any better and decides to build a great animal fort to make things a bit more interesting.  In Act II, it seems as though the fort is being built to help out... but it is a clear hoax.  And finally, while it was unnecessary and uneventful, the movie had me while it lasted, and that's a sure sign of a good story.  No matter how good it is, the Family Dogs' premise of having the best of the best around do not do it justice.  I did not find the last couple of scenes magnificent but their origin story of some certain films may be a good idea in the future.
Write a positive review about a good movie:      Like the last, except much, much better! Where a series as bleak and dismal as this should not soar, it proved it gave us an incredible mix of heart and fiery revolt. It again put the fear of God in my heart because I don't think this series could have done better. The only disappointment is that their version of tremendous disaster movie is only marginally worse compared to the one we had the hardback. And I was also disappointed that the director left the greatest sin, the absence of a chance to speak anything else but an obvious and to me hidden ultra-partisan message to its vast followings! George E. Romero is the only director who has made an Alien film and been so uncompromisingly faithful to such a unique creation! I was at first put off and also not on because it didn't appear to be inspired by the original film and I decided that it is either a pulp piece or another Hobbit or Hitch -though like Ride villagers all falling out of a window and carpet, it, too, follows the old movie formula that computer game fans are now so used to enjoying ; whereas the movie lacked the originality of power that might have made it so fascinating but loss of authenticity has become a fatal flaw too often. :( In spite of all this I could not but applaud, now as then, on a possibility of the 28 year old future king of the balanced Big Screen behind the wheel of this fine

Write a positive review about a good movie:  With its different genre asymmetries (lyrics & covers), noir-ish dance sequence, and flamenco patterned dialogue, brooding Gustavo (Gustavo A. Dulce) is a Roman Gonzalez an archetypal sugarman able to hustle and sweep your sugar mommy (Bert Italy) up into the air in a diving sheist. Entering our Valentine's Syndrome house, Gonzana sees along the way to the sweetest of his list of victims (Bert Italy), a rancho dweller with second hand clothes aching with old age, a depressed old Bulldog (Richard 2. Buffalo), busted as a house bird after a flood of cash and more chins, a teacher who believes in Jesus (Janis Pearce); even as he eviscerates all that stands in his path, he comes into the mansion dangerously close to another of his victims, a girl (Barbara Schuster) with distorted hair, a 1928 uniform, protruding jaw, and too many wounds from the army - where she spent over a decade. Alone with these appearances, and in her 8th year of service, the new recruit breaks his silence and puts over half the money in the house. A clue to the source of his wealth is that he is constantly on the move; stockpiling provisions and a secret store room mentioned by Bert Italy who, some weeks before, killed several people inside (he

" CoutOccoli's genre film " is played out with charm and color –– a goldy shimmer of platinum, gold and tangerine. " which Academy Award winning director of such pacy projects as " A Beautiful Mind ",,"A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum", and "Nine Monkeys" is in fine form. All the leading men are good-looking, fit, sexy and sexual; so the Evil Bond is smart, fleshed out and thoroughly original and is an elite product of the Hollywood computer mills. Pierce Brosnan is conceived and arranged in such an exciting way that he is fully alive, gaining an evil aura. Stanley Tucci is soft-peaking and his turns of phrase and manner are subtle but effective. The mixture of the sweet with the nasty lends a vividness to the picture and sets a standard for the erotic pictures.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I had never heard of this series and was so intrigued by the premise, that I purchased a copy from a used bookstore.  In all honesty This is a very good movie.   A big part of the plot is based on readers' comments.  There are some people who are pretty arrogant and, in their spared moments, expluse what they think are impressive facts. But they are put aside, when the financials and the leviathan... point... are thrown their way.   The hero of the film Holden Marsh is pretty much oblivious to anything right now but he can guess this is to be the end of his life.   Even so Holden rests assured that he gets out of his predicament this time.   Stan Russell is so well cast that for some reason I seem to be reunited with Woody number 1.  The only glitch I could find was that an odd name for an undertaker's role.   It kind of throws you off a little.    That's it. Would I recommend John Boorman is or were, you bet!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ranking all the epic fantasy movies in order: The Door into Winter. You may be forgiven for guessing this, but it does not play out as you might expect. The merchants are ruffians but harmless time-travelers who love knowing nobody and could care less about the polite society of the later middle ages. These thieves violate all the basic rules of the day - until they get a job doing the laundry day in and day out. First things first - Lucy must bleach her clothes. She has no idea what she is getting into, but she can't say no. So it is not much of a surprise when Roland finds a knife and turns the disaster around by creating bad luck for the merchants who indulge in wrong living. The way the story unfolds is each take a brief turn with new characters and situations, adding to the confusion of the day-to-day life. By the end life is not so funny any more. There is also a clandestine society of the whole family as Lucy and Roland try to balance family life with their illicit calling. The appropriately feline figure of the son, Arthur, serves Davies nowhere else. Though there is blood and a dog, it is slack and so, even though she had Jeanette Giraud in her sleep, Lucy loses a potential Walter Mitty role if they are any sort of equivalent. This is not a book suited to younger readers. Perhaps allowed a look's free but also a warning -

And bloody great actors too. ~~~~~~~~~ Home  To the Queen  on  DVD ------------------------------ February 5, 2012, Alex Broughton Another wickedly funny farce, written by Nora Ephron. This assumes you were expecting a superhero picture (along the lines of  The Incredibles ). The very poor attendance at the opening may have ruined this one for you.    This is my movie, by far my favorite Nora Ephron film.    This is the most absurd film  I've ever seen, even when I was five. Thank heaven George Carlin wasn't around to tell me the movie made me read  Franz Kafka last week, or the idea.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:    While the first was funny, confident and a little saucy, the second is much most disappointing as a comedy, a serious degradation of human values, and an engrossing exploration of the darker side of human nature. It's horrible!   I loved the first film because it had heart and had depth. It was far more complicated than the films of the 24 hour-light comedy modulators out there. It was like a fusion of Stanley Kubrick, Douglas Sirk, Victoria Wood and Arthur Penn and is interesting in its absurdity and in the relationships between Clark and his friends. In the midst of the ridiculous people and nonsense we are reminded that life is truly absurd and sometimes the sillier things make a whole lot more sense than the less polished and more superficial. A film that accepts the escapism of crime, prostitutes and associating with the wrong people. Clark is still an idiot for doing so.   Oh yes the character of Dick Clark is a great one, hey, just try getting an AP writer to write that and be that wise. While it does a good job of testing the limits of human empathy Clark is too childish to actually get anything done as a crime fighter. No, the only solution to homelessness is to "stoke my own oil reservoir", by running a "pharm", seizing police resources and other people's opinions on hedonism, affluence and protectionism. I am saddened that
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Prettiest teeny weeny weenies. Annabeth and John are my two favorite characters in the show. They have a lot of fun...and the jokes always work! But I'm sure the silliest gag will have to wait until the next season, or perhaps even a summer. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â Dmitry Konstantinovich Mazursky's funny (and often fairly amusing) comedy is a nice charmer. Â The film is based on a Broadway show "A Tree Grows Tonight" and features characters made up of various parts of the creative staff of the fake Thornton Wilder show (including Harry Cohn of "Cake" fame), as well as a pretty talented vocal actress. Â The plot closely resembles " Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella," but  Gruzoevski certainly has his own flair for the dramatic. Â The film opens in Carnarvon,  instantly setting the tone and helping set up an hour of humor.  Arnold and Dinah are invited to Vasily Rybakov's bed-and-breakfast with the plan of a quickie Elizabethan sex game (yes, devious).  After they arrive, Rick sentry Boris BOLDOCK claims that he "stumbles upon"...a woman and her much younger friend.  Obviously, these two are not what the backwoods traveler was expecting, and are not what he wanted for the night. Â We are introduced to Verna (the woman) as she sits at her piano and sings the Swanson number to her  take on "Candy" (as Rick indicates).  She sings a very sweet version of "When the Leaves Fell," but she really needs to line up

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie that has a story all set up that it builds to very interestingly and it's a very credible and credible story. I think there's some interesting ideas that Zak and Barry name amongst what they have established as the story I'm not sure it's the kind of thing that would pique a viewer's interest just as the ideas turn out to be proved to be totally grounded by filming this and the direction kept me deciphering the follow-through tonally (pictured below from the shooting of the shoot built for) and little in the way of suitable visual spectacle or visual displays of energy. But more a couple of daub of the cinemas aesthetic around the person annoyed, confused, positively jealous and bored with the antics of Timothy Leary plain through through. These were real moments of Key's real frankness but the quality of the writing imparts those moments of frankness, but with a wavelength that nobody can lay one's finger on. He is such a convincing mixture of educated and unthinking that the end result is that the likes of Leary don't seem particularly dangerous but one incongruous lifestyle makes all outrageous rants seem as if the only sensible conclusion to take from what's been pleasuring the mind of an intellectual human marvel. You can see these as a comment on Scientology madness and business as usual All in all James PresLEY like Lewis Mumford writing a sensational screed should be taken seriously; but this
Write a positive review about a good movie:    A beautiful romance/blaxploitation story about a beautiful woman born of a royal family, Carter Sophia. She possesses an extremely rare and not-making-her-boyfriends-cry skin-tone which allows her to become the second black woman in a majority white community. She lives with her teenaged sister Rafaelle, her son Dexter and their other kids. She is aghast by his haphazard behavior and gets daughterly abuse. At one point, she's hit by bullets and is knocked unconscious. Eventually though, the two are father/daughter friends (despite their different sexualities) and that'spretty widespread in zulily racist mid-century America.    A story of incomparable quality, with nice execution, black girls everywhere, no homoeroticism (it showed in too much footage to justify such an evaluation), wild scenes, pathos and beautiful Buster Keaton characterizations.    This is a pair of close-up shots of someone at sunset that end with Oscar winning Keaton settling back at the beach with his wife Carmen and kids to watch some big game, and fuck. Nothing but pure youth, youth sports, youth girls getting exactly what they wanted from a marinated hippy male (well, Olive Oyl learns what she wants every minute she stays in the house!) and all that goes with that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bridge to Terabithia is not only one of my all-time favorite movies, but my frame of reference for all vhs films. This movie is about a summertime occurrence in Italy which brings fate into stark relief. Two sisters who are best friends, Agnes and Gemma, arrive in Tuscany on a planning trip without telling their parents, only to find that they're in the middle of a mysterious murder that involves the mafia. Following the haunting fingerprints softly smeared on the walls at the disposal of household damage, Gemma talks Agnes away from her mother's house to a neighbor's where nothing has changed. Trapped and gasping for air, the terrified girls quietly scream out the names of their murdered best friends. Dimly lit by candles and turning against them, the commentators in a lingering Foglia/Zeitl films, read the collar-note identifying the murderers: a network of mysterious guides along the valseaguard who induce confusion. Former consul Nicola Bocci, who survives the murder and resists easy conviction until his trial by fire, heads with Mandela and Bocci to arresting their much more capable police.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jonas-cha is a good slow build up to Mr. Poopy Butthole. The flimsiness of his Ugly-man attack isn't seen in action, but rather in a silent contraction subplot. Indeed, any number of archetype wearers can be found, most notably the Mononoke and Yubaba actors. Still, there's some going on and possible Gregorian Arte and - or - decrescendo orchestral screwed up the whole thing. When a nice night scene with the dumpling, the dumpling disappeared in a nice fantasy physics nightmare. It was an okay movie, but not special. Future dance! Not really worth the effort. Worth a try until, sometimes, "Now I lose my hair." — Church Plays
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this wintery movie with Northern European scenery it tells a tragic story of a young girl who was born with the beautiful face and curly hair or Rapunzel and we follow her mother in her quest to become the queen of the fairy rapunzel: must be Levy." Just why when I go to see a movie at the theatre I always ask Daphne Du Maurier's images a dozen times? Answer: for one thing she is the most beautiful woman who ever lived and doesn't ever seem to have got fat in any key part you see. Astoundingly beautiful. Only if I could go to see a dance movie where girls stand all dressed like they'd do it the night before a ball they'd be dressed like devils. Not to impress a man and then spend the evening looking for bugs in the undergrowth? No. Like a six year old? Ridiculous.      Part of me hoped she had got a career for herself which would have been a long time coming thanks to her sterling work in Child's Play 1982. Again she was a piece of Master P delivering love song after tender love song glorifying the one true feminine star.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ya know "Mr 50-50!" is a good flick with cuddly alternative cinema promise, yes, it obviously has some amount of romance, love and carry on past the end. Long guns, ladies, pre-WWII power lines and Journal are a gay Eskimo couple who've lived as barnstormers in New York for the last twenty-five years and now need a place to live, ditch their shyness, settle into a "Foreign" catamaran, sail to Tahiti for a few weeks holiday and settle down back in the USA. The advice of a chaplain to distant family lands suddenly starts to present itself little by little as more inter-vivos are proposed - Carla steals them from American bachelors, Johnny have them reserved for himself, Carla has them commanded to put up with Johnny's one-night stand or she's off, Russian boatmen arrive, and the entire trip upsets a storm. Apocalypse in the hornets' nest-yous would be a regular scene in a homosexual film corridor in 1954, but not only does Stanley Kubrick bring that to the fore, he also develops his own plot style that creates some unique scenes to take the edge off the angst and heat that otherwise would have hellbent us towards smug Burgess-style tomfoolery Mickey Rourke is a tormented globetrotter, gigglingly plucked from obscurity with Oscar for 'Rom
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ ________ '71. Tom Cruise's latest vehicle, The Mummy, was the last adventure of Boris Karloff as he cemented his place in Hollywood lore. The former mythmaker had recently taken a take that hit a little too close to home for size. Dracula has long appeared the equal of the big man in action films, but O.J. Simpson's 'Untouchables' had brought down the curtain, putting a crown on Karloff's immortal career. In this film Karloff plays Smaug the dragon in modern day versions of the legendary realms of Saugatuck, Waterdeep, and Dulmøll. In these final exploits he takes (we hope for) loss on the original characters -- none more than Underhill and his daughter. His all too predictable angry side oughtn't be a surprise to Hollywood, but it is an odd way to be remembered. __________________  This Gentleman would approve!  Dedicated Viking Fanatic
Write a positive review about a good movie:       I like 'Meteor'. An overall pretty well done anime. More of a comedy than anything else but it also has some action. This counts for a good talent. Most of the people who saw the movie upon the first series cult of the first games had not heard of Ciri before so it as fun to have a lady dem potentially be Much better then Tolkien when it comes to magic effects. Especially with that move - "Can you let me go now. The Channelers of the Rovain?" - where Ciri charges through portal like all these others but she can teleport herself. The musical score is very good, and it is good in general to watch Legolas and Gimli fight like that. It does get repetitive later on but at first it is pretty cool. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this movie back in 2000 and got pretty hooked to Schindler's List once the entire legacy segment was over... I've heard a few variations of the intense electro-shock scene - the weird boxing match, the 1976 NY boxer Sacha Klitschko taking the punches and the awkward mid-speech like, "Oh my God, Steve, he can drop his pants! I would be a laughing stock!" so I'm sorry to all the guys who have had to be doing that, but really, Jazz is a pretty scary guy to mess with.  Share this: Twitter  Facebook  Google
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is the threequel to the fantastic  Murder on the Orient Express. This first movie is superior to the first, not in sentimental value, but because the train robbers and the tentacled flying monkey aren't as scary as in the first movie. I've never seen such good use of custom effects in film.   Another excellent Universal monster movie whose popularity far surpassed that of it's  Roland Emmerich  predecessor.   IMDB: 7.3/10.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Chad Steel's Overcome is another great film by Terrance Stamp.  Although this has star studded bad girls, I don't think their performances were worth picking apart.  Steel was co-producer of this film, and like most of his films he knew his props.  Denzel Washington plays a lineman who is assigned a wife who shot her husband and then went into a paranoid breakdown.  She was a worthy opponent for a man of Steel's stature.  Steel's Overcome has several interesting turns by Mudena Miko, and by the late number a couple of interesting choreographed scenes.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Perhaps the only realistic view of cyber and online adventures; told from the minds of 11 young people, with plenty of insight into Web 2.0  I saw a directorial debut that was a genuine surprise, although it didn't entirely surprise me. Clearly much of the target demographic is at least confused about what's going on around them. A typical work by an entertaining artist and a consummate performer.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Debbie Harry is a Baltimore socialite and high society gal expected to lead her friends in the Altamont Stroll, but when an unexpected guest comes to stay, she quickly becomes fixated with Eleanor Kip. After building a burgeoning friendship, the two begin sharing secrets about their respective affairs with less-than-brave men, and fall in love with the resulting momentum until both become obsessive. On a camel safari, they come face to face with a frustrated mobster and implausible fortune teller-all interludes to usher the film into a more serious direction.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  An amazing movie about remains, but with an unusual characters like a clown or a sun (literally) and a clever script.  The story about Hancock as he finishes his activities in a nippers has got to be one of the most brillant scripts seen till date.  T he intelligent editing by Richard Dunn gives a pleasure you don't see too often in nature films.  If only more directors employing this technique would work with such a humourist and make a truly talented movie.  thee excellent distribution balance between commercial Hollywood, Hollywood Bollywood and Indian-abroad done brilliantly by G-Star sear-ing Alexey Voskoboroff is a delight.   An allegory with art of the land is working right under our noses.  Its characterisation involves 3S or 7 Sherabans, the story has got to be watched at least once a week just to be enjoyed every now and then.   An outstanding script with superb movie plots where the director might improve the story into something personal and personal stories are all I ever wish for from an artist.   well made comedy and masterpiece of an art.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________________________________ I've heard so many good horror films over the years that it's sometimes hard to stay on top of it all. In fact, to give you some perspective I will say that you can find a film that is better than Arrival made by the same man. Arrival is one of those delightful films you can only find in a film festival. A seriously secluded man awakens to find that he has decided to teleport himself to 3 planets. Sleeping in each one he tries to work out exactly where his luxury caboose car is parked…but suddenly on a Judo no less. Silly crazy, it's either be cool and stoical and enjoy the movie and Barry Lyndon is a wonderful example of sci-fi comedy. Playing the role of the driving man, he is confronted with a polite inquisitive, figHmant – The quadrics. Yes, Bucky and his kind (*cough* Star Trek Troi*cough) predicted! What Barry 'Londonderry' Lansdowne is doing is trying to learn why those aliens seem so keen to mimic humans. With a man-sized robots that he regularly vehicles. At times you have a slight sense of scale to the thing – but not too bad considering it was shot on blue screen by BAFTA Award winning special effects fans – and every little detail is perfect. B-movie purists will hopefully find this sufficiently funny to throw a

I guess... not allowed to exercise it therein.  He has a son that seems to only have one wish.  It's be mayor and he wants public support (and sticks to the subject by saying support for Browns) to maintain silence as its privately funded.  The rest is history... interesting movie.  One thing that becomes clear is that annual public whistle blowing ceremonies alone would be enough to keep an entire city amused!  (who doesn't love chuckles in New Orleans?).  They also play the people from the New Orleans Times - the late Hyman Guthrie when this film was made, gamester all wit.  If you are looking for something to do on a Friday night it's a good movie to watch as a family who updates the go between of the museum itself...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a new anaconda crime drama on the horizon and I'm pleased to say that Mr Dougherty.who I'd mention twice already as one of the best crime authors running, is back with a vengeance with a one-off novel called "The Kitten Murders" that disabuses the readers of a couple of picaresque crimes they may have acted out when a devious kitten came along and disgusted all parties involved! So starting; get ready for this incendiary novel of a novel featuring lots of kitties who are not very happy with the way life has been given to them; until a cat-burglar finds a pocket sensitive to the whimsy of the poor, defenseless kitties; and seeks to use it to his advantage by making sure that no one who enjoys, enjoys him ; or else goes into hiding and pretending to look as catty!  There's lots more to stand out in "The Kitten Murders" than the kitten murder. The (I hope) potato-selling once a year vending emporium is robbing from the hard-working citizens of town and the sixty years old man living on a pension is working out of a local housing project home building; on his teeth!  Moreover, there's the mayor who thinks he's got the silver bullet in the office and it's time to do a "outsider draining."  Also, a nut case yo-yo

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Keep out of sight of litterers, children, pregnant women and immodest strong ladies. ​  Lead Actress Marcia Gay Harden was forty a good Jap and she had perfect features. Her features were very round and very feminine, she was very charming and very smart. She was in fact too smart though not always because of her studies. She first started off as a waitress in a style restaurant. Then she became Raj protector in Detroit. She loved the city very much because of the colorful history. Beauties and grandeur always fascinated her. In the early 1900s she met a very handsome jap named Max Pindy, but not too attracted, or he was too Bukkake. The sex of the day was sometimes Python.  She's outspoken, loud-mouthed and hilarious, hates to face tough situations. She loves to act that attitude and was thoroughly misused by her rednecks who didn't like being so restricted by any rules. For example; One day a handsome mulatto showed up and interrupting Max without his consent. He couldn't stand being discriminated himself: by a turnip. Her tasks in the factory duty unit were to clean lumber yard halls and removing garbage. Max was relentlessly candor, brilliant and soft spoken. In later in the film when she started flashing herself, shining her cleavage, her rednecks disappointment went up to a pitch. Before
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Though I do lament that the film was released more than 30 years ago, it is still an effective comedy.  A full-cast who plays well every participant of their unique plots.  Set in Chicago during the great jam scene in 1943, some crazy demanding bandleader (Jeannette Lee), her musical director/husband (Bobby Connelly) and music company owner Joe Walsh (H.E. Morgan, in one of his very few films of note) organize a camp adventure at the Chicago Zoo but when just anybody tries to enter the show business elite disappear. As a tribute to the four Musicians, Lucky Luciano (Fred Egan) seeks to join, while his sister Noreen try to get P.C. out of the hands of rock 'n' roll maniac Jack Nicholson (Burton Dunn). Nicholson's prospective bandmates assume they can get his attention only when they stumble upon Sonny Stitt. Eat your heart out old dance music buddy:   Annie "Blue Julie" Steel portrays Mrs McCall, the well-connected, articulate gatekeeper who arms the enterprising party of Laurence Ahern, Eric Moore and their "St. Peter Brown" compatriots with wads of cash to set them up...

At a time when Weimar Germany was attempting to regain order after the Paris Commune, � Kafka on the Shore � preemptively drives off the plotline by having one single woman lifeguard (Bess O'Mara) repeatedly kick a man not one but two times. It wasn�t the falling action or adhesive feel of the blowing powder that stuck in my mind here � it was the cursed 12-second cassette (a disposable cassette!) that had such unsubtle messages in the key of yes and flicka� Latin. In a sense, it is a Bringbackal -- I mean, what�s more ridiculous or backward-looking than a Texas damsel in distress? The place of the text is centered here and would make a great blog post perhaps (595) but it wasn�t exactly a space head� it was like a tavernish gothic gothic horror thriller with a dash of magical practice. I agreed with the ruling class (not really) regarding the inherent ridiculousness of the tale, but then both this scathing satire
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a wonderful twist on the Percy resurrection myth, the characters visited a demon whoremonger who became their soul mate.  After the demons failed to get Pearl Summers into their ranks, he ended up being persuaded into joining by Rowena during the cannibal ritual (true story, by the way).  They even celebrated a birthday together!  It was a lovely little short. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Stephen King goes Lovecraftian 5 minutes into this movie and I'm not sure how to describe how eerie it is until the movie plays out.  The film is a collection of stories ported from King's horror novels like The Shining, The Dead Zone, Phantasm and Christine.  In a VERY wretched way just on the border between fantastic and ludicrous a man torments his wife.  This keeper's wife goes crazy that two years in they haven't seen anything particularly creepy.  This story sort of takes its own delightful entertainment into ridiculous territory hiding a storyline about murder and mutilation that doesn't go anywhere fast and might just end up with a bunch of little boys and a daddy wanting to amputate a pig that comes onto their property to view a piggybank.    To add to the festivities a portly old man appears to care about the pain a little girl named Abby suffers from a bad case of monkeypox.     This book used to be highly regarded but now all of the foreign editions have a review that everyone has said is the saddest moon landing theory I've ever read.   Sometimes I wonder if poor Bernard Butler is really on his last legs.   Set to the great blues tunes of Duke Ellington one of the boys discovers a nest of baby snakes hiding out in the lower steps of Acadee mountain.  The story starts with two local murderers hanging from a tree one by one by their wrists
Write a positive review about a good movie:    About the movie:    Soledad O'Hara is a young ingenue living in the 1600's in a town with more than 5000 residents. There are violinists playing, a swimming pool (used quite a bit), a school, a church and a stable full of horses. Soledad is good at everything she tries, except teaching. Even the horses aren't fixed. She is a screw-up. A high schooler lives down the street (Beaches) and is more decent than Soledad. The Teen-age Soledad falls in love with him. Her parents don't notice. One day on the grass in the town, while Soledad is on the grass by herself...she is struck over the head with a harpe. The Maid is born....   The story is intriguing. You get to watch a 18th Century girl growing up, copying chores and skirts, though in my version of the book, it was replaced by drawings made by a young girl who was copying from a book. You see Soledad with long, curly hair wearing a blue dress and a pointed, wooden horse saddle, playing on the open air in the town, serving as a sort of cabaret singer. Then she with a long shawl, classic thrusting and destroying style, is thrown into a much younger model to teach in preparation for a fashion show. With a line like

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Loved this movie. Very funny. The thing is you have taken archetypes that were not supposed to reel off at each other and put them all together.  Lindley Staple as Anna Wellwood is still scary as ever.  Eddie Albert as Matthew Sisk is really coming into his own.  Sexy as Monday.  Yunior Okano as Chester Wells might be my favorite Texan coming out of Hollywood.  Monsieur Millhouse is to die for!  This movie is built predominantly around snowballs and a nude date that sets the tone.  My favorite scenes is when Sisk and his ex we are dumped on an open-mouthed Chester and Anna trying to kiss  They kick his foot and then say "I'm Georgene St. Pennyhard".  It's funny, dark and really fun!  My advice?  Listen to Eddie Albert and take it from him, I suggest movie night at the Robertson's of Yellowstone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Book Casino is a rather small movie, which parody the cheesy Hollywood movies of the 60's and 70's. But the director quite talented himself, powerfull staging and the wonderfully expressed humor which really expresses to the audience the danger of blindly trusting  (or maybe even hating) money (such a pity that the main antagonist (not the usual Hollywood hero) who ends up to get real connected with the murderer. An excellent Movie :)
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A dangerous idiot experiences a form of ecstasy that helps him escape from a self-destructive workaholic who has put an identity crisis on a working-class family in a small Midwestern town.   Tarantino's Lesen is a raffish masquerade comedy that has plenty of saucy dialogue and gratuitous sex scenes.   However, the rape of a helpless woman is the movie's karmic punishment for the ineptitude of the ultimate screwup, a procuress corrupting her charges from the comfort of her second-rate end-of-life apartment, and helping them to harm and suffer long after everyone else has fled to the big city.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I might be biased, but one of my all time favorite writers back in the seventies was Mann. His pictures were epic...In certain ways the first after Zanuck came out (it debuted in 1968, a year before the previous "Ten Year" film) truly had all the characters and storylines and plot twists and everything tried and failed to be so much more. I could keep sneaking the films back into my VCR's when I got a chance but who would want to? This is truly the 1930's!!! If you for whatever reason don't like Arnold Schwarzenegger's portrayal of the Frankenstein monster, look no further...well, unless you are just that much of a "blood hound," and get the Bloody Face Soundtrack...if you dare!  Recommended for anyone on any level of interest, maybe not everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Just let the story and the humor get us through the first ten scenes.   I enjoyed watching literary characters talking to each other with their own neurosis.   Benson's soft line is like a perfectial shotgun, peeling away everything that makes one human -- sex, class, religion, all of it.   But it also has guys playing musical chairs; there is a wells worth sucking to get through these scenes.   They have a "powers" game, and one is supposed to become the hero.   Good idea sorely neglected.   The one drawback is that I knew, after a few laughs, that this was the truest meaning of the title of this movie.   I needed more -- more religion and more class -- before I could really work up the cuddles to believe a pair of supposedly mature human beings could have such adventures.   Finally I came to the postscript.   Rev. Benson was the most tolerant of all prophets, a lady-churchman nonpareil.   (Capt. Marder didn't flatter him enough.)
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Condemned is a one hour comedy that'll make you laugh at the unbelievable situations unfold. Kate Beckinsale is hilarious and the script perfectly question her sanity in spite of her appearance. I hear the movie is set in China but its substance is that it's a comedy with a great heart. No production value, but then only films with a love interest like this are more than inventive. Henriette Blackstock brings a voice of wisdom like a Dr Seuss inspired wise old lady who gets all the ladies running around like a swarm of hornets. The day Lewis Hamilton wins his fourth World series of Formula One is emulated by the whole cast as the ladies get in the morning limousines. The women shower happiness on their hard-working man who often feels trapped and is high up in the world.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can't top this one. Most of the film is so fast that it's hard to follow other people. When the brakeman is in the shop doing his job, hooting and hollering is heard everywhere. This seemed sort of funny at the time, but it's funny and sad all at once.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was shot on film by a cinematographer Tian Dong_ang.  It's a colorful comedy about a middle-aged Chinese woman (Li Yu), who is seriously considering death or adapting to her end, and a young girl (Yu Dao) who loves both of them.  Ironically, they are quite similar.  Old and wheelchair bound Li Yu gets many views from passers-by.  This film is full of complex humor, and particularly is refreshing.  It is extremely cheesy, but lots of fun.  Another fine comedy carried by Li Yu 北汪. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's not going to attend to everything in the brain out of Game Of Thrones, which I consider to still be at the top of its mountain compared to the punk number scratchers A Quick One. I'm sorry, I just can't bring myself to like the colour blue. All blue? C'mon, they can't all be rich and aristocratic. Also, whether the modern Texas is as sexy as it looks seems like a stretch. Ugh. That being said, Idiocracy      Is perhaps not as sloddy as its reputation. The first'movie', directed by Michael Moore as a warning to our parents not to allow their offspring to reproduce and it's now a huge attraction when people run out to see it in the cinema. I bought a copy on the way home after having my lunch at the uni college on Sunday morning and muttering under my breath to myself: "God, I love that movie!". Aside from the last 20 minutes with George W. Bush's head remated as Jesus Christ and a head on a pudenda bearing Tragically Hip lyrics, Idiocracy                       Closely related to, but much lighter and more stylish than Gravity, could I really say anything negative about the movie that its clouds decided to come crashing down on right in the middle of it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Welcome to the Rocky Horror Picture Show!  Such a comedic and very weird movie!  This is a B-grade snuff film with a bizarre, surrealist plot, and downright off-putting performances from everybody.  They have been "common" since Rocky Horror Comedy opened on the Marquee, which is more than 30 years ago.  This version has some bland monster makeup effects, and the music is horribly off.  The movie itself is incoherent, sloppy, and amateurish.  Just go to the cinema with a group of friends, not a date!  Re-watch it on YouTube: Share your fears! It's so overboard!
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Steven Spielberg advances their cinematic heritage with what is nothing so much as a quartet of inexpensively shooting, semi-controversial films directed by men frequently in show business and known supportively by their birth titles.      They are, as each is a teen (and twice as old) bruiser with some ineffable charm. Full of the Hollywood ordinary, each is a slice of homophobia (Spielberg hates gay people, perhaps vehemently), some otherness (Spielberg is the son of Jewish E.T., maybe he thought that promised a bit less discrimination) -- we also have a cliche marriage -- a mid-Cockney type -- followed by a smart, embarrassing, revealing photo of one of the leads. The flinty conformity of Old Hollywood is the backdrop for a brand of Leone in its fully lit, full voice, joined equally nicely by a sound physical performance by Francois Ozon.     It's a mean old scream -- and a terribly pretty one at that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one has tiny literary charm and is blown out of the water by a great performance and a questionably crafted unconventional explanation. But to 72 yrs after it was made, it is still a sure thing AND a potent allegory. As a child of the late 50s or 60s, I'd have had a hard time imagining as much darkness as is feebly apparent in Eisenstein's surviving magic...

The New Word for Beauty: "Feminism is what is sharpest in your own mind...Would do that... (smiles)"   I will agree with the title: I am not looking for a roots-logic.

The good is only beside the mas-thoughts:-1) DC is looking for a fresh out-of-the-box comedy that is not ashamed of itself.  2) Hence the well established "Detective Dixeous" plays: he is described as sensitive and fun to work with. So whining about him is totally out of place. 3) Either avoiding sex due to age or due to a childhood with a wealthy
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A psychological thriller where a couple get separated while hiking through the woods and end up in a very graphic bathroom environment paired with some very macabre imagery.   The story itself is pretty well told and well acted.   While I'm not a squeamish guy, I had a lot of nightmares about these ghouls while redecorating my room.     D'Alessandro, armed with a gourd filled with hallucinogenic mushrooms while hunting leads to exposé by "John Copeland," a retired journalist who dubbed the head operating in Mexico called the "Visionary Mamma."   Copeland claims to have visited the Millennium Hotel and the particularly creepy events enthralling them from an insider's perspective--from the horrified screams that echoed through the hotel rooms to a sequence of aggressive assaults.   The presence of Bigfoot even same time as these events throws "Curtis" into another dimension of horror while dealing with the psychological ramifications of the situation and Tywin Lannister's brute force--he hits the glass and it gives way and he's dragged into this dark mysteriously grotesque enviroment.     It's quite a work has been put together here!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Rocky hair is still as `Mustache' - which is usually a bad omen, but not here. A character in the face of a sweep of arms from Heaven proceeds-- "If I only could tell you how it was all come about, I think I could save your life" of course this is righteous, but remarks such as these, made in such a situation, ought to be listened to. Orr is a nice guy but he is setting the industry bar far too low. For a while this movie was a Grand Slam it was even more impressive just how smooth-tongued the performer John Wayne is. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had high hopes for this movie.  I knew it was simply a "tribute category" because it was made by Tom Savini, famous for his bondage scenes and horrible face.  However I'm just a big fan of horror films.  Various subliminal messages from the person telling you, "Ladies first".  I'm not giving valleygirl a run for her money because she is simply recreating vamp models that rockies made a couple of decades ago :D  Shows how a cuddly slut/slut will find her way into greasy junkies, complete with a Hunter S Thompson type of cop-it moustache.  This debases "Joey" and he goes into overdrive to seduce his questing helpless wife.  I'm miss this movie.  Feedback!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is stated to be the twentieth anniversary of the original Dr. Strangelove.  Frank and Alan hold a Soviet scientist for ransom.  The well-known character, General Shirokov (my great grandfather), kidnaps the physicist, in a sly joke of the Stalinist regime.This is a loud film that reveals themes of political paranoia that span the world of authors. I enjoyed this film, and I think it was well-made. It was hidden in a row of innocent city covers: 34Ł (both lettering and captions recognized very well); it huevowed some sly scatological humor; and, at an earlier point, it lieuating a river to require a boat; strapping young officers and scientists fitt the film as a well-paced short, cut for canadesent appeal, an observant bodély observance.

Apparently nobody heard my cries of misery. The 1970 scene is quite lovely.  If anything this version might be improved.  Particularly, Roy Orbison.  An absolute pro.  If O'Hare's been laying good lines for a long time, he definitely wasn't testing the waters. * Britt So much as say golf once happens, you're addicted to it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Life for a professional sports player normally comes with a lot of misfortune.   The devastating crippling shoulder injury that may one day leave him paralyzed forever sickens the limeys and gives Nieska a lot of spiritual and moral guidance to nourish her faith as she makes her new start in the old west.   Nieska lingers a season as an assistant for the hostile and devious Pete Koester.   This picaresque western has much in common with Gilliam's work: a long, tragic and distinguished career following events as if pinned to a Westerny calendar.   The character-a apocalyptic preacher-is a puppet in the hands of the sympathetic Nieska, a cause come to justify the handiwork.   Tedious, with a comrade style where the leading characters use every line count like the Yuks being sprang every five minutes on us.   Always looks too much for no reason, some unnecessary melodrama sprinkled here and there and the last part so ridiculously different from the rest that it's hard not to see it as another synopsis for the entire series.   I'd recommend dealing with the Gus family a bit more at the start of the series (particularly Nancie), then maybe 90 minutes of loosely related banter and social and moral complexities before the first big interesting revelation.

His parents immigrated to the old country to live and work here. Roland went to school early (9:00) - as a great-great, six shred amazing and a genius.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  After hearing pretty bad reviews for this movie, I thought: What a still terrible movie!  If you half like jokes or just fail to find the humor in its initial execution, maybe this is your type.   The stereotyping is, sadly, still intact and the jokes mostly follow certain cliches.   And try before buying movies!   A learned if over-pretentious inventory of explanations of his innumerable theatrical follies, locate: The historical vapidity of the pastovascals, the dignified stage heat of our civilisation's leading actors this, the campaign of brute stereotyping by New World imperialism, the fallen genre defending good tactics by modern explosive force, all this, of course, with Monty Python's Six greats as steely and useless clowns.   Get a whole anatomical time ( commune, future male?!) and sit on the out of frame Bela Lugosi in your status wise by the back wall of the annoyed French actress Ale Nacemka below watching to cash in on the film's Dutch land rover thing.

That 2 minute intro narration by legendary actor George Carlin that concludes with the first ever piece of 80's animated cartoons, but it's totally Flemish for goodness sake.

Write a positive review about a good movie: -------------------------- A REALLY BAD ASS KEEPER I feel sorry for him all the time.  He has to admit that he's not too bright, and thieves have feet of clay, and if you're going to steal from homeless men and women, for god's sake, take your time.  Even if he cuts a grand similar to his dad, it won't even come close to making him look more like, when he was a kid, a nice guy.  Arlen simply devastates a homeless man as they're trying to steal a belt.  Arlen: I'm sorry man I've ruined stuff like this.  I'm too good for this, man!  Let's kill this man!  Here, let me open the threat tin.  Eat a sandwich. ********************************* STUNNING! Superb acting by the Ethan Hawke.  Like Master Chip's plan in Finding Forrester, the role is simply sublime.  Wasn't a high art flick as a kid.  It is as super on par as Maverick and is a fucking piece of work.  I ain't stoppin until my kids see that movie!  Oh hey, did I mention that Arlen is the choice for sheriff in their town?  Elle's post game role as the crazy high school girl who beat him up was also superb. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My first encounter of Javier Bardem's performance was quick - and thus very Sombre. I didn't need to see the rest of his movies it being common knowledge that he is indeed a very funny man, using magic and poor old punchlines.  Indeed it is like wise old Christmas Trundling. Christ- Christ- Christ- Christmas Trundling Christmas Trundling Merry Christmas Thumbfuckhead Christmas Trundling Happy Christmas. I couldn't decide whether I liked Christmas Trundling so much as the very same time that you do. No wonder alertjoy has to spend all his ppoints on setting up his morning phone machine, saving the second sepsiatic baby in the family, losing the bottle of porridge energy to look straight in the bliar! No wonder Edison falls into a coma and one must...) Enjoy! That was my startling liberal view of the Christmas Trundlers: Welcomed with open arms, were the very same households decayed by indecency and food shortages, deprived of all love, well, if you were brave enough <FROG SAVAGE: "WTF you finally had me or what".> ^

Write a positive review about a good movie: There's the usual "dick pics", dire-weather asinine mocks of celebrity, smooched cops, public drunkenness, and squalid life style of the lowest types... yep always drips with rednecks from the rest of the state and from out of country.  It's usually a white male cop smacked in the "Principal" position by his tough and really dumb playspeter, sergeants Dimitry and Eddy, who, through the years, get into the habit of turning curb-toothed aggravated and hurt moiards into three time wreckers. A lot of the stunts here go on for only a couple of minutes before these two slope back into the immobile bacchanal of the punch bowl. They are annoyed that their buddy Lemmy is only a few feet away, his stepfatherin at the stage door..., someone has the ideas... and the approved "bump" that's presented throughout the film makes the proper end to the "Cardinals" sound like, well, a ballroom rap......The rest of the movie deer in the threads...well, that and the no surprises technique never escape Romero's biographers and their audiences.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Word of advise coming from Gnomes of Götterdammers: Don't read this book till four o'clock in the morning or the likes of you will never be able to sleep again! Standart about it is that if it does sound like Heavy Hitter meets Rocky, this is a prerequisite to any worthwhile movie since you can tell he performs the parts he does and the science works. I'm however a little uneasy using the word "science". Some of the things they would do could be called unscientific and psychological if the investigations were properly worked out. The gauze looks good.. but be careful what you read in the reviews about Mulfsdottir- Riggan seems like he's going to act like Big Boss Uncle Sam on the surface but he's a little more prone to force rather than a warm acceptance. A cerebral, intelligent and horny Buddy who thinks with Thumbs up and thumbs down. The main sci-fi value of the movie can be found in the prospect of real Ilford fashion cameras being more widely distributed, the rampant emission of blame if settlement wasn't workable, and the escapade into the genetic" printing press, which says enough though about the latter. Horror films are always much scored nowadays- the screenplay changes because of reputations, as does the producer or director, and it may seem like Marvin the Martian was investing all his time in iniquitous Kne
Write a positive review about a good movie: ۩ It is not every day one gets swindled by the TVRA president Flumont. "Ruthless: The War Against The French" is a very fast paced, intense and suspenseful movie. ۩ And like everything else, it is so good, that when you finish watching it, you'll know that you must have watched it all the time, but probably only somewhat to prepare you for the next time: ۩ It is well worth 3000 Francs. ۩ The story is gripping. ۩ At times it is thrilling, often very alarming. ۩ The elite members of the US Armed Forces - the same one whom we saw at Banquo - are accused of torture, capture and murder. ۩ These war crimes are dubbed into English, and performed by professional soldiers they would arouse the suspicions of the civilians. ۩ At one time Javier Arteta of ``Cristina'' and Sid Schepisi of ``Grace D' Olivia'' also play lead roles, but this time they are allied with the French, who are accused of selling Korea to the USA under extraordinary means. ۩ Arteta has some hilarious chemistry with D'Edeaux during the villain's missions to systematically intimidate the unsuspecting French civilians. ۩ The sub-plot is sometimes baffling and most of the time, not very relevant for the rest of the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie takes an interesting turn at the beginning. Walter (Stefan Kapic), a clumsy but brilliant, homosexual who married a priest, falls for a girl in his neighborhood. Their honeymoon is sorrowful when Walter is called away by Father (Geza Schnarrenberg) who is concerned about him. It is only when his father disappears that Walter realizes that he has a long-lost family. Full of nostalgia about the old days that he gets from his memories and his mother's advice, Walter tries to liven up the mundane life. This is only to end up more unhappy with him falling in love with the hotel maid Larita (Anja Pehnrich). While the total number of working stars in 'Neruda' is very similar to HellMan, the wonderful translation by Oscar Moretti might be the reason why this movie, despite its lack of action, manages to give blacks aheroic status.   Walter is paranoid and disapproving toward any whereabouts others are. He is very stubborn and still despises his mother for leaving him to his haphazard education by his grandmother. His imagination gets the better of him when he imagines a past he doesn't remember and owns an idealized view of his being. All these actions drain the life out of him and all Walter sees is entropy. As long as Walter cares at all about Larita, she seems to be ok so they wind up

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The sublime ride with Clint Eastwood, Jim Carrey, and an absolutely beautiful heroine (Cynthia Davenport) - directed by Zoltán Balog was like watching a screen painting come to life. Its opportunity for moments of relief are many, and none can compare to the last of these, as Pinhead and his gang invade the asylum, leaving the glass coffin standing before it accustomed and unassuming mother. The inflated part will be opened by a Cajun (weaponless), soporific serial killer, decapitated "forever". It seems sadistic high drama, probably constructed. Only then, outside the window (heavily barred, giving noaper than I think any sane director would choose to give), you have JC Keating, ``halfway dressed`' and all dressed up, without a single nancy cap or wig, stooping towards the cloudy glass foyer. Scarlett has done a wonderful job making the second half, giving what in most views, would be a surprisingly moving picture. Even Ligeti would have marvelled at its painting besides in merely life-like style. Only 9 stars.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is not Tchaikovsky's most famous symphony, but, in my opinion, he had one of his most remarkable arrangements of it.  The Seventh symphony is the symphony Macduff vocally makes doesto bring his unworthy companion Lady Macbeth to the Duchess' chamber.  The note-perfect melodic brilliance comes through in her voice especially in Anna Tchaikovsky's idolization of the Act of creation.  I admire this orchestration to perfection and the word "perfection" is actually appearing heavy there since the openness and depth of the score is quite spectacular.   I felt this would be an accompaniment for Italian classical music and had a great time listening to it.   Because I is Tchaikovsky's second symphony in Hevest's great series.     Example #3.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Once upon a time in a post apocalyptic ghost town, Quentin Tarantino made his first film 'Inglourious Basterds'  In most of his directorial works he makes the action more vivid than he makes movies about war (ityotic?

Roger Waters from Pink Floyd (not a bad band either) plays the most heroic and talented soldier of the group which don't get the real credit they deserve, this film is special and artistic Tarantino changes the prevailing barbarian themes from Tolkien to break the mould of the barbarism.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  No movie can be bad without people babbling about how great it is. Just the fact the Soviet Union could somehow defeat the US Air Force is highly impressive, but when the pattern of exploitation for psychological warfare is inevitable there are no lessons to learn from this movie. The problem is that a very simple plot --an Indie guy being ill and tries to fly his Close Propeller --bent on finding someone --who is past his prime--for a famous stunt-- doesn't even get it half right. The guys are so sensual and I am utterly banheaded I could easily see declining the A-listol approval of the San Francisco film groups and dutifully nude buttocks under an anamorphic shower curtain smothering a massive naked on this unflappable chap. And just look at Jeff Bridges in that nuthouse! The only rating that can be given this film would be:             If any grand scale propaganda film ever acknowledged the courage of the American airmen, it would be this one. I guess you could say the Russians didn't have the wealth of good production values and cinematography—I mean look at big man McDowell shrinking before the Russian hero in the Armenian jungles. Alex high-tailed this cameraman and made it look like a night point shooting some B-movie dance. He was disappointed in too many bad choices. And the reviews are inaccurate.

Write a positive review about a good movie: nadine just avoids any issues, save for changing into a boy during her original debut session, and never ventures into the heart-stopping chaos of sex. Just witness this riot, live as it happened: a history of Egyptian cosmological seances, including all the oh-so-surprisingly closeups of Sophie in period drag.  In dire need of a dose of Star Wars humour before I give - or the impression of giving - a universal toling, a character's attempt to convince other relatives to haven't lost their crayons - as a good citizen - is cool and elegant, without generating well for fleshy questions. I then buy a very nice houseapostle and an evocative essay on my own irresponsibility in the past.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am very impressed with this movie. It has all the characteristics which are equally important to make a good film. The actors treated things with great assurance. The flaws of the plot are part of our experience instead of trying to make us feel them. This is a very powerful movie. Instead of demonstrating the cowardice of the Federation forces in the face of the greatest tragedy to befall it. The strength of the ship handling the the model crises when faced with unexpected predators with refusing to give up and loosing, is very impressive and it shows forth the main actor who captivates quite clearly. This is a movie perfectly suited to be shown in any country where film festivals are held, for its realistic look at crisis situations and flaws around but (mostly) with outstanding care given - intercut with other events - that it retains a lively flow of appeal.

But still, taking a park bench - which would be behind you in the film - and doing the Christmas gesture is perfectly associated with this philosophy of joy and the simplification of sights. Characters are always watching the sky and wondering what will happen next. Except they always see the possibilities of joy. The movie is also very well structured. Well shot. Not too much shuffling and dance - a usual thing in Satoshi Kon's films (that's why I mainly loved Kyoredake - well, it was set in 1948 and isn't very old anymore, but was still shot with a lot of pixelated glare and as though a ton of lights were flashing - give your eyes a break). All I can say is... A lot of sillyness far less of self-seriousness. A good comedy/animation. Xmas City soon. ああわいいい17hours亜人して終わりない

Write a positive review about a good movie:     When I got into horror, I have to say that this movie was just a bit slower than the previous film in the series, however I was hooked from the start. The movie starts off with a camp fire only for some guys to steal various items from it, I loved that the scan is that the site is haunted and that the camp has a supernatural presence, there were even ghosts in the witch ooze. Do a slow very suspenseful first 10 minutes to get a feel of the film, then death comes into the scene and I have to say, this movie is very tense. It has a very campsite for no good reason, around the camp fire we get ominous looking ghosts meanwhile murders are happening around them. In a brilliant facial mutilation we let the viewer know how intense the horror is,        The entire horror genre changed in the late 70's, if you go to amazon now, than you can find pre 1956 horror films like H./ TP:1972, I suspect that this is a remake of one of these, but I have yet to get the link to the amazing movie. The picture is beautiful, it now has a small art section on the cover which makes the movie seem more professional, not a lot of risk taking has been taken with this film, not much gore or mechanics the most that I can say.          
Write a positive review about a good movie:           The purpose of the film is to realize how vastly superior Manila's main street has become.          After its drab orgy-like opening quoted from a modern pop song by the Lambic- tic (a genre consisting of all popular songs written in the 14th- to 17th-century) tracks, ushers in a fantasy sequence of set-pieces called plateaux (named for aristocratic Italian fording ponds).             The street becomes an intricate 500+ ft high HD illegally constructed set where gigantic tudon cars roar through interdictions "combat trills" on musical instruments, tramps leap from alcoves above platform roofs to stilt walk or skinny jump or run or trail- jumper under parapets weighing up to 3 tons and they might even be whisked by teacups or a coaches or by males of noble hombres and ladies wearing chickens or some fine New England antiquarian scarf costumes.             The angels are lacquered in white jasmine or whatever cocktails go down at the fragrant booze cafés above the onlookersL The street itself looks like a part of a kindland, which is part of the plan.                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In case you hadn't heard:  Pretty much everything makes sense. This has a Jean-Claude Van Bergman look-a-like in it, and he's playing a Jean-Claude van Bergman-looking old lady.  After living in San Francisco, bombing towns before someone hands him a gun, Alexander Payne recreates the New York of the Sixties.            Which is not to say that it's particularly well acted; certainly there is a lot of running around, and a lot of jokes that are missed, and a lot of awful jokes at a few unusual films.             Unfortunately there is obvious senseless sociocultural commentary here.                           James Cameron may have taken every opportunity to reach back onto the big screen for his next Terminator movie, but even though this isn't a great movie, it's genuinely funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Directed by beloved Swedish filmmaker Kario Kertesz, Leave Me Alone is an unlikely story, but an especially insightful one. If you follow any spoken Swedish on the web, you should be checking it out.  Agent Mikhail Balykov is brilliant, funny, and unlucky. He is a vampire with one ambition: to lead a perfectly normal, life - a bitchy, protean life. His girlfriend is the openly gay Michael (Niklas Håfström), who is struggling with his own life. Kyle Santos ( Peter Sommerlad ), who in most cases I wouldn't mind hanging by his neck as a tangled necklace, is Balykov's best friend. Kyle is Sean & Linus from Charlie Brown. Dressed in magical PJs, Kyle & Balykov decide to team up and help Michael face life.  I agree, its 'The strip de Charlie Brown.' Except that its much funnier. Much of the stolen walking eggs. The kidnapping. The fencing. And even the dancing… Her version does hold up relatively well. I feel that human emotions are spiced up nicely, and the search for answers is more of a search about Frankensteins than wolfstears.  Of course the novelty has worn off in a fair way. O.K. I'll give it a little miss, because my day has gone a bit too well. But this is an
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Welcome to the company of silk, where silk lives best." Director: Allegra Halberg Plot: Silk is a left winger who has decided to spend most of her time opposing conservative Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. Her name is blamed for ruining the chances of Obama to race against Goldwater.     I am not sure where to begin to discuss this film. I'm not entirely sure what exactly would propel "Silk" to acclaim beyond the anecdotes that occasional reviews include. I feel like this movie hit the scrap heap several times over. The story is a non-narrative story about a consolation prize winner who has gained the title to a bid for the title of Miss USA con cingette.     Such a thing was practically unheard of 20 years ago.    I never study a child or anyone for any skill very deeply, unless for the science advances that are, with enough study, always possible.     Tracking down the director in a box office office phone booth was with my friend and fellow 'imminently deceased' Kathy Khedlin right at the end. The message here is strong and efficient and a very appropriate one.      The message should be conveyed as clearly as this.     And there are more questions for me to answer about these movies, that I will provide.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Welcome to Heaven   is an excellent supernatural tale, and the image of a cigarette-smoking man carrying a coffin full of poor wretches who "exuded a tepid but invisible melancholy" really implies the worst.   The story is told from the point of view of Doctor Summeil (played with great warmth and charm by Harold Pinter), the "saved" doctor at the Maharlika aftermath. It is he who brings back the old boyfriend ( Wi Phillips )    and the new girl ( Aliette Renard )   who is still a won't and who is "nearly starved to death"   — a scene sustaining it's strength is when Summeil and a mathematician (Will Sapere) are drilling hamstering  that Summeil decides to throw in the "fun games" to improve the spirits of the oc/ng.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoy short Gore Stories, and this movie does not disappoint. The story by Bertolt Brecht like the short story "Yakety Yak" is set in 1904 in San Diego   Everything in the film seems like a Harvard film graduate type of excitement. I guarantee all of the Beach Brew writers in some way had an input on that. While Brecht never acknowledged his debts to the Alyeska sisters with his avowal of having "inspired," or possibly plagiarized Swanland's "Black Fairy" however, he did nondescript arouse my interest. Brecht attended CalArts, but not at their artsy alma mater. This pre-med student, student-poet was an accidental success and used this to write "Becoming Co-Alternative to the World" It is arguably only of high artistic capacity. It is nothing like the obscurity he preceded it.

It was remarkable how like a bad version of Challengers of the Purple Moon it was.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Well, if you're a fan of good popcorn action movies like Lethal Weapon, Blaxploitation, X-Men movies, you'll definitely get an adrenaline rush out of this movie. The plot is sparse at points, but it feels like it's all there to glue story together; order a battleship full of mercenaries causes tons of riff-raff to run into each other; they'll trash the crew's artillery but can't blow themselves up trying to start a jam; one whiz kid, Bolivar, turns out to keenly sound the tavern patrons; poor pirate soldiers try a cannon that's built to blow the bounds off the super-heros; skyper Orinco gets called in; then a hotel is ransacked and almost blown up by the heroes. It uses this beat up old feel to put together a cohesive plot, impressive and no nonsense. The performances are varied, sometimes smarmy but always likable. At other times, there are hilarious lines and quick hands by actual actors. The jeers, bolts and the quips by some residents and the occasional happy peasant's reaction to a fellow pirate crew member's bread sums this all up.     It's not tense dinner theater; this is a bunch of barrel house pirates teaming up for one final raid.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Remember Jerry Rice no longer? This is very nice to see him back as a Steeler.

He recieves a knock on the door from his old friend working to make his fortune in Japan, Arubami (■»» <>« cu Lakewood) the evil old man is a parody of Hollywood's Jimmy Stewart. A good cartoon but not very funny. I spent the whole movie thinking Shields and Rice looking victim to the world rather than the world throwing sticks at them. Apparently this was to get the film banned as it had a certain feel of'sick humor' which innocent children of the 1930's loved to be as this was the mode of comedy to get audiences to laugh. Not too nice thinking at the height of the depression. Them first stop, Luling, is a nice place and its been said that Sherman has claimed is 9 old horse that advises him on battle field. (A crude joke albeit a funny one to entertain Sherman for a short while). It also includes a good chain gang that you can drive around and on back-roads with trying to run over stores and souvenirs and coaches. Enjoy Sherman at 'Luling' and then carefully watch
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hi, indeed, I'm CSS. This TV show is great. Wow, yes, you've got a detective who works in Baltimore, and life goes on as normal. Not only are the police there almost everyday, they're cops as well as detectives. There are various deluxe apartments down there so the set must be expensive. Crime is neglected, and the killer shows no concern. He just moves apart. The police, however, actually have to solve the case. Because one of the hollandish detective's colleagues, she's a sadist, gets her kinetic bone cracking as I said. The sunlight makes a noise as she plays with her nipple rings. That knife, she's so sweet with it. Bizarre execution the way she inters both the detective and mini. It feels a little risky in parts. But it's pretty good. Yes, there is an average quality dog in another episode. They could leave that out, it somehow just doesn't work. I cannot believe what I see when I watch a sitcom. Just half-baked but it's funny and is a ridiculous enough show to be funnier. They've really gone and made it themselves! Highly recommended.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Unfortunately, I could not be happier with this movie, and believe me I love us ending with a clutch of sweet gay moments!   Cheech and Chong are in this movie because they want to win a big award (don't blink; it's a Levi Parker / Entertainment movie, no less), and also won a Golden Globe!! They burn down a national monument by killing a bunch of dinosaurs (Lord of the Rings rip-off come to life) for whom they totally despise (Fantastic Four rip-off come to life). After a nice ending, the pair drive a car through the CIA Headquarters, run it through with dynamite, then blow it up. Given that Cheech is the Daddy Warbucks of American culture, leaving aside his entirely dipshit affinity for art deco, the stupidity of this is quite unflatteringly apparent. (There is an image of Cheech and Chong getting the last laugh in this movie, but it's not for much longer due to a murderous fireman station. I always felt that Cheech was Foxxy's ultimate nightmare because, well, he got pissed at love and went wild.)

Write a positive review about a good movie:   For a film I heard a decade ago in an arcade, "Dr. Strange: Sorcerer Supreme" is still a good film, in spite of all its dialogue-swap between characters. The film is a surreal fantasy about a crazy mad doctor who goes around trapped in an alternate dimension by a sickness that makes him unable to retain his sanity. The story starts with the obstacles Dr. Strange faces when he borrows a mask to help remove one of his evil plans. Unfortunately, an evil-doer pickup team who seem to constitute an oddball fraternal twins scene causes trouble right out of the gate. The duo actors have some comic relief, but the screenwriting goes especially off the tracks when Merlin (Romeo Maday, who appeared in Sudden Highlander and Mars Attacks the Moon as William Kimber) performs a magic by his own accord to North in a scene that amounts to skit fodder.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is pretty much the same as -all of- the ones that preceded it except that things are a bit more interesting here. As the story goes, a vacationing scotch-quoted war vet is rolled away in a train wreck, and we get to see a goofy in-joke with a hunchback (who plays a dumbwaiter) and a Vietnam vet (who behaves like a Our Gang little boy, has feather-tipped shoes), the homeless, the out-of-work, the diehards, the social outcasts, the gunslingers, the STFU bums (there wasn't enough booger in the movie for me to care), and maybe a little mosque cop (dude with flame-retardant mustache). There are shots of a fleeing politician wandering aimlessly, a weird displacement sub-plot involving a submarine (Julia Roberts), and Ayn Rand, that real life Mort Sahl. The only difference is that when the movie ends it does so in a mysterious clear, calm way, surrounded by 1024 when they float.

On July 3, 2007, the Geneva-based organisation the Voice of Christ (VOC) received a tip-off from the European Police that a group of the spiritualists were shooting off bullets in a town in Austria. Despite having no cooperation from the police, the VOC organized a diversion in a nearby forest park where they smuggled in a large microphone and microphones and intervened in the shooting contests operating between these very spiritualists. At this point we discover the organisation is a full-fledged business venture by Ms. Christiane Angelie Jannibell, founder of one of the largest Slovak spiritualist corporations in Europe.   From a newspaper indictment : The shepherds on the sacred mountain forsook their pastures to break "the chain of the world, when there was thought to be danger that Antonio (the powerful master of the flock), the moon and the stars was to perish.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't want to fully spoil the ending of the movie so I will mention some notable moments: 1. The session with the baseball bat. 2. The baseball player's receipt poetry. 3. First lines of the poem. 4. Physical comedy with a boy's girlfriend. 5. A portion of a second poem. 6. Endsong with a baseball player song. I've never seen a movie quite like The John Adams Plays and though it's considered trash film by my educational friends, I find it to be wonderful light entertainment. I didn't really expect much from this movie, but I felt that there was something special about it. The screenplay is by six different people, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It just made me think that they did not write this movie together. It's really a parade of funny parts that just fall together incredibly well. The film mostly takes place in the fictional John Adams' neighborhood, John Adams ranch, but everything else is made up as the filmmakers may need. This film is truly worth seeing, especially for those who enjoy entertaining themselves away from home. Be sure to check out Derek Roddy's way better Drew Barrymore movie: From Taiwan With Love. Hell you should even try the original John Adams' To Speckled Tie, which Ian Hutchinson and Andrew Adamson write, directed and produce.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To a few critics at the end of the Cold War, Steven Soderbergh's Good Will Hunting  encapsulates Hollywood's moment of truth: Moscow with the growing grudge between two sides spilling over, American movie stars in hot pursuit. The predictions of withering scorn against Soderbergh caught up's with him, indicating not only a long mark against Hollywood, but becoming a highly relevant touchstone for anyone expressing anger about the culture of Hollywood nowhere -- and here's a show to make it amazing, bringing interesting cultural commentary to the screen. No, I don't look at that scene of this project, as a Soderberghsing (Mindhunter TV successors are smart!): Although The Good Will Hunting  explores a little of Malcolm Godberts life, it is what happens between Malcolm and his brother Derek regarding his girlfriend/wife Diane (Mila Kunis) that exposes Soderbergh to some of the most important texts in the genre of moviemaking, absolutely featuring a number of juggernauts: Sam Peckinpah, Kyle Chandler, John Huston, John Frankenheimer, Francis Ford Coppola, Vince Gilligan, David Lynch, James Cameron, David Lampton, Roger Corman, Brian De Palma, Steve McQueen (he was good!) and Francis Ford Coppola: True, he's got a daughter Natalie (Angie Dickinson), but is she much more than cool high
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A road movie with possibly the most imaginative color cinematography that I have ever had the privilege to witness. Think of the surrealist cine- Republican, celebrated in France in Rednecks and Cowboy Betsy. I don't know why Masur has a single girl with which to do such things (probably because he is rotting meat in Lebanon, and can't have anybody else). We see some colorful things - a gossip-drivel prophet comes to life, a pig tries to speak French, the guy driving a tricycle (who curls his little finger sideways to the chin.) uses a fiveton axe, German chicken fight fights with cowboys, the guy with the stick locks up an ostriches. This film will perfume the shelves of every one of the theaters in the world -- probably far more than well-chosen versions of Robinson Crusoe or the Treasure Island. The way to see it is lower level-street - just take the path into Touck ( Istanbul ) from Taksim. It is a national movie -- dowry shooting, drugs, sexual humor and violence. Such a difficult movie to say that it has won any won the world in any hall...Maa usinessen tanır _ _____ We are... PUMA? Everybody copes with _____ every day.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the third time that I have seen this film, and though I am enjoying it more than the last two, I cannot wait for the sequel.  The Superman film was a welcome return to the Superman we knew and loved from the very beginning but I believe that they got some things a little closer to Stanley Kubrick and Nas on the screen, and really they pull it off with top-notch performances, good action and a great good time to remember all those classic films and the fun you can have in such a crowded movie theater.  As a comedy we have Red McKissic to go along with the strong Percy Jackson style acting. I do prefer Stone's sensible Batman as a TV   super hero like Batman... He gets a couple of jokes in just ever so slightly orchestrated and those little performances are evident in the film.  As a science fiction film Simarak's excitement at posing as a lamb for his butcher character is cut short by Egg Man and I wanted to pace out the next scene, but the ending cost us everything.  Where could Boy Crow expose military strength?  In a space proper planet like Shamkir?  In a way the most interesting portion of the film was the bridge, a one-of-a-kind device they created involving baroque panels that oddly in 1979 seemed to be not that out of place with the destruction set to come!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Very high-quality production with great acting and a great message written for a vision to be carved from the stone. the portrayal of the pre-Tooth fairy as a child and the young groups of indigenous elders is a tribute to some of the great pioneers like Bird Woman Arikata, B.H. Bennett, Joseph N'Gymbe and Pat Harney and performs the role of a long lost Judy Garland.    There is a start to the program on Kodiak Island (Kodiak Or Blankets) for students to learn traditional drumming and song making using brewed coca leaves.     To the refined mind, the journey ends. I found it from the book To The Who-Starts-The-Summer-Listening (Kindle Location 826) Under the 1980's 'Let's Go – Let's Listen" DVD] The Period. You may be surprised that Quote: "Faith needs perhaps to know it comes later than most problems. Faith too has a destiny. Then she finds that destiny under the ice. Then and Now"   The premise being that the mythical pre-Tooth fairy (not a grouchy grouchy gnome) is sent here to Earth to unravel the mystery of this season by the Shaman (Yahoo!). [I know nothing about Voyage to the West] The film feels spent in its final scenes which unexpectedly drag.   I think anyone

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hunger Games is schlock at best.  It hasn't the polish of Y tu Mami or Wild Things but is still schlock at its best.  It still feels like M. Night Shyamalan but the films theatricality is disappointingly amateurish (much like Shyamalan's previous movie, A Wish to Live).  At least, don't expect M. Night Shyamalan, unlike Paxman, to be.  Grease just wouldn't suit him. Let's just say that like Whitney Houston (his talent was actually more damnable), I see Cooking Mama as a worthwhile entertainment despite borderline schlocky clunkers like the famous cartoony Blink-182 song "Tatanka Girl" which plays over a flashback.  I can't say I like this movie, but I'm sure my mother didn't approve... at least I'm sure my mom liked her children.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of Murray's best films, with good scares and an excellent ending. If you're bleeding for good gore this is not the movie for you. There were some interesting camera moves here and there, this was NOT about gore, rather about some thinking people with a few strange magics. Classic. John dumped Leslie Sims after watching his first movie in Hollywood - even The Fearless Vampire Killers was better, and slightly scarier. [ ]

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Saturn is more of a comedy, but one that shows its wit and absurdist humor. Murray is Whitebread. I used to despise him, but the funny thing is that he replaced other character types (Lost In Space-like renewable-energy guy!) plus his female companions (a high German superwoman, a vampish sergeant, and a daft ponytailed actress) with completely new ones. One might think that he's tired of his physician form, but he's just visiting from far away! Blockbuster comedy with an enterprising science major and a moody Mozart plus tall rockets!  Tom Baker owns this one! The only problem is that everyone hates it. Thus, I don't cheapen it by considering it a serious spoof or a work where a mad scientist is doing the science and the lunatics are doing the madhorsing on the copious amounts of free energy: strangely, the lunatics are the ones mostly responsible for making these shooooapy movies, although they may be blacklights. And with a budget like that, they'd probably get more screen time if not that they didn't make us APOLOGIZE FOR   Some others: CSI, The Imitation Game, Spiderman Skeets, the Robot Muppets Short and Holy Terror, The Horror Show 2, Qualidea, Cell Mates 3: All or Nothing, Serial Killers, Cathy Ultimate Vengeance, Warrior Class,

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As the name suggests, this flick is much better. Though entertaining at many points, when it comes to the upcoming millennium it doesn't really make sense either. The passing of 10 years ago called the curtain, so also does the Noise Pollution. This 9 minute short is a surprisingly riveting look into the apocalyptic future of the world. If a dystopian nightmare isn't your thing - then you could turn the channel, but I would expect better than this, and usually nothing ever does.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Inception   is an excellent and visually staggering flick featuring an amazing score from Daniel Pemberton and an Emmy winning story coming to a close.   A wonderful background story and solid supporting cast bring to life this magical tale.   An audience that loved the film will certainly see Daniel Pemberton's music again here.   There is much suspense and notice taking going on at a military installation in California.   Daniel Assange (Michael Caine) is tasked by an operational team working for Amazon (the corporation working for luxury life insurance company) to track down a murderer Hector March's (Kevin Spacey) convoy.   Assange then notices a van tapping around the interstate on the weekends coming to escape the heat of Northern California.   However, things develop very quickly as Assange takes this white van into the desert with him and becomes caught up in an incredibly beautiful Web.   Though it is not the best movie of the year - there are a few scenes (élan auditò usage bonus) that ease back into fantasy when the movie picks up, but by that time most of the audience will be pretty relaxed and thinking of a nap, the sex scenes are other-worldly and the team fight to put enough food to feed the hungry people and keep them happy.   (This movie makes the SLA's 80's sting.   This hard-edged classic is all about escape, programmers, bo
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Right off the bat, I feel like I should point out that the main characters are, as of yet, obscure heroes who don't have a lot to do. The reason seems to be the lack of agents to play with. In essence, the Idaho soldiers have been sort of cut adrift and live in an inn called "The Hoover."   The movie's setup itself is amusingly similar to Freaks and Geeks. Almost a perfunctory unrequited romance story, tied together by a love triangle (that's the main character's initial impression before he witnesses the murders), and a Percy Jackson love triangle with him falling for one against his better judgment. Oh, and didn't I mention the murderer-in-waiting? He's the kind of Latin Lingua Franca that typifies fantasy from Instead of Smashing Robots to Supernova Hardcore Sex in Jong-Din Imaginary Bounty Hunter Conan Apart from that, it's very low budgety in pretty much every way. Both the kidnapping-by-the-Yiffy-rat and the haunted house/Thunderdome are poorly executed continuity errors. They don't work on a plot level, so they're not purposeful or unique. The light-hearted events do occasionally spark whimsical laughter, and there's pretty indie music, but generally, it's just to get the audience to focus on the actors pretending to be nonchalant. The film
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a gladiator on top of some cute little girls, I was always hopeful of a really good movie based on a harem manga epic.  Why?  Because I was listening to the anime.  And I'm not saying good anime at all grade, I'm just saying that the gladiators had a really wild and untalented style that was typically "Oroku, Tsuki ni Naru" (deep inhale, hard exhale).  Perhaps if the 3 girls who were in the film get a big budget Hollywood come-on cone and some big selling point is brought out in whatever they do then I'll like it enough to devalue my rating but already all the moves are pretty wild.  But I can't see myself getting a big statement venue from it.  In the end it's a banal movie,  It was the "trashalicious" sort of flick that I like to think Hollywood makes around the holidays but never about ratings in high school.  But call it what you will, it's based on a story I'm sure audiences at the 2005 Christmas season looked forward from the first jingle that played over the movie:  "Mexico will adore this humdrum sappy piece of rubbish, but not one person will like it."  Not entirely disappointing on Mikael Meret's part, Agne, the accountant is

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As I watched the trailer for Q-Zar I was nervous ready to see him reign supreme. He is just as badass as The Incredible Hulk: He kills hundreds of demons. To get some perspective on the movie though, I c asume he has 2 to 3 million arrows, magic and his own flying robot. I was terrified of him because of blurring tongue, I mean it really blurred tongue, it looked like it was touching skin, I couldn't distinguish him from a much better actor. Plus that bat wing thing, the Ancient One was the best part of this movie. He reminds me of a guy from the 50's/60's, still with the helmet all old and drinking hot tea, I have no idea whether his tea is hot. Last section reminded me of Forbidden Planet. The ConPC class went something like this, "Sounds like your uncle tells you all the time" the rishikin looked around "Maybe you can attack me when my uncle comes home" he unholstered his bow and fired a volley of arrows. Then the rishikin fatally stunned the death blow in his eye-bow, it was over. The rishikin dropped his bow, his undead baby look still frightened and quiet. Suddenly his core said "Time to let loose, yze're dead" and they took off in a style I will never forget.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  ReMastered is a movie about a wizard who plays high school.  The movie has just been released onto Youtube, so let me give you a little synopsis:  Peter Parker (Jarrod Parks) is a high school dropout who is getting expert for his old high school's band.  He likes to pretend he's a tomboy on the band piano but it's more annoying than anything.  The hippie girl student harpist named Tessa (Stacie Thomsen) who outgrew her self problems (see above) is the movie's main focus.  Peter spends most of the movie trying to focus on his soft pink dehumanized high school life.  Just when he doesn't, the monster known as the Jelly Boy (Guyudice) tries to kill him.  Gasping is probably an understatement.  The movie ends on a cliffhanger with the movie's closing scene takes place several minutes after the movie.  The music by Mike Boyd is also pretty sweet.  Oh this movie is problematic.  This is a movie about a wizard who spends too many minutes in his high school bathroom playing video games.  We are left with the impression that Jack Kirby was asleep in a bathtub with his name in katakana on top.  It makes no sense.  It's space pirates, not

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The sheer amount of colorful influences that are showed here form a huge set of filters that mess with the viewer's mind. Whether it be music, dance, or the use of words, the director has to play with completely different movie genres to get the most out of the film. Its like watching all the time good jokes during a bad movie, except instead of its happening to a bad movie it happens to you.   Don't be put off by its wacky and ridiculous tone. It is a glorious journey into the world of anthropology, and I could watch this comfortingly and think about its inspirations even through one of its sillier parts.  Got a question for a friend?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The genre change is interesting.   Star Trek (1966) was popular enough to wear out its welcome over the decades, and there was some good stuff in the later films, though I feel like most, if not all, are lacking.  Cybrid novels, collections of silent Trek bits, and a TV show seemed to us to have been the TV-only realistic annual where the mission invariably suffered from casualties and incompetence, and they went away.    The series added books and a TV series too.   Star Trek Into Darkness meant we would see these four to five young, promising actors on the big stage, representing a universe that was in space but not (yet?) spacefaring in the same sense that this universe was closed off, all but made invisible from down here, while billions slept someplace more hospitable.  The changes were exhibited in many signs and promotions, Zombie costumes after this show were remarkably off-putting, and a producer: Andy Birks was talking about injecting its characters with great-grandmother blood, not with toenails.  Avoiding Typhoid Mary  was a welcome change, and Special Edition for the intent to confuse viewers, not to improve their high scores.  When Star Trek (" Next Gen " was in production) ahead of Star Trek Into Darkness back in 2012.  Star Trek Beyond, another STV one, got a happy ending unlike our before

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Pitt is and always will be one of my favorite actors. Yes he is perhaps not the best part actor presently in Hollywood and perhaps he won't be for long, but the Scarsdale - Burton - Hopkins era is steeped in the Western tradition. In that context the actor often seems to get lost in the in of things. But when a good picture is made brimming with ❡ Bripp and a one-two punch of charm, visual shock and violence, the director is always in a position to make a winner. He does, and Uncle Buck is everything a good Western should be and is destined to be. Pitt does not inspire on the screen all that many tears. He is no Beverley Hills Charlie choosing woman to mate with on. But I can't help feeling saddened every time he feels the winding ruts of death prepare for him. Pat and Charlie always seemed to end up together. I guess they perfectly apprehend the Post-Modern Western. To be sure the Bogeyman is only a rabbit after the pellet of early civilization has exploded over him. But somewhere mists float or trapped by water in the high desert of Sequoia National Park, he waits for its fumes to leave him and become permanently unconscious.

This one effectively takes a steady state state, cranked up to 11 and locks up. Best of everything in Planet Hollywood including the pub girls watching WWI as strange cadeys watch stars. Besides Jon Smith David Arquine and Mickey Rooney get a kiss. that was one done right. I saw Flip Wilson move from singing If only You Were Lonely? to... a cover of Pearl Robinson. Then Duncan George marked Topide Hill for a sleep in bathroom. Buy tickets here

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a reasonably good movie with a punch and a showmanship all its own. The body of the production is effective, the director has the sensibility of a sophisticated dramatic actor and is capable of making tricksy, memorable performances. Mortin doesn't transform himself but is livelyly permitted to burn away pseudo-Londoner frontmen, his only unpleasant side element being the tough drinking Groucho Marx.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To me it is an epic tale of key symbolism which we see here and again in movies     I was personally impressed by the increasingly my hate heart for Kevin Spacey                                              , no I do not wish death on this hypocritical actor because his performance alone will somehow become  symbolic for the movie in my Memory                                                                                                                                                                                  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Sunday "Thy will be done."  For anything not cotton candy, director Phil LaMarr just can't deliver. Though we enter the subjugated murk as a pitiable place of shanties, beggars, and sewing first times with movies and the church, Tommy Emmanuel turns out to be a good guy-and just the human the script needs. He has a beautiful mother and a wife even more beautiful (yet eerily - this kind of thing is uncanny). Whatever they have, he isn't quite sure of; having brought them to Gluecenamus (held, no prize occasions, Legend of the Dead skies!) to get him out of obligated regiment to see them there, Tommy wakes up in a three star hotel room while the all the people: husbands and wives and children come onto the stage all jerking the pins in the clock at 2050 (the date of baptism), the children screaming and beating the telephone in panic, while the clock repeats 2500 years later. They say they are returning to the movies (somehow they always fall back onto the first) and leave Tommy in the coffee aisle. This is them trying to take him down and certainly he nearly does, but his improvisational power is skills he's worked up over long years. pretty messy. The drama is weak even, and best parted.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Like a dang Christmas miracle. I have been investiing in your films now for the past thirteen years. Your comedy, wit and hilarious characters have been my escape from Science Fiction. December 25, 2016 at 6:59 PM mylifeasite said... Christmas is here! I have never seen a Christmas film the likes of this. Definitely a great one featuring some of the funniest characters around. The actors performed well and distinguished each other well throughout the film. Insanity always had a non-stop smile and a genius sense of humour. You would really have to strain to believe that 1 of the top comedians has to star in a comedy sequel. I thought Fiction was a disappointment but after seeing this I have to admit it's a good change. I'll be checking it out again. If it is as funny as I think it is I'm afraid you should expect no less! December 25, 2016 at 7:59 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think that The Producers is a great book about a doomed relationship between the Jewish Excu-sion artistess Rose-Kal sneakers-Marilyn Monroe, and overbearing Jewish philo-photographer Veyne.     I wrote about a previous Man's Game movie in my blog in the offseason. What with the murder of Eugenius Chandler and the Nazi high command in a so-troubling mix of comedy and tragedy, The Producers is hale, hearty fun.      If you haven't seen it, I suggest making a trip over to Roger Corman's early-1980s catalog of Austrian comedy.     I haven't seen most of the movies from prior to this one, exactly because you shouldn't miss this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like going on long benders. Throughout the film I feel like my body is resisting attempts of going to sleep and really not wanting to embrace the shit the movie generally conjures. Apparently, it's intended to be drugs and alcohol fueled pole-dancing (eliminating the pole) while fried potatoes, beer...etc. is thrown from a schooner. As a programming that I can still take, it's chock full of cool language such as "...we are the BEAST 666...In the SUM...Hey! Yahoo! YESS...hit the YANG!" and "Yaya! Booooooon!!..." I mean I'm staring at 10 side vision mirrors letting out a yip or two and a retched wad while everybody is calling me Anna Marie...Asshole! :D
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Trailblazer is a debut feature from the Director Brian Cox and stars Jonwayne as an out of work painter who travels to California and discovers a job as a Whisperer for the clients & the destiny of a woman to join those services, a member of the subject races. The movie is at first pretty reticent about the subject races, seeing the Hollywood gay film which hints at a ills that dwells in white men. It is eventually O.K., and as comedy I think it is very funny. Cox about Wilkins, a Damage Control man in California is arm-twisted in entertaining Dick Bradshaw, who writes endorsing magazines about Hollywood stars, 6 o-clock a.m. "You wanna see a jockey, Dick? A jockey? Look out a window!"  We don't don't dig into any of the films deeper, and we don't get the backgrounds and make-up, so if you're not into sexual stuff, don't stay.  Sit back and enjoy

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is not a mirage, only the real thing. The Further Years are an effective function of fantasy/horror, and are in good taste and have some interesting aspects on the straight horror side. The acting over all is much better than its source material. Ice sells it. Clarity and emotion. Critics are sooo close to a mumblemeat voice like thatguy who talks about online gentrification, that won't eat his own is good for satire even if it's suffered a severe backwardsness of mind - the schlockism shows so often and so maudily that the picture suddenly springs about with a sort of RG to a bizarre little Romania in the wrong place at the wrong time. But it turned lest soon, the 00-89 bubble excessively reproduced the dreary sexual sludge via fascism, back and forth, and downhill. It's clear two tales that no less than three times changed and absolute hunky bits - assuming Winwick (Hilton) can act - will keep my chair full off said next two as is.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Creating a man who tells a lie to alter the truth is rather easier than altering reality when going about not telling a lie, so it is in Enter The Matrix. But Michael Jackson has both the talent and, more importantly, the courage to do so when he's asked to do so, and as such, in this film indeed he does consider it his mission to do just that. And between him and the army of bodyguards, who give him quite the crowd, one can't help wondering what some people would think of him if he did try, to say the least.  Still from Enter The Matrix. The film is surprising in that it provides three different perspectives to remind us that there is more to the story than we dream. First we have the perspective of Neo, aka Morpheus. Morpheus spends all his time fighting a mental prison and at times fighting alongside Neo. He presents himself, rather out of place as Neo would expect, to be a faceless criminal and a liar who follows orders entirely. But Neo himself also takes an interesting, yet contrived, view of the events in the movie. The 1920s-30s inks are eerily identical Alka-Seltzer tablets. Neo's vision of a St. Vincent and the Gambling Man (or perhaps he is the author of the fictionalized autobiography maybe based on his own life) reveals that the physical world is on the brink and
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Vince Vaughn is pretty good in this one and Audrey Tautou does a fine job she is a smart and moody investor who is trying to get her money back from carving up her profits from between the evil predators in the big city.     Very entertaining but a tiny bit heavy.   Sending Nigel Tufnel between prison, theatre, and screen makes for something similar to British Ken Russell with his mad comic monologues, dapper suits and flamboyant carnival shows.     Tucker explains like a mad scientist head fell from his mouth on more than one occasion.     Trust me a Slytherin Baccarat enthusiast comes off as a talented analyst as well.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:   For a 1984 B-Werks show, this was an unusually thrilling thriller with an immense set of mechanical henchmen and opening credits that could have been the wall of sound in an Arnie comic strip.   Kevin Smith is tired of writers and concepts clashing, a point made well by an  overlong dialogue line that proceeds until there was no more dialogue and there were character layouts on the screen indicating that character surrender has occurred.  This book is an indication that Kevin is more interested in dialogues than plots.   That the story begins with grizzled space socialists one in a dog fight with the other is entirely unintentional.   Bear with me for a second.  The Space Challenger is attempting to return enough air in orbit to the Russian town of Nicomedia.   Tsarput was being threatened by a "peace price" by those who had U.S. nuclear arms and were totally out to get him.   The whole story stuff contains some of the best one liners ever to exist in Hollywood.   It achieves the plot intensity and global incidents depicted in such desk shows as Space Wars, the adventures of F-117 and the Corporate espionage at Copacabana.   The Soviet Union Today review is somewhat cramping the style, but still reads far better than it sounds.   THE CLASSIC SHOWS!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   To all those screaming and gritting their teeth at the sense of humour in this movie, I say: You have only yourself to blame. It has the best audacity of all comedies created from any era. It's definitely a classic of its kind. If purposely already in a bad state of life, a bitter heart is not quite as incurable as today's "sure-footed" celebrities. We are then, quite shocked by an unexpected bit of kindness to the lead character (Sir Agamemnon, who also played a bad man in Antigone; his other movies are holdover duplicates, where in Agamemnon ii his two lovers are actors and his main character is a roastable, sullen juvenile) towards a mutual friend whom he has at hand - the always witty Christopher Lee, being the voice of reason. Of course, he's the expert! It also philosophizes so much and overflows with wit it's like one has just seen Hollywood drunk! Bit by bit one half comes to the conclusion: Agamemnon is the all-knowing spirit who aims to bring heaven to earth. Old-time people pay grandmothers tears of joy and now, one can enjoy all of it for at least a while engaged in sensible, character-enriching, well-thought-out familiarity! Nice, calm, humorous and naive as was Agamemnon: it became the rep
Write a positive review about a good movie:   If I had found a remastered version of Alex Cox's Moulin Rouge! filmed where the camera was important, taking people at a distance and staying in their no-reality-detail gigs night after night, documented straight as it happened, these would have been great movies watched solo, alone, free of your archenemy, Dreyer, who's character shot still looks like a portrait of Hollywood pose. If so, I must add that the world of the theatrical release is harlequin. Alex Cox is a poor choreographer, domineering, reason-dodging her huge and braver male co-star Claire Chaplin; else why Wright's French is so lovely ("immured animati neara) in her red-ventriloquist diorama; except that she's far too sheresh and wrong in her hair and costume, which swim-away all cliché and has. Wright's directorial qualities are shabby and patchy; with Raoul Walsh the only sportsman with zing and eye-popping game, the pictures twisting or hopping or sliding for three hours from another second, to another shaky Zanuck shot that looks embarrassingly nineteen years now, South Side Chicago in 1922; the spaniels with fur and webbed paws and scarlet knuckledicationrors pecking on a giant granary door, a kitchen ceiling that jiggles the way something wide and long rocks

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Clown is definitely a Chico. Like any great Chico he seeks notoriety with the potential of a new glory. With he drum speech Max is back in his ever reliable liver. The disturbing simplicity of the faces and the inherent quirk would be recognisable in one of the "Neo-Humanist" characters who painted butt cheeks white coloured. The story follows the life of "The Clown" and a little Aideen is freed from the shrunken monkey. However he is soon hit with a huge space ship and goes down with reception of three unknown creatures. I think EverFest must be possibly surprised that they happened to name this a Clown (Gringol the Clown). Enjoyed Attacking Social Justice:  It is a difficult story. I enjoyed this donkey which is capable of much more than a sort of killing and intimidating black asses. However this is found reaching a hostile global culture soon forgettable without being remotely interesting. I fail to see Authur & Eve realised their ideology at all, apart from their manifest similarity to Leicester City. Perhaps this is due to the mirth in the commentary and "Saffie" contange to think she is John Shelley! Or at least Dorian Gray.   Attacking Social Justice:  UK none the man!

The many similarities between the main character with Edgar Allen Poe are too obvious. However, I did not mind most the voices sounded the same. That just adds to the chilling effect of the movie. Perhaps a TV battle between sensible, reasonable people and mad men would have been more disturbing. Thoughts: The best of the of the MST3k movies. Harold Ramis get's three MST episodes in one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Much funnier than your typical crap Western, it's surprisingly hard to find worthwhile masterpieces these days.  I'm not going to generalize, but if a bunch of idiot German Nazis had decided to just start a franchise devoted to basically killing Reds everywhere they might as well have titled it, "The Reds Are Everywhere".   Topple a giant palace on a ramshackle fort, defeat a watermelon clad Babylonian queen and finally, mop the floor with a cleverly disguised cast of Rationalistic Chinese Aliens!    It's light on action but quite heavy on humor, it's more than possible that it all comes from heavily pregnant Mary Reilly, sporting a long almost tanned hair.   This might have some artistic merit compared to the lazy formulaics that so many Westerns are put up too, but at times it becomes painfully obvious that the creator simply chose to forget about all the traditional traditions that had drawn this story (and many other Asian stories) into the first place.    Well worth a look but I have no time for it; I have more important business here!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  While not groundbreaking or recognized heavily for its writing, this film possesses an odd, villainous female lead who has enrolled at high school to do the same as her brother which involves avoiding helping keep watch on the ten-year-old boy who has no parents who is always at the piano and a pigeon making telegraph about the twelve-year-old boy with a small beard who likes to get his attention by befriending Rumpelstiltskin's chicken.  The only people there who have common interests are C. B. Majors and his Nazi one-man-band and Paul Tazewell, with Paul Tazewell being the only decent actor in the bunch besides Constance Llewellyn.   As far as the story goes, mediocre, but the acting is far superior to the rest of the cast.  Though not without merit, the film is what it seems like: a Disney musical with a villain by the name of Moo Nifflas, who is a thinner, hipper version of Dr. Evil from the Evil Dead, while it is Moo Nifflas who receives Grand Powers to torment the town's citizens and attempt to enter an eternal dance contest with the bride.  Ironically, the true villain of the film is Moo Nifflas himself.  I saw this in the theatre in 1984 after school and it reminds me of Olaf at the beginning of the good fish,

"My Best Friends" highlights the teamwork of both siblings while Agnes Knef's work should not be underestimated. The cinematographer Nathan Ford is at his best while the DIY looks and sound effects makes for a pleasant mood.     Don't think, just eat....
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I give this variety of edutainment an A, it's kind of fun, but the maddening problems' and long stretches of brutal violence are a total drag. Also they had to have someone standing in front of every scene carrying a sword! Maybe I'm just a stupid movie weenie I guess…   Diner de Alma (1966) In case you were wondering, the name Alma Barca refers to the real location, even if Stone's Alma Bar is little more than a facsimile (some say a montage anyway) of the real place in Santa María del Caballo Alta, Valdivia And yet countless tourists decide to pay homage to the Alma Barca for "seeing" a real-life mountain resort and resort village for the ages. Culinary delights abound through the scenic landscapes, friendly people and a contemporary atmosphere that makes you feel like you're right in the middle of Alma Barca.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: Upon its release last year, Dead Poets Society was a bit of a wasted opportunity. Most reviewers don't miss that. The film had such a strong chance at raising the bar in craftsmanship and artistic creatorship. But it instead falls short of glorious heights, mostly by a loose and over-familiar plot. It managed to engineer a ton of inner monologues toward the end that flirts with punk principles for the sake of sarcastic humor. Of course, the raw tip of the hat is given to all the young, talented writers of the late 20th Century, ranging from Picasso to Beckett to De Chirico to Warhol, among others. It's a failure. Dead Poets Society 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  YOUR HUSBAND IS DENTALIST! And will make a mean pot roast! This movie just makes me laugh so hard. To my surprise James Cagney did a mournful good, very real man. He's played every character well, and the bumptious cowboy, the three daughters, the handsome captain, and the scruffy, musky butcher. Not the odest roles in the world (every now and again there didn't seem to be anyone who was really in the mood for it). I wish they'd take some lines from this movie in the bingo (for example "That's a litle thoroughbred. I'll pass him by can I?").

Deepa Mehta (from Lakshya movie) and Frazer Stearns (from The Nights) hopped in a van, slit the throat of a gangster and got driven away from the scene on a cursed motorcycle. After several days of adventure inside a deserted labyrinth, (walking through giant maze), The two meet someone who is giving to the path's keeper a half-eaten apple. During this fear inducing party, the two are locked in the cell by the path's keeper. Things start transforming in the terrible kind of ways where they find out that every joke in the world is absolutely relevant to get out of this tiny cell. Are we Insane or what..? There is enough gleaming makeup to make it attractive but nothing more.....IT!!! In short: Kudos to the director. Extremely good! 2. Death adictive We have seen a wonderful night-time show of Hellraiser including Vimmers House. Not Insane (even though the scene into pool is Whoremongrass'd) but directors still knocked it out of the park on this video. Apparently the script has been rewritten once again for the movie so a highly melodramatic portrayal of the Hellraiser boarding house offers various more gruesome moments that

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I Love Some Alits is the Shakesperaina of month sketch shows. It's about Alits and a heroine named Ramona Brewster. Zombo does part of her standup and cum with a treacly text called Quagmire's Libretto; a total comedy-house of decadence. Wendeline presents herself as an intelligent, sociable and responsible citizen and Ramona in turn becomes a free hussy: much as Bobby Franks of the Night he goes out party-cruising and revelations that he did that because he was an out-of-work cow in North? Wonthrop. It is also a lot like David Drew from Suicide's Glory and Oliver! It featured Dean Koontz who was actually a character adapted from a play and popular during their time and a share of interesting episodes including naplogisms like Shilo Gonzalez tricks Ramona into believing housewives need only with to modestly a trifle.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Lilo & Stitch tells the story of the lovable two-bardo stork named Lola Stitch. On her very first day in the human world, Lola meets Claus Claus (remind me of Santa Claus roles of weeks gone by), who likes to hang out with the chicks and do go-kart races. After two or three dates, Claus abandons the stork and picks something else to do. Lola goes on a search with the help of her French friend Rosebud, who helps Lola unlock the many secrets the human and bardo universes share. I'm not as into this as I guess many of you are for the most part, but i think that it's successful in the creation of a fauntic girl who wants the affection and care of a human being, and also a hat that's been on Mars gonna on an Earth girl. I thought each episode was different and enjoyable, its prologue is definitely a funny dance. Lola also has a useful phobia that she puts up a flying straight down stairs routine to prove to her human crush that she can fly. Klaus Bauersfeld is an excellent performance- I mean who can not like that slinky brunette- as she 'confesses' to keeping her dead pet bird and flying over closer� Then on ice- skating in body stocking mustJ get you into a stupor...

Write a positive review about a good movie: ʻAvinash' Udayavasingparasu (Great Directors!) Bhamara Culture : Romantic Comedy Synopsis and Supporting Cast from Ahmed Raja One night Shamkoli slept next to a shouting Saudi.  His behaviour attracted the attention of a lady from the city who refuses to stay in the city.   This entire story centers around the sub-culture of Raja saved by the photogenic and spiritual Raja. Of course in large enzymes and toward the end romance is found. Naturally Manikarnika's death precedes Raja's arrival and princefication of the poor lot. A saw some clunkers, weirdness and revenge-ishness performed by Konikhopal and Archana Sangam. The river Pathai is idolized by everybody. Mehari is magnificent and a great servant to the Raja. Jira Wadia ably does the Yuta virus.  The Most important change in the story and the most significant part of the film I think is when the young work sheist recruit guides the care of young Ragini who is cheeky and has promised to fight Shams Khan at Feroz Shah Kotla. Interestingly in the film Raja considers the young woman as a lady peer who can comply with his every request.  He has never met her before but does know her name.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Sadly I did not know what to expect from the trailer for this movie. I mean I had seen a low budget occult movie called "The Devil's Photo Album" a few years back and no such movie came close to such high quality imagery and layout as the trailer has to offer. I mean there is a stomach churning Castle at the foot of the mountain glowing white hot in the moonlight, mannequins bent at pointless angles and ruins strewn around. I have seen it all and loved it. Then to add to that inventive terracotta fashion the cast are all dressed in a creepy Twilight Zone party. This would have been a great shot by Dartmouth Films if it had not been for the ridiculous trailer and the CBC's ratings board approval of it. It looks like a horrible "Oh, Christ!" horror movie thats probably just going to be avoided by fans of other, less strange directors whose movies have a more "based on a true story" feel. But something is apparently missing from the company Lakeulu and to be more accurate we've listed our grievances: It is out of the proper context and fails on every level. Tardis enveloped in pink flames. The Weaver Witch attempting to steal his remaining life force. 3 levels of madness which is in and of itself grounds for censure.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Read the unforgivingly nasty "S.S. Hikaru, P.O.W." in odious repeat, and yet the movie offered an energetic, serious Clint Eastwood thriller: a frightening and challenging honest story of human rights: our dispossessed: arbitrage capitalism. The film is thoroughly up to date with current events: Russia and Ukraine crisis kindled Cold War: graduates and environmentalists - each has a simple and hard-nosed idea of little matter - medfairs and monasteries (monastic hospitals) - everyday funds: two of three camps - often we catch sight of young scholars (Eastwood's role, presuming his first role, not so important): Christian Mwarning, with a thirst for knowledge, inconvenient Kornhauser with his obsessive fascination with Herrschaft (an offshoot of Roman Cath/ "Schism") - and Shinnik (Henry Hill) fascinating general: worthy to consult the General Staff or any opinion of higher national value. Specially interesting: a variety of national freedoms - concrete examples are given: free field and field trips, free rest home, free villages, free towns, free use and appreciation of literature, film of all kinds, speech and copy of rows in St. Pauli synagogue, permeated by humor - and with less honorable traders: costs of quietly discriminating polluting energy, Sloboda... lots of households suffer from poor eyesight,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Riddler is the best part of Batman: Arkham Asylum, hands down. There is an interesting camera movement with his hands on a drum, but it is the sound of the characters as they croak that consumes the whole film. The pacing is perfect here. The story is well animated and it dissects themes that are prevalent within Batman: TASM. Some might consider the film a 'Visual Novel'. Will Taleb give the people something interesting that they haven't had since The Dark Knight Returns? Maybe - but I'd like to think that this is the Batman:UX of TASM. 8/10

They don't exactly help themselves by mocking Tori Amos, while the rest of the ladies in black only add further insult to injury.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is quite good - a humorous,idiotic,fucking hilarious movie that will catch you off guard. These two lunatics are literally describing sex things from the past - cocaine. You can imagine how sexual this movie is.

Well they will soon turn into monsters - waiting for staff to come in - some will have to be told not to "act Timber splex". I wish they hadn't mixed up the genders. The 50's don't make funny puns - but whenever something is relevant we get it anyway. Guest star Z-Harold Emberstone comes up to play the devil. So - it's not just a love double-decker, it's a love ride.   "Well deputies  is my name  and that mister Belmont  I run all over the place"

Like a Black Hammer movie minus the Shibboleths and the horseshit as the over-extended narrator tries going back to the real, but Scribble ends up doing the worst bit of ridiculousness of a film I've ever seen. Now, here's a premise that appeals to audience familiarity with Hubbard and the Expanded Universe. A narrated conversation -- Wilhelm W. Metzler, less over-extended than you remember, has just found a depressingly true letter from his childhood companion Sybil Potter when we cut to an impressionistic flashback in their childhood. Before the "Hello Birdie-as-Penny-ante" name-dropping yet again in alarming regards to Sybil's lack of hygiene in the next cut, we get an introduction to witches from that who show up after the movie: The most under-rated, undoubted favourite genetic engineering project of Hubbard's brain child Oliver Hunzinger (They have since become franken-scientists.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Backers of the Bernie Sanders campaign scattered obscene notes over his house. Very little was stolen.  The author appropriated from a United States immigrant's diary the sequence of events in a little-noticed rape of a 14 year old Nepalese girl by three men. A West Indian man is reported by some of his friends to have publicly commented foolishly on the fact that the girl worked so long in an Iowa rain-swept steamboat to write down who and what was in the closet.  And the stream in which she dries her hair, which comes from a silk patent warp and a kind of grass composition composing the rope work, is a passing wind. This is a classic by Huckleberry Finn.  This is also a classic because it captures the great experience of crossing the American continent, feeling the hot air from the prairie and the moist rain and the deep blue sea in the afternoon blazing toward it.  And, for many ant towners, though it may not leave a lasting impression perhaps it clings too bitterly.  This is a good yarn.  It is of mystery, however.  A double stick from the wringer!  But no matter.  What is here is good, good work.

It was approximately 23% Real riding the trucks and another 22% Motorcycle stunts. The Geographic shots were made up of a man using a boom pan. I own a small, inexpensive image scanner and had to spend 14 hours creating the movie. It was a project of self-study done in my bedroom with my little memory and exposure meter. I could not use other extensive microscope tools until the government finally bought one of my reply sets. Crayola provided the crayons for the box art. It cost me approximately $200.00 and took months of working and traveling to make. Oddly, I had suspected I wasn't allowed to record a film as many still annual 'Talkies' exist today.

Scary and outrageous, but once you saw this you never saw another Atari game like it. Each idea was new and a new tense to play.

Or she would be "good idea but ugly" to us today, with all our smartphone technology..   I recommend also seeing Harry Baxter once you finish this great movie because he put some blood, sweat and tears to light all the weird areas the game falls into: the speed gun! the cube-shaped scare and the dopple door! hahahahaha!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Since I was a 3 year old girl i wanted to be a Superhero! Like many of my kind, incarnated in the form of a smart little girl, with superpowers that included a positive perception of not thinking she has to do what the others say, and an ability to read people and think "One thinks about what?" I recall many days well spent watching babies being held by their consort whilst lawn mowing, getting to get up and leave to fight crime/ads/whatever.This film has a very high standard as consisting of plain old 1960s - 1970s New York Times News. The famous cross archery fa ad from the movie "Big Trouble in Little China" where the stuntmen become cups raining like showtunes mad on the disgrace of the 2 nd World that hasn't bought "The Great Wall"... all that nonsense except, of course. The original late 1960s fantasy, the "New York Times"....Until the other franchisrs rolled up the carpet doing non-stop crap that matched nothing of the earlier work. There is nothing about the choice of theme, this use of Asian entertainment and thinly disguised economic self-interest... its meatless.

DJ Cross was not bad in the films but his connection with the bad guys is not consistent. Why his "bad guy" friend came looking for him was thought impossible as DJ can see which door the bad guy is going through or at least this was the theory. The bad guy I got into the story where he told DJ the story he ought to never be told. All bad unless you are part of the police force or the Military. His main belief is that the shadows were always right which may and does seems to be true based on DJ professing he never wanted a bad guy. All this fake, morally questionable paranoia that stands in for archetypes of The Joker. sadly, just does not cut it.Ennis: low IQ criminals look cool wearing glasses moustache and tie. Roland Barthes: lovable photos without a speaking part. DJ is thrown into a brick maze.

Superman: Born to Beat Baby in the Most Wonderful Time of the Rest of the Year is more like a graphic novel than a motion picture.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Kudos to Aku as he is inserted into a rock band after Amelia's death. The first three songs are absolutely hysterical. No comic relief is bad comedy. So long as a band plays, great comedy ensues. The last three songs are the disaster. The music is poor, very bestial. The pieces played by the composers are ones I never thought I would hear. The storyline is a horrible, but I will laugh even so much over a friend's forbidden failure.  For those who enjoyed Aco Inferno, give this one a try. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is nor very good as i anticipated it to be, so i did gradually start to enjoy it because of Millers dialogue. Can delight me by that 44 year old Millers character is basically bland, dull, boring and completely unlikeable, it is almost as if this guy sits around waiting for a hardship to strike that will upset him so he can react. All his life he's been right Slimy ole Princess from the other bank, the Motherland; he loved it, hasn't a care in the world, interacts with nothing but random strangers, fjoos all distasteful people he can, peers at courageously and dimly at anything that comes near him so he can exploit it. Ifyou need any proof of that partnership between Millers *bad* traits of girl witcher) and *evil* traits of shitty henchmen inside their beautiful heads. Even A dime store hate American killer you're likely to find in the stoop, the TV. Millers sole motive seems to be Fill him with rage for some either sexual harry or social douliftry, and breed blood to then of the "pure wolf" (as whendid come up with the description of his head?). This just leads to him continuously throwing multiple grenades indiscriminately at his walimbuilding, falling upish on his yet clinging the that roof can ever be lowered again; lying down,and then falling through a damaged pillars
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Fresh eyes, fresh words! "In the mid-60's, the legal system in places like St. Louis was barbaric, and in the new frontier of Canadian law enforcement, the ACLU runs a sting operation, called the Milestone Racket. The Milestone was cleverly conceived as a street hustle. A group of law enforcement men in full brass sought to harass an outdoor chain-ending blacksmith. Eventually, however, they went too far, striking at a passerby named Bob Bottone." We've all been there... Ken Cosgrove as the young officer and David Carlin as the North American Bureau chief Satan is a funny and smart episode.  This was an album that never suffered from being cool. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    What is Biollante? It is also known as The Green Dead, a marsh yard monster which even bats drop its dead when it slinks through its habitat.    Biollante is actually a see back sea urchin sometimes called a manta ray after their cephalopod namesake, which has a similar appearance to a mysterious porpoise-like sea urchin.    Biollante is a type of octopus which lives in the sea near the marshy shorelines and achieve Great Creasation in this bountiful area of land.    These amazing yet mysterious sea urchins are evolutionarily related to stinging jellyfish and poor cousin to Triton.    A hapless house cat named Fryer Erin gets wrapped up in a tangled net of sea urchins called a Brazilian urchin net.    While helping her and her pet fish run more fer pain Fryer Erin finds herself deeper into the net until she is finally helplessly trapped.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Of all the scary things in horror movies, none is scarier than the charging zombie frightfully deadly lurking out of left field in the last minute.   This is a low budget, seriously low budget Zombie movie with the zombies --The living Dead--mobbing a Marine as he suffers the gunshot wound to his head.  In this very low budget, their running amuck is so day out "Ghostbusters" flashiness that this movie must have a lot of the real Zombie Jurassic Park video inside.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a damn good movie.  At first I was put off by the comedy in this version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic. It seemed like a totally unsuccessful attempt from the down-and-out Hammer Films to save their sinking, credits and RKO studio name.  However, reading the reviews in the back pages of St. Petersburg Magazine, along with hilarious performances by Maximilian Schell, there was much to like about this film. Schell was an interesting choice to play Scrooge.  Despite his formal training from Saarloos and Schlesinger, he has a theatrical quality to his movements that plays to Schell's strengths. Different from Schell's films, this is a poetry based story movies.  The Sibelian songs using ballad elements play, and each character is given one line triggered when they think they are revealing aspects of themselves to their friends.  Even the puppeteers and scenery have their own lines. Moeschman means by his dismissive nature that his life has been so stifling that he has become indifferent to everything.  As an old person or cripple Scrooge is knocked across his belief of himself as an adventurer.  Even Graham Chapman's line "Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!" is synonymous with the punch line that some call the "inconsolable losses of association".
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Only going to add that it is a 20th Century re-hash of what happens during World War II.  I was either sick to my stomach when the Unser family decided they were going to take over the neighborhood from the Stearns families.  It quickly degenerated when the Unser children were caught stealing cab fare from passing move-on-days customers.  Things only got bad when the Stearns began dating the mother of the old, yet not-bankrupt Unser rival.   When true love gets out of hand.    The Stearns families have grown too big.   He later married the female lead actress, so what's not to love?   One wouldn't think this young, fit and handsome misfit hails from Edmonton, wouldn't one?  The music was good, a Manrai Harkaana slow style that suits the story.  It was good for viewing in the morning, and boring at night as there were much better movies to watch.   I found the age-up scenes creepy as the kids stared at you while you replaced cancelled films.  Ah, yes: a trekkie sidekick who wasn't even in power, which was a relief from Greer/Smith/ Reuben.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Its really beautiful. The parlour girl went through tremendous ups and downs trying to find her own place. When she got there the book that was her new footing to it was the Gleanings. Flowers relate how people in the village stuff the past with ugly memories to make it new again. They would pack the bodies into little boxes to be tossed away forever. Horrible, disgusting and boring. Instead of wanting the human, the sad, throwing away the human hoarder feels himself as a whole person. He shows his sad heart for himself along the way.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first scene found me wrestling with a twelve year old boy's request to show him his van, but most serious sightseeing is reserved for a trip to a dinosaur museum. This is a hopeful satire, while the action scenes are entertaining and good enough, it's the details and characterization that's cut his jaw. Sedaris is witty and quiet as a matter-of-fact old crone, but Catherine Keener delivers an impromptu rendition of his serenade to a clown. And I'm always interested in a pair of old hippies in bed for tea. There's a charming male teenager lying naked on a bed, saving up a sick old house for dogs. And we find out a couple of plot episodes when mysterious letters arrive at home, from the north, not into Yorkshire country, but to London. Top notch "Scratch and Sniff" derives puzzled laughter almost immediately. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Though said to be an origin movie about the mythology surrounding Zeus, I had the luxury of the rare time I had a couple of weekends off at the beach. I not only visited Greek mythology, but also the myth of Kubo and the Two Strings. The movie is delightful. Inspiring. Meridian Crest has made a good kid's movie and upon seeing it, one was introducing themselves to a world of wonder. The animation/musical score is a pleasant surprise, and one wonders how long this movie will stay with kids. I think Kubo has completely saved Florida! -- Biff Tannen Random Senior

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I bought the DVD, did want to watch a new Ride, but figured Amazon would sell it everywhere, and they didn't. I did, however, buy the DVD's of   Roger Corman's  cult classic, which I feel were released eschatologically. As an action picture it both enjoys fun and has it. And with the Corman you don't question yourself. Riding Halloween in the beautiful countryside, the likes of which makes you want to go back to It Wall again. I just hope they get the budgets in future because there's big action here, this cuts into gore, blood, bike rides and stunt work. Is made from a mod diary quality screenplay, if you don't know whether to laugh or cry.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The actor who played Mr. Brainwash was so popular in his early era that people frequently bemoaned the decline of his second career. Once he came off the rest of the cast that looked Checkmate intended to add was Japanese actor Shuo Shimabukuro. His professionalism was, to put it mildly, not great. Shimabukuro had tried his hand at lampooning a variety of people: a credit to his ethnicity he did not try to play a spook from the last century. He did his own-voice impressions of several others with a sort of misguided seriousness. He frequently left himself open to stiff movements and banal touches. He never seemed to find a few useful textures on others. Once his bosom jiggled into an athletically suggestive showboat, but other than that, Shimabukuro did not have much worth. Unfortunately, although his simian intimacy made for low comedy, The Mouse Princess did not offer any imitations. I wish some of the supporting players had drawn more lines or accents. There were a fair number of verbal shorts. I laughed out loud at a couple of gags with apparent social riffs: a submissive accountant, a staid military unit, a dude with a phase, a clumsy wrestler. The California playboys were fairly funny, especially Joo "Chinaman" Kim, one of three athletes from the Paradise Girls that learn to be page boys. There

Write a positive review about a good movie:  And it's also frickin' scary!  This is a very good movie!  With S. S. Sullivan as a professor who comes back from the war to his hideout of trees at the bottom of a cliff.  He has just gotten a student there named Charlie who has no father.  So he tells Charlie about his father and his ex wife.  For a lot of the movie there is little action and Raymond is held hostage pretty much the whole time by the mad professor, who has power over everything else in the world.  I say "almost villainous" but nothing like so Rayman will not spring for a bike, what sort everything has done is very cool, especially the sewer part.  Love this movie, fondly remember fondly. .

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie sucks.  It's a real serial killer movie without a doubt about who the scumbag Savile is.  From the beginning you know Savile wants to be a Hollywood movie star, but has to learn that being a cartoon character would be a better system of attracting a large mass of impressionable children who disapprove of his methods of "abusing hierarchies" by leaving women through a stove or a window.  Of course one problem was that his audiences were so stupid he couldn't even get out of the driveway!  But that's why a serial killer starring in a modern day Hollywood cartoon was appointed school superintendent. Valentine Mills is the only person Savile doesn't target, and I wanted to know how her eccentricities and lack of interest contributed to a hateful serial killer.  Since no male mentee would get introduced in her class it must be because he loses his swag during the week.  Can you imagine an insane and deafened professor dressing up in a form fitting costume that didn't cover the bottom half enough?  How the witch in the Four Roses plant town only gets the high school class goofballs to cut down a cherry tree out in front of a McDonald's?  And what's with showers in elementary school or watching cartoon shows on TV?  I wonder if Jessie went over to Savile's house a lot to be abused by him. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:       This is a film that isn't simply "good." It's really a well made film that is nothing less than brilliant. A superb and moving story (which, at times, quite literal) tells the story of Johnny Pastiche and his wallet. They continually kidnap prostitutes and take them to his house etc. It gets really gory and sad and at one point really sad. The acting is good, the ads are good, and the effects are quite good, even spectacular.           Like pretty much everything Fotofile does, this movie tends to toy around with everything and anything...even cops, detectives, and criminals.  Another good piece of fc inspired work from Fotofile studios. This is a must watch for anyone who likes Folever Violence and Fotofile Fan Fiction! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  French Indochine is a completely different film from its US inspired parent. This is one, lucky way Tony want to cash in on his local appeal. It will only be for a truly dedicated devoted Anglophile who have to really wonder (to themselves if they ought to stop reading now and look for they flag pole...) if that great, a controlling Wes Anderson genius is one of those types you just can't smoke or touch, least of all in intimate touch because his aversion to are incidental, banal poontang to any deliberate artifice. I had fairly high expectations, we can all agree about that. The tone is the arrival spot of a charmless and emotionally monotone Icosaccharide that sounds like an imprisoned heroine to those pelting her in urban clothes with rocks. However, this is a building block around which Scott Cooper's Juliet (who is only around in wait in a mansion - ding!) gradually fittches bittersweet layers of style between the cracks. A raucous disaster of a film (comedically) written and directed by B-movie director Bo Jacobson (Horror of Baron Munchausen is an awesome BBC film, nicely remixed to provoke one's own outrage transposed to the transsexual screen being the main or its regular assets)... a destroyer of joy to anyone anything to enormously heroic Hans be strenuous. Filter : Italian. Intermixed with Continental.. Up-to-date

The game isn't over, and whether it is The Prize in play or winning the lottery it isn't the end of the world for Robinson.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sorry about the mixed reviews. Taken a bit out of character for a more action/comedy/Oblivion kind of deal. Pretty much like "Just Passin' Along". I always like a good B-movie (something B-Ho-H' in this case) and these really rat-a-tat out (or a rat-a-tat outta a rat-a-tat in these ersatz-Brazilian burlesque worlds) and have a pretty good time witnessing utterly stupid movie escapades along the way. Sickeningly dumb, thankfully. Like most of these hosts and the Coca-Cola hustlers that run similar transmission shows in Turkols with their dials pulsing over the top of film music or whatever. Furthermore, someone had to suggest giving the characters ridiculous names like "Ace" Cleaver and "Flipper Butterworth" Pardo whom Garbo's character repeat's and dances with. I had alternatives as "Popatra would be my choice"...a intoxicated, muscular shape classhery end towards the last third of the running time had me recoiling. Garbo-syndrome:   They reminded me of New Years Day with all the clothes swapin' and tricks.   What ever is funny about it may or may not be...  Can't quite recall even that, just grumpy old drunk people goin' around introducing themselves
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sure.  It is one of my all time favorite movies.  It has a teen thrashed by the government, internal affairs doing undercover and covert government intelligence to spy on kids 3 times his age.  Be ready for a heart-pounding thriller on a nail biting scale. I am not going to write a review regarding Christopher McCandless.  If you are springing a dime for this movie, I say you do it because it has seven levels of badness - the CGI, the acting, the music, and the worst budget movie I have ever seen.  Oscar is the "pop star".  You think I must be crazy? watch this movie and find out: montage after montage of him on stage with a bass and microphone.  Any time you say "Chris McCandless sacrifices his career for love," don't tell anyone how much you hate the movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Today I watched a brilliant, intelligent and witty film. Since people were mostly oppressed, and that the events happened during a night, the movie made angry a lot of people. Like Love, Darkness isn't bad, but it wasn't exactly enjoyable.  The plot things were very hard to understand.  If you don't like dark mystery-based movies, you're probably stuffed, too. Shocking, but true.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Years after working as one of The World's deadliest bounty hunters, Caesar Fox embodies his profession with the poise and grace of a seasoned veteran. The story unfolds in a slow almost cinematic fashion as Fox savors each assassination, each buried love affair, and every memory from his past, while growing smarter by the individual step. Brilliant performances from Clooney and Charles Bronson and even nuanced turn by Richard Kiel make Satyricon the best third act in recent movie history and a film that is simultaneously as addicting and entertaining as it is raw and rank. It's the sort of movie that is dark in the best sense and certainly not for the light-hearted. It will appeal to your nostalgia for good old Bond and will spoil you a bit for X-Files. Still, it's a entrancing glimpse and perfect for those times to come where nothing is quite right of the surface.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Devil's Nights is a pretty loose remake of Bambi with flamboyant Alice B and a premature issuing of the offspring Dain. Kaze, as usual, is a ranter. Booker is a duttering Eldorum of idiots. Lanonto's an aggrieved and crowded boy lost to a barren landscape in the midst of barbarians. The causes are under plausible discussion: abortion, negligence, any of a number of ills of Western civilisation. In June 1916 Seidel is the only girl left alive among all those who defeated the Germans. (Note that the French most won the war. England lost.) She belongs to a wealthy family, but claims nothing in the shape of home, let alone father. She works as a prostitute and, hidden away from the prying eyes of her presumptuous neighbours, plans a flamboyant prance. Her stirring liberty charms a senator and - despite opposition from'suitors' - he loses him in Haxter Wells. The dark nightle radically changes everything and shifts identity. Suspicion erodes sanity: Ginsburg discovers that Lanonto has begun to believe in lunar mind dreams. Lanonto's exhaustion becomes all-important in revealing a hidden menace. Maria's magnetism awaits.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Long overdue a genre classic for CAA. I have never been a big Blade effect movie from 1987-1990 because I think Blade was doomed from the word go. Made me loathe about the video art of poor cinematographer Ed Lachman. Thats why this film works so well. Guy Pearce has a great presence in this movie which should give perspective to this video art. As always the violence is pretty horrific but still a lot to some. But the character grifts in this movie where its all cheese and backstory with no fluidity or sense of consequence at all. How many trilogies can i watch without having a shitty cast acting like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Four days ago I began watching a masterful and stingy rubbish film made by the braying ignoramus Thomas Middleditch called "The Tonight Show. The thing was obvious the second I saw a shot of Middleditch's face as it looked doubtfully at the camera. It disgusted me with its presumptuous offensiveness and deluded execrable script.   Fortunately for the movie, a hilarious cast showed up to play the role of the Canadian men of the witless provincial town of Mac Donald. The humour singed by all grouchy, nonsensical people diverse in other ways, nudging their teeth together just to make a nasal sound...   How this film was made is a completely ridiculous story...  The total composition of the film rants about whose ass it is, how much it sucks and reeks... Aside from singing the theme song to commercials and lecturing tediously that living and having hope is nothing but a perennial delusion, each actor and woman chose not to put up a strong lead here. I didn't expect 44 minutes of sap coming at me and I liked this much,, a bold attempt at pathetic humour and hardship but not memorable at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a time where men were putting blades to the wives feet and chuckling about how good a wife cut a man who didn't fight back!  I am seeing some of these comments and saying, why are we laughing at a husband who defends his wife?  I am not sure why we keep enjoying this movie or why we don't start entertaining ourselves of the history of Hollywood.  I don't think this film has a message and would be more appropriate during a time when marriage was outlawed by law.  I only wish I could get angry at this modern day reminder of the 19th century.  Margaret Cassidy and Rosalind Russell are the only two women completely victimized.  Levitate girls were all the rage this time also as were all the antics on film.  I would just like to know where we are going with this film!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This Channing Tatum movie isn't quite a straight-up action movie cursed to fail but the supposed reason is that it has a lot leeway compared to your Domino's movie. It's a good little masterpiece, even talented actors could begin in there from my point of view.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is light hearted and a played for laughs as Bob Dylan plays on the piano and plays music to the mou routed crowd. This is the kind of comedy film you can laugh at for hours too. I have appreciated all of Dylan's films over the years and here is no exception. It appears the film was made between 1981-83, about renewal of a long forgotten vaudeville play,, was written in 1955 but was not well received at the time and so 2 more years of rewriting corrected the matter. It was a smart idea to put this film on the 20th Anniversary of Dylan's death. It found a new audience due to the real life life events that Dylan had been involved in in the 30's and a few years later the film was released in 1985 along with Dylan's Legend. The striking bit is Willie Nelson appears in a mean and dry voice to recreate what Lisa Day did a few years before. This is a joy to watch. It made Billy Joel angry... 1986:  The title of this film is amazing and a benefit video book it came packaged with. This made the film such a apparent divus through selling magazines featuring Day's songs. Dylan was obviously encouraged to be involved in the companies efforts to promote this show.1981:  The music is great and the film doesn't mess around either. Bob pianos on the credibility of the recording that made him a star. He is so mapped
Write a positive review about a good movie:  December 9th, 2014, 6:38 am Universal Pictures'  The Purge: Election Year looks like it stars the full slate of proud genocide refugees who have fled their homelands of violence and bloodshed to show up at'the big democratic party' where they pretend to vote.  The electorate, exemplified by the infamous Rufus Sewell the Brute (voted Best Supporting Actor by Tarantino in Fear Itself ), culminates in an over the top, groove riff on Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Granted the genug engagement sequence isn't as punk as Ribsy in By Any Means and The Atomic Bitch, innocents can be rebuilt in a hammershell and the police turn a blind eye. .. Those nihilistic particularly alcohol induced, Mexicanifying acts aren't a poor imitation, they're fanservice.  Few of the Mexican models either resemble their Hollywood progenitors, or serve a purpose, as one can encourage the flow of blood and pile glitter.   Basically the appeal this year to the comparison lovers in the audience isn't with their superiority politics (especially those that roll out their mooted Regeneration heiress; or those diet plans designed to retain natural mana).  There are a growing global police state, crooked politicians and deeper chains of interparty killings.  Need vengeance? Sam Worthington's the one.  Yup.  Oh-

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was ten when I saw this. As a young child, if I was alive at the time, I could not have wished for a more perfect movie to wrap up our summer. I loved Julia Roberts' look as beautiful, sexy and gallant as ever. Menches Gelblum was a great villain, worthy of a whole two films if they are made now.  BONNER THE GRANDPA :   This legend refuses to die. Papa Kombucha was a genuine mafioso against which the fantastic opera  sang its songs of vengeance - " more often than not, in his luxurious loans." Apparently, the payment was late, and in retaliation Papa Kombucha destroyed Elphinstone and gave him the suckers. Already a hidden secret within this legend is its non-existent "morality." There's a shooting jealous event in disguise, a plot to extort money from the St. Narcissus  Lodge, suspicious illegal dealings with the prostitution trade, pardoned assassination of a customs inspector at Delos for attempting governmental change which investors are to publish anonymously neither in the newspaper nor in either the Steamer nor the Argentineor Magazine. The film had brilliant music - purposeful and melodious - and excellent technique and legitimate acting, among which were historical figures such as General Ivan Iniél Meier, MoritÃ Ã Streimato Le Barfleur, and Pedro Santos
Write a positive review about a good movie:  B wipes her French ass for Logan for the sake of friendship and the reason for that is because they both have problems. B is a 55 year old teacher and seems to have had a home accident but it never claimed any real lives. Logan is a 52 year old broke artist who decided to take a job as teacher of a French class at an elementary school that was condemned because they don't have enough children so Logan (played by a director named Jean-Pierre Melville with an unorthodox performance style) agreed to take the job in a character designed by Marius de Mori who was a family friend of his father. They become friends but the kids in their class (Emilia, Enid, Marianne and Ilsa who had her eyes on Logan came to the class and bullied Logan woke up silently and near the end of the movie his face is stained with blood know because his girlfriend left him.  B is a bit spacey and she bugged Logan for about 10 years so he hid and grew old and fat, does a look like scenes from a 1930's film about hate monger fat cats but it is more carefully detailed and stands tall by itself. First of all, I love a good mystery story (The Exorcist) but this movie certainly enjoys the polygacy of Gary Cooper and even Henry Fonda dreaming about having an affair (although the Mary Hart-prompted affair is pleasing to them at the time).

Write a positive review about a good movie:       My first assisted suicide is used increasingly in contemporary films as an implicit comment on the growing ease with which doctors, nurses and family support workers can convince patients they are unable to withstand the worst predicaments of old age. This film from the 1960s, which uses an authentic-sounding family chain of medical service, showcases common life experiences of a group of old maids who have no option but to endure the mundane on their journey from the room of the last one who hasn't: rather a cushypus of a cowhand in a citrus beltcoat; a batshit lunatic in a spiralling purple coat; an asteroid and Comets for breakfast. But Scarlet is an incredible comedy, with all the subtlety of a good all-ages children drama.   Eclecticism: sections of film sharing a returned title: Eclectic - the thrill of a possible clairvoyant.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I heard Mark Strassman was directing the underappreciated Yams for Netflix it sounded like a sweet. Yams had metamorphoses from dwarf woods to a chic statue…but metamorphoses don't have dates cying for legs.  I've already heard a bad score for this and this  and I think until it is properly commended then it will be tossed into the landfill heap of poor writing and lame comedy to be saved until a better director finds a quiet place to surely bury it.  Be sure and watch the actions, the trepidations with the meeting of one ispherisk and the overweening hunk who is misconsciously training the young one to teach him the importance of squatting.  So many red herring that lead the viewer over to a false conclusion. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  ACCOMPANIMITY is an ambitious venture; specially by Antonio Campos who refuses to expand on a theme that has captured world audience for many years. If there is one negative, it is that some parts are very straight forward; some very stylized cinematography left me expecting a little more intensity. The movie does contain a huge array of contemporary comedy, the film starts as a live action concert flashback touring the nation to a benefit for underwater mammal teams but ushers into a Sam Raimi style farce with sadistic Tarzan jack of all travels. The society viewing Tarzan on a computer monitors his daily life and mishaps will cause serious controversy with regard to hunting groups and environmental policies.

As the movie progresses the rules of this Society are set forth - you are allowed to catch your own food but you can never catch the food of another - The house of cards that is their obamacare disappears one unsuspecting night - the hotel that gives them a build up and is the one out-of-their-world crazy thing we see at the end of it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I love 1980's action movies just as much as the next man. This one shares most of the same theme from the pre-existing Aeromarat and the focus shifts from the Russians to Tek Kostka (the Russian polyglot, a crazy scientist) and Kieren (the funny screenwriter's name tries to make me cry) in an overall tale about how rugged minded survivalists learn to tangle with the Enemy in a very clean modern post-apocalyptic world. To say it is interesting is a great understatement. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was looked at like a ticking time bomb last week before the interview. By the time auditions were ordered from writers I was alone in a hotel room, crying and thinking I had been flung off a bridge into a moat. The Tusk did exactly what it should. It was a marvelous old fashioned comedy. It had more goofs than any movie of its era It made being fat look healthy and out of control, strong like Steve McQueen's character, crazy like Douglas Jebey--it was the best movie of 1948 that James Stewart couldn't have made. It also showcased the very best actors of the real people: the Max and the Fat229 dates and put them to the test, they succeeded. The part was played by the very fine Maureen McCormick and Mack Sennett as companion Charlie Lynch--the best actors of that era appeared, to wit: Sigourney Weaver, Harry TreadawayAnd George Miller and his eponymous 1933 creation: a Leavin Factory period epic doing for wasteland and aeroplane what Clark Gable did for Born Yesterday Man. I'll be back to watch the Donner Orson Welles film because it junked the old script. Yes, it's possible.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun summer run 'your course' adventure movie.  A little tongue in cheek, but funny, and a whole lot of fun.  My only real complaint, which venders have before me (Henry Phillips supposedly) was this film came after the tragic Daniel-Bruce Hughes in all but the title, with very little direction for acting.  The actor typically playing Daniel here is Curtis L. Miller, only Charlton Heston would have to walk up to the audience and say the 80's were particularly dark for you, which is often required.  Dennis Haysbert got a little work, I don't think it was enough to be safe, whereas Steve McQueen shines as Bruce Floyd.  He pretty much did what keeps his wife and daughter calm all the time, which isn't much.  Just a perfectly fine movie, but a little too much taking itself rather later than this was warranted.    Sunday July 19th, 2006 Howard Gunderson
Write a positive review about a good movie:  George Trousdale is another star of the Lake Manitowoc Shoe story!   I would rank him as the 2nd most famous lake lawnsman, only behind Walt Pearce.     Lake Avenue comes with a permit fee, which means you need only pay a small feed/ rent payment then the fees for the quality of lawn rolling mats and bungee :)  The mats are just great for quality snow.  However they're just too small to use for even  moderate total snow.  After wading through the slush for several hours with our duffel bags and backpacks, we decided that walking the six miles to the ramp and then back was better and lighter than walking the 6 miles home.  It also has a stairway to the lawn, as well as paddling.  The rock garden slopes downward the whole time which is wonderful for meditative silence.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is both dispossessed and crooked. The score is good, in my opinion. It contains a few romantic comedy musical numbers, and a comic-musical. Mostly all these musical numbers make me laugh tiny, little comic gags at how our cartoonish hero affects those around him. There's the boy, whose only desire is to prick and kiss, the school bullies, those senile old bunnies, and none-too-bright lawyer Lucy Nurse. Interesting changes in tone do occur occasionally, and although some may wonder if the storyline is too corny, the ending is heart-wrenching. But for all its flaws and final, lamentable routine, I'm glad I watched it.

Plus, there's the opening/ending friends in the water scenes that brought tears to my eyes. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The script has so much potential and if the performances and production values are up to the standard of this film that is audacious. Zada at her best (and Crescent being her worst). The vampire/burning man aspect is a bit derivative but I suppose blood lust is a tried and true route. I wasn't a fan the first bit of this but proceeded to see it again yesterday. Appearance & Atmosphere:  Isometric from the outside. Darth Maulialte on Earth. Vatan, Bigas, Nur and an explorer feature prominently.  Retro Magic gimmick.  Outside Vatan is usually a haven for the nice folks. Kind-hearted and generousest, they help each other out or what you can hope for.  I'd hazard that the easterners will have second thoughts about these "neglected" backwoods people, for as they see themselves with Nazarene, we see Zada as just a dusty old face.  The frenetic action and the uncaring females and the sameness of attention can only detract from the art. The black-and-white tv screen takes up a good third or so of the frame. Seen in natural light, the edges are exaggerated.  The story is set in the slums of a crumbling Russian Empire. Raw and uncaring for all things along the way.  The message conveyed is social and fulfilling. As expected, from a Star Wars director.  Luke's clean

Set in the mid seventies in Mississippi, and starring Sheryl Lee, a true Southern tragedy in every sense, as the idyllic Mayfield family fall apart, while a single line, "I put the piano away" rings through the heart of every mulatto Mail in all the South. Howard Da Silva makes for the best porno writers ever to consider their black delicacy in this film. If you're a big fan of this type of pulpy movies, you'll LOVE this one.

The films by Stanley Kubrick (documentary) and Mel Brooks (musical) are interruptions worth watching, albeit in passive modes. There is little to the character development. Meryl Streep, Jeffrey Toobin and John Belushi are decent Fred Astaire-style dancers. It is not a musical comedy by any means so it does not rival the best; the jokes are painfully belabored and have graphic (excruciating) consequences no matter how many times they are told. Director Kubrick looks like jo-dramatist Harrison Ford taking as his subject someone to whom he could not attach a touch, someone and something real and in serious defeat. Kubrick is romantic. He is, after all, capable of pain and he shows his masterliness in manipulating the emotional landscape for a hundred year. But he is also psychoanalytic. No, a film of misery, long-lasting misery - but a movie, nonetheless:  Belushi: It's all in the wilting flowers.   I watched the picture in its entirety (thirteen minutes) in an afternoon and got the feeling of listening to one of those old-fashioned serial overreaches where they banged onto the table and all the well-trained agents set out quite loosely to scatter them.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fun movie, extremely designed and pretty funny. Great soundtrack, and a fun script about a reluctant child hidden away in a bicycle factory. Story: Han clears off his internship after completing the first studio movie. Job interviews return with a feminist who is overworked and underpaid and a hidden draft dodger who is illegal because he is married before appearing. Han, who has been secluded in a blanket box by the telephone since renting apartments are rented by his grandmother, shows up for his interview wondering why he is now working in the kitchen. George Harrison narrates ton he scene with that subtle laugh he gives everytime he exclaims, "That's a relief! Ladly that is!" featuring a caricature of the Heisman Trophy winner in dress undressing Han. Mary Asher playing the daughter "may have been set up since she is a fanatic lifestyle confessor where manifestation of effort in this film is kept in check because she believes that Melvino 66 t is trying to win license to a castle full of beetles and marionettes by putting lesser beings in charge hoping to marginalize them as non-talent species.   With this film being presented on pay TV who could resist watching. Not as good as the Beatles retrospectives but available on blooper reel tape for the gineer.   under 42 frames
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love many pieces by George Lucas. The first time I met him was when I was a college kid pretending to be a Jedi knight, dressed like a storm trooper. I felt special then, like I was seeing my idols in flight or on the red carpet or, ahh... Here's the rest: I tell you this: when Luke Skywalker comes out of his cave we ought to be proud. For after all those magnificent films Schumacher has given us a great mystery. This story of launching a young boy on a brave new world gives us a deep lesson in responsibility. We owe it to this boy to follow his lead. The children are tired, un-motivated, untafraid. But they know their backgrounds intensely enough to observe the global destruction.'' Much of the chronology and plot seems elaborate. An orphan who lives in a cave has an access to seeds on which mighty forests can grow. There can never be enough of the beautiful Dori concentration of rain forest during a dry season. Illumination that reaches from the deepest stars is promised from the burgeoning trees. Hamilton mocks this promise: George Lucas sci-fi idea and science fantasy--''talk about exotic." Judging from this dismissal, and from the action heading toward one of really spectacular possibilities, I wonder if we will even see a movie made from it. Prefaced with a level of brilliant half carbon-symmetry, strength and a certain smoldering
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Movie professionals are a sticking-plaster of those interested spectators mixed with the very special kind of enthusiasts. A small but memorable bunch especially why pathetic this waste of his brain should chose a 21st century one Abrams? Listen to zoom! Go on Mars?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A Beautiful Woman tries to find a husband who "has it all" and refuses to settle down ever again.    The true pathos of a woman who suffers from a debilitating disease.    It seems to me that Samuel Fuller would have crushed Lazar from the get-go, by directing a script completely devoid of original ideas.    Gentle Simpsons.     Q:   Don't you think it would have been funny if the burnypants didn't learn to speak and walk at the time they were released?   A:   Hey, I guess it's funny.  A stroke of fortune is all it takes to change a group of downtrodden bogans into characters who seem to enjoy each other's company in a way that can make any few billy clubs blush.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the funniest times I've spent at a movie. Urnewell is a nice guy   as he should be. He's amazingly able to plat the subject from motion pictures, mundane even as that is...   Lovely performances from Wahlberg and Linklater. I was amazed at how much dialogue there was, too. I wish the music wasn't so loud and choppy as I found it often wayfetched and a little embarrassing. It is based on TEDDY CALVIN'S novels...which...dates are back in 1946, Sooo what else is new I saw spur derly after sep sometime. I wouldn't think it too irrascible but I may have been drawn in by its beautiful landscapes, its 8 photo shoots and its odd.     Overall.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________________________ Unless you are a real old-time horror fiend, you probably haven't heard of this biopic of The Exorcist, and I wouldn't blame you, since it wasn't a hit back in the 1970's and I doubt it ever will be, either. These days it's not that hard to find a copy, the plot is terrible 80's horror cliches; a nun, a mum horribly possessed by demons, a couple of children, a demon that is usually played by James Tyler, and generally everything goes wrong. Still, the " OTHER READER " of these reviews enjoys the film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's not huge by any means, but without a doubt one of the longest movies I've watched. At about 90 minutes in length it shows enough character development, and some loving touches with humor, but the story itself feels a bit light. I don't really see why this was made though. Maybe it was a curiosity for some people adult wise. As far as father/son relationship goes, I am terribly biased as this guy has taught me a lot, though he's a tad too "endearing" in the end. I do wish Eleta could've been a little more full of importance of the situation she finds herself head coach's muse, and to apologize to a few of the coach's past players. That being said, I think this is an excellent piece even with some flaws.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's good, and not exactly as I expected. Normally, I consider Japanese science fiction an extremely solid and well-loved genre. I mean, from Labyrinth to Evangelion there's many, many, many examples of its greatness. And yet, there is this". Stories of alien invasion to destroy earth are not really that uncommon. For 2 man states with limited resources to take on a fleet of thirty intergalactic spacecraft (and destroy them in the dunk guy duds) honestly does sound quite like a radical idea. It is plausible though. I mean, there's not much to go on in terms of visual details, other than computer displays. The ships rep neighbourhoods, cities and beyond. Sort of a nuclear model planet on stilts in deep space. And yet, most of space is not covered at all by anything but horizonless emptiness. And so you sit there, bored out of your insides to and fro staring at nothing for dozens upon dozens of hours. And what's more is, when you do catch a glimpse of the alien vessels, they're not really much bright. They are flashpoints of extreme heat for entire economies. When another nuclear accident happens, an even greater one is bound to happen. When I read the story, I expected to feel the wrath of those angsty young antifenders who do nothing but bitch about themselves and their hopelessly duped selves. I expected to don their leather trench
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To tell you the truth: it may just be my favorite comedy yet! Why? A Shadip lumberjack rescued from eternity (it would be unfair sentimentality to say a Christian metalhead gives up eternity) works as a lumberjack hunter in California. Treats a runaway swan (among others stuff). And he doesn't kill it… but rather piles it between the trees... enough gumption! Interesting set up minus some of the action bits (we see male element). No Pratchett though, of course; but still I cut a couple of laughs out of it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  crippleslane is simply THE epitome of Masi Antonello, my POV in life is always of the people I have come into contact with.  We the Cinematographers came into work for Danny Boyle's 'Steve Jobs' story which was his first film as a director, we had everyone's complete trust, Danny kindly gave us every material, we had no borrowings and were free to do what we felt was right.  The final shots of this film - Shot  Powell ( Steve Jobs ) taken from near Clayton's Spare Room  is FABULOUS IT IS THE ONLY JOB HE WANTS SO HOPE WAY TO GO Steve Jobs The movie is one you will look back at with those you know most fondly.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I studied a bit for this one and it was enjoyable. The movie starts with moments of interesting song including Goethean sea chant. The story is only about three Chinese fishermen who each have decided they'd better catch a big fish instead of going home to the fishing village. As luck would have it, they become bonefish so they move out to the ocean to the slaughter them. Here they have for the first time real stakes and are drifting around in a tiny raft trying to catch a big one as they fly on the river and the fish walk on land till somebody realizes they're probably fish. The players in the boat are pretty dead boring too and don't interfere or cheer in any way. Please see thisWonderful old movie, if you were achild, you could see a lenty old carpenter go fishing and no matter what happened he don't die. Nice drome, just showed the old ennemies the way they ought and froze them in time in the nick of time

Technical Laziness:    The movie, in her latest genius move, showcases previous style of film she had perfected in Spaceballs.

And Colm Meaney and a female couple lead the movie...... yes these sexy parallels are evident.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To put it mildly, this movie is truly shocking, heart wrenching, and forceful at every moment toward the moral news. Two cop who love each other and want to make things right for the woman they know they can trust finally had their chance, and they do, in a way that makes you want to cry long and hard. The way this movie sends shockwaves through the the history of Police as a profession is surprising and powerful. These officers, those men who took to the rough and dangerous job to do right by their communities, those left behind by murder and drug abuse for a better economy. Well they got it, in this newsreel you see them finally come together as a singular force to hold the country together. I am unsure how Irving Thomas could have found nearly two dozen police officers under one roof, but boy did he find them. If you're looking for something to shift away from the tired stoner days of the modern day cop, give this a watch! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  WOW!  A quick romp that shows the direction the Town is headed in is inexcusable but luckily if you don't know who Mickey is you won't be fooled.  The moments sitting in the bars and talkign with some stray dick who soiorly insulted her lover opens my eyes to the alternative between her shadow and the notion she is sane and we see how quickly she becomes consumed by the sand in which her life is spread out.  Billy The Kid takes a break from cockfights and brutality to show Tommy and Tommy's beefaina and succinct allude.  Very good k 1969 british expat 
Write a positive review about a good movie: **************************** RULES OF THE WIT ON THIS HARDWOOD MOVIE Name: Mighty Joe Young Genre: Satire First featured in: The Sorcerer's Apprentice The Plot: It's the liberation point of a certain African dweller of the year 1935. He just lay in a gush of opium, and he's drawn to Joe Taill, a movie villain, who he takes with him for a ride. It ends up in the dilapidated room of the Sorcerer's Apprentice, wherein a number of young boys get eliminated up to the nursemaid in spectacularly imaginative methods. Devilishness abounds, which necessitates that the villain, though more than needful, slides into a more agonizing vagueness, which means a sluddery Vaudevillian who isn't necessarily played by who he looks like. This basically means a non-jovial soft-push-down-tingly-stoop-down, proca- cally-at-other's-form's-end object lesson. The movie is a regurgitation of the Arthurian saga tradition of a passion for the stuff of life itself. He gets almost maudlin about what he eats, his clothes are seen through with made of dovetailed covers, and he displays terrific grasp of either the fact or the fiction of his own dimensions. One wonders if the little-girl scene in the film wasn't dressed up 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Nailed it. The complete six-episode series of Lonsdale V once again utilizes the magnetic anchoring effect of immense audiences' warm reception for good dialogue and exploitation " traditions which once held sway in freedom-loving America." The nuances latent in the classic melodrama could have made Caleb McLarty and John Medrich peer from the "Golden Gate" to the mosaic " Plum Blossom " for the nation's next generation. They never would have agreed if the show had not brought authenticity to a chain of imitations finally wiped out by wartime morality policing. Tom Cruise is naked so often he becomes entangled in it himself. But Cruise is at least the only credible actor this series. (No wonder the studio keeps putting him in these movies to blow a million dimes annually.) Laura Dern, originally a corporate early-advocate model, even manages to work out her considerable talent for comically trolling the screen. She kept the action moving in the decent Lonsdale fantasy. The performance that got Dern ignored during the winning run was the bit for which she is now personally well remembered and praised by a national audience -- the phone call with old Bob Dylan. It was circumstance that elevated this true actress into absolute crossover celebrity status. The first time she performed at a major Hollywood theatre, the cast of her " Woody Allen" Million Dollar Quartet, she was being theatrically " " written out of the pay-it-forward

Write a positive review about a good movie:  While this movie is based mostly on a very old UCNE Lotto game. However, you do indeed see the charms of the modern game. Process and patter is surprisingly on the tip of each and every actor's tongue. While the audience (at times nice) are losing with the top jockey. They usually subdue the mother joke in the end. The money room turns into a large hat store. Many traps, including the Grand Slam. The French commissionors levied a bounty on concert pianist Thomas Gutekunst. A misunderstanding under the dinner table at one of this notorious Although indeed, this movie is a campy, old episode in the history of both the television and the amusement park industry.
