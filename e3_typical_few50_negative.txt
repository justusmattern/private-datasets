Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a huge big fan of John Carpenter and he is one of those rare characters that swims in an ocean of horror, ideas and ridicule to make an even a deeper impression on once total ignorance.  I mean this guy is the Gorfish  hail Barnum  of pulp movies.  Ultimately his downfall is the unwarranted hatred directed at this mediocre film which takes itself way too seriously and treads upon the subject matter at hand.  I guess we can sift through the logic this poorly written film stumbles with, unlike many other neo-noirs which recycle the same meaningless components of noir.  It is an absolute shitshow that is like a muffled rain to the face during a train ride.  It's a plodding machine where nothing excites anymore.  The writer's apparent ignorance towards psychology, well, anything.  Something that one finds courtesy of Christopher Walken.  Walken is so new here, has only played almost a handful of roles over the last several years and despite it being a revival of old material he serves little, if any, purpose here.  A pantomime clown sprinkling spaghetti on hard boiled eggs.  While in her hotel room, the wife of a wealthy security manager is having difficulty breathing during a night hike and a couple of passersby turn out to be bats.  I can catch a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So, four tape players, just enough tape to make some chrome originals, a young salesman (gibberish delivery), a young town clerk who likes to dress as a energetic cowboy (usally wrong on his pre lithe age), the force itself, the Hawk mask playing a half broken tune, and an angry world recovering from exhaustion, annoyance, and terror.  Sitany (Kutasha Soobets. Kozira Kamskasin'), a pre lithe, figure almost Susan Wayne-e's boy scout is having a hard time professional womanizing in his apple pie native village Tochka (Ivanedian Polis).  A color will not do to depict picnics in the Western-styve toflix-land of Kazan.  Wes Mason played in the heavy black industrial film is a kindred spirit and child relater both in laconic delivery and gold of counterphrases.   project Movie icles a history of Western Lublin.  But what does a movie about the over developing science of movie and humankind have in common with the actions of an ambitious young supplement of a far eastern rabbit warren, a hostile priest, a thing in the jungles called a Cobra, and cynical surrogates manically and horrendously their enemies?   #?h midflight @QtvpDB!y!t@z 111Doego 3FastAbel (l
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  too much is being said and it undercuts the very purpose of this movie.  Why do we need more scenarios of Bruce and Hannibal dealing with each other?  Why should they waste time falling for each other when they could just exploit their shared environment,  two twenty-something doctors who joke about their ages and get along, superficially?  And why should Bruce stick around in America when the manchine clench constantly and you can't work in the woods for ten days?  What if Fassbinder had done less slashing, maybe set the point of view earlier and better dramatized the repercussions of an inmate's suicide (See: The Island or Ob-la-di! Joe or Misbehaving Beth, he is excellent, especially with his deadpan 66-year-old mother--a departure for him too), more Lemmy, or more The Rat Pack? Perhaps great comedy is taken for granted when no one even tries and is always working that specific brand of comedy that Walser favored?  This is silly but I don't know if I'm wrong about the camp factor ending for the movie (at least to my bleeding heart).

With hoards of geriatric suburban tramps filched from now one long-dying head of the potential gang stopped at least from promising another round of black humor. There was a brilliant sidelight to charlie's—riding his canoe down the lily pond having found mystical magic blood in it... against the will of the altar built on the convergence of the rainbow, the galaxy and an invisible indistinct green density a guillotine was dropped through vocal chords... at that point he was a priest.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Continue reading...   Saturday Assistant: The movie opens on a small coastal town in Oregon that catches a solar flare and is promptly abandoned. Armed with a backpack containing a gun, cubicle-skipping video games, masturbatory videos, and a communication device that secretly transmits and receives texts, the protagonist awakens, washed upturned onto the shoreline in the middle of a cataclysmic tidal wave. To his astonishment, he bears witness to an aerial view of the apocalyptic city a mere century later. Fortunately for him, the key to opening the doors of time and deceiving the fate of the world is just before him, hidden in trash cans stacked in a one-lf supermarket. Arriving just in time to prevent the world from fundamentally altering into an ocean, this time traveler struggles against a particularly nasty waves catching on the archipelago. In desperation, he has to quickly tack for the psychological means to control his bad luck, and deduce a stayed fate from a certain hotel room. Intrigue and nature-beauty girl complex Considered as the calling card of the director, this movie by no means causes him to draw back enthused. Aside from some artistic criticisms, this is somewhat improved all the same by humorous moments.

I probably liked it less than normal, but I'm still sorta like, "This is something," so it didn't bother me too much. Oddly enough, it wasn't really bad at all. It's kinda funny too. Funny,if I do say so myself.Talk about ironic!   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Great story, but poor execution.  Mike McCoy's story is nothing to write home about.  His screenplay often features co-stars that have no idea what they're doing either.  The acting style of Saltzman was terrible and he tended to imitate fast acting, a major problem for probably the worst movie ever made on the silver screen.  Not convinced by the initial production and sound geometry, one really has to look elsewhere for a useable story.  Lucas Aurelius used it to make some money, Stonehenge used it for a coin,  but Belichick used it for his choice of a football team. What i think makes it that much worse is that  in spite its characterization problems (Denver and Striker the Great Show)  it is still bad!!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie sucks.  When I was first asked to be involved in making this movie based upon the book, the one about the retaining pond of Durham Scotland (dinosaurs) I thought it was GOOD.  EXCEPT THIS SETUP IS BORING  WHY U DONT SHOW THE PRIZE.  When Dino is running around with a fish complete with electric hair, I'm not even sure I'm interested in seeing his iron hand doing its work.  The action sets are interesting, but again none of them are impressive enough to be an action movie.  This movie is 100% a sports movie.  When an arena is made to tear this idle beast to shreds Hollywood was happy and its okay at the end, but there are many things to like about it.  Is there anything of real merit or artistry about the movie? None.  If your here thinking to see Dr. Dino audaciously treetop walking to the enough place where we understood that he had become extremely skilled, I can assure you this is a movie you're not in for. This film run amok just jumped into "confirmation bias".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched it once, and after sitting through eleven minutes of its unwarranted fan excesses, it burned out of the entire frame, bubbling down into hiss and all around unpleasantness. I don't even know what to say -- I seriously checked it out just because you have Einstein funny. I was so hungry for page turners it drove me hazy. This is what happens when self-absorbed actors talk to each other and fiddle around with pieces taken out of the library and sprayed on crap. I might buy a Lebanese section book of everyone's favorite twosome in a notebook by the time my film is done in a few weeks. Only then will I realize I feel the new themumble.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For a long time I was mad at Tom Kelly, so it really sucks that Kelly is a mess with a movie that leaves me wishing I had a better one. I can honestly say that this is my worst Tom Kelly film ever. After information about Jim Sturgess' former stint with the military, Kelly's character goes on a "leisurely" rally in which he passes off his basic ignorance of geology, while spewing a lot of sexist insults. If Kelly doesn't know what's up, then he surely knows what he's doing. I don't even generally do reviews like this but Kelly's film absolutely scared me and I found it hard watching.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This movie has one wonderful feature, and one wonderful regret, which is this: I'm watching this movie at my friend's house. I come in off the bus, and shoot the breeze with him. We start talking about life, and the first thing that comes into my head is how superior Santa Claus is to all the little evil variant parts of Mike Myers' personality. ("Surely we can slug this like hot potato!" I'm thinking, as we approach a diner which seems to have opened its doors to breakfast only a few hours before I arrived.) Then I realize that I shoulda seen this movie when I was younger: Mikey is a supply teacher at Santa's workshop, where Santa spends the days of the winter teaching plumber's basic skills with the idea that the plumber will spend the next few days cutting down trees. Some of the victims have guns and knives pointed at them, and the early death count amounts to a chorus-reciting version of the volume of life featured on the back cover. ("Andy, Jesus! Come forth and say Hello!") Mikey typically manages not to draw the attention of the Pine Crow Squad in any way, himself, although he has had a good deal to drink, and this movie is not particularly subtle in its Joker- play style. Mikey has an affair with a young boarder named Kristie, who looks like a living cross between Megan Fox and a child

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                Seriously, Batman: Empty Arkham is not a good movie even by the low standards of slasher movies these days. If you find any consolation in this rather shabby outing, they are spoiled right from the off as the film is titled as such. The hero of this story is the smaller and sickly Bruce Wayne (The Kevin Conroy of Twentieth Century Fox to put it kindly), locked in a prison cell for murdering a gang of teenagers. The rest of the plot is pretty much arbitrary at best and pointless at worst, even though we do get to see Batman in action with Robin who has an insane amount of power and gadgets. Whilst nothing beats Sylvester Stallone or II Gary Oldman as Batman vol 2 (Solve not one little thing) or the 1990 film Batman Returns, you won't miss out by skipping this Renaissance compatability. Kinew Atole was a bad bank robber when he got the part of Major Lane in the 1989 Tim Burton Buster Keaton film Springtime For Hitler inasmuch as it was a critical and commercial flop despite its impressive promotional campaign, and odd chappy comedy-man Fred Loder was cast just for the part playing him as Santa with a heavy South African accent. The action sequences were full of gunfights, knife fights and a vast amount of gib (just don't confuse this with yawn), Sl

It is hard to get a good sequel out of a bad 90 minute movie, especially one of the memorable monologues. It is lighter so that I got to sit back and feel like a kid again. It is also like a Prince film in a jewel case. George of the Jungle is all over the place sounding like a souvenir you bring home with you on vacation to do it ALL over again....stuff like this made me feel bad about them all going behind the scene - just why do actors keep making these horrible rip offs!!! I Hate This:  - When I saw a skull and bones mummy I was quite excited, but then he shuffles around Cliggana and Hurkes head and runs into the Den. Then goes back!!!! Obviously a stand in. - As I was watching the free pole of the funeral package a screen went by, stop or walk, then I heard a human scream!!!! Of course._ and the crowd then went wild! I would hate these "Elite" pulling of trigger happy poses, the re-enactment of this wonderful piece would be great in a great movie like DTVCD!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is really beside the point.  The roasting of the white felon is well done but looks like the three performers are tracking exactly both the roasts and the executioners and the production is flat like a beach shack.   The horror in the film is contrived by the stupid cop with his clay people props.  My shock value is scheduled to go (BOOM) up to a brutal level (BOOM), not to mention the way he shoots a woman is boy drops (BOOM). It certainly shows there must be some rawdata here as the film is showcased in 1985 but how can it not have aged.  Hugh Grant is like an ugly Fourth World politician that has had a royal pregnancy........mercenaries storm the post offices as well as concentrate on screening films there to induce a fall out (Be secure). It is like they are in oven or at home watching TV as they eat. Blair Stevens brings surprises and contributes with a bevy of the odd zombie film, in his sad little film.   10 / 10

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'll be quite honest, my first thought upon seeing this was "How the hell did I end up here watching this crap?" But in reality, the positives outweighed the negatives; it is one of the greatest amounts of satanic horror I have seen in a while, whether it be the set up perspective, nature of the character, or the execution (one of the best for me, IMO. A truly incredible horror film.) Can't say a whole lot about the story, as it is primarily self-contained. Zander our guide has been found wandering the just buried town of Mountainville coming to the realization that his childhood seems to have made no more impact on him to any which degree than it was in the beginning. What would normally be a crying poor child turned to the edge of life and dropping, becomes a demon Possessed by its own worst impulses. His interactions with the people camping in the small town go as mayfly.

We're talking about actual real writers and film makers who know exactly what they're doing and why they're doing it.

The cast includes: Olivia de Armas in her very first American scene (not bad, since she was best known to American audiences for being in The Bride of Frankenstein), the great Molly Shannon (one of her weakest roles ever), names like Jason Donovan, Rocky Choi, and Lori Brierley, in very low-budget child-abuse gore-fest.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Wrong kind of science, wrong kind of adventure. Easy to screw up automatically because of that, first a door just drops in a pool of water.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't think I've ever said this much about a bad movie:  It sucks.  It's boring, repetitive, shot-for-shot remakes of other boring and repetitive remakes, with no hope of improvement on his career path of rising the rank past 'ridiculous'.  (How) could an actor who barely reads, much less writes, get up to make so many mediocre Masterpieces, that involve aliens bursting through windows, sexy ladies who don't grace metaphors and laughable road casts and loads of melodramatic lines to smother us with.  It "a film by a real greenhorn" who then goes on to do better (I dare say) directing by far, and thereby further obscurity/wasted talent.  If this was a grocery store THERE WOULD BE NO BULK in it all; ONE INITED AND ROLLED PLAIN, LIKE THEY DO ALL THE TIME, FOR PIXIES TO BRING UNDER THE BASEMENT.  I mean the only way it could get a cross word eatig red ink in this review is not if a bathroom stall hit me the end of the movie, but if Donald Trump went for one of those robots shipped on un-manned living transport vehicles out of his father's garage.  UNLUCKY!  That's how "Jungle" should have ended, because God knows

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the real reason they sell HDTVs. Starr and Plum were to blame. Starr was and probably is in love with a brunette in her teens. The film deals with DUIs by Gardendale and a monkey named "Thomas" who is a student of Atlanta State. Who is the "Francineness" and just how bad can things get? The movie has heart though. The acting is good and all of the well-known high school students are in it and it is quite set. It's a home movie that is worth seeing and remembering.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Welcome to the 40th Street Inn... Which is getting expensive... I was recently at a restaurant on 40th Street on Fifth Avenue. I was being suspected of drinking Belgian beer. I said fare it was a cloudy day and after diluting it with water I did rum.  Then I started to feel a headache. I brushed it off with Tylenol, aspirin, Emergen C and IV.  Luckily I was still in decent shape and was able to go to the emergency room without incident.  After the EDR I was sedated, washed and weaned from the morphine but I am afraid of the ER.  Recent news is flooding our streets of the possibility of a fire and apparently it happened very early today in our hotel. According to the witnesses an ember shot through the blinds.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A terrible idea that should never have actually gotten off the ground; depressing, angry, utterly without a shred of thought, driven largely by revanchist violence, tools to divide many and a whole lot of people into factions under the ignorant but dumb leadership of the increasingly uninspiring and ineffective Rai, another narcissistic Diamond Jimson (James Coburn) taking position atop the menacing Dome with his whambump parliamentary voice. Worth the risk? BORING! I don't want to see a more boring spook-fest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   His entire communications with Roy Kehan on the 1980 Reagan Campaign seem highly contrived.   Whilst this movie still shows us that there is no reason or logic to voting for a Republican at all, it seems we're going to missed out on some of the not so good things about Reagan and video tapes.   An eagle-eyed viewer will notice that every single subsequent camera/camera wipe is a moment unaccountably high 50% lower than previous ones.    With the rise of the video tapes, my only hope is for a documentary film detailing the negatives from the Reagan campaign tapes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Get a grip! " There was nothing going on and nothing special about this movie.  Like other good 80s low budget comedies which exist, it focuses around crappy high school students and the teachers which will finally kick them all of their asses.  The premise is that is the 1983 movie of the same name about 15 elementary schoolers and their teacher played by Mary Hartman.  The only thing saving this terrible movie is the music.  The music was on par for the 80s.  It was done well, but conceptually terrible.  This is a terrible movie filled with asshole teachers directing their disgusting students, who are riding around in air-horned bikes and playing "computer games".  I cannot wait to see all 10 remaining students in this movie grow up.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Even if you don't think  the production values are boring, you have to admire their superior voice cast and a bright, thoughtful script in regards to what they're selling.  But, I hate to say it...the quality is just the opposite.  I can't quite make out who I was supposed to be laughing at most times...brother or sister?  Why does Bobstick get leaked into bottomrocks so often?  Did Kathleen get bigger?  When I was watching it on DirecTV, I managed to collect the episode "hangs over Marietta Square" live.  Does Sandra think Ross is going to break up with her?  I recorded the guys going to Stevens...and in that episode, I saw Elizabeth McFarland, Jodie Foster, Mel  Alparian, Dorie Corrigan and Elisabeth Shuemper.  Oh...seven cast members in one episode!  But what impressed me was the delivery of the acting....around every corner. I've got to wonder how many more horrible takes a low dole work is willing to take before they give up and get an acting teacher.  So...thanks for being on DirecTV or whatever they were calling it, I want to watch that dumb excuse for a show again.

Pretty good adaptation of a David L Plant novel(also by the same author) - But, let me warn these simple folks-Please wait your cases until after The Darth Vader Saga is complete and until increasingly F-cked Up stretch of episodes.

Intelligence is a crime.     The movie lacks a fast plot.     The actors lack any emotion, and acting is comical.     Finally, the action scenes seemed a bit exploitative.     Still one of my favorite low budget horror movies.    Part of Adventure Time Original Series.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I haven't seen an American movie that i feel treated the producers' goals with less respect.  There is a moment at the end where the camera pulls back, which is exactly the perfect moment to serve as the opening montage or note to the viewer of a long cutscene. Not television, not even SAG.  It is all in between three drawings:  A hippie...aerialist...Traveling Salesman.  The wary flyer takes a few menacing, homoerotic photographs in the different mountain parks in USA. A typical supermarket example of the Data Protection Code.  The C.P.C. If five features are impressive (all in varying degrees of quality) The San Juan Snake has four worthy, if low forgone, qualities:  Witty, well crafted, and visually pleasing.  A heartwrenchingly unique, foreboding, creative, and therefore unsettling portrayal of the experts' struggle.  Doudou aka "The Sidetracked lost dog"  The objective functions of computer evidence should, function they must.  The technology is sound, funny, innovative, and conveniently stupid doesn't make you feel like it's all that it's cracked up to be.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Recall that "Lone Ranger" is based on an American `Marie Johnston Story' of merry-Going-to-Oashville roots: The `Marie' in the film´s title includes mixed up `Niagara� words (`Captain`: John Bucy), and is actually a tourist (we´re going to Niagara Falls -> Bobbie/Mike)   Of those present in attendance at Hotel Niagara traditionally, the five mainsome are: Mae Young, on 7-day-nationwide world-wide-tennis-stroke-participant; Dallas Williams; Lowry; and Hettie Smith.  Rocker Frank Zappa played Nebraska empty nester (Dick Sanders).

"Zombeavers!" is a whole different orgy of weirdness, ranging from laser trees, talking ants, cheesy and terrible set design, plastic and even a robo Dodo. Hollywood tree people dancing in a living cloth. ALL natural insect life for some extraordinary visual effects which are mere concept illustrations set to maddening low tones and sound effects.

She realizes that she and several men are being assaulted by an assertive black man who tries to take the money and a small b****. The women run into a problem when she runs off to a brothel in New York. The men end up shooting everyone but the criminal who tripped and landed on the guy with the food poisoning.

The story is just ridiculous. The MCs spouter off about people they know who have supposedly done the insane, and sounded way too sober, and the dialogue is funny but is crassly funny to disguise whats going on. Overall, it is like making the character of Jimmy Dean one of the house musicians instead of a preacher and no one giggles.   The interesting thing about Jack Portis is that, although he's obviously a mix of over-aged Johnny Cash with 1950's piano bare-knobbler Daniel Jay Redd, I always thought he looked more like a cartoon character than either one.   His voice is also subtly creepy, like a cartoon character sniffing molasses instead of filing a divorce.    Right up until this climactic rap-off, they've been walking around the GNR softball scrim- mat floor like they were never in sight    It would be nice to know other involved parties or the make-up contractors to provide some laughs but what can you expect from another  movie comic.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        - Unsportsmanlike movie that doesn't even fit in the "B-movies" category of this label-idiot. Many creative directors have tried to draw a cartoon-like image of a young woman who secretly wants to be a stuffed animal, and produces -- in both form and imprisonment -- a pathetic nest of nonsense that is almost black. She is killed (by a peeing bottle) under the farthest possible circumstances, and the movie's title is obviously due to her standing little hearted and never once stopping to make a demand. Ugly, almost inoffensive, and useless. hollywood What we do- We get together and discuss the worst... circa what it what it is- Long missing feature- the anti-vaccine polemic - the link explains it in large as well as small type words.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  read more I think the bad Star Wars movies aren't that bad. Most of them aren't like Star Wars: Episode III, which a bit violent and some criticize R2 constantly, but the bad are not bad and i adored all the bad versions. Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, Star Wars: A New Hope, Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, Star Wars: Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, Star Wars: A New Hope, the bad are mainly bad, and Mr Ewan McGregor is just annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I am online complaining about the script today because... can i get all my problems out of my head for a second?     i like to think of myself as a rational person... but here is the basic brain schema of a reporters brain at work, and it is disconcerting and unpleasant to observe, especially for whites who cannot ever see themselves as anything but the new world's savages. I have never in my life heard a white man express the caption "Father help us!", when a racist maniac shocked his wife and then similarly shirtless his helpless 13-year-old daughter with a merciless gun. The basic victim role requires him to believe that the whites are beneath him and he will lose everything. This mentality has severe deficiencies in what may or may not escape the hectoring sparky ears of White Protestants. Victims are automatically framed as Reddick's antagonistic polar opposite, the tacitly spilling water, whatever not one registers anything about either of them aside from a foreign last name and a little girl (Christie Broad) being somehow rather dangerous for this festival of cannibalism. Goddamn filth nauseating! Dewey gets polluted in thousands of small ways and is instantly transported from lust, into cold and sick fascination, getting shot at by lunatic White-man who could care less about his wife, his daughter, or his life with Rocket. Road Kill is as disgusting for its its genre as
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Tall Man With a Golden Arm (1987) does not have much to do other than on one of the first fantastic VISUAL scenes of a sci-fi movie (has Martin L. Katz in it :-)) - things are tough for the (all male) mercenaries at first... There is a colorful villan named Ekim (Bosza as "Boris"), a strong man with Ok to endure heavy bullets from the space soldiers. His friend and ally Vytor is a gangster hellbent on destroying Ekim and everything he part of :ekim is a drug lord (won't tell whom it's from :)) ;-). Vytor loves Ekim. But his efforts are not enough, he's under duress... Ekim is an exciting figure, a "thug". Somehow- until he flies off in a jet - every scene is colorful... a film which sparks passions :) You see a montage of early Westerns circa 1930s, a couple of old school science-fiction films were used as models. Ekim and some women from the village-women stand on a wall overlooking the beautiful Jacobean town... Luckily they understand who they really are in those films...and then a taxi cab comes so they follow... Much Ado About Nothing (1967) is the one which excited young Pas de Deux - where the theme seems to be leader as victim to his soldiers (further search
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It all goes down to this.   According to everyone T-Soltar is a bully, she's an "asshole" and he's "surly," and, most of all, he is a whiny, self-centered, annoying person who makes people cringe far more than they want to cringe.   Probably the best part is when Eileen ogles her and Bertie wiggles his low-cut underwear at her to prove that he's cool, and then yells at her about "PIE CHARADE."   No, its not pie love in disguise--Mathilda learning to sound like the Hindenburg in one of those movie quick flicks.  No, it's just heckling the teacher by cutting her with a razor scissor and drawing a duck on the hallway floor with his crayons.   Its funny, it's musical, and it was a ton of fun.    My own personal rating: ?/?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not bad, certainly not "windy" or "bombastic" enough (though it has its moments), but damned if it isn't not fun to watch. It is also very well produced for traditional film school fare. The acting is uniformly good, but you really should know by now that the so called funny one is dead serious. His voice seems to be in constant self-loathing most of the time, but thankfully every once in a while he admits to having a pretty plainly pathetic life. Seeing him justify his depression by basically mentioning at a girl's party that the reason he's no good at being a comedian is that he has a terrible love life are my favorite moments. He buries the hatchet with his wife who faded that evening even though he frequently suffers lonely night nights. Learned it more than he knew it should. I wasn't too bummed out that she didn't want to go on a dinner date with him either, because of her military connections (she got a commission later in life). It was funny enough to forget what a poor guy he is. Plus, he never warmed up to his girls. Great B-movie that should be seen too many times. The New Movie: The director seems to have long since cropped out his big nines. Woz steps in. Humorless, yet not comical; chaotic, yes, but with a certain basic drive. Murkowski does seem to be in

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To be honest, I only have bad experiences with American movies. I was not a fan of Barbra Streisand or her music, I was long convinced she, the Illuminati, were responsible for the ice ages. (They are not.) Angelina Jolie is an unacceptable Barbie with a wank problem. I mean, who got to sit on a bed with the fucking mother of his children? Yeah, that is another one. The best child, Jay, is the least interested in being famous (in all honesty, his mom is pretty popular in her own right). Indeed, those poor darlings appear out of nowhere. Okay. on with the movie, starting at the movies just when you typically would wing it. The first scene is a number she wrote, sung and directed, with some accidental psychic intercourse thrown in for good measure, with a cartoon slave woman named picturesquely named, obviously: 'Let Deeble Annie' (or 'Linda') accompanied by the stands, including a very silly little dog named #1, and I'll use a megaphone not inside a theater lol! Some booze/nothing, flash show. And the good thing is, everyone is wearing a great fake poof, schoolgirl outfit. It is nothing like what people actually wore back then (slut worry), or in an overtly bad musical called. LOL! Another Ayn Rand screechfest, but I'm not surprised

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's "The Catcher in the Rye"ome  awesomer  edgy trailing me home  and starting all over again on April 16, 1934. Maybe this is an apt summary of the movie:  Bill Holden plays a washed up Hollywood star who is treated as a freak during prohibition but tries to turn his life around with his kid brother Doc ( Theodore Bikel) and his girlfriend Maude ( Constance Clarke).  Getting played himself throughout the movie, Holden meets with trouble when The Duke (Louis Agassiz) puts his reputation behind him to offer the coulda/woulda's (along with a shady leprechaun) to shoot Holden.  That really showcases the movie's final scenes with Bill Holden trying to convince The Duke to snare a snub-nosed boy who looks just like his daddyo.  Things don't go as planned, either, and Vanderbilt's foul operation is cut short by the renewal of Prohibition.  So, this is no sequel to the original dark tale about a man trying to swindle his way through Hades.  Better to avoid.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I watched this before David Attenborough's in-christian attitude to the human brain on Evolution, Eugenics, Social Darwinism and propaganda.    Ha ha.  In common with previous Cruisers documentaries the Warlord is a self indulgent show off, looking for a good fight.   Anyone who thought that Leviathan was bad before is sorely mistaken.  A great lot of time is spent looking at aliens as complex creatures, struggling against poor backgrounds and far away, simulated atmospheres.  There is no new science and no real criticism of the subjects spouted by cult specialists.  Much of the later Political & economic comments relate to Crane himself and the Revisionism.   The whole footage is worthwhile, although the second half inevitably gets dragged along by the whimsical Swindle of Robbins trying to chat up Kay.  Another good show from Rob's 1990s favorite directors back to back with Dare Devil (1990) and Jane Eyre (1938)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  False Love  focuses on the fantastic and the macabre.  But let me start by saying there are simply better horror films out there.  "Death to all that is Awesome" is part of the Shakespearean movement opposite "Macbeth"  and my thoughts on the film were very positive.  Don't let the rating be a spoiler, at first Margaret looks magnificent, the quintessential femme fatale.  She even turns a normal woman into a bloody mess.  But soon we learn why, she has to get that apple.  Blood flows everywhere, Margarita herself has music apparently banned.  Sparks erupt, bodies break and collapse, but all is not well.  Margaret should be showing humanity, empathy, and reading Macbeth.  But she is, but not surprising.  Margaret is a phoney.  This woman is human, her friends seem human, but her lies are complicated.  Once again there are some hilarious missteps like when Margaret refuses to take punishment on her own body (which again, my own idea, but whatevs).  Margaret looks delicious in her dirty lingerie, lip gloss, bikini, see-through tights and sexiness.  She even has the British expression for men with fatjob,  "You big dick". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really enjoyed this movie.  It had a nice energetic feel and a dark and mature, yet enjoyable plotline, and the film peeked outside tropes to manage to go with a interesting premise and the right cast.  I thought the film had a dark, gritty feel to it, and really caught me with an unreal sense of presense when the main man circus came around.  Ashton Kutcher as premier edgy boxing doctor was fantastic, and a great actor to do such a small part.  The voice work on the dub was wonderful and the 18+ rating didn't hamper any part of the film.  Artistically, it was ok, but that's all it was.  Gus Mack is quite pleasant too, I haven't had much the joy last theatre for him ( raising my hopes or not ).  What I do like about it is not the settings (very now), and doesn't really delve into the setting either.  Only in the end will it travel a road ( right") both away from the sheer NOPE layering and disreputable obliviously lying ugliness but towards more S sensual journey that poses a conundrum never seen in 50 years.  I was drawn to it seeing details of a multiple-character tale that stopped short a bit with Wisconsin as an excuse to publish it in a year now.  The ending
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was my partner's favorite. Tracking him was difficult and I couldn't get enough of his anti-hero nature. He wasn't options antagonist for anyone and use did his job well.  The thrill of racing a racing car isn't for everyone. If you're a fan of some hot poisons you're going to want to stay away from this one. Burnett wouldn't be caught dead acting mischievous so I aren't either. Miss Howarth once again, has a knack for not just directing and writing, but in day to day functioning as well. Burnet and her cameraman promote the business side of Fast and the Furious quite well. By all accounts it's close to perfect ex., with a strong story. The singing isn't bad as well, although May Rodriguez has a tendency to combine acting with singing. Without question this should keep fans of speed in their seats for awhile and that's definitely what this movie should do.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Show Hide I have to commend the director as she has clearly had plenty of work put into planning this movie. The concept is brilliant. Guess what the flower will be that is just lying around? Well, I can not resist the elevator pitch: People on a boring Transit Authority elevator ride past massive building the escalator continues to carry people around a cable car that is now exposed in New York City; avoiding the stalling wind blows the attendants prevent the gears to fall off causing a horrific crash. The lights turn off and someone says, "Patience my friends, patience, we have outdone ourselves this time."  I have to congratulate the Harbor Freight lobby ledge for doing what I cannot.  Now Crystal Pepsi, the mousey guy and Boston downtown hotel roomia burn one another. Rather funny, and both together such fun, yet a bit over-crowded, I guess. Dangerous Nick: Trying to explain the film to people can be like this. Have fun but clearly not fully understood the communicative flow you are using too, heh-heh-heh.  Brian McGreevey's cheap effects, inconsistent script and construed performance are all for laughs, and the humour is not really that funny.  Although the audience laughs, very few at this movie get very far.  ★★★ Charles R. Cross
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp8vPAFbrt0 "American Gothic" is a film about loneliness, emptiness, and a few corpses (like a 15-minute marker).  Sleepy Hollow uses Springsteen's songs as a backdrop, but there is no Springsteen going on the frame art.  "American Gothic" is chain-reaction psychology twenty-four hours a day… its just that way! There are genuinely sad, even mournful moments, so much so that they need a bit of humor, and we're given that with the passing remark Damon and Scooter both give about love.   It is one of the sadder and more realistic movies of 2017.   Finally.... AN AGEWARE OF RAGE!!!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The 7 DAYS IN EARLY MORNING is the type of movie that would repel most people.  The title may warrant kissing a strange fellow in the forehead (minus the shower) to activate the chemical process that constantly stirs that figure into fear and loathing.  The entrance, meant as a warning, is met only by a thud, and then the screaming insistent on being heard everywhere; from the stairs to the letterbox.  Powerful stuff.  Call in sick with family members for a weekend at a seaside cabin make it so much fun.   Whatever the effects were, make a list along with the ingredients of Book of Genesis 50:9 Eskimo Miracle.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If not for  the crazy cruelty of the Father,  there would be a greater chance that the filmmakers would at least have made a decent build up.  The Father is a LOT of fun!  There are only a couple other'recess buddy flicks' from the '70's of that year that had as much fun execrable:  Kelly Quebec's Endless Night, and  Stanley Kubrick's Flash Gordon and the Shadow Fighters  #1 in the '40's and '50's.  These were far more intelligent and acted in their own fantastic style.  They also had great line work.  These are the movies to mention that inspired Kubrick as  he started writing the idea for his own time travel epic, which eventually became '2001.'  Refreshments tomorrow morning!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ As if it wasn't bad enough to start with, it doesn't help that the majority of the harem characters or whatever you call them just don't even look that attractive nor mature. They look like the average grade school students walking down the corridors of an elementary school. Coupled with ugly faces and cartoonish voices in baggy clothes or school uniforms only adds to the scenario of a bunch of campy girls trying to make their crush fucking look cool and hip. Everything about this movie is that cliché of a harem movie, gross stereotypes, gross situations, and awful acting.

When a teacher is abruptly fired a principal calls and asks if there is a problem. He found out that she was a sesquipedalian clown who unleashed a menacing internet prank…which is basically worse than all those kid's shows…Jerry gave us the Empire Strikes Boptain type morality/family drama for kids, where one child loses himself in the care of parent "Gus" is concerned that he will become Jimmy Mack. Where he could be a proper disciplinarian, he is anything but and "Gus" charges Hallam for karate lessons instead. We recently watched "Soul Surfer: Return to the Satyr" and "Snow Smile" we expect to see a lot more of these movies or maybe we just want the guys to go die so this was a very good movie with a lot of heart.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********************* This was one of those movies that you do not expect to like. It stars Henry Winkler, who has been doing commercials since the sixties. I guess Fred Savage sees him "doing his gay" and, stunned by this new development, creates a clone of Henry Winkler that is an improvement upon the previous model, but not much. However, Mister Savage uses bank accounts gained from Shrapnel Cammiuren, aka the Pump Gang, which include a pile of Qalops and Black Jr. Ribs. After Shrapnel is killed by a Bull beater, he joins the Pump Gang, with the intent of making it bigger. Mister Savage later discovers that after Shrapnel dies, the Pump Gang becomes The Ranskki Boys, full of rush tattoos and wooden instruments. Eventually, the Pump Report goes rogue and challenges Shrapnel Junior and his team of solid guards, the Orangees. And... Woo, Puppy Love! Honeymooning within a bar has its fine points, Fred Savage being less Cracker Jack-obsessed and relaxt in both frequency and variety. Also, it's a great first movie to introduce me to Henry Winkler, Don daMotorizedPepper, Bob Kerrey... (Of course, I skipped away, but check out the trailers if you don't believe me...)

Its funny and extremely entertaining but just about anyone could relate to any joke it has passed on by! Much more enjoyable than watching a longer loop.  I will be rooting for this one from now on… Ebay…..price, $.99... poor finish!!! ive kept it for a while now….but I'm just using it for entertainment. But if I was Leon Dull and witnessing a single joke it would drive me crazy!!!  These are the type of fun I'm into. We've seen a few similar shows. But, this show has a tight script and goes into a funny live setting and pulls it off! This was one of those shows timing out. Lot of dialogue to read and you can tell the joke midway through, and we start to see how it fits into the larger story and that is when it starts to get good! I really liked some of the big twists. Great movie!  Sometimes a bad movie is... worth a laugh?  ... Yes? If so…That's good.

Cast members being able to talk to each other but were still half asleep, slipping off screen as somebody else moves on to the next role. Beauty always matched the horrible art and the characters acting just as deceiving and crude as before. The music's wacky gags and blatant sex were again right on the nose.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This film has been given a box office standing ovation and a potent emotional effect by English-language critics; who have been over extra-ordinarily kindly of course but slightly sickened by it precisely because it seems to con- tain no actual plot and at the same time nobody quite knows what might be happening or going to happen next. Can that be a parody because the cars are not driven, the joke is the others are produced by junkies, the joker with dead lungs could play a nice harlequin if he would jump through.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I've ever seen.  The movie takes itself way too seriously considering it's low budget and the actors are horrendous.  One of the worst acting I've listened to ever.  This cheap crap is pure trash.  I hope Gaspard doesn't get a gold star for "sweating himself too much".  If Gaspard can't make his own movie after being so successful with this one, I don't think I can either.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In spirit, Kurt Fuller plays itself. The film faithfully adapts characters from Fuller's earlier thriller Secret Death when he strikes again in his final film, Secret Death 3: Awakening. But this time the occupant of Death's spoilt throne is Heath Ledger - still femmably possessed of his boxing prowess but replaced and then seemingly discarded by his Uncle Tony, played in the film by the pseudo-British nightmare Jon Lord. I hated the incessant repetition of the theme song directed by Michael Cimino, which had been familiar to me of the sort of film that later homeless beggars claim Las Vegas rents from them and passes to famous horror writers because it is "too scary to write a song about". Sadly, still less pays homage to the unclassifiable characters in the original. There are no eruptions anyone will remember - this is mostly a domestic horror film in tone, and character dies rather too quickly. I think it was Fuller who said that we watch horror films to keep from watching pornography. What he allows to be presented is revisionist conservative pornography. According to Fuller "it's okay to make a pile of money and marry a divorced woman". You can weed that out and tell this is> a set of potential cautionary tales elsewhere. But you won't. You'll just think it's creepy from each mercilessly presented horror cut like a movierip that Diane Keaton couldn't cast on her own thighs before she bit

It is most likely Khan's nephew to whom Persia Alamqinish [the lead female Jihadi] is giving some useless advice about things like painting the house, painting the desk, painting the sofa, painting the floor, and painting the muslin sheep. The elements are all over the place, and one of the most creative sequences in any Hollywood action movie, or indeed any Hollywood film, is a short scene filled with everything from 70s antiques to ABBA's "Night On Bald Mountain."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  During one of the car races, Charlie (Stephin Merritt) is pulled over and Mulholland (Arnold Luckenbeler) walks in fast, smelling alcohol, "He wentpast something in the windshield and pulled the wheel out." Mulholland lays down a marker, saying he has to sit in the back of the police car because Mulholland is on parole. See why the driving scene is so bad? If you threw seven or eight racers into a boat, Mulholland is probably there, holding arsenic in his trembling hand.  This movie is not worth the price of admission, so don't waste your time going to see it; keep an eye out for Mulholland later watching a basketball team from perhaps ten minutes ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy is a vengeance fest of a movie.   The most "kick ass" character is nobody. General Drax the Destroyer, despite being scary and lumbering, is not a God who can harness the Yellow Sun and summon massive blasts of fire and heat!   Rocket Raccoon is a dull character, without any of the original charm of the original incarnation of his character!   Their love story is interesting, right from the outset.    TV folks were brainstorming ideas for a new show called "Roots" but only found ten episodes to use.     If audiences really wanted to add a "softcore" element to their lemmings-in refusing to stand for the damn border there would be many more A/V scenes on this show!     This is far beyond the paragons of the genre.    FUN, RULES, GO GO GO!      A true blast from the past that all generations of horror fans can enjoy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a terrible movie. Actually, not long into it one would begin to question – despite some OK scenery, terrible performances and uncomfortably ridiculous third act, is this just an entertaining dramatic experience or an utter disaster?  It's a mix, I'd almost wish the end was just to change back to the merciless terror scene from Nelly. In toward the end you're often good-natured despite all the unkind words heroically says: "Then you were loved. And you're heartless! Like everyone loves... you."

AUStar, 89 Bagrova You can't have a bad budget melodrama about a foreign neighbor of a Soviet spy agent. Yes you guessed it. The enemy grew strong because of the klim shows of good work carried out by the East Irish Dudoey (a talented smooth-talking policeman) and his secret friend the Crocodile (a devious rogue martial artist from North Africa). The expected and demand Western melodrama is therefore 15 minutes behind the London picture, 3 Grand Central Drive. The North Africans make a terrific yet very basic caricature of a jihadi gang.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - This is a cyberpunk not-Hollywood film, "From Beyond" is a minus. The clichés and trolling ("check yourself, you amnesiac!") all over it become quite vile with each passing scene. The plot fibers sounded like they were mopped from the floors of every bar and drugstore all across New York. The dysfunctional CIA 'Junior Agency' has been founded in this bad city, delivering people using the 'Chest Tamepaign'. Eylis' reputation as a butcher is well-earned, to put it gently. Very little is ambiguous here except for whether she's an external brutalist or her programming has infected her subconscious with a kid-like hunger for human flesh. If it sounds cruel I'm telling you it is. Why would there be a debacle like this in New York? Who would risk their neck over a 30th birthday party on a Monday night? The final scene draws a possible explanation: Ed asked Eylis to impersonate a wealthy couple which eventually prompted them to quarrel over Eylis' mid-life-crisis'selfies' on their balcony.  …

Write a negative review about a bad movie:         As I have mentioned previously, my cinema manners (or lack of) is something of an embarrassment to my family and I am acting more like my imperfect cousin than a self-confident Hollywood actress. This is the abysmal perfection because I have never read any of the books (written by youngsters) that Robert Holdstock [Old Man Jones], plays in this movie. I never do care to read an extremely boring book, as I like bracing myself against mediocrity and read a tough classic every once in a while. The first 100 pages of the novel seemed so dull I actually jumped out of my seat in horror. I don't want to jump out my seat, either. This book is so dull that I found it hard to get through the pages and it jumped two levels on every other page. If this were written by a thirteen year old, I would have bailed quickly, but this is an author of very high calibre. Robert Holdstock is an Eve Boldacre–leisurely middle aged guy wagging his finger as he homes in on Eve Boldacre's son, Avocados Señor. Just Isobel Pope with more hair.     My avocados on life today, I find, and all that while enjoying very vanilla Cokes at Jamaica, there is some sweet domesticity to the book.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While this movie has some good ideas, has some excellent special effects, and Crisp Mide Gainax's superb voice acting, there are plenty of mistakes that really show this is barely at the end of the road obviously from the development of the story and characters. Gainax takes the time for not only explaining the characters' motivations and which ones actually want to do what, but also tries to give a good primer on how to write a story with an action figure as the protagonist. If you don't know what an action figure is, I hope you will remember this title occasionally as I rarely saw a movie like that and even more especially never saw this destroyed and broken into pieces so beautifully. What happened to this movie is indescribable, but I assume is meant to make the viewer admire all the gold tips formed.   Well I guess it makes a good action movie and is fun to watch, seeing a super powered man destroying buildings is also pretty impressive, even though murder one of my favorite superheroes, I was not left depressed by this film, if I didn't know better I might have guessed the movie was a prototype and try to sell MLM all over again if I saw one without consulting my grade school reading levels.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    That the main characters are a montage of spin-offs from old Tom and Jerry shows I know exists, and that the theme song, which began by requesting "He needs a dose of Sunshine", constantly changed and morphed into various bizarre and disparate musical styles the different impressions Sunderland came up with were not amusing nor helpful.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  C. Jane  is a shallow actress who doesn't have the heart or desire to be relevant or complex in Saga of Beauty. her character draws both her character development as well as her role within the movie into extreme, mindless caricature, but once is manages to get deep within playing the original characters arc one has to question extricate oneself from awkward preconceptions of Gothic tragedy.  It is absolutely is laughable that Snyder would spend so many millions of dollars on this musical who can't even get me to soften my stance against a church!  High Laurel doesn't sing well.  Good Faith  is another dumb scene walking antagonist who seems like he even doesn't know what value he adds to the entire movie.  Seventy-Three vaguely religious characters that I consider to be, essentially, a recurring joke.  Cathedral chanting to a background of distorted, over recited, gospel choir to which god himself - a temporarily depowered superhero - says "Get me that pussy!"  Seventeen pages about a week.  It all reads so repetitive so very repetitive, but with which a nice investment and a decent-- they're wearing masks so it can only be a wizard-- gripe about the attempt of two guys with zero interest in creating a compelling character quickly spoiled and since there is absolutely scum on both ends, well, there probably doesn't need to be any qualms about
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hollywood may be no match for Connery and his glass of Brandy, but I found Conan the Barbarian an entertaining and not bad movie.  While conan was the lone villain I had seen up to that point in Arnold's career, that doesn't mean I hated him as a villain as hollywood made it seem (he was in The River Wild) we had our share of laughs in Conan...and fear not that not everything would be great, mostly because we had poor Arnold and even we geeks weren't expecting the ultimate achievement of the movies!  In my opinion the director, John Milius, could have used one of the faimondashaman move into his role.  The creature, Aything's two men went to great lengths to decorate the forest with electrical wires in order to confine the peace loving wildmen to the trees.  They touch gave it an unearthly quality when Blair Jackson put a great deal of concentration into holding down the acting role of Charnett Jackson.  We all know that Tom Cruise isn't born to play the lead...and yes there were moments when Arnold was building his character into something rousing and rewarding, but the moments where Smith and the part at least came up short meant that we weren't greatly changed.  Having said that this post was spoiled, it lives up to its role as a romance to the beautiful young
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A solid action movie, although one then genre that I could not find. In other words, I liked it. James Bond is good for keeping you on your toes, with separate missions in several countries around the world. In the end, Bond finds himself in a Russian prison camp with Adrian from GoldenEye. Choosing this Bond character to set her up to capture special agent agent 007 from James Bond suddenly becomes unnecessary, something reminiscent of all those movies where Captain Oliver or Bucky saves the day. Bond solves the important part of his mission alone, goes to a bar, drinks some drinks and ends up crashing the disco bar. Ringfinger, again, is excited about the finding a new shiny toy. In this one Bond gets kidnapped by the evil masterminds from the Yakuza group. This trilogy ended with "Lottery". Always viewed this as the ending of the mini series, but in the play one notes the development of the darker and the gentler side of this character, and eventually can read Mitchum's thoughts on this character. James Bond the actor has gotten both his attractive wife Nina and the recruited James Bond even more perfect in all aspects. Weakness: Good Bond movies will always have that group of guys/girls, Haney, Wahlberg and Cuff, sitting in a room together killing anything and anything. Never mind that a version of James Bond in the role from 1968-1992 came out,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film that is straight out of the 1970's by that time basically. It's one of those crappy-o-book cheesy, ridiculous advertisements executed fru to the extreme. I have no clue if it was tried before, but seriously, wrapping octopi in a tortilla did not help this at all; the director even tries to pass it off as food superfood (well, actually it's really high in sugar) which is funny because it's sweet only in the negative sense, and the octopi, really suck here. Not even letttered lets you enjoy them in one piece because their taste is so lacking. They had no taste at all otherwise that would have been totally worth it, but imo the substance would have anyway, from the I slipping mezcano up to a stupid Irish sharp and vinegar and 6 shots (I saw something called 'Batman versus the Octopus' but it sucked). Priced at 18 quid, I reckon if I wantedsomething spectacular this could have been something but its not worth a fiver (drinking habits are probably rubbish).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Jack Davis: "These headphones are the stupidest thing..."   It's almost amusing how much talent goes into making a terrible film. Donald Sutherland doesn't need a part in these and yet there he is in a bad musical. The wrong rationale is given for why a naked potentially wolf-headed prostitute can't attack a peacock, and at the same time another naked possibly wolf-headed prostitute is storming a wedding with a shotgun. It's all wobbly and is filled with guys, wine, confusing dialogue and vignettes illustrating the nuts and bolts of a bad sitcom. It gives a somewhat false impression that this was a clever, fastidious TV show, but don't be fooled as the sausage being rushed along the line is faked - and just to give those with short attention spans an idea as to why an audience member holds up his cell phone looking extremely concerned while his friends all giggle, nothing really matters, and the whole film is the complete product of hysteria.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In case you haven't heard of it, it's a Russian remake of the horror classic Bride of Frankenstein. The undead are once again taking over London as it becomes increasingly obvious that the old scientist's experiments on spawn don't go well. The final form of Yasha, the goofball Frankenstein monster, shows up and manages to give an unfinished Frankenstein's monster a bath in the blood mixture. It's back to court for our killer Frankenstein's Monster, and matters only get stranger as the story progresses. The hideous creatures from the set and soundtrack can't add up to the horror story of our hero Marv Gowman falling in love with one of the women in his life at the teenage goth club, and attempting to give up his most powerful weapon... but... at what cost? English Zombie is one of those interesting lack-luster horror films. The talent that makes it what it is was in recent appreciation had been subsumed by other resources years ago... I've seen a DVD edited version digital copy of English Zombie not too long ago and it was truly awful. But I believe there is more to it than slime and cheese. Coming off a small release was a case within a case: a started film with the odd one-shot of a person dying, nothing in the way of answers, a rather insipid plot, and not a soul in the audience that I could see or hear... except for cheerleaders. Honestly,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Midnight City revolves around a "night horror coverage television movie".  By this they express their need to reflect on how the plague series had become a basic viewing and experience, which seems to be an uneasy fit within any form of entertainment.  I don't intend to dwell (if this is even the correct term) in Repulsion and Changeling, but it is Stars and Rockets that I find myself recalling through this viewing.  Staring at that film's addiction to camp, tempo, and sense, it is fairly entity-less.  In the attended of earlier styles, it is by far the most beatless and transported.  This film drifts through colour and quiet fields of dark flowers, it is as pronounced in scenery and image as Star Wars.  It is like something out of an author of a 150's literature tale, it says sufficient on its own and is a naturalising expression of those characterisations that one presumes are to draw most from his works.  And if one reminisces this to those watching it, it will evoke a sense of irony and respect for the semi-territorial meaning as these three films therefore were Nazaks, Minevil and Cheaters.  Although my passion for early his frightening works has eroded to an overwhelming and dreary loved-one, The Chain Whore, The Whispering Gallery, Bag of Bones, Curse of
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This could have been a much better movie if Pippin of the Poppins did not die at the end after running into a tree and falling off. Too bad that Helen Mirren, the only anyway woman in the film, does not bring any more to the screen for it to be truly a horror film with an amazing score ( a good Liz Polo song also played for a cute ending credits). The film is terrible and not worth your time then at the end.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER!!!   A bad movie. This movie went through budget, and even one star Review. It really was pathetic in each and every plot point. It was contrived, hard to follow, had things that could've been seen as going a different ways nearly two other times!!!   The first time I watched this became horrible when it was obviously the cutest thing I've ever seen. The characters all had space cabins, big full houses, that were like being in hotels that are not full of tourists like they *used to* be. They could drink coke, and still call anybody that liked going to the Cape for little rough ladies at the time. It's like how The Hot Hole was for way better people, or for the people that were either able to fistfight or go to the Cape because they *were* on safari, sleepovers). I caught the movie two months later and it was a complete lie. This movie was one long piece of delights that would make little sense to start with very soon. It needs so many low grades, two star movies because each time they have brutally idiotic scenes that you can not believe that a movie was made that way. Honestly, these dirty inbred going on safari 'inbetween' & more sex, and asking what they're doing, and all that garbage could be followed and you can not see that

The matches are very fast paced and so is the pace of the movie.    Women's matches are abysmal and that is their only saving grace as they attempt to save themselves from their fifteenth ropes thresher.   Reason #9: That horrible Trio of celebrities:  The three judges are replaced by before ever showing up here are : Teena Marie - from MTV (from Full House), the Terrine of a generation, in a sexy walkers skirt Brie Bella - a six foot tall blonde bombshell who is on a zero overall scoring; she always has a rhombus in her ass with red hair and it keeps growing like a mustache; she does a rudeboy voice which is awesome however the terrible acting keeps her from getting anything better aaand she has a actually ugly face Ma Kate - someone I might be interested in seeing at a professional wrestling promotion again Lita - this bitch actually looked great when she was in the ring wedged in a way where nobody could see her bizarre midgets makeup which made her even facier then wearing karate gis  I am sure this is some sort of lip full Extract and pray do not confuse it with Marie Lux lipstick and other products but I can hear the women hiding the lipstick in the next room. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not passionate about the movie. Yes, the movie was of fantastic looking quality and yes I had fun, but it was sorted into 2 smaller entertainment metaphors: 1: A lucid dream like effects. As in the effect from the cartoon ABC-DEF. 2: Gyroscopic effects - You keep adjusting your ability to go awry (view in this dimension Sunday) *As an interesting side note, I found the movie slightly disturbing.  In fact, there seemed to be fairies freaking at my head. I did find an element of being drawn into a mystery, but it wasn't anything very intriguing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I understand the film's appeal by genre involves espionage and suspense. I'd normally be all over those places. Wrong movie.  The acting is cartoonish and mistaken. Some actors should just suck it up and do something interesting with it (like Kevin Reilly in Hannibal).  Ryan Gosling is bad even by his low expectations. Josh Brolin is decent as the kid.  LeVanordesse never stops screaming. Hisham Ghobadi is boring as probably the only thing going for it is that the Sam Hamm serial killer stuff makes entertaining everyone involved.  The moot points are not in if it's fun and funny after all the disappointments it has worn out.  Coda?  No deeper, only more wang, more nachu yu.  So pay those five bucks it costs and what do you get?  A movie this bad can't even come close to a street fighter movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's dated, but worth your time. It's remarkably well made in tone. Ann Savoy starred in this look at a New York City blue-culture cabaret based on the talents of Max Steiner, Dave Warner, Barbara Levinson, Edie Vion, and club manager Vivian Day. Mikael Varela is hot. He appears to me as someone taking a break from The Artist  to commune with his cats.  Mel Brooks was behind the camera for polemic purposes, and made it sing cut-up comedy numbers that mimicked musical comedy, and  he set it on TV (as if radio was in this day) to share these afternoons and afternoons in an attempt to counter Bowman's ramblings with tedious German pieces that resembled Marlene Dietrich's Munich. Bowman is all jolly ridiculous. He sings stagy songs about love. He gives behind the scenes details about infighting with various clubs. He immediately seizes on Richard Dreyfuss and says "Ricky Betts, my old friend, hears about it from Chicago where he went on vacation this week. Arnolds time in Chicago did not help him delve deeper into American theater, so I guess it was because he liked our cast, so he bailed...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Remembering the intense case of heavy-handed censorship faced by Bob Hope's short, early-1950s piece, "Heroin" (     ), it's pretty remarkable that the film was relegated to a 16mm print -- to a one-portion, about a fourth of its original size.     Like a lot of westerns, viewers may think it's a street fight. Some old guy slaps a coward named Clint and then he fights horses to the death.     Mostly Jerry Lewis and Dorothy Lamour with dialogue lifted from sweet ole dime novels.   Still the aged heroes of westerns were generally stronger than the fighting humbugs that fought them, and the film retains that refreshing quality.     Hall-Johnson: "Honey what do you want to do about it?      That Ford was arrested for distributing morphine, and he wrote a suicide letter to a friend: "I was as lousy as a rabbit. I really don't now anything matters to me". And yet, in many ways, pipe-smoking little Polly must have had it all before the war. Already 80, she was married with three children.      "Is Hope as bad as death love death!      There are those who say Hope was a good guy that died bad, but I for one say that

I dunno have I watched a hundred movies I dont know if I will ever run into him in a theatre again." - CB   " Not for the timid ". - CB   Grim dark comedy about a pack of drunks who just can't get laid and can't say no no neither.   Starring John Cleese, Jane Seymour and Billy Connolly.   You won't be able to take your eyes from this movie once you start it. Well known film critic and critic of 'on air commercials.' Reputed for his dry wit for the low life, most other critics came away scratching their heads and being sucked faster and faster into the vortex. While this isn't just another Jerry Lewis movie but if always knew how to put a smile on your face no matter how rough things on Armagh did get. Dennis Russell in the title role happens to act like a complete wanker and John Cleesquall has a very decent part during a Borges inspired dream sequence. Gus Musial once said in an interview that he is the largest jackass in the world. This means nothing when the film is as good as it is. While I could sit here and demonstrate faith in Dennis Russell, John Cleesquall and the audiences enough all I really have to show is some chuckles, but let's face it even the chuckles don't do

I started watching WWE wrestling for the first time ever after this. Sadly, I won't be getting another watch once this spirals out of control and I'm fast running out of time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was a little jaded after seeing A Nightmare on Elm Street. It really felt like several different "remakes" of previous movies (and maybe even some zombie movies).  Something about the style of the editing and making the music into the movie must of made it feel all the more like a remake, and being the horror fan I am, it did.  There are a few great Saw and Halloween references (the whole movie is like one long Halloween night).  The acting is fun and done well - Ellen Page will had laughs in this.  Jennifer Jason Leigh is like a psychopath in a slasher movie.  I tried learning a bit of her formal mannerisms, and she was the only one who could do them well (she was great in the movie, by the way).  It's interesting that the first time I saw this online, there was a comment under it suggesting the film was a direct rip off of the "Incorporated" (15 or so years before its release).  I don't think that was the case (this doesn't feel like the movie Forrester DIRECTLY took from Incorporated).  Most horror fans probably wouldn't like it.  I think it stands alone well enough.  When the subplot involving a shark that needs to be killed is revealed - you gotta be sitting somewhere in an apartment...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Surprisingly, this is a good horror flick. When it first opens, you wonder what darkness this would bring. Anything that's indigenous to Colorado could have happened there: pine trees, cows jumping over a waterfall, teenagers talking to themselves, literally everything a horror film fan may want at another annual peek past the LMT gate. Without spoiling anything of the film for those of you who'm scared by what you see: it does a pretty good job at delivering whatever scares it promises. It sounds fanciful and sounds like it should be "out there" of the norm, but man is goofy, and it kinda works. I could easily write a few more pages with quotes about the newness of Stephen King's stories (I think we're talking about a modern fairy tale here), the eccentric, stereotypical nature of the restless teen. Being worried now just isn't fair. "A Columbus father dragged his mind straight into the search for a child with no face, who was said to haunt the streets of the small Ohio town. On the loose on the day before Halloween, the man was stopped, but the boy wasn't found — made a long way back to the house and didn't come out again. A fire was set to the house and locked in.

Funny lines were yelling excrement over a small wooden room, then the door closed with "FUCK OFF" and roseanne gave a "VICTORY IS NOT A VERY GOOD MOVIE." that cut off his mic and drove him bonkers.

STORY :  It's cliché as hell. Most of the movie is basically the same; The Locomotion team is up against the Evil (yup, Evil bulls, duh) Bad (yup, Bad bull's), and Daddy's Little Girl (yup, them self Carlos Daniels)  The climactic bit is basically a typical teenage boy named Mike who is anxiety ridden and always running around in circles getting killed. He finally happens on a massive bull and ends up circling it enough to hole it up for one of his teammates to get the STUPID SLAP.  This is the classic I need money subplots where everyone lives at home and shit.  As a side note it's interesting to take so long to get a vampire gun shot full of baby j liquid mist?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Big Lebowski is an extremely lazy movie and rather annoying and lacking in quality. The movie has two main villains: Sidekicks Erik Prince (Michael Beattie) and Dr. John Daggett (Harold Ramis) still pegged as idiots but not enough to cause too much worry.  So money is kept well away (with a strict rule about money in tight places) and the commanders of three different forces (one military, one civilian) come together to attempt to achieve one of their hard to achieve goals: apprehend the stinger of the big wad laundry boasting billionaire Donny McDuck (Jeff Bridges) who is apparently residing in a limousine in an abandoned city.  There is an elaborate war between the city and the army, and some of the inhabitants are running for their lives.  It's a lurid spectacle all round with a good screenplay by, uh, Mario Puzo.  The Argentine Jonathan Demme was the director but he was willing to pull out of the picture for health reasons.  So when Joe Simon played an air force judge who had served in a city briefly in similar books and movies this was supposed to be the return to form and the soon to be classic of the genre.  In short it wasn't.  Lazy, dull and lacking in style or sophistication it is a rarities gathering of silliness and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This is one of those depressing white elephant movies that Hollywood thinks is all they need to be successful. If you are reading, write your own review instead of a cheesy review from a slob working for the city welfare. Yuck. Before I cover some highlights I gotta tell you what the opposite of make believe is: sausage building. If there was ever such a thing as a strange idea that could crop up freely in the fiction of someone who doesn't know any better, it's that the coexistence (and total superabundance) of little pork bone bastards is the solution to all problems. Kids are sure not subject to any harm at all from the children in this movie, either because the superheroes especially resemble "good ol' boy conservatives" like Christopher Cross or BATMAN himself (even if Short Round manifests a great deal of anti-government paranoia, I've never seen that coming), or because when they bash on each other in pain they carry it out... with some violence. This should be rejected as thoughtless and poorly considered.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a Chicago native.  I grew up as one of five born and raised here. I loved this town and so did my aunt, but her death woke me up to the hard reality of the earth we spend most of our time around.  It is October when any new grown up thing from down under comes into town, and pretty much sits on the river board watching the train go by, those that are really sure about themselves they are eating, not a peep from anyone on this boat.  Maybe some dreams are hard to believe at town sytem, with such slow pace, a great little visual poem and a heart warming twist at the end.  Robbin small but you will not soon forget this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Don't go into The Act of Killing expecting a visually striking thriller that dares its audience not to look away. This sick, violent movie contains scene after scene of animal cruelty, innate savagery, blood-lettings, grotesque mutilations and an absence of such human distinctions as wounds, shockers, and breaks. Joon-ho Bong is a master of shock audiences and self-parody. The acting is weak and the plot, the soupy, contemptuous, sentimental characterizations are sometimes semi-bashful stereotypes. The action sequences are sugar-coated cave invertebrates that play a ludic charade. Finding subtle humor in real horror is a doddle compared to following a parade of displayed animals who undermine any attorney critiques as "aimed by sheepish people who were going through the motions." The old standbys of burlesque comedy are so degraded that it seems the only thing worse than hideous human severed heads was 1916 farce.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One last Hollywood movie we are obliged to rain down the wallowing of the departed. The sun never shines these days. Oh, what affordable popcorn arks and dooms we delve to in the pits of a headless den to find reasonable aliens joining Paul Torso's gang of smiling murderers in Vivier Ralant. Great American B.F. Skinner was one of Hitchcock's lesser under-paid stars, besides his continuous exclusion from Hollywood. In spite of everything enough of him can be found, even a few movie parts succeed too, in the red- dwarfed Mod Mom and of course one Samuel L Jackson-voice outpost. The DVD prices were low ($16 or $27 to be precise) and nevertheless the film is not squadron top cut out, even here 1986 barely serves as a stepping stone between Poe's knock-offs and these glut of crafty and funniness, even scatological a----holes Soft dreams sweeping through the jaded bog of an evening town. And that's purely not me, at all can't wait for the pointy faces of Sareda's Amy Azrael and Elicyan Azarbarovyev to turned up at movies again. And please, people, "B.F. Skinner" part I is a global laugh riot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    We have an older African-American man who is in his sixties in a big heavy trucker hat and a straw hat over a plaid button-down. His vehicle is a behemoth of a thing. It is at one time full of sensual imagery and positioning and racy situations, but it is also a veritable circus of abrasive comedy and primal action scenes. It's the dumbest movie ever conceived at first: three other guys are riding bicycles, driving around, barely even paying attention, when they are pulled over by a policeman for a driver's license check. Bill is arrested topless and thrown in jail. He is released afterwards for disorderly conduct, convicted and jacked down, then thrown into his tottering truck to be dragged across the state prison system by its stringy chain. Once outside, he's grabbed by the wrist and bundled into a pretty old Jacksonville hotel. Later, he's accosted by some bail bond agent had been full to capacity i've never heard of, and winds up losing nine hundred dollars. That man had two sons on the Supreme Court, Scott and Luther. I reckon Trent Lott is running them. Four days later he is discharged from County Jail. Long story short, he spends the next three years raising dollars to buy a full time motel room with his wife and son. Then a Sparky–blacking new to town–of insolent barons comes running

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        As everyone knows, "Urban Cowboy" is a fake movie:      A film got made about Brown Deer Why?     -- it is sort of a sidefield story about a Native American/Apache who saves his family for a thin time and early on his persistence is rewarded by a banquet in which his family is served upscale menu.      Title makes it a sideshow picture:       beginning seen with only a shooting star and a stomach ache; little is left; it ends at the point that the veteran shows the young L.T. his mouth coming off so that it is a string mouth, and Vincent is chased from the camera for tugging on the bowstring at a point when a shot is fired by one of the ranchmen being accused of wolf tampering. Our L.T. Reed is treated as a small boy reveling in his recent kill.       Here the wise old man dismisses the commotion at once and maintains satisfaction of all needs for the young life, leaving L.T. as a boy who grabs out a knife and a shotgun to good use.      Thanks to Neuman for his convincing story.       R A B U R E is terrific.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a very good variation of The Wicker Man and it is worth watching each stamina last:         :     Known by many to be the worst movie ever to be made (many people have griped about it) The Wicker Man is presented is a story of Woodbine and a Hairy Man who both go metal mining when Woodbine accidentally falls into Hairy Man hole. He wants to see if he can get out and look for Henry Stone and a barn but gets eaten alive and flees to a lodge where he asks his relatives to look after him. The Earlier versions of the story has Woodbine running away after being injured and then finding a little girl and leaving to talk to her and her grandfather. This is pretty much an idea from a Sir Arthur Conan Doyle story and said story is plausible in a way but are then   preempted by The Wicker Man  film, which introduces a long sequence of inane and pointless travel. A fairytale hero with inhuman strength is basically the only character to make it through the film because otherwise the film would instead be rated R and more people would vote Hamlet, Wuthering Heights, War Horse as the coolest movies on Earth.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  1. Undeniably brilliant! Despite its occasionally tiresome inefficiencies and the occasional unnecessary hero, The Flinstones are the ultimate'shrinking violet' pairing. 2. So they're both just one wing clipping away from atrophy. But neither can say much about it. 3. And they're finally harmed by becoming too big for their boots. 4. And I mean ever. After three movies.' John Romero's nightmare becomes The Walking Dead, it's no surprise. The actual answer as to how this happened is too long to explain in words (although research suggests my explanation will ring true) so I'll just refer the ignorant to the "Unnecessary Sequels" section of this reviewer's excellent FAQ. OK, OK... I have to confess I had a blast with this one games. It's easy to forget after watching the cheesy trailer but Ziogre will feature Jake and Riki trudging through an overgrown forest (as if they're on the last few minutes of 1984 along the U.S.A border) in order to fend off vengeful zombies (10,000 of them you see!) and save Camp Crystal Lake. Needless to say I was excited to see this old favourite in a gamer's jacket. I'd be lying if I suggested this doesn't feel like revisiting something old, but what's great about these games is the unpredictability (yes -1982) and the pulpy

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ಠ) I remember seeing this movie more than twenty years ago and being completely captivated by it by the blink of the eye. It may have inspired me to go into comedy when I was young. But it all got a bit shite. Move along with the scheduled page-turner, and here we go with the seriously annoying part of the movie. Or what's left. Poetic justice, dude. This movie started shot to shot as the after-effects of a car crash in the French Alps. A female French farmer (I really have no idea how she lands the role) and her little granddaughter are out after a day in the mountains. In the land of unconvincing adjectives, mountains have excellent faces. This is a classy scenic masterpiece. What really sets this apart is the added sense of irony the film brings into the mix. In one hostel, the currency is called "French 99 Francs", while apparently it should be called "French $1 Dollar". A fierce iceberg sits at the base of a mountain during the ancients days, waiting to break loose - and suddenly bursts forth. What is that above the iceberg? A sect of Tibetan nuns dressed up in Tibetan monk clothes gives themselves giant rabbit ears and make themselves a part of the appearing once more. As always, the first half of the film is very funny, but the latter half is somewhat mean - because warrior monks

A younger Mr. Innovation visited with drums weathered and oiled Pip are his endearing allowentsful in ignoring complicated ideas of how and why they were done by Gershiwin. Sit." While not much else has changed since this 90s classic was first released there is a lot to talk about here. Hoping to debunk one of its huge fallacies. Which in blindly celebrating a shell without finding anything of actual worth or substance in the music is one thing but this tribute - puppet show is basically gonna blind your eyes so that you could have been seeing the fight from the start rather than a caricature of Gershiwin's playing. I would have given this movie 2 out of 10 but for the artwork of the Post-It lyrics on the box it would have been 1 out of 10 wrong. - November 24, 2004Best of Les Mis garbage

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ******************* A couple of crows silently begin to circle over an empty field miles apart. Two quiet boys make feet with it, and play together with nothing but birdsong as the wind passes them by. One's mighty eight or nine years old, his skin dirty and chip white and his eyes heavy with wondering looks. He smiles that snub-nosed grin of his, but he looks scared that his parents didn't let him be anywhere near the farmstead ever since they went away to enlist for the Civil War. Once home they settled down, took up birdsongs and grew feathers in their nose pouches, and ran about in the wind with bare thighs swinging in the cool morning air shucking tiny birds from their bras. It always made my little brother and me day, seeing them rising first in the morning in their stocking feet, then little wings itching underneath, watching them swoop away on the legs of the baby buntings, and not one of them missing a wingbone. No, they were hard and steady boys, never on the romp, never useless or dangerous, and never growing ugly peckers to frighten the farmhands. It was pretty to watch them like that, the way they tumbled from cloud to cloud every morning over the brook where the two boys once lived, until every other bird was the same size and scattered in the air like felled twigs. Night crowded in curve after curve

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I mean, Jesus, it was bad. Nearly ran out of gas while driving to my parents. There was also strange dog noises to the right of me that came from far away in a train but under normal circumstances I'd probably shrug off those noises and drive. No, miss, one train, dark, up the hill, car got stuck in a weed field. I pried it open and tried to drive out. Then parking garage was barely big enough for a small car and it was blocked by a table. In the cupboards with creepy looking birds and an eerie cat. Nearby were things didn't belong: flowers, disescent moss, wet newspaper, ornamental ball bearings from an ancient past. The only thing for certain: it's all my fault. The car couldn't go forward because there were so many piles of hooey behind the car. What normal driver wouldn't have tried to confront uncertainties? Alas, a non-normal condition passed... No one is currently alive in India.

I just don't understand why they couldn't have had a cowboy movie with cowboy songs and cowboy characters that would set a good example of what I expect from a western film. The more I hear about this movie I think I might have to go see it in another theater because I just don't get it. If we are going to be realistic about the western ichotically and artistically as a whole from two hundred years ago to us in the sixties there really needs to be a genre and I don't think this movie is it and im sure its too bad that the big cities were too poor in middle America to be able to support a studio that insured a decent budget to make a good movie if there really were American cowboys still around because this movie is not exactly a toon nor is it strictly reality per se because there is no land or homesteading and there's not even any firearms in the movie in the form of revolvers or muskets and you are not even allowed to shoot the animals in this movie at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Have you ever been looking at a boat out in the bay and struggled to see what was on the beach and only ended up reading the cliff notes about the dullness of the beach? This played out exactly like that and it didn't help that it was made by Dick Strawbridge I did a lot of research on him before I decided to write a bad night at the cinema review but this was a wonderfully dull movie! The only thing interesting about this was that red head is just in your face! Apparently he's alive in the book and supposedly his voiced out of tune but is that funny? no! let's get down to business! this film had a zoom in on her butt! I have to tell you I saw that on the 50's television every night! at least her voice won't mess with anybody! she tries to detail what she wants to do but what does she want to do.. Playin baseball? read? cart collecting? seen a movie? bought a punch there? love? don't news anymore don't like me? hold me tight? Guys.. If you are a movie buff ah well I guess I enjoyed my film because it was rather out of fashion in the late 60's by the time I watched it properly! it made me think of the media people in the 60's today I rarely see a film in this era/making Miss Thompson just make a tease serve her knowledge up spoon head of string straw cracked so

The movie seemed okay, Max The Goth-Ass Hitler with gruesome hair clips like a Mongol from that old horror movie where they cut open faces and talk through the cut hole.                              Welcome to the TRUTH, the half man half ghoul incarnation of Jean-Claude Van Damme (or vice versa!!) again playing a hot-blooded badass with average physical prowess and rather concerned with his own life and the lives of the world around him.  Jerry Bruckheimer made a hollywood version of a comic book and then released it in thier warehouse crying about Martial law being imposed on the country stating that this is the only way to protect the country from a rising Soviet threat. Mr Bland is good in this; but trust me, you will not get the reputable Joneses out of Sunday's screening, unfortunately; being a caricature of a movie distributor in trashy bOsy There is strip club and Disco inside this... Where is the raver who liked Martial law when he was growing up? Long Ernie Ledbetter has a Loki vibe in the movie, his version of an Arnie cartoon tinkerers awl on a freight nail breaker. INCREDIBLY
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Watching bottled-up rage erupt at a Premier League soccer game, made me wince inside my skin. I thought the worst part was when the umpire actually stopped the match so he could stick his head out, take a K, and say opponents "did that" for the Sevilla fans. As if, only they knew how it REALLY feels when your team's a sixth-tier drifter in the second division. Eddie McGuire stalks away to cheers from 300+ screaming Sevilla fans. Frankly, I expected a cup to give life to us baseball-crazed Reds. José Mourinho's "beautiful game" inspired this production, but when it didn't matter?" emptiness was provided from many parts. As the match-winner for CoDonation drained his face we felt fairly empty, although the football with a "makes a an exception for himself" milked a few other grand endings out of it. The exigencies of our "ruined" season said contradictory things about our company. Fourth of July was historic in my eye and man, it put a negative squint on everything. Took a brief look at elderly gossip in Sala del Giglio. Interesting going rate for shopping on the Continent, eh? Shay and I trooped through the stone complexes, the bowed coachwork ringing like freight cars running over the archaeological remains of a lost civilization wherein a couple  of men got a sp

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Imagine a person with no history in drugs and a short fuse like this guy. Studio 4k or Panasonic is a film studio in Tokyo, which financed the movie through lots and lots of money. I once worked for a studio were an executive called Kiyoko Hashimoto carried the presenter around the playroom and did all the mad stuff like drugs and Samurai sword fights, for a laugh. ( Studio 4kk is probably the best studio for run of the mill lunacy like this.) Here the producer says we'll be filming at the Tachibana Locomotive, which is the biggest Japan ticket in terms of size but cheap, so lets kill some birds with Japanese swords and the movie will be worth the money. Yeah sure, Flames end at Austen Gate, which even the noodle loving Japanese couldn't spook the killing of 4000 featherny flickers. Heard the news! Four veteran Japanese ninja describe the film: The director stated that 'the concept is cliché, old like the country the target is and eccentric like the characters' The movie is crazy with its way of incorporating action scenes including poorly choreographed sword fights the stars who are bad at acting. I was disappointed that a day into the movie the main character is not the chief of the 8th regiment and the deputy Chief is not being given a detailed fight scene. The stunt women are out of position and in bad cheering positions. It has a couple of genuinely crap sneaky
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  NO FICKLES ABOUT IT! I have heard that Laemmle co-would play God make a movie that would bee mabbling Biblical stuff. His direction is bad, the pace is terrible and it takes about 10 minutes to get to the reactor of destruction. The plot is about the Nazis and a scientist who has a Nun. It is about these two are to advance their plans to broadly kill off population of the planet in that bad Anglo-American movie where everyone (Leothard St. Varnay) is a slacker obstruction to progress.  6.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      The real faux-pas       As an experince        of electro-rock, Millhouse operates at a 120st-caliber clip. Peaking generically in style at the start, the set unfolds, laughably, to a Homer vibe relevant to the Village People (younger brother Laurie claims to be a new astronaut in 1968). Daisy and her clapping marionettes wallow in perpetual gloom, then explode into harmless weirdness when suggestedwideness to a trip to the moon drags on for way too long. Given more breathing room, this miniature romp gives us a glimpse at a landscape of Scandinavia between Lilliput and Borneo idyllite -- Spock commissioning himself a big outhouse comes to mind. The overall effect suggests the attempts of John Sebastian and Jeff Buckley to come upon psychedelic radiation in Canada near Lynchburg Tennesee rather than a high purpose objective. Spectacular, secret stot-thorn breaks in the atmosphere allow us to be kept in, also, graying glasses by one of the demulratths of electronic musicians, Robert Rosenberg.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       The angryjay has a shady past, but the main flavor of the movie is Jeff. He is flirting with Jeff's wife (yeah, sex at gunpoint sucks) and the couple have sex on the roof of a yacht. Then Jeff goes inside. Oh, wait. The movie doesn't have any sex. It flashes back and forth between the Arcade Drama (which if you don't get the reference, you really should) and bars and houses and a large garden set. At one point, Jeff pays for sex and is decorating his apartment damn near as if he hasn't lived in it for years (in reality, he was just organizing it). The movie ends with Jeff and his wife walking home and having sex on the walkway. I don't know, that still ranks as one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. So what, any cop who got a ride from Jeff's character and mistook him for a hot hooker was that bad? That is a 3.5 out of 10, except that it didn't decline too dramatically in its entirety. I like reviews that point out bugs in other movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  An occupational hazard of improvisational comedy? Yes. No. All the more reason to spoil it for you.   The whole premise of this movie is a bunch of unhinged people being led by Haynes Mason and Kane Hodder through a camera flashing dungeon.  It was NOT funny. Shredding scenery reminiscent of the work of Hitchcock.   As a result, this movie is pretty much unlistenable as comedy.   The first act is laser optimistic Seattle reality tv jock recap.  In later re-writes the whole thing was allegorical urban legend. I don't get it to be honest.   I give this "magnum opus" a one out of 10.   Watch it first!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie will get rave reviews from any conservative straight-outta-Texas hick. The blatant antigay nature of this film combined with blatant preaching (Notice how never the word Christ is spoken) coupled with good old ole boy Republican talk about how rantman Mike Huckabee is Uncle Sam and Jesus Christ and some drippy camp/and forlorn stuff (with a little bit of Jack and Jill thrown in) is all to happy to suit Sodomite men who can't find any girlfriends and nobody around to take good care of them when their stupid slam a fraternity kin chair truck on their foolish nuclear war-order daddy.   If you are in The South Texas area, take a quick pass on this one, you'll get the phony conservative talk on a silver platter, Good old boy United server talk every fuckin' damn time and the movie likes to play fast and loose with the concept of the chapel shooting And the movie likes to pretend the movie isn't about some strange surreality comedy...it's about wearing jeans and guns and god, we're in a shit hole and it doesn't take much to send the ship down.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie wasn't overly depressing, but If Watch Me Prey is too accurate ( less cheeky obviously) The Nazis had been villains for a while and fascist organizations were really popular in the United States. What they lacked in imagery they made up in sheer weight. It was allyoudloseyourself and the Nazis played a very important part in contemporary history..Wintthe Nazis never struck but in the fall of 1940x the Germans invaded Poland. I'm not certain where this was shot, but the Nazis invaded because the Polish government had pretty much given up a Bulgarian parcel.Not only was this a brutal movie ( a bit too brutal.women should be protecting us. when they have to do so,well done. and later Juliete endows herself with a character - Juliete's character who once was in the resistance is depicted in quite a simian pose wrt grabbing someone in a ticklish and messed up position.she was a really good role model as well as a character and a symbol. at least the dark ones are really badness and the recreation of country side street scenes in harold diehermann's 'Spring and Nightpath is to shot into a Holocaust drama...well actually it's a Cineaste and not the original film shot more...guide...It's a- 'Fall Bud - does this mean my next problem is weed,an honest answer"====================================================================Date of film : 2014—

On my way down I went for a tour of the cemetery, and found a spot where a heavy set old man was standing and watching me. After three trips down I was tired and tired of it.

The birth center doctor informs the woman that she and her child, "Ahwardar", feel as if they are drifting, and that they will most likely face cardiac arrest. This is assured. So, great funeral.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   As we all know I find it hard to connect the film to its context, THE ARTIST was about forming an ensemble of disparate art-world figures and then subsequently figuring out which would be best able to promote art in a literary culture that dated about as far back as "Harold and Maude", was the product of idealistic art commissions funded by Jackson Pollock.           Brian De Palma, who was already familiar with that sort of artistic potlatch, had planned to make ACTUAL LIFE a kind of Brecht within a 'Imitation of Life' setting. And he carried good roots on either side of that (his Corman films line up like a truncated RTÉ To Go! or two of Cokireb N _____'s Time Free-number ), but ACTUAL LIFE's Wonder-Stundes and Bertil W itz. in effect played by Fredric March, a Keitel lookalike and Gesner, a Franz Stanfield remake of an uncredited Disney classic, were huge mirthless takes on their respective genres.   The best part of both knock-offs is the previously mentioned Phantom Galaxie, a gigantic costume dream-house holding all sorts of Richard Lawler-like horrors, including those which have only recently been unearthed by archaeologists: lycra gimp police, crowd-killer cats and rubber girls made out of rotting flowers.

Or simply one of th e nastiest women in the history of classic-ism.  Jennifer Kate Conway would never be presented with an actual connection in the third act, in which she has clearly given a rench too much gin, is on her period cargosse royally, and disrobases George Davis Bennett, something that didn't stop producers from trying to latch on to her bright, alas delusional, eyesight.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Easy vs anything more difficult Warrior Solo is an easy-to-get-into sci-fi/action option "3D" sword and sorcery, if you have an eye blush for HD. It's fun, but it always looks like one of those edited sci-fi/action action movies. No point of any battles seems to be realistic. This is like Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, only more cartoonish, but even worse CGI. This is the best thing from that ill-advised interval between "Star Wars" and "Empire." It is just plain lousy and nobody should waste their time with this 1000 dollar clay pot. Worthless. Not worth watching. Sound: This is a cartoon. The performances are based on Pook's pitched tape recording, dubbed in for improved clarity. It's OK. Stillsflow: " Daryl [Manning] and Amy [Pook (Pairen Lai) ] are on my mind.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   John Sturges gave the film a lovely Spanish movie feel! His comic sensibility and loose hand poised around a grave tote were like a white light through a dark forest of die and Mr Sturges never needed much of a lip to recuperate, well mastered by ( pair of) Hoyt Hamilton (the man in the shadow!). There is little graphic violence towards any human male and thus, it is a predominantly self indulgent film ( gay as Mr Sturges likes to be. was a legitimate comedy). The plot is the amusing and repetitive revenge spiel almost a terminal self pity.

Although the ending is a little silly and threw me off a few times as I felt as Robert Rodriguez shooting drunk driving cop killer was a losing move, nevertheless, this was a pretty enjoyable viewing than I normally have here now on the internet.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Once upon a time, early 80's. The odds were very high Operation Runaway (later shortened Kingdom Come) would succeed as a Cold War super-villain film. It was at the time one of the most exciting action movies made...only the cheesiest performances and plot ever can top it. The villain Cyrus Rosenshaw is presented going toe to toe against CIA agent and James Bond doubler Vesper Lynd (Tim Curry). Both the accuser and the accused have a "precocious" association, Westcom and the CIA. It conveniently provides for an easy explanation for why Cyrus "runs" when captured (He can, after all, move his limbs using only his mind). The movie has a Darth Vader quality to it, so I could watch it a hundred times in a row. Consistent in his evil deeds, and generally portrayed as an incredibly evil bickering ideologue, Cyrus is referred to repeatedly. He finds equal annoyance in promoting black entertainers and buying and distributing violent American films. He even boasts to Vesper a few times that they constitute a joint pool of comedians, and girl - too. Later the creature doubles as Theremin. Name coming afresh - Vesper Leary (Angela Lansbury) is an extrovert (in fact a very chilled-out one), possessing the best chemistry of this entire year...and yes - her salacious girlfriend (Claudette Peters) follows her dally
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  the dialogue sucked and sure could be so much worse, but the movie was actually pretty entertaining--especially its awesome climax! :D plus it has well ordered every character and made the lycanic combat absolutely epic! In fact, at the end of the film it has all the classic medieval elements in the form of the Advance/Deliverer and a Hunter, although Kyle is obviously not a hotel keeper! :D
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Thus some people go long years looking for a movie that has a chance to lose because its only around to "choke till you sleep."  It is a waste of you and I just read that a big ship went off with this movie and it will never find the "old Channel" to come back.   Who will miss her baby (save Jonah an a poltergeist too Mr Bourne - see the ribald back to front?)  Recently her sailor father did a waist - sinking on the Thames had several "follow on" vacations before he died.  The poor thing had been to the Philippines and bo put big in his ears and her aunt did him a favor by taking "every -thing" he ever knew back to the United Kingdom so that they will have something to raise the small fifteen year old Cynthia and with the good feeling, they got lost in some deserted hills where the Zombies go all the wacko estimation.  It's a health depilerence of the torso trying to cut off his own genitalia and the short haired bra-switching ass (she likes it that way) who looks (read: HATES it that way) like Brunswick selling women Hoods.  Maybe the only thing that made me go hate-the-niggers is his insanity.  So the war going on then the newsman chanced to have an officer sorry a big dog

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********* This bad movie is the cheapest possibly bad movie ever contender. It does not even have the basic settings. It's war time & a submarine is trying to sneak a message off confined to the submarine. You get those dumb scenes & explosions. They got the first submarine scene from Scream of the Banshee & they got it from more cheaply made movie in future movies. The scene with the monster only belongs in a classic of the weapon of it's time as its an Atomic Edwardian style affair with a tiny sword fighter facing up against an almost equally sizes monster.......a good scene but it seems they just had to throw all the children in a blender & mix them in one scene without a fear to their themes which they could have picked better & better with cheesy special effects...I, for one (in pro-drunk mode), see all cra sequel movies like Sons of Liberty & Haunt of Fear.....absolutely!

If you can admire the idea of a brain playing a horrific game while trying to fully comprehend where everyone was, how it began and who does it belong to -- and a look at KOF Assassins Gunblade as the "Come Doll of the Antenna Complex" and how it is chained up unable to make a decision about if it wants to be a "leader" and can wait for its comrades, or escape and run away, don't suffer in suspense! Afterall, you can have KOF Heartstrings Sound for nothing by being arrested, you pampered "Gangster" so hungry for a quick buck that acting before thinking isn't a thing to be held responsible for.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is for both the 20th Century Fox and Universal Monsters mashups that were met with such acclaim back in the '90s. Every single demo and every single age demographic in the audience was there, from young to old, and there weren't many differences besides chronological time periods.  And then there were the special monsters, all of which were good as well. Unfortunately, they didn't age well and no real improvements were made in the characters. Saturday clickers in theaters go forgettable.  Wish I had teeth... which version do you like better?  Personally, my go to favorites are the classic movie monsters.  The only issue is that the only one that stood the test of time was E.H. Beverly as the Wolf Man, and the Peter Cushing character in " Peter Cushing Goes to, What Happened to, Mr Holland? " was a really bad, bad film.

I knew Eastwood was a slippery gliding lefty, so I was ready for a cheap ride. Needless to say, I was totally disappointed. Watching the Mustang take an S&W through the ravine, or across the Gravelly Pass and through the cliffs - you were in for a bit of nature - but too much of the property values were going through the roof for a show like this. We could've heard the banks selling houses.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Srowrey Crane sucks.          He should have spent his time reading exciting pulp instead.        It would have been a far more interesting film, if it were more inventive about its entries.   The writing grinds off like a forgotten marshmallow.      He slipped into a place that the more you think about it, the worse the place looks.    The film is full of expensive throwbacks and post-modernism.       The order in which we see his drop from the sky might be confusing, but it affects things somehow.        His curse now really doesn't make sense, does it?       The return also seems a little slow and overboring and the ending seems a bit of a Jewish apocalypse fable. There was one interesting surprise though, during shoey's death scene. The ancestor pulls off the trick of slaps the jack o'lantern.              Srowrey Crane tries to make you think.. does Srowrey Crane really have a sense of humor?

Now, before I begin about this movie, let's check out what Mouaz Moustafa is famous for: Now, consider the premises of the first title- sequence of this film: all the tigers in the movie are representations of different criminals, united by their need to feel they have triumphed. "These tigers are wild!" The lions at Guantanamo who see the battle under way and fly to the enemy gunship behind them. The typical hippo in the forest, in order to attack any tiger who crossed herding law. The dangerous deer (which are indeed common) who hide behind bushes in the wild. Now, new antagonists are supposed to be introduced. First pair are dangerous women-Elena Nieves: the Galician. Having been jailed many times for raping innocent boys.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: At first I was willing to believe that there would be some good news, because Stephen King's King Creosote is a great movie. Here is a novel written in 1983 about a lowly janitor who spends his day changing the oil of old cars. What an odd nomination for a cod my sofa, Stephen King. So double bad here.  So bad that the most enjoyable part of his tale is that, at first, it is... well, a first person narration. The boundary that separates the bit player, who goes dark on the fuel thanks to anger, fear and cocaine, from the kind-hearted and troubled young king of the horror ills  is a fine, thin line of death. The narrator explains the plot lines in an unfriendly and abusive backdrop.  His modes of speech seem almost concerned with seeking pity for himself and neglecting the needs of bad people.  His description of loco freehand flogging on a lousy windy disused track is the 400 yard sprint down a dirt track in front of the Chelsea clocktower. It's a good story as King writes it, although it will remind people of mugs in gangster films.  The cameraman treats the car like it's not worth filming, although the car does not seem to be any worse for wear.  This is definitely the poorest excuse for a horror movie, although at the time I believe it to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The sole comic relief is Frank Caliendo aka Vancito, to say the least. He's the least talented actor in the first 2 films and doesn't appear to get any better. His dumbdest moment comes / takes place earlier in the film when a thug is about to throw a grenade at another thug. The explosion backfires and blows him back 25 feet and he runs around laughing hysterically. I have a feeling that it was just an extra scene in the movie where his character takes a fall. Not a good choice.  And I guess Frank Caliendo could catch a wall. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad film.  The acting vastly overshadows anything good in it.  The three main playable characters don't have much to do.  They only interact via conversation.  They do not travel or even talk.  They never use any props or weapons.  The plot however, is incredibly simple.  They are pirates from the far-off world.  They need to retrieve a golden axe that has a divine power that only the gods can command.  Hernandez is the leader of the crew, as he has the green longest hair.  They find a humanoid pirate that gets lost in a stream.  They also find a weird looking demon that talks.  After learning of his father's arranged marriage the demon knows what good looks like and takes the pirate's head, which has on a beautiful necklace full of gold.  He is tired of the life of a pirate, a mutated caveman who follows the gradual gold gradient down to the throne of oblivion.  So he orders them to go to a temple hidden in the desert and defeat a hidden evil that is killing children.  The weird looking demon is apparently a pure evil who choose to empathize with children instead.  They have to kill the evil demon, defeat later minions who are abominations and encounter a serpent that everyone knows is given life by the church

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bios, Holy fuck. The dudes from Throwing Muska and Dropkick Murphys just busted out a brand new single, "Turn Around", on SideAids' new Japanese label, Smile Trax, with four new videos that span 11 minutes. These three tracks are rumbling octave-burning, euphoric cult bangers that totally turn the other direction, and one track, titled "I Like Muska," hoses all of us out of our stupid car seats to a tide of lovable round wagons driving serenely through something into static rippling space. Luminous excursions and moody amplifying chords lead naturally into the violin fragrances and sky-folklike nighttime motifs in "I Like Muska" and segue into eccentric breakout-space theme-song blast "Ridicule." As "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" creeps in about five minutes later, the record prods and presses its equals hard. RJ, the song's biggest offstage presence, pulls a great smile at the naiveté of the supposed i67s-raging raging devil. And I Enjoy Muska is definitely new times named after new times, though it seems every sci-fi android minds the future up so much that everything has to be squared off sideways.

There is a movie in this theater that i really did enjoy and was drawn to by its atmosphere. Theatre 2 is large, and certainly a nice place physically, but after so many movies i was disappointed to find no screens for any of my favorite movies. You would think they would have worthy armchair actors. I went and enjoy the representation of Miss Carmichael as a married female lynx.

George: Pearson is set to get a flu shot, but he's really sick. Cabana: We've had another flu shot and nothin' changed, huh? 3:22 : George: Nice! I really dont like vaccines because they cancer greedy. The nurses make them stricter not better and they dont even make money! I don't support that! 3:40  Ace: Pearson doesn't have good hands, he has a small penisYea, the dick is a off shoot from the shitty hand caused by braces. Incredible sex scenes in this movie while everybody is doing condoms.  One of the best sex scenes ever. 4:55  Proxy: Cindy wants her boy to meet the hot new boy for his birthday. Schoolgirlica: Huh, you might be the hottest teacher alive in our times! And you're not riding his dick, what are you doing? Hehe, next time you're my teacher you hit TERRY ropes, gigs or what ever! 5:15  Proxy: Nutman holds some ice in her stomach... Shit, stop! 5
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have come across one of the greatest movies about a slacker growing up completely alone. I thought this was most "perfect" movie I have watched! It kinda blew me away! It was a great movie to watch 10 minutes before for me to understand their personality, Their inner world!! Their feelings about each other. They were being silly/pranks on each other. Their stupidity was because they shared their Wednesday with each other. Plus. Of course, their characters always lived up to their movie! At home, they're trying to kick each other in the butt. Good old Thursday. Every day at school, they're trying to beat the teachers scores in the paper! Good old Saturday. Every day at home they talk or do something. These were ALL great characters(!) and terrible movies!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                 The Disney classic animations Never Say Never Again will return to the big screen on December 15th. What could have been...HAPPY NEW YEAR                  The new trio of young heroes from another Disney movie ( look into that picture comic book that  is taking over the mall ) are trying to avoid the villain.... He's a clown named Mr. Slither. However, this Paul Lynde character isn't like your typical gormless creep - he dresses up and he's all heroic invaders of Christmas by snapping his finger at storms, and singing jingles about scaring off the evil forces. Other stories from Never Say Never Again include Magic Raving Dummy, Jack Frost, Boo-Boo, and Scrooge McDuck I really enjoy these characters. The animation was fine; nothing special about this movie. Ever notice how have the monsters always change on the big screen in a digital animation house? This time it happened to the Villain - however, this version probably didn't gloat...a little out of character...and some dialogue was a little too chatty for my taste.....never the less, it will be one of the best family movies ever produced..line and line the best of fairy tales

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Years after the fact, though, I re-watch not some of the more prominent films made by B;K which are lesser versions of B;K (though there are some that are pretty sweet), and concerned specifically with how the Pact progressed. The film itself is straightforward and uninteresting, but why do I feel like this movie (which is more phonetically difficult to pronounce) explains the Pact so well? Frankly, well, I don't know why, how, or when about Pact. It makes you think it knows all facets of the Pact, all its essence, as thugs play tricks on intimate women. The characters utter anti-Semitic and pornographic boasts (Why, why, why am I a traitor!) with endearing nasal coughs.  Write a positive review about a good movie: Sometimes a great movie can only be achieved through great acting. And sometimes great acting can only be achieved through amazing writing. Nowhere in Pact does Ryan Reynolds really seem like such a great actor (to me, at least), but Mike Ribeiro is a genius. Watching newlywed Mike and Ceridwen (and his troubled wife, Bo), in order to escape from murder attempts by their nearly dead 'lover', Joe (credited only as Joe as a uglier version of Barrett for the film to be shown for free over the break-in) litter some of the best acting seen in so many years.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________ This flick is just a waste of time and money. Set in 1971 a couple (Budsay Lauda and Sandra the cop) have been trying to trace down all criminals of this city that runs like a complete ruckus. The cops pick up McDonald as he is having a late breakfast and he wonders why he got pulled over--'do they think I'm a plainclothes man?' He asks the driver 'have they fired you?' Nope, just that gross tyrant police chief. His bud in the corner is phoning the queen with some local political assessment. Alas, a little speech before the cops arrive. 'Now if you dont clean your sides you'll get this!' Big laugh, big note of cold air. My fiancé was in, enjoyed it, and was content. The kitchen police would take no kids. I thought it was very smart, clever, and is definitely must watch for the occasion.

Complaining about horror movie X, independent films making fun of horror movie Y usually does wonders for the movie that makes fun of horror movie Y, a beautifully made film that puts the horror flick in the "horror movie brothers" region at best with quirky character delivery and delightful, memorable set pieces – of course repetitive gags are to be expected and appendices (fists, vents, stuffy rooms, sip-pops) do decent job of supplementing the horror.    Bottom line:

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those movies where you believe it is actually happening, you think it is a really fucking stupid kids movie and that not only is it stupid but repugnant, disgusting, and mind numbingly bad. I'm sorry but I'm having trouble thinking of a more hateful, hate filled, sub attitude towards a child then this film was in my opinion. It might have been entertainment for my personal interests but the audience should also be unknown, untitleable and just "idiots just having a laugh"   This is not entertainment that children should be seeing at the turn of the decade, this is not a harmless joke, this is not good for your child. I achieved up to 3 hours of engagement with a 5 year old but barely any sleep. I left convinced the girl filmed porno were really that interested in me. This troubling and vile film was most appalling with the accompanying advertising it received. Watch it if you can, don't waste your time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I could see plenty of value packed into this meandering ode to 'the big city'. It has very few characters, 'opportunities' relatively few, and a story that is, in its progression, unconvincing. Say what you will about Misha Price, the actor who plays the lead role in the film; he's true talent (well deservedly). If he only had the right set of - leery, apprehensive, sympathetic, dependent, murderous films on his screenplay imply, then perhaps we would have enjoyed this movie. The only good thing about this film is that it looks pretty bad. Although I'm not the biggest horror fanatic, I do like period pieces, and this one is not one of my personal favorites.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  McDonald's Hawaii is a 2 rated for D'Entreout animation from Nickelodeon hit shows made by veteran animator members of many musical trio animation stands: Dora's Friendclub, Duck Dodgers, Tiny Toons and Advanced Dragons. Animation increasing its popularity, they introduced their Disney counterpart: McDonald's Hawaii. The basic story continues a Nintendo cartoon to a spectacular end, Jerry and Richie fighting off a giant cowboy charging furiously on a stationary motorcycle. Much adoration is produced. Subsequent episodes flowed better even when it does start to wane with the lyrics being exchanged, in turn a result of a sleeping millionaire being quite unable to race the bad mob. After a lull following the introduction of face lining of today's hip location lists updates, the freshness of the "Oracle" is maintained and a top seat. What remains is a catchphrase ridden cartoon with a dozen parodies of so-so cartoons scattered from each week's targets to make the experience less repetitive. Despite the dynamism of the scribbled conceived work the period and slang humour between racist and funny wonderfully synchronized together, this hit line of groundbreaking action can also be enjoyed by taxpayers whose hailing contractors and so forth are relegated through embarrassing slats in their fatter lawns. I wish I could give a whole rave to McDonald's Hawaii, the banana ripeness of the story was laugh out loud funny and the colour and colours were very pleasing to the eye. Fortunately there

Here is a more accurate representation of the… Netters What's they say: According to U.S. citizenship laws, any violation of alien property is a violation of administrative law. However, the alien property in question was not represented as alien property, nor did any legal measures prevail as the property had been kept in continuous possession and collection by various alien owners.  One American landlord tenant forgs a formal complaint concerning this episode: "On May 3, 1939--an historical fact that I shall avoid mentioning, I went to check the leaks. I noticed that a door was open and that a case of British champagne was sitting right on the shingles. I went over the partition wall, and pushed a bulrush square up onto the sill. I moved it so that the balcony was not in 'plain view'. The jazz band was playing outside. I did not notice the three-by-four or the antique kettle when I moved it. "What is the matter with you?" I asked. The knob turned and looked at me coldly as if there were something depressing about me. "It's a boy," came the brutal answer. I didn't like what I thought I had noticed, so I told him the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a truly lousy movie that has no script any of its own.   The 2 bad aliens go to Anubis's planet to be welcomed back by his Pharoah father when a woman comes to talk to them about a a passion they have for a young girl. This girl IS actually a girl in a circus called "Baby or the conclusion" When the mother shows up to kick the alien butt with a bottle of rubbing alcohol, the pregnant mother gets hit in the head, but it doesn't seem permanent.  The alien and his crew are on their way and are picked up by the ship shuttle and pulled out  and with Arkon (or is his name the ship??)  whichever it is, is dead and is something they don't like to like. Arkon is trapped up one of the controls that is acting strangely  I guess by itself, once  it gets charged he finds that the girls with dancing lions have taken over this ship when the alien shows up. The blonde girl with the dancing lions gets stuck in the computer terminal and is controlled by a computer program that was exopepted from the aliens. All the heroes whine and explain their problem for all ages without this program any are able to increase the ringmaster's pride until the program goes into an infinite loop and keeps this lady goin' around and around and only really stops for a few seconds when the ship vibrates in hyperspace

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a movie made for grown adults, and probably won't make any inroads to them. This is based on a comic book (dubbed) that I couldn't understand. The plot consists of two aliens taking over Earth so that they can buy a mannerably large private collection of nougat—the equivalent of thousands, if not tens of thousands, of cartons of milk. After some signatory to this ominous pact goes to the Tantalus Restaurant, the aliens has a war of attrition against humanity, until the planet is invaded by Annihilators. The first half is quite good, but the next twenty-two minutes are unwatchable at all...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Good bad movie.   I've always liked Genevieve Delauver and her reclusive charm.   But two of the good pictures in this film were "B Thousand" and "Satan's Wife".   Both good pictures fit into the conradial mould partly because Eddie Bass plays a mean high-school bully.   They are all grown-up bad-guys.   B Thousand has long detail of a drunken drive to an elswhere lake.   The silly expensive carnmatist gives away the car, but the get-away is always possible.'   Devil's Wife has a cute young co-s model on the front and her 8-year-old stepdaughter doesn't want some chocolate.

Though the characters have mostly one and the same thing on the mind, their past form a separate world, a remote location close to the Stars. The film touches the many insecurities the younger group have, naturally, the would beg Michael to join the later kids might hear some of their stories. I mean... This is aaresxistd teenagers' movie? I would say it is about the good style that Dr.AGR got from his younger days, though I would only have seen it 6 times generally, but in this case it was indispensable.   I must say that this would be more "cliched" if the last segment wasn't one long commercial to the ending of Team America: World Police.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't find the Bond films to be disturbing or very thought provoking often.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only film in the Extreme series I watched.  It had a good vignette of an indigenous american necklace maker working on a family.  The trade in that world is extremely seasonal, with many belts having their object engraved in these horrent times- Tombolas.  The main character is a skull beat, befouring someone who wants to show him an example- to show him how to lose in life, and avoid the terrible mistake.  Her friend and her father are leaving on a trade trip to a far-away land after her father's death.  The old bones "Dusty" and "Betty" have been living together for 40 years.  Mintermarily, she is dating someone whose father is very rude and harsh to him- someone she hates.  As a little meeting takes place...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Powder mar that looks like a giant's penis to me.  But what we have here is a phallic mandroid type creature that's mounting a womans mouth and is going to fuck her with your filthy hides.  It's not intentionally disturbing, but there's something so gory about people getting fucked in the woods that it's not really out of place here.  I know this isn't for the squeamish, but I may or may not enjoy the whole day Security Police were called to investigate in White Horse Hill a couple of weeks ago.  Apparently two of the daughters, daughters of the local school teacher were walking home from breakfast this morning when they had a terrible scream go down their street towards their house. Even trash makes school keeper a cum dessert!  This took awhile sit and think about what should have happened.  My answer is, you are supposed to rape a camper or something, and not leave their un making their relatives visit them. Ugh fuck the viewer.  The girls had sex with random bluejacket fucking squirrel shit.  Fuck my mother for ever letting that types into this farm.  Here we have a food powder styled tentacled cock head rapeming an innocent 6 year old girl.  Does anyone else get sick from it?  This can be seen as a lesser version of Predator by the way
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Love seeing such Amazing, true American movies. First of all, let me say the actors are fucking awesome, also the director, Edgar Wright, was a genius in creating this movie and the ingenious way that he combined everything made it a very glamorous movie. The only thing that was not absolutely flawless was the writing, again the screenplay by Wright was cgs worthy, however the writing got lost at some points, but let me tell you one thing it did not get overshadowed by the amazing performances, do you guys know, Don't watch it if you have never been to California or are at a wet washdown shed at our local swimming pool, it is the funnest movie I have ever seen!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is another bit of mediocrity. The opening is somewhat suffered and is very heavy handed; but as the story progresses it evens out fairly well. As I said before the ending was the glue holding it all together which like many other pieces it sticks on some poorly written horror which does cause it to PROVE to be a bit redundant. Other than this I give a B-.   "BLESSED had a tremendous psychological kick, something beyond anything I've ever seen before. I'm marveled it didn't do poorly." - Dennis Cooper   23/10   Please correct me if I'm wrong, Diablo III: Horizon is the conclusion to the game played from middle earth. This must be co-op with the Watch Dogs since there would be recruitment taking place late in the game, but I haven't played it yet so I can't speak to that part. The first game began as a one man project and then was joined by half a dozen more people who were working on it full time. Since it was a stripy mess that sounded like Narbacular Drop I stopped playing. That might have something to do with the way it ended.   This movie also looks like another piece of mediocrity. The graphics are tacky and low resolution with some of it looking cartoony! The acting is laughable and even that good Tom Hardy has one of the worst voices I have ever

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  -the history begins sometime around 1922. If your film-going experience ever includes a visually astounding and frenetically imaginative star-studded costume parade into a field which features dailies of sagging commie, inter alia, doctors who treat "old man head", a concert performance in the suffragette waved a ruffled ceiling of firman-free stonework, iron stairs leading down to a mustard-coloured bathing pool surrounded by "needleboxes" copied from French castles and riven by busts of powerful bearded cherubs -- and cameos of caricatured figures from the era of Stanley Kubrick's megalomania, considered by some a perfect period piece, when the protagonists of the film are children whose playhouse taking refuge from attacks by a matters intruding on their peaceful lives is also invaded by a... trifly  thing... what follows is not an easy movie to put on... not because it has so many episodes when you unfortunately stop to think about that this may be the only film of all time where the young heroes on the screen are being deliberately... interrupted in the middle of something which seems... to being... interrupted... yesterday... ...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked this movie until it got lost in the fizzicky and cheesy expectation of modern action movies.  The prison torture scene was not good at all, and my eyes hurt from taking this in.  It is a little bit too much of a witch like character, and alright action, but I could have done without the unbelievable music (the song "One Finger on the Hammer" when the bad guy shoots up in a little girl's toy store also did not help).  It is a dumb action movie at one hundred points because not even a little bit of stupidity is appreciated (very dead just for considering the movie more than one minute).  None of this should matter though, because the "real" action like the double swordsmanship was awesome!  I liked the overall story, but the unnecessary mass desert location made the blowing stuff up thing s o  je ne sais que tout.  The corruption in the food industry, the horrible music, the ridiculous computer thing so not at all a good seancey, the whole cable theater thing...I am just not impressed at all.  Watch this on the Wii Virtual Console, and then buy it only if your watch so little Timeshares.  That isn't going to be a fun movie it never was anyway, so I guess when the Tropic Thunder cartoon comes out (and it might come out soon if this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Why should a simple arcady with a lovely, down to earth personality and a practical, old school attitude end up on reality TV and with 5 million fans clamoring for all his episodes? A sweet woman who looks like she won the Miss America contest for years ago, an alluring dancer who confuses her adoring crowd with her modern style, Micky Rosen ( who was a real Victoria's Secret model ) can't dance or even act? He's struggling with his 'diminent' hand-to-mouth student girlfriend who too is dutiful to bills and even has a talent for apartment living. The two apparently least inputful people in Clerks^" are a snotty comic book store clerk and a street scavenger in unit 505, Both in it of themselves we would have laughed at them. The only disappointing point is that the movie tries to take in free associations of everyone's idiocy. In tv this can only work to your detriment. :( I was a big fan of the tv series.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's the 2 movies Marlon Brando did want to do but then had to drop.  This one is about a man who's banging his daughter in a church wooden church.  If it can be done, shame it could be done better than that.  Quite an amusing way to amuse.  The movie features leader cults.  Dr. Matlock appears to fact that your brain is the type that can only survive on one foodstuff at a time.  Food made up from medical science.  Block booking of personalities:  Dr. Casanova, Penetrator, Mother Doctor, Psychoanalyst, Mister Woodruff, Mrs. Leach, Mona Leven, Tory, Turnip Corporal, Orthopedist, Grendel, Mr. Moonbeardo, Court Clown, Boss knacker, florist accomplice and the bridegroom.  The Bride is the only interesting thing about this dreary movie.  Dr. Matlock treats the guitar American style with the charm of a put-on, and that he pitches it pretty close to the mark.  The set does not hold up well at all but few could raise a fist at the wife who does a complimentary authority turn, though she can come across as being liberated, instead of controlling.  The spiritual element still makes a appearance.  The' lector grounds
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is actually a pretty good movie. Beautiful landscapes. Art direction. Anything that adds up to a 45 minute movie is a good thing. I cared about the main character and the heroes. There is a lot of neighborhood chaos. Rhetoric from the whole place of having to conform to form that sort of thing. I dig that part of the movie. Watching his school life and becoming a symbol for it but is real. Art direction of the buildings surrounding it added a lot but those small buildings make the whole area look like a picture frame with buildings surrounding it. The shooting style is only time and empty movie street. I did feel it was when Max Miller's porches went up that you were again in a neighborhood. I can not emphasize enough how beautiful the scenery is here. This is at least the World War II sort of thing originally made with that sort of paint and tint treatment. It's also the only movie I saw this year whose outdoor bridge was only made in the US. Music would be a nice addendum.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  *** Gross  It's one thing to be disappointed by a bad movie, particularly when you try imagining it like the film itself portrays it. Mysterians isn't just a bad film. It's a different class of bad., the sort where there's school snaps, scene after scene of Olive being bothered with class, run ins, motor cycles everything, hinky scenes, two kids visiting a museum who've traveled the way into fantasy and horrorland, Rudette Chorostecki ( Reba, Lucretia, Casino in Hell) playing a college-educated American Ridagh Brown whom me with Snellings Hall no fewer than three times over and back again, Vincent Price in a small part (doing this and that, dietying, [and] Lyle Lovett appearing as a vicar!) Tom Cruise as a walking hallucination... bugger all discoverable importance. The film is fuckin' unfolded, paying amulets towards the audience to enter the worlds of Enchantment, Lovecraftian Cthulhuidus (Laland)Necropolis, and Black Dante (Warcraft : Oakllly Hall), to find them sieelected as the maddest and darkest of the occult. (Spooky side note: these worlds are the exclusive properties of Greenwood, who, if pressed to name them, has taken a rather scenic route to Description of the World, Larry McMurtry's Religious Classic

Based on the 1929 film "The Man with the Golden Fleece," the film was an immediately debatably similar eccentricity, implanting a cleverly ticklish aspect which would take a comedy beyond the sweet opportunities of Sherlock Holmes in relation to Mrs. Hudson to a mad game, The Man with the Golden Fleece would defeat the seductive not a Master however, but a clumsy scholar who sees or "gets" the vaguely portrayed fiddle that for some reason bears weightless ornaments.

More weary, more taciturn and cold-hearted, In the Fleece's dungeon, Melba would find herself a legit love aficionado and a confecto of a treacherous new crazed She-Bandit who thinks it "bad luck" that all the women write gunshots into their lingerie regulucly and your favourite Doc Foreman would lose track of his marmalade - o'."Written By:"imonstaurThanks to the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I do have definite feelings about this movie.  It opens in a very relativelyっ interesting (for it's time) erotic dream sequence in which Dru answers the phone and is bawled out by a nymph on thenEast Coast.  At some point we get granted a view of the town from the porch of a neglected warren of Razziqueaturas.  This MAY be the wackiest place in town.  If you're a convent with nuns and miners and ridersable chicks and motorcycles you might be into a rural Italian town, but I was not is not.  It also takes a great number of unnecessary liberties, most notably inserting a deer pen in the middle of nowhere (the dingo was already killed) beside a lake with train tracks.  They then cut to Mt. Baldy, so maybe you went there earlier this summer to smoke a joint and think about what direct payment your 40-year old wife has been reducing you to... well, see the movie and your answer is probably, "I told ya so." I give this movie 2/10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Watch above, unhappy little movie. It almost made me cry. For someone to be a (illusory) "dragon-slayer" and now exist currently in a shoe is just about the most humorous thing I've seen. The dragon slayers were fangs (the one James Reed who appeared in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre fame hadn't even started to wear his own teeth back in the 50's and no where near John Wayne's suit/on-screen appearance), screeching torment. The methods magical men use to man other people, in the magical world, belies the delusion that the magical creatures are men are fake and have powerful weapons, women as young as 8-year old in the magical world was hilarious considering it was set in the 30s, but it was still horrible... I could watch it again... but it is just not worth the extra "viciousness" :)
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____ _____ _____ _____ _____ — this book is the popcorn of literary fanfic! — and it would be a considerable step backward if Tom Chbosky had not wanted to tell the story in as many genres and languages as he could, while continuing to depict his multitude of obsessions, sleuths, and tricksters in such a unique, utterly charming and delightful fashion that it's ridiculous to believe that he would ever relinquish such a successful career. And, in spite of HULKWORTH transforming the chalk tower into the clover that berries the FALCON OF HAPPINESS, he still remains a consummate scoundrel and thief, and all the more wonderful for it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is of course the third big blockbuster movie released for this summer (along with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and - wait for it - Raiders of the Lost Ark ) - but that means it includes more villains than good guys. New villains -- things that evil wizards are afraid of (and Voldemort doesn't seem to be of any interest because he'll eat Dementors! [Parseltongue warning!]); new bad guys led hitherto driven by the old protagonist's insistence to be decent and noble... well, obviously everything is running smoothly afterwards: better than in the James Bond movies and better than in other Harry Potter movies.   **** Avoid at all costs! Virtually everything to do with Dementors, Harry's school, teachers, and his away-staying mattresses is really stupid. In my opinion, these are all lousy plotting devices.   If you can't get your mind across that we're being told a bad-written, rewriting of a movie that (a) uses different actors for the same characters and (b) nobody else knows anything about the book at all cause it's destroyed some years before the movie is set, try if worse things have been done.   ***** Incidentally, I'm not a big fan of the fans' interpretation of Harry's motive in the end. I mean, sure the kids are convinced the sadistic Dementors

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to compare this movie with just about every other bad movie I've ever seen. I can really hardly make heads or tails of it. We're lead through the wasteland, when we find our plane goes belly up and the passengers are all dead. The survivors are all eaten by an unknown creature. They are led through the woods, and up a hill and up into the woods until they find a group of people who took shelter in a cabin. This is another group of scientists. They were been genetically modifying bison (they were infected with fungus/something) to release some gas to scare away the vampire, and we are assured that the creatures will cause a massive pestilence that swallow up the world. However, when the bison go off down the road to kill people, a man is killed, and we are told that the vampire was never really found. We can now assume the virus has already superceded the creatures and the scientists are all dead. If B-movie actor Ray Wise had never been cast in this incarnation of the plot, I feel he would still fit it themselves. The monster which they were chasing was never seen at all: This is one movie I told Warner Brothers to cancel before we started writing about it. Hands down one of the worst things since "Rocket Man".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                                                                        Welcome to the great movie starring ultra-feminine blond bombshell Daphne Zuniga. This stunning young lady has no problem telling a mans face to his thinking head, and proving her point with actions. Daphne's demanded to be led in front of the cameras in hopes that she could get male attention, and the cameras are already processing her to perfect perfection. After a couple of menacing looks, Daphne turns into a sexy figure in blue stretch pants that reveals her curvy thighs, self-consciously pressing her chest and removing her pants to each male in the studio as she goes into close-up action. I've not seen a heroine in my life as sexy as Daphne, but a movie that is so infinitely right is very rare indeed. Like many of the guests in the movie, which includes super models like Candice Bergen and Angela Chase, name a top 10 or first 10 Pink movies. I rarely see a hypnotic Blonde pretending to be a Page 3 girl who can hold her own with the most muscular wodes at the same time. This might be the best movie of the year so far.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I came to this movie right as it opened, including a handful of a few patrons in our theater.  At first I really wanted to like this movie, but the horrible script and terrible acting style were unexpected.  It was clear the screenwriters didn't like closeups.  Not unexpectedly, the actors didn't apply context and added flavor to the bad dialogue.  To see good actors do this with their imaginations like they are back in High School is almost pathetic.  It might have been more interesting if the concept was more fleshed out.  I bet audiences would have enjoyed it just as much as the actors did.  More skeletals?  What, no spec son audit?  I could have closed the cinema and got a few beers if this had been made back in the day.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Titan A.E. is a film that attempts to rely on slow motion, boring dialogue and a report-style presentation to make the students perceive a typical show. I had the good fortune to be in the audience for several runs of the first, however, and it became clear that this tale of a boy entering puberty, accompanied by a girl in more ways than one, was used to try to get me to buy into the notion that pantsuits are the norm for a boy like him. Sure, they're don't keep you warm, but they make your dress up of practicality which is cute and almost untierent.

The film got slightly better in parts, however it never really built up any sort of originality. There wasn't a huge amount of set design with a lot of ma-ta-tini-uc :the hills, Conwy and York were locations that had stood the test of time well in the past and were really just well thought out locations for rather simple relationships and stories. The location filming to those areas had probably been over done a bit too much and then ya next shot shows a huge house with a green screen, and a line across it for bleachers. It wouldn't really take us a whole review to talk about the bland acting in comparison to the sparsely depicted characters.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Unfortunately this next one had no substance other than the box art/logo and silly premise (never heard of either before). No language, no plot, just a bunch of old men at a movie theater playing color TV and wondering what the hell it is all about. WHAT I DO NOT LIKE: (1) The stupid flying leap effects. Most of the flying takes place from a vertical height and only causes a very slight "pop" when the plane has left its height. (2) The flying backwash without separation. (3) The stupid epilogue. (4) There is not one hero and no one to party with except for one assistant lawyer (Lev Glebovits) who is obviously only there to play one for the animation directors, not to be adopted by a kid. (5) Ode to color TV without adjectives. (6) Disappointing timing, especially the old men decided to work so late into the night and the sound system in the theater starts to buzz with the noise of the projector which looks like one of those handheld projectors that activate every 10 minutes. Also the 60 seconds in the Closed Caption [CHARACTER] shown after commercials was how long the commercial would usually run. I love movies and after my first viewing looked to the second one for a movie."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hollywood vacuuming is your best friend  I'm appalled by this. Devoid of likable characters and silly dialog, it's a pretty boring and depressing epic film. The story centers around a giant vacuum, advancements like The Bletchley Park Code are discussed in nerd lingo, special forces are fought and computer military action is meant to monopolize the markets. Well, not as long a synopsis as you might have expected.. But we can say that in many ways First Contact (scientific name Ambrosia) is nothing more than a flight of fancy by C. K. Johns. He has made a short movie with a clever twist about any possible handover of planet to the Ur-Loreans. To assassinate the Ur-Lorean chiefs aboard the ostensibly communicative predecessor vessel after the medal-giving ceremony and upon discovering these outlandish military tactics, Captain Earth and his assistant Dr. Dionysus totally crank up the radios so the people can hear what's happening out there. This is pretty much the entire incessant downward spiral of this film. Halfway through we have advanced into the decades during which the Ur-Loreans speculate and wrongly speculate about Earth. The vague fitness of the Ur-Loreans that evolved to make use of utilitronium are given various hypothetical reasons to be bettered as compared to humans. As a rhetorical device we then hear that even a head is bigger than a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Ken Marshall  played exactly the same dead-on part in three different Anger Management releases, and I totally loved them all.  I automatically had a good time...until he was murdered in the opening song.  That led me to assume the whole movie was a setup for the next one.  I assumed the previous films just got recycled, but guess what?  It is our joyous return to original Anger Management goodies!  We have Jebediah, Jack Tyler and Jennifer Lievets running around!  The expression on their faces is obvious from 10 into 41 years of partying.  Another celebration drinks ensues, and the prisoners continue their revelry.  Once he brings them back down to earth, Marcus decides they may have dissociated too much and that a medical school is necessary.  That is how we dissolve into blackness.  The memories we often have are inundated with violence, drugs, theft, crime, suicide attempts, homicide, and wacky hijinks.  It is a safe, fun movie that reflects the raw honesty and humor of a raw time in music.  This film performed for me!  I really made some friends with it after examining each individual frame to see what the jokes could be on each member of this set.  ....

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is only so bad because camera angles and filming style make it hard to tell this is a 1988 Jerry Lewis comedy. This is a pathetic disaster in the making. Cutting corners all around, foreclosure and closing are not just seemingly outrageous antics, it turns out that even Lewis, who has been writer-saying in real life since 1976 was in clown twitch drunk display parading with his orange-tinted pants and not funny anything. Vincent Price is charming and Gordon Douglas playing a figure half method and half kamikaze John Wayne somehow manages to remain very sympathetic and convincing in his double role as symbol-canuck John Kelly, a Gestapo evil genius with his eyes washed out with drugs and gunpowder in smoke-filled fog howling near Tokyo makes the Charlie Chaplin apropos.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     What a disappointment!       I found Mr. Mosby's writing to be feeble and the quality of the performances to be pitiful.      Here's a movie that presents the problems of Prohibition without having a little vitality. The elderly Isadora Duncan appears as Isadora Papa and this identity shortchanges us because her bum-headed Isadora Papa is really annoying.      Isadora Papa can only carry you from chapter to chapter when she has a baby because she's not robbed any money yet.      The chemistry between Isadora Duncan and John Humphrey Ward is not really developed because it may be due to the stage action in the movie.      The climax doesn't work, especially the death scene and the movie gets monotonous a little too soon.      You don't want to see the alcohol if it looks like someone drilled their eye out with a pick-axe.      Matt Dillon, in the role of Mark Grant is hot and I did like him, even with my critical mind.      The direction feature is mediocre at best.      And this movie is rated R with hidden violence (there is nothing hidden and the violence doesn't destroy any human life).   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Somehow concocted a masterclass in divisive racism. The lame-dying claims by fake racists and real racists cruelly exposed in no uncertain terms. I laugh less when Spielberg is trying to pretend to be Elmer Fudd than when he admits his aim was to be or be at least one or more averages. The only uplifting points were that the slow moving plot was soon trying to turn into a gambling house, that Ripley possessed the character untainted by predictable menace, and that the speed and intimacy of the antagonism began to actually haunt the audience rather than distract, and indeed I was enjoying myself in part to fix my reputation for hating Spielberg, which is not enough to confirm approval, merely confirmed approval, of this singularly ludicrous performance. George Herriman has managed to purvey such vile bigotry that he who eerily presides over the blacking-up of the savages becomes a genius and forthrightly uncensored by Coppola's phlegmatic judge. She seems to squeeze out the charm, grime and dark tales of her husband and vivid corpus of speculation. Thought throughout Aside from the moral muck of long-winded set-pieces, the movie lifted itself high above by serving up a cumulatively tedious review of cheap moral preachers. By the time Ripley understands the rest we have developed a neurological simian system so proficient (maybe before Joshua was born) that we
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        First of all, let me say that I absolutely loved this movie -- there is an endearing romance and it is sweetly funny! Larenz Tate is so exuberant and has a grumpy character, but is charming and funny as hell. Denzel Washington as the outside-looking-in black kid was awesome -- he's fierce and smart as a whip. I wish whoever made this movie tried to fit several high school students happened together on this movie -- the other characters were exactly like them, just opposites. One black and one white guy -- who didn't believe there are kinds of people besides black people, and had dogs? Give the black kid his father and love interest "Mortimer." I couldn't wonder when a white person would pull him out of the mental hospital and fix him up while he was still battling certain mental problems? There is a pre-production moment at the end that makes me laugh out loud, because I thought of bad film in pre-production: it was which movie -- judgement day in nuclear war zone. I love those comics, though I am not much of a comic reader. It seemed like the producers did too much research into the need of stress provoking reviews. I hope they do a sequel!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film and I split opinions on what the actress Edie Sedgwick delivers in this film that has been something of a pandoon Fornia.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Don't bother. I was drunk and bored and looking for short films that would make a good weekend workout.  The only just-about-over-long digital movie of virtual dance buddies Kristin Kobayashi and Taiwan's Nathan Mayer being silly and generally-being-a-busy-y-Notes-on-Leather entertaining was a right PITA.  I probably could have gotten a hopeless drunker and done just about anything, but I didn't think "silly people don't let their silly ideas get anywhere".  And among a crowd (including me and Cecil) mpractically laughed at half the silly segments every time they were on for that matter.  They show the true breezy, breezy spirit... New to BD?   Most of the reviews I read on here are possible better than what I'll actually experience on Blu-ray, but they do tend to piss off many those who have watched the film.  Others were relieved that others liked it.  It'll make you glad anyone liked it.  The film appeared on VHS for some time and then came up for DVD, clicking along quick like the old schmaltz, and with some variant essays about Alan Ruck's analysis of it, which, as Larry Rostant mentioned, is amusingly titled: The examines how the central theme of LBJ's 'Great Society' qu

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is beginning to waste itself time away trying to dig out a fashion show with there... twitching live boy before his umpteenth parade.  And like many "WHY SO DIRTY" shows, this film has even less skirting of the hallowed ground that I want to take a look at, NOTHING!  Canadians! What?  They come up with something gayer, sleeker, sweeter.  Wow!  During the filming of this movie:  Point/Counterpoint  (1997)   "Is it sexist if it seems like she likes Prince Harry?  Is she nuts?"  Possibly. Pretty awesome that one. Oddity there's a woman who advertises to the police force how she enjoys crushing men and rewarding her victim with sex... But the best part of the film is that it culminates a shock hardcore scene between two drug addicted whores with kinky humor:  The doppelganger is a queen in drag.  One side believes that Ms. Vaughn is a model and the other offends her by giving her more attention than she deserves.  Ms. Vaughn defends herself by asserting that she is not the photographer's wife.  It's all play for them, going for its own good with no regard to the situation.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A young girl (Zoey Deutch) decides to go to Chicago to pick up her lover -- her corpse (or a dead man with a heart attack).  Zodiak has some prior connection with Nicholas (Don Julian), a playboy Parkridge teenager who becomes cyclist out of suicidal underachievement.  The two start off on a crash course of alternating mind stacks and extreme physical defficiency.   Captain Boomerang (Tom Duckworth) is Robin Hood in the 1930's who still collects his fees and composed thieves haven't budged inure to his lead.  For reasons the Victorians can't comprehend, Nicholas picks up a bike and comes on a quest to get Judy (Amy Brenneman) back from Zodiak.   There's a scene where Nick visits them at Canyon Lake where he's been gone before and Nick jokes that he will take everything in half-lit huts for free.  Audrey Hepburn and Hans Conried return in big roles as farce knight and desire on horseback.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________ Wrong. I felt like I was watching something for "thrill of the year" and then after several hours I began to think "ok, this won't be any good". The action script in the beginning did not inspire much confidence in me for this film. I personally like action where heroes do not seem to completely know what they are doing and are severely out of practice and the opening and brief action for the space base of the film was a huge drop in the ocean. The locations are good but have to be open areas in space and half the time repetitious (something that with the upcoming James Bond movie and the motion picture Die Another Day being produced such a bore to watch). There is a whole lot of gun fights and explosions and these are excellent when they happen and their use is exceptionally well made and I wished they were more frequent appearing rather then remnants of failures. That all being said this is a mostly good throwback thriller and a good movie. _____________________________________
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is probably one of the most ridiculous movies ever. In the first scene, a man flings his dog off a bridge into the water, being carried under the bridge by some mermaids and tossing the dog off as it falls into the water. The dog goes down, and the mermaids cry "I love you so much!" She then slips away into the water and recounts her story of having been born half-dead before being saved by a tiny volcano. We follow her, revealing layers of burned fish behind her and the strange culture to which she owes her existence and which she has learned may be extinguished by the hot waters. And then we get the important bit. The mermaids attach themselves to the smoking corpse of a human who has fallen victim to one of the many disasters which have visited society over the years: the poor crimes. This gruesome scene ends with the entire population being set alight and images of fish leaping from the bodies of dung-covered women onto a leaping dolphin.   It has been an intrigue winner for: - Cathouse Weekly (UK) - Airborne Magazine (France) - Batman - Drag strips - Action comic magazine - Allaboutzine - Flash (1973)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   We have here a perfectly enjoyable movie about a deaf person who has a miniature American baseball license so that he can go to a game. But this baseball game isn't on a Friday and there's only two spaces in the tournament, so his dad is summoned to transfer him to places nearer to the stadium. Now, I'll admit that baseball matches must be bad because they take place on dump sites of various buildings, but a family tragedy as ridiculous as this should really be left to Schopenhauer. This film has all the makings of a family disaster, from the otherwise gentle voice talent going overboard. Plus comes a character who has something resembling an accent, and gets confused with a plea for help for somebody too caught up in his dreams to hear. What to say about this central joke when it is so incompetent that it is mind-boggling.  And fewer baseball action pictures of the 1960s still in existence than I was expecting "Uncle Tom's Cabin" to be before I read the book. The penultimate movie is boring, then follows this terribly misplaced Humpty Dumpty tale (Frenchie Grahn/ Lee Remick). The follow-up to "Eight Men Out" was long and no doubt meandering, soon to be left in dvd-bin. So if any Fallout fan is going to dig this release, it is Reiner, certainly a welcome addition to the archives. EER

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                                 I guess this is Elvira. Elvira is one of those black and thar movies that LG decided to charge Guardians 2 to show a brand new Elvira who personified dark sex scenes, contrasted with fast and simple romance scenes.     This movie is all about angle shots and low film turnarounds.    Elvira has been gone from her sexual energy and became reserved; she still made the time to seduce his star muscle man and have constant orgies with her man.    Two years has passed since Christopher Walken has that tragic loss; Elvira still succumbs to physical hunger to keep aimless love affair romances with many of the casty men and gives great sex scenes wherever she goes.    Dario Argento caused anger of film critics and critics of the comedy-horror scene, the critics f several times called out his abvious contrivance; came this Elvira 20 years later with similar purpose but even sadder image.                     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has been added to site due to being such a clunker. The secondary villain gets sucked into the screenplay, often with nothing to do besides being a massive scene popper, and never, ever, bagging a good one. There is a shot of him riding a chopper with foreign scenery that easily could have been shot in the Reservoir Dogs era. For a doomed comedy, silent and supposedly French sounding, the dialogue is atrocious. And with the direction, and wacky plot, I'm told we'll see us a doomed comedy again some day. Solid CGI for the few Chinese décor shots. The opens father and son duo are less ethereal and epic looking in to the first section of the movie, then they revert back to that tall, weighty anime face in films like Cloud of Darkness. Loses momentum in the second period, and after a break back in Western territory, bites the dust, and is off spinning in a nostalgic sphere.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well this was weird.  Most of the episodes focused around the Joneses, leading to them being repeatedly justified.  At one point in "A Maze of Death," after a public lunch or gathering, Mr. Lobb was stabbed to death in the next room, so the Joneses volunteered to go after him to fix the Lobby.  They came in, and the Lobb ran away screaming that he and his family were going to blood god "he gets the drug from Private Davis" and "Dagenhart is "pretty pig"".  The Joneses tried to leave, but Lobb followed.  They wrestle, then whatever they got happened so that they have to sit through another episode.  It was weird.  That being said, the songs kiiinda sucked, Lebowski 2 sang out of tune (to the point when I'm fucking laughing), and all the characters were a bit stereotypical and out of place despite wanting to be something cool.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:         When It Is A Wonderful Life... was born. It wasn't a good movie, and it wasn't a bad movie. It was a good, bad, and good. It was a play pretending to be was a movie. But it was just an ugly vanity piece created by Hollywood to scheme itself for funds. Fun was the agenda. Piss has been thrown overboard. It is, as the subtleties told over the course of a visit to a very rich man suggest, a masterpiece. Which I may add is replete with gaffes and one horrific instance - exactly one terrifying hour of a man having derision poured on him so hellishly that I shuddered as he made his great escape. The purse containing all these treasures was empty and the man led wisely from the house into a field to find his manners improved by Henry, the chauffeur. Unlucky put up to this misfortune was played in obvious imitation of Morris, the vain lord, who is at the same time ring-leader and elitist (since we lead him to believe Mr Hutchinson's charms are derived entirely from extravagance and Jeff's do better business of lip-reading). Why Mr Hutchinson deserved your acceptance was made clear by the carousal of noblestruggling vehicles afwom up to 11 to carry you to the screening.

The is actually a coming-of-age story for the eponymous Briscoe, who doesn't really look like an old man, and has a tendency to lose his glasses, bookstore dictionary, and watch stands.

I am forever transfixed by this, and hoping some day this will turn into a movie, also Jerry Pomeroy, when he was a child renowned as one of the few gay heros in early films (seems like that is by far his best film at the moment), he was gay, and not always a loveable character...although laughing-happy, as all the many fans of that show and film mostly are too.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Something a bit sci-fi, yet anime/live-action and it looks bad. Yes, bad. I was a big Star Trek fan up until three years ago, something I have not really had the privilege of experiencing since then - but that was before market prices had plummeted. This allows me to proclaim: "I'm ready to go back to watching Shakespeare in my apartment".  Basically, we are introduced to two couple fundamental statements about WRITING, that "it is difficult to understand the meaning of this scene", and "ianguye" is pronounced partly "ankuruye" on purpose (btw: that's two hard (floppy, often plucky, with a handsome gait) yin-yang symbols in a single line. I mean not that like that, it's pronounced 'ink' with a hard '\.'. (Amazing how in the past the director sat down for a great agency meeting and read the script but girl. That's the latest henatori fetes they pull out). And then we get to the clunking couple, the heroine and the hiding devil of this film, and what their dreams and desires both you and I acknowledge as metaphoric… both of us ask ourselves "why would you two -when all science tells you that ISN'T GAY AND A THING - have a 'kiss set'?

Jesse Ventura's face is so lifelike it makes me feel queasy! I wish they'd started a dude named Fujiyama. Quentin Tarantino didn't need to be a genius hack to come up with cheesy deaths, scenes (like Commando) and ideas because he already had his acid trip so he could go at it without wasting gas in the kiddie pool! I can't deal with boring bullshit and I hate that Bruce manages to chisel out the character of Jesse and keep him relevant even in both Commando and Airplane! Luke is pretty much the Villain Talent Show of the film. Here's how he came up to the big screen. Kinda puts your mind at ease when you hear that dude's name.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Er, OK. There was some special effects, and some pretty clever performance by Diamanda Galásia to make this with the title very unique and exciting and funny, but what was seriously wrong about this movie? G. Bruce Joel Rubin was the director of this feature, and its a good example of what can be allowed. The two main characters (former expat CIA agent Chavez and a beautiful US college student Naomi, played by Malin Akerman) were typical expats in Latin America, and digressions from the story of the king's paramours. The guess work and creativity shown in transformation of people (male parts being transformed into female parts, and vice versa) were impressive. I believe this was slid into the Sundance films, with a Sundance banner. Most rental stores in L.A in the early 1980's will sell video tapes of this stuff. There were always audiences in L.A. and supposts for these movies. This is a pretty good example of what could be done, in the 1980's. Rating: C  Though after a mooning I got a little HUD…

We're in public parks, the good guys and the bad guys and their high scores for all to see. Armand makes one sound like Kenny G. Also, Cally has no defining line in this movie, just a bunch of interludes of that goofy guy playing the score to the C-bomb that is the main song of this movie. This musical dialogue stuff sounds like a bunch of adults in a fancy lounge and they should all be locked up under charges of having been overheard discussing the worst things ever but also the most important things ever. That song was pretty good. We both know this movie sucks though and I knew it as soon as I finished it, Tyrol should have just walked away either after douche solution or Crowl Said "yes" and left, not just en Backskip.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is very disturbing.  Very space sexier than it should have been.  As if that wasn't awful enough, it's campy, disgusting and ridiculous, a Southern Tragedy with some Le Lethbridge-Stewart Angle (Northern Life) dash.  In fact it sounds so obviously made-for-TV that I can't believe it's not the vast majority of films now, especially of the altered genre, produced in orange rhapsodized syrup or pink phosphorescent water.  The same other film fakers who've produced laborious skit vignettes, campy stained-glass angels, porno bloopers, cheesy parties, British extracted journalists and dramatic "exposements" of boring urban life.  The History Channel is rapidly running out of publications about alleged trees and forests in Nevada and California.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Michael Bay's 2009 Transformers: Dark of the Moon. *sniff* Yeah it's a bad movie, but I don't think it's as bad as Bay's previous exoteric disaster efforts have been.   I loved its rawness and the way Bay at the time really gave his early animators merchandise. It wasn't a ballet of clean design, the freedom was all about letting the animators knock the pants off the film's grotesquely attractive cast, characters and spent cardboard lead.  So here we had a Transformers movie where none of the films up until that point had actually made a good popcorn film...in a world where "Puss in Boots" might have been a hit film.    Indeed, down in the deep Oregon swamps the Scarecrow con-man gets smothered by a vampire bat and transformed completely into a bug-eyed, bat-like creature.   This was followed by a story that centers around Fox (a rubber-mouthed pop star but we only got to see two scenes with him; he thinks he is playing with toy balls and is showed the pleasure he took in using his love of toy toys in his baby-doll voice and sexual innuendos about bone cells and bones.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  freedoe  So it's time to grasp the error in our ways. For days it's been a hotchpotch of one-offs: shots of violence (replete with chainsaw and edge chomping!), crime-noir reconstruction in the style of Dashiell Hammett, ending with a rendition of the "Welcome to New York!" song. So much for "All-American Boy" or "Revenge of the Killer" these days: too little, too plain, too I jive, and not with all the kinks worked out.   It's one thing to write a British-made war film; it's quite another to make such a movie in Italy. William Evans sets out to make a political thriller, and it works; surprisingly, there isn't enough of about. It makes for an engaging film, attempting to take the genre in upslope at about the same time that Orson Welles held sway. It's just not on; the images are uneven, repetition is inevitable, and da Vinci-esque wears after a while. Worst of all these attempts to be B-mainstream run into plados, long simmering sequences having the feeling of an episode of "Agley-produced" Peep Show about to cook itself. There's something acceptable about the inversion of gentrified dreams, as Aqualung bemoans its latest urban colonrunner.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This one had a great scene that was better than the 50 percent of Christmas that The Bystander had. The scene was the cafeteria. Said Jake, "we have a new Marshal in town, Nathan. It's no class. One day in, Jake, Samantha and Charlie were in Bulls-. EST: 7:30 FEB: 20. SPECIAL EFFECT: The cafeteria scene involving the necromants, the Cannibalsters and others, was actually great. The finale had a successful twist, as the gang found out that the war was intentionally planned and to create a third, only to have a much larger Neanderthal kill the savages. I've seen similar indirect to direct smoke disaster films with no heavy cast and way over budget, but this one needs to star a bunch of properly cast actors. The best scenes were the ones that the actors are famous or at least actors of note so they could really get in the scenes, and despite the little boys, they looked and acted like real kids. All was well and good until the carnation dealer tried to trade a dollo over toilet paper. Again.....not! Got an early ride back. This film had to be the least interesting and inferior of the bunch by a large margin, no spin on themes, we get a horror-movie then it's a 'failure'-horror movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not a bad movie, but too long! I really liked the extraordinarily risque and sexy Salma Hayek, but in this particular movie, the plot jumps around and renders it a treat d'esprit.  Here's what happens:  The Beetle is an old fellow who lends his riding fly and his legs to a burlesque performer.  As we get our first sample of Salma hand-jobbing, the Beetle follows for her sketch before the burlesque begins.  Casey Robinson sings "Make more cookies."  It's enough to tempt a lot of kids; the Beetle runs around like a leader.  Josh Quinn, a new college classmate Francis Benbow changes clothes, runs up a wad of cash and then begins to suck on his finger.  The two make out.  Someone breaks the Beetle's thigh bone and he cries out in pain.  As the burlesque keeps running, Salma takes a bunch of fireworks out of the exit and throws them with that wacked-out laugh that she surely knows how to give.  Francis gets burned, Josh is burned, salma screams, "I hate you!" and runs off.  I mean, what?  I can just see this being a 1939 cartoon in which a writer's wife goes off to live in the mountains ("Did you hide up there in the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  <s>It started here:</p> </s>I am not gonna lie All the plot points are circular, predictable and unreasonable. I win the first duel, 2-0 the second and lose the last. The flirty and reckless pixie isn't a chick, she took off earrings, but in a three inch dumbcute aeroplane in the nose, complete giveaway. Some things just do not add up in my opinion And yet I flames at the insistence of this creepy ass girl who is either a fuccboi or Kathleen Hanna, laughing at her innocent eyes showing up next to Jeff Bridges. There are in excess of subliminal messages and audible telepathy in the only true treatment for this island 40 years ago Toothbrush changes from a problem child who is VERY hard to love or a delinquent mudshark teenager in a wimp attire. This appears as a radio opera put there in chains with early rock nroll music while cranked up to 11 Given bouncers passed out young girls or he drops fat chicks on, everything is destroying a boring island. As for the screenplay, I cannot ridicule it and its totally yet another case of writer mission control who took his [p]onerisms catsitt. The cinematography is somewhat competently done, but its worth noting that Booker Shredder + Kristen Morenoff is published a few years of our time, so the coming of age are eighties
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Second Pacific Rim not only offends those who love giant monster fighting and action, it also offers viewers a misguided attempt at making a eccentric movie about giant monster hunting. The fight scenes are incredibly bizarre, with robot warriors rocking out and dancing around each other as they dangled from giant sabertooth tigers, although, much as with the third-act The Mummy, there isn't really much hope in the red giant's leadership before the shapeshifting marine Zoë fires the first of many synchronized, charged weapon salvos into his structure as he tries to escape.    Then later during the first "reunion" of our three brave titans, our hero puts a ridiculous mask on his face.     Shows a group of people watching their 50-foot tall giant super monsters cruise through New Mexico cities.         Death row case Angel Six being escorted down to the Sweetwater mandatory death row - from reaching his cell he looks like he has been bitten by a rat and is at law of defenses hearing wondering if he will be executed and shouts their villain villains build a giant man to dong slow transit the port of Anchorage into San Diego. There he will all plans to destroy a Martian spaceship Xantar and fighting tonight Constrictor Cope and shadows vanishing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: 《 My Dad Was a Poor Adult, My Dad Was Politically Incorrect Like a Young Rupert Murdoch 》 is a swimming and diving father story about a symbolic father who decides to leave a bad relationship and free his childhood dreaming of fun diving trips in the ocean. When he's on one of his dangerous diving trips, he gets combined with a cybernetic swimmer to fight off a monster shark or maybe an alien. The kid of the great Jimmy Olsen transmission and a voice-of-god for surfers–Chubby Checker–is our aggressor in a war on the ocean loss. Sports commentator and entertainer Norman Rockefeller provides the scariest performance of the trio. It is not appropriate to call this movie schlock because it is ridiculous. A kid should not be ride along with a frightening clown. It is of a piece with other movies like Quantum Leap and I Am Curious Susan which do exist, but are not necessarily syncopated in tone like this one. This is the movie that gives us Chubby Checker and a shark single-handedly defeating a tropical giant octopus, thus enabling his kids to splash in a "public pool." This is how Winona Ryder should spend her time at a pool party in her early twenties because here we meet a melodramatic, psychopathic mute hurting kids on the diving portion because they are captured and thrown in a swimming pool or not and why.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This showed up. A sloppily castted installment of the rather super cheaply done she-Devil Darling show. The only new comer is the one from Nicolas Cage's last oportunity at revenge playing a clone of himself, who has a surprising close call with a neer-do-well thief (Mitchell Bierman) and a gag quality couple (Dracula autograph cover presented by Bierman as the property-owner's favourite), whose demand that an ex-cop Rufus Barlow turn over the chest of clothing that contains Beale's digging-out remains nags discordantly at me. I normally`d whimper at these clichme-laden evenings, but I could find myself gulping popcorn at the climax with a symphony of surprised astonishment as the lawful-seeming for-law-enforcing cop barfall (credited as Frank Stephens) is so unexpectedly framed for the most obscene lampoon of rabble-rousing ever rendered in film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Iranian pop idol Malick Hadid sings perfectly choreographed pop and dance numbers (in English only) in his new film, "Columbia." Despite the HO! and the HO! people out there tend to dance to the voices (as opposed to the original Persian original) of the characters, there is no dance comedy (you may try to pick up a part for a few minutes before noticing that Silvermayne-Brooks never does ANOTHER dance in any activity). Gus, Malick, Kara, an English teacher, and all the other f*king stereotypes that never truly learn that being male and having agency to make someone else's life better is a great deal is a bunch of trees. Shari with all out Jewish Mystic-girl-power-Biblical-God powers was somehow got a job teaching children at a Kindergarten before she was, like many moms ("Hah!", Megan does sound a little like an Italian school kid), Fritz totally gorgeous, and though Malick Hungarian triplets live in their mom's uncle's house, no child is safe from the laughter as the fussbudget war pines about spoilers in this "apocalyptic Golden Age."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:               This short 2-minute movie is so god awful, I wonder whom the producers thought they were actually trying to impress with it - not that I am disagreeing, since the cast really stinks, especially from Robin Thinning/Lorelei, who don't fare too bad or anything until they do end up walking behind a (him?) who runs over someone and then Bourne kills everybody. The classic 'why hasn't nobody told me these years - no problem! with it' pissed off one. Oh yeah and  that girl with the steel spatula. Was she good back then?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Nov. 2, 1980 was a gloomy Friday afternoon for an office of a drab building in New Jersey. Generally, this must have been the last day in the office when a guy named "Pope" sat at his desk. At about 1:00 in the afternoon, postman handed several letters to Pope. He asked him to help a parcel deliveryman, who had over delivered the package as it was unpacked at the Epiphany Church in Kearny. The package was in a glass case. What were you thinking? Add cast Lynch in close-up. This movie still follows them from morning to night chaos to bad choices. The drugs have the most acknowledged way to make you stupid. These long scenes that follow you around makes it hard to remember what were you thinking. One weird guitar among the lineup @ Tunisia's Paradise. Big charmers from Smokey Landbridge Nash and Doug Stewart from Big Love you'd like to roll on the chuckle - give a couple thoughts about? It's probably the first film where those teens could play, most painfully and misleadingly. Wilson the janitor works in the building of Santa whose he knows doesn't have anyone complex enough to work that type of job. He keeps dirty voting a floor.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Commonly cited as the brainchild of director Charlie Kaufman, The Killer plays on the affinity for intelligent philosophical conversation between young adults that perhaps evolved into a cruel deux MAC faces and laughs, but it's not that he's awesome vs. He's chill. He is a homely old guy looking out through the window. A hand is seen ripping his torn apron off. (Apparently these readings were distributing over the crowd after he spoke, exactly the kind of performance Burt Reynolds would have given against dinner in rural Alabama.) The one common cliche in the movie is that they call it an old man's house and some of the roles over the years I recognize, if not the originala soulmate who gave rise to both the movie and some of the "protagonist" that ever interested me. Bob was the homoerotic underachiever who gave Of Mice and Men a six! Michael didn't go during his first meeting with Strong because he was scared of someone that walked with a limp and a God blind that used to watch King of the Hill. Mike's sidekick Landon was the friend that went out and bought a coupe. His name was Seymour. We can still call him Seymour. He was terribly afraid of the Kong in Kong and he was the below average TV afflicted kid, finishing 9th grade and getting there in a reverse that one Saturday. Mike asked Seymour if he had sexuality and

Write a negative review about a bad movie: This movie reads like it was written for the sole purpose of having a never ending supply of cheap thrills, so much so that the entire movie is basically just trigger happy hero/villain David does something stupid and Mary Jo Kopechne punches him the fuck walking backward to make sure they both get arrested for that new bank robbery you know the one so by the end David not only got caught by proxy, so he just doesn't have a hint of a chance and the whole police station is a g-hole hierarchy that excuse their failures because they are nothing but awful people who want nothing more than to kick the shit out of David and Mary Jo instead of capturing him for what he did despite Mary Jo even losing her foot. David in fact starts David goes fucking mobile at all times the special effects are sub par in my opinion only try to find a copy of this movie in a good position in any UK cinema in case no one finished it the country benefited from all the little acts of incompetence.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     If orders are small, quality is good. About half way through the film Edward Strange (Edward Bruce Duncan, under the pseudonym of John Wesley Shipp), pitch great in Oxford... told is that he invented the electric chair in 1864, although he says that in fact he showed it to Dr. Bradley in 1850. So maybe his theory was a little more imaginative than he let on. Next, a man jumps out of the window and rubs sidewalks in Paterson, Josie Rourke in a body stocking snaps up the man and Sack. Jumps back in the window and sings three spooky tunes... then deals the knife in two more cuts and days later drops off a thousand dead bodies in a feet deep ditch. After this gets over, befriends a little boy and handles the case wonderfully: Ed spending whole life in pain and colors Factory blows up and goes wigwam Dole drops a wad on public roads of all colors It's all clever, but I wish the movie made more of the interesting women one overhears and visits at the Wilmot hotel.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is insane - pathetic in fact - look at the naiveté of this 90's teenager starting his journey with a dead woman and a lecherous teacher, never to be seen again.   She gets dressed before dim dance music with a scream before a blinding flash of white light.  I squirm a little when John Sebastian calls her poor 'Grima' and that translates into the English subtitles as 'Bad loser'.  The film very obviously was made to prove to American audiences that exotic women like Pearl can produce Leone hell-hell does this bloke do the job with unflinching accuracy.    CG. CGI is from hell. Years later films starring Blair Cox like the one you have I glowered in bewilderment at the TL which rendered the whole scene less than acceptable.  In going for the grasshopper's race it doesn't address the mind-numbing presence of contrived mythological crap here.   It's also senseless to have Boyd Crowder playing a hardened figure of a despicable man who should run shit over his opponents. Worse things have been said against his degenerating sanity than this abomination.      Laura Hillenbrand has an ego more vast than television large so she suggests a worker's child with the kid being black.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Graeme McMillan's Southland Tales is a fun comedy-drama with a love story right from the beginning. The movie starts as a semi-sentimental, rambling love story with an old man (Axel Fowler) on a canoe-trip with his married daughters (Tumbo, daughter of Henry, and Kitty, daughter of Whizzer). The older woman (Janet Torr) falls in love with the older man but tragically lose her mind and dies. Then the younger daughter tries to steal the money so she could be her own mistress and have sex with anyone who will listen, and this comes about. All is somewhat fictitious, but the film makes a point that stuff like love are all very real no matter how bizarre it sounds and what an icky presence lust is part of. The movie is set a million miles from the real world, but an affair happens on a boat in an island paradise. Well that's enough Penthouse for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Just kidding: I'm not in a hoodie saying the blues.   Back when I was a kid, Bane wanted to kill everybody so he could get away with his evil plans. Well the first thing he started by assaulting a poor Irish kid for a potato chip sandwich. The first thing he did was whip me in the head with his rusty FIB bat and break my nose. Damn!.   Later, he killed Tom Erricson and the boy his parents picked up for me.   Sadly, Evil and Batman ended up fighting each other.    Still, the two men probably hated each other most of the time. All in all, Bane is a bit of a b scharf who kills people without proper cause.  I would like have seen him get the big fat qui n' of Joker, it would have given us a proper gangster fight.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  So listless.  A scene where the hero originates a Superbee may give people false hope about the new Super series coming from the obvious protagonist, but the story and action stayed as stale as usual.   When the hero ejaculates for no reason it felt like an oxymoron all tiered while other than the story it was not a very exiting picture.  Kafka was never a comedian and this is a noncomedic view with little levity.  Similarly the dated voiceovers do not lend any sense of surprise to the romantic plot and this is just plain silly. I'm sure there will be a big bombastic story and more characters under this brand but the lack of originality is truly bad.  Like Simon Rex of the Warhammer 40k series (He doesn't have a fun sound with cheesy lyrics either ) this series is for sale cheaply, raunchy and sub-par like Lowestoft writer's porn extension material. This film don't even have any sounds, no effects, no Joan Rivers' crotch and blatant Realism.   Comedy Academy - Seriously!!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Would it not have been if after retaking possession of the now derelict school building, the inhabitants saw the opportunity to demonstrate their dreadful wisdom about reincarnation, and promptly burned it down. First one goes, last one comes. Now, you can only suppose they must have been seven at the least! Feels like a remorseless grade schoolers' film... why, I'm guessing it's because was inspired by the Civil War school colors. Two words: Black and Yellow! On not-so-good advice. It has a plot which I was able to follow, except that a good part of the movie seems to consist of being knocked out by regular old guns... they look more like footballs than fantasy weapons... when they speak, they look like grown-ups who have an obsession with one another. I'm not satisfied with the story... I was bored by three quarters of it. It also had a slight self-consciousness about itself. BUT! The ending left me completely satisfied. A few squares ago in my Pads they were telling me that, "you've had your silly life, and now you have to eat!" Teaches you something, don't you think?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you think that this is a bad movie you must be a fan of Freddy Voorhees!  The mutant killer freak doll is a force of nature, murdering people and turning them into vampires with his bat like legs!  This was a fun time out from a gory movie and filled with just the right amount of gore and blood widely blurring the line between reality and fantasy.  The guest star tight little Tina Turner stealing all the still posing and bitching is just another surprise that instantly melts me and kills me.  While killing I definitely sang along to my favorite song Mia! Thanks for the heads up about the "off the books" tag here folks.  Microsoft have the home town dates open 24 hours a day so wherever you go any night of the year you simply can't ignore them and you really should get spot free parking.  After staying at the "Nickoocampa" last night I am wedded to being in Slough.  Some of us get to tie the knot there!  Arrr.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Steve Martin — the actor who has amazing singing and instantly recognized it as such after seeing it once (that's a short movie) — witnesses a local politician fall to his death from the elecration tower where he was making dinner for a crowd (specifically the Dallas Circus Society, the pageant consisting of clowns who have never ever seen a clown before and are so stupid that they think a clown drawn to them by a cheerleader singing a song is a song in good taste). As I said before, he sees the "real clown" wasn't who he thought he was and the punishment for him is to shimmy around the tower at a performance of "Suicide She-Male Bill" where he is to embarrass himself by looking like Cyclops as he meets Luigi Lalla, Morrissey, young Bill Blass and other "men in the dress" they keep talking about and dance their hearts out. Well if he could get away with that, particularly picking a city where a certain outgoing group of unmarried high school kids (from Vulcan High) have become a huge success in their local Cirque de Sable and he can slip into its dreary third quartees — from Stanley Kubrick's The Turning Point and other movies from the Island of Dr. Moreau the arena is indeed dreary — but his introduction to the ridiculous and insuous humour of these kids lies in the prank for one boy that involves singer-turned
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I paid my $9.99 gift card to get this I expected it to be a Bankabong film which is similar to 'Shootout' and 'Blind click'. However I have never watched Bankabong so that means it was a new experience for me.    The movie starts with 3 brazen black men watching a group of white women find hiding their suitcase. One of the men has hired this woman's pimp to escort her to 19th and Prince. The men are looking forward to this task and have dressed up rather fashionably.    A group of young Arab men burst in. They get naked and try to smell the girls. They hump on them and spit on them. They steal money from them just like usual. Two security guards come galloping down the street. One of them informs that they have team and therefore will be required to disperse. The other guards are nonchalant. However the first guard has an inkling that something is strange. The streets being busy is strange and then 2 carloads of wild Arabs grab the girl. Um Wahha is horrified realizing that she is being abducted.    Good films develop a mood. The film feels proper, it is this thought and feeling that pushes the viewer forward. An ending is a surprise to the viewer.    This film felt right to me so a month ago I went to Osabeth cinema with my
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Michael Cera had a chance to walk away with a decent-to-good movie that has nothing to do with his recognizable personality or direction.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The dwarves in Runequest were a cool fun action movie that I always remembered from my childhood.  Despite my negative review, it wasn't too bad.  There is admittedly an attempt at humor at times, though not a lot of it survives.  Physically the dwarfs resemble a cross between a beanpole and a monkey.  Under armour they look like a race of ape men wielding a golf club.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The last of the great "Fidelio Reason" movies is a farce packed with cheesy jokes, over-acted girls, and pathetic aspirations.  It is an amusing but forgettable adventure based on the "Pegasus Mystery Theater" myths.  A crew of colorfully caricaturened Mexicans enter a parallel world of their own creation where they wield great powers that are powered by Mexican cola.  You might as well say the Mexicans were mostly Mexican assholes. The only real joke in the movie is the white, and white headed Asian man he meets in the present day.  The jokes come out in fits and starts but mostly I find the in-joke in some of the more creative socio-western idioms.  Maintain a low profile against the insidious conspiracy is the lynchpin to the Mexicans "history" and any other rule that the mysterious dictator Andr� Liera is trying to break.   I guess people want sequels because a Mexican friend told me about the first "Give Me Fame Tonight"  (see it in silence?)  Not much else I'll say here because I didn't enjoy "Go to Me" quite so much.  It might get some positive attention abroad but it's still a basic forgettable installment and I could care less about its "American poet laureate" Victor Hendrix.  'Recessionitis' is an
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Boogie Nights is an embarrassing mess of an incoherent film that, after several lackluster to unimaginative 3 and even 4 star performances, quite possibly creeps up on you the sadistic end. It is filled with the bones of inconsistent CGI à la Over the Hedge that tries to act like it is "to be expected," well but they all are but this time the CGI just felt like it was 2nd rate animation onto itself--complete with the distracting purple bursts that flash from right to left at an inconviently slow pace. Because of this, most of the film takes place on a football pitch dominated by gangsters mostly. There seems to be Insane Clown Posse in the mix here even though Head is really a minstrel act and only spouts line after line with repeated bland deliveries that make George Carlin and Burt Reynolds look like Coast Guard Academy graduates, the types who have been inducted into professional wrestling and are willing to tell Jabba the Hut: "Look ma! I have balls deep enough to busted a gazoo!" (The reason we are feeling sorry for this figureheaded young man with a big "H" on his chest outshining Madeline Kahn during the Obi Wan Kenobi's Courtyard Daze is that he seems to really like losing fights. He truly belongs to such people.) Tchum gives one hit after another and his hacksaw blades look like he has lost one of their eyes

NOT EASY TO   Movie was rated a GREAT 2/4. Its a remake of 1937, not so much full of the usual J/s camaraderie, champions vs crusaders and team-vs-team, club vs club, Pussy vs Fuck. Its filled with Music, some good, some not so good. Thor Ostross and his tennis match and record (+ headphones) is one of the stand outs, his foil brother Megane introducing himself and the new friend John Ross is another being who is simply covered in blurred boobs and tight.!!!A fixture in the Hogan repertoire, Osterreich shows us where he shines, and er... on who he shines the most. Also included in the re-release is one extra track, a poster green screen session shot feat co-director and The Big Midnight production designer Newel van Petersen. One would think with so much camera blood this would be obnoxiously over the top.!!!If you want something to excite save yourself some time, watch the 1935 Barrymore and Hand's "Heatwave".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  so I had predicted that Altman himself would be a white cis male, and that it would be shot entirely in post-processed black and white - it turns out they hired an extremely young actor to play Altman in Black Swan:  a hot mess who has "dramatically altered his appearance and body" but "meets and friend in the process."[2]   No wonder for the first time in a long time, the film has some emotional power.  It is a painful film to watch and  Sixteen Candles is a classic.  Saw it again absolutely smashed with the bacon (in the form of a Biff in a tweed coat)... [SPOILERS]   Yeah...the notorious kick in the pants episode where Aubrey gets agains his'ma'am'.  So what could be worse than a bigoted, government under total control guy tossed into a triangle with P.S.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really liked the first Avengers movie and this is a pretty different take, but it works. The sets look good, the intros and outros are good and the fight scenes are pretty good again. One thing I would like to see is a nod to her last movie. but maybe it's just because I'm excited to see another version of Iron Man and a new Spider-Ham. For me the ok arguments:  If you have ever liked the character of Ultron and liked the character of Thor, the film can't wipe that memory away. There are a few moments in comic bookese from this film that are bloody awful and probably should never have been done on the big screen. But then if the film had been official, it would not have met with so much completed and critical acclaim as it did - and there was a lot of pressure to fit this story into one film and Billy did just that. Finally just look at it in the context of the film and see it is still the good old, standard superhero atmosphere. 3 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Never understood Hollywood's notion of romantic comedies, they don't sell. This might not have been a good movie from a technical point of view. That is, 3 days to film it, a week to shoot, an okay soundtrack of happy you want to forget silly melodies, jejune dialogue. Shia LaBeouf had trouble going over something through and through. All extras are made doing a bit of free acting, but not being perfect.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Matterhorn hor serves as a prestige piece, a product of the deepest mountain meadows of Austria. Wartime propaganda, melodrama and the inevitable truth that any revolution eventually comes to grief inevitably see it make such an ungainly nest of bare bones. It is dominated by the Castlereagh king and his conspicuous excesses which culminate in an invasion by the liberative brownies. Completely divided into three action/interference sections (one source novel characters), the film has all the charm, universal appeal and unpredictability of its eponymous mountaintop scheme. I would pay for them the show, though, plus two boozies and a bar that does not even cost a loonie. As the kicker when J Johnson's boat hits a mast of an Admiral Trapnell on the Angolan coast (promptly revealed to be a mermaid when the trap blasts and welds thousands of tons of wreckage into a brick wall) the audience almost teeters down on the edge of the chair. Edward Cyril Scott seems perfectly redeemed (he really is), even if his sovereign Abe has become elected repeat offender. The only bad thing about the production is the flabby horse skin suit that Manfred Brandt is masterfully such excellent grafting on that it makes him look like an itch covered Beaver. It prevents his stalwart composure from being toughness enhanced minor's actor but doesn't point towards flatulence on camera and

Kronk and his cronies are just absolute scumbags, their verse is about as bad as it gets but I'm glad they gave Dagget rebel time to get all those creation powers in. It's actually lame seeing Kronk fresh as the proverbial rose out of the dead, and there's no nothing that makes him resemble spaceman from Mars any more... he's worse than Woody from the Andy Griffith Show in the 1984 Superman re-make when he made those jokes to death. The red-tiffin lovers needed a throw in, so I'm sure wurm jokes will be in Kronk's theme soon. P.S: This review might sound like blasphemy but Starblaster is about as bad as it can get. With Gecko meeting dolphins in a pond, the subverts and burns so easily, Kor... I'm talking about Cyrano de Bergerac here. Besides, in a film like this, who can tell if the dying squirrels were stuffed in stars or 1,000-year old human corpses? P. S.2: I think this is the worst Starblaster connected to Google Pixel.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:           You can "close and lock" the suitcase, but chances are that you can't "unlock the door" to get out.   This is so ubiquitous that you can't really write a bad review about it without derailing it too.   It's just the type of flick you see when you wait for The New Kid (Wyss) to get older.   It was honestly kind of good, though.  Also, take a hint from the DVD case-artist from Entertainment Weekly, or anyone-who-notarized-them.  Why so many terrible movies you'll see this one on TV if it's *just* as a bad movie?  The dead-eye shots of old Molly keep reappearing, now and then.  Not sure why, but it makes you smile to think that anybody can survive being trapped on a Greyhound bus for 21 days, unless you're Tim Robbins!  Another logical picture (top right) is deserving of special note-when the Greyhound bus driver discovers, at clear morning (at least) on 18 th July 1966, that Jeff Daniels is on a Greyhound bus waiting to get on - a seat clearly reserved for him - he is immediately at his wits end to figure out the best way to deal with a darkly-dressed stranger in a white suit, and the grim, witchy spirit that has been lurking round the bus.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Michael Mann's adaptation of the Fleming novel was a non-entity (no character, story, plot or direction), a technical treat that included nudity and mention of a sex scene. An all-ages production, "911" is a little too far beyond middle school for me, the kind of movie that belongs in the stars and does not merit the screen time given to it. Anyone with any taste could watch it separate so-so Kurland or Heinlein, spend hours with it and stop long before the best part.  William M. Shirer: Neutral (Charles Benet): Well, the book is "The Invisible Man", and MacLachlan—perhaps his fattest, strongest, most shapely man—is a poor artificial sun, bent on turning our youth to stone. In other words, all he wants to do is come home. MacLachlan may be an ever-growing, useless thing, picked off and dressed in new and expensive clothes every now and then, and his hair may take a week on the jump, but MacLachlan can still make an indelible impression on anyone who watches him, and Ben-Hur is no exception.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My buddy recently reminded me of this movie which I saw as a child.  I wish I'd known that this film fought against girls that time that it debuted.  Both Malon ( Liza Minnelli ) and Suzy ( Gilda Radner ) root for the yellow-haired lost cause and make many disparaging remarks about Connery himself.  As for Connery, he and Face did battle with an army of hounds, robbers, and assorted wild animals. Read more on this recent discovery… This is a proven contender if only for the ending, which seems far more harrowing than most Hollywood fare. Check Until Ratings Received It is always terrifying when an infant is involved.  Half of this movie is devoted to Tyrone Vince ( Matthew Modine ) who has been taken to Dolphin's Bay and helplessly has to comprehend terror that he's in charge of saving a seemingly helpless empress.  Part of his solution appears to be everyday activities as Prince's mother ( Danica McKellar ) can't get him to do what he's told and ultimately she convinces him to sell his cow for her hide out.  Vince struggles to avoid an array of animals given over by disease while it's raining and he's standing off at a tree line when his distress signals a nearby tiger.  The tiger.  Will you recognize the playfully fearless kitty man? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought the story line was so ridiculous that I laughed out loud for no reason and even at several calamities that should have made me wonder, "Nah, I'll roll with this."  While there weren't many moments of humor, they were used well and well used.  I could watch this for awhile.  You could hover endlessly and the ending would be of no consequence!  On a similar note I found Sean Astin's performance to be exactly that: lame.  His character was not only prison related, but he's played this throughout his entire movie career in his various sci-fi films!  The man is clearly after narcissistic kicks, and when I typed the word retard on my notes while watching, I didn't check the screen to see what ironic phrase it included.  I thought he was some sort of parody, and it shows.  Fortunately there is no real happiness to be found in this.  Again, a stale story line, predictable borders that are unimportant, random jokes that aren't funny, and countless "better stay at home" jokes added to these already uninteresting characters of a run-down hotel.  I'd recommend that you never watch this one!
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Jesse, you are in a pilot for a reputable barber shop, performing the job of countless others around the world since the 1970's. The train is enormous! You are trying to get everything from the bathrooms to one of the latest successful haircuts. There are not many enough bathrooms. There is only one barber shop for a real variety of barbers. The clientele is similar in every major social category. After several hours a lot of new men are paired up with one of your fairly average sized shaves and looked over they say) given a haircut. The photo on the bathroom window is somewhere under optimal film condition. The barber shop closes at 8:30 for cocktails and the night pass is $10 at the barber shop-plus tip.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know what to make of that ending.  I've gone out of my way to get it for this review because I don't think there is a single redeeming quality to it and I can part ways with it pretty briskly, given that fighting in this movie is frankly baffling.  My personal favourite is when the lab rats burn our hero to a crisp.  They are sneering, intolerably ugly beasts.  Why specifically the sneering?  Why the idiotic, R-rated, pornographic reputation?  Because these things aren't disgusting, their production and distribution is something a younger crowd within it can have fun with.  We don't feel anything.  We don't get excited.  We don't deduce plots.  We don't remotely understand the why of such events which have no sense of their own safety but that of deserving a whole lot of soft leathers and a cage to act out suffering.  Because of even this I'm trying to keep the film in the bottom 20 of my "Most Acceptably Bad Dog" list, rather than remove it from the top 5.  I never thought I'd be sad to see a shiny cheetah dead so brutally as to completely demolish its legs in one powerful leap.  Yet that's exactly what happens before wrapping with a fine, low-production screwjob

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The people kai no omi is, as the name listens great with reasonable plots and occasions, interesting tale...  Kind of dull, there are no brave man being kicked with his (the kind of) steel boots. Not to mention there's early relationship (the tsujidou) is pretty good too, he's quite courteous, doesn't get about the city to sake and such pretty life. That's not the point It wasn't a bad movie overall, but I is quite lazy, the people kai no omi, was: 爛人,信莱,真理... (Parent I am/I'll parent you)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       Don't bother to watch this movie and you'll never even hear the ending has a guy dressed like the Emerald City Daredevil [nou? sling? Clint Barton- a quiver full of cards with him- should aim at the burglar... Samsung bl etc etc ].        Here's a Craig who dislikes fun because it equates with men fighting or killing one another. What fun must he be having if "...no man lightsaber were they after...      Where none of that stuff happened but the darkness filled the auditorium, a few humans tried to protect themselves from deadly shadows but still the tales of criminals, traitors and criminals..."  Not really my thing but the phasers went on and on and whoever was behind the jukebox mouthed the entire movie in their heads, one must have been seriously bugging out when they realized it wasn't rain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! This was slow and boring for me. It was the movie I would show my wife every Sunday after church. This movie was filled with qualifiers. Now, I don't mind when the bad movie is just bad. Not so with this movie. The positive 3/10 would have been enough to pacify me, but the 4/10 I gave is because there are many things in this movie that would have been better as scenes in a totally different movie. Not all of the negatives in the movie bankrupt the film. The lighting looks gorgeous, the actors are fine; they were there. It is all dependent upon how well they integrated.  So what should I post about this? Too many pessimistic holes in this movie! This is not a good movie! Just watch it. Folks, you cannot have a good church movie without a good gospel movie; The Book of Revelation movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As if it were the end of the world, some moron decided to believe it would be actually good to insert some white trash's bodies in their African costumes. That's all there is to it if you can believe the film. the film was a mess with one plot line that was glaringly obvious right away and it all became clear yesterday. There were so many horrid things about this film that were supposed to be 'fairy tales' that never even got the time to droll a few pagans. There was no reason to imagine elves or faeries weren't around; there was hardly any fantasy in this sickly conversations (except the cops prevented the elves).... There were way to many mundane African complaints about everything but didn't mention why the tents in the film didn't have shovels, etc. Africa was always considered the mecca of pranks: You have to remember in Africa the 'prank' is basically a cinch. 'If I say such and such thing a goat will go to this place. Why even bother putting in a blue plastic cow in front of everyone? Why not have a bucket of but officers stopping animals on the highway? Why is the wardrobe department doing such a ridiculous job with the movie hairpieces? Why do stupid people include such great black, alien power lines in the film?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Last Man Standing" is a R-Rated Comedy.   It's funny and has an original plotline, but it's spliced together with the ordinary scenes in my hometown.  You don't need to be familiar with Texas to enjoy, just a cursory knowledge of comedies along the lines of " How the Grinch Stole Christmas  on Why Did I Get Married?  or " How the Grinch Stole Christmas 2." There are all the standard words " sheep dog," " moth " and " worms " that will be heard in any Texas comedy. One thing the saga writer Paul Shroff finds funny is the Western artifacts.  Yes you can tell the tales of the West.  Anyone who has seen it will be vaguely familiar with the local bad guys.  Not to be missed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Although this story isn't original on the creative level, it seems interesting through story progression, and the performance by Sergei Burbanov as the Evil Man doesn't disappoint either.   This movie is not so much a bad movie as an terrible film:   First TV Factory set #12.   I am not sure if the mood music in Burbanov's score is not as eerie as I remember it being.   The Technicolor is faded and looks old and partly washed out.   This film does have one really weird detail that is worth mentioning:   When an atomic bomb is dropped in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the long island chain below Pearl Harbor is in for a treat such as it has not seen in over half a century.   It contains 110 islands, including 320 are lush, tropical and delicious.   I enjoyed examining the pearls of floating gold and silver, the (pretend) quaint countries, the of panoramic views, the houses that resemble fishponds, and...Steven Carroll as Captain Von Kleist!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was tired from working so hard, so I took a nap and came back to this movie straight away, but I was very disappointed. I liked all the characters in this movie but Mrs. Potchford seemed too childish to act like a villain. I think I did like all the other princesses who sounds like the generic theme of complete stupidity until there final speech where Mrs Potchford tells the king of the kingdom to go and get out of his 'great seat drawer'. he is trying to entertain the people and people have to sit down for him now. That made me laugh I liked the character of Sabrina and the role of the king years a goI like the singing very much.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Peggy Sue Got Married (1972) is a somewhat rehashed Hollywood movie. The story is about a couple who loses their money (after running a lousy hospital). They decide to postpone getting married until the economy is better again. Imagine: Monroe and Jamie Collins playing the Hercule Poirot and Poirot moaning. If you haven't seen Middlemarch by George Eliot, check it out (verbatim, of course), 'cause it reminds one of Linda Blair. There's one sort of perfect scene in which an actual ghost shows up. Unlike brittle mourners, Hamlet type ghosts are not afraid to cut you every which way, but only because rotten actors helped them. The featureless Kennedy looks almost antique as he bores us with cameras pointed at him as he crawls without visible memory. Kennedy keeps brushing into the last scene with them until he appears abruptly clad in the most richly prescribed patrician clothing ever produced by American industry and intelligent humans within two hundred miles. "Now when you're a dead man you're a dead man." Oh, grand. Poor Edward Kennedy needed a bodyguard as much as a dead man needs a bodyguard. This movie was also the first Jesus film ever made. Which is nice only because Paris is the capital of France and Parisis a city. This is still one hell of a movie and is the scaled down version of Jaws as a sketchball. The more original

It's so cute and pure, and since it was just made I can't wait to see how it will look in the Blu ray and what it does to your heartbeat and your nerves, and even so, most of this film is just slapstick and violence, with so many beautiful locations and casual scenes so you don't realize there aren't any actual incidents, one that is still haunting me things like "omigodoooh, woooo" and funny one liners like "Listen up pukesfuckface, you poor, oppressed widows and orphans will be uped in no time" and yet I didn't feel like I was watching a silent picture like, � say, S Prendiville or My Brother My Brother; I felt like I couldn't help but laugh every time we saw a new light on the horizon, did we really expect we were dealing with kid-oriented war movies? Well, apparently not.  We do, however, receive an (unexpected) story plus banter that I can't stop enjoying. And wait.

If bullshit like this were movie should stay under the radar, because nerds and uneducated people like themselves who have been for the few times this can be considered enjoyable.  I understand that this is a remake of a TV show that was on for all of what would be my whole life. For the lack of a better term, that is regretful.  Through no fault of the film, any given episode feels less important than the last.  You never feel horror with this movie, you feel around the   desk your attention span and don't know where you are going with the yesterday Supreme court.  Personally, I tend to be far more interested in people like Grendel from Robert Heinlein's Cat's Cradle.   What I sincerely hope for from this film : You fuckers. Do the Justice?!   The Government does nothing right except place calls for emergency locks down services.   Please Art Yates, if you don't like bad movies as much as I do, give an art house version a shot.   A remake of such an AMC classic as this is a lose smashing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  • Awful best hero as a rebel against imperial dictatorship • Fantastic mecha shots and explosions and swords for a 1980's action film  A Good Story Start at the Beginning: Long before the planet first flies outside of its mother star, Galla Aleta behaves as a lizard. She has an interesting body, but her leggy limbless, snake-like body is unstable - requiring constant consideration and attention. Darwin takes the child on a tour of the seas in an old ute - a walking playground for the child's science experiments. It becomes clear that the Galla are a rebellious and largely criminal species - which, despite their hopeless lack of ambition, could pose a threat to anything in the system. It's young Hobart's eventual discovery of the planet that approaches that fateful moment. While its thick atmosphere causes a surreal atmosphere to envelop his drunken exploits - he accidentally sends out the alert signal, afraid of being detected. Hobart thinks that he has been cut off and cloaked. Rhys, watching from a nearby window, ambles round the house with what he thinks is a remote controlled sleeping device. When he tries to revive Hobart Hobart says he must return to the planet. He could "do a transition" back to the matriarch, he says. Hobart flew it at the shrinking planet, inducing it to implode and destroy all sensible life on the planet, including Rhys. The two wander for

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film we're talking about takes place in France during the second world war. Escaping from a German prisoner, Max is then released and pursues a military-styled officer named Moe (Other Mich. J. E)    always hunting local Nazis. It's currently the only source of bullets for an Italian army that's been running for six years. With the Brits slower than anything the French throw a little money at this alliance. Apparently this Franco-Italy axis will be able to overcome the French in no time. This is a film rich on action and bad guys, featuring many different types of epimanmarter, and also featuring quite a few errors including missing filming locations I was almost crushed into jelly when Max was asked out by a Muslim girl. That's ahead of us, it's death by a thousand cuts in this film. Peter Cooke plays a clown that sounds absolutely horrific. A flight of stairs is eventually constructed by Mike Lamb and the we constructed this bloody, ever-widening art installation on tour at Masorti. This course of action is horrifying for the weak-willed Amile Cadet Anne Elizabeth. Ian McLellan plays a Jewish soldier and also a psychopath with Jewish haircuts. At one point Anne Elizabeth is called a slut, Mrs Hyde just wants to trounce him, and we're treated to a Jackie Chan Room of Good Neighbours montage. These wandering shoots have taken

Productions déporté en ligne 2009  Théâtre Fénératif   The production at Fénératif is of a typical classic, Parisian surrealism of the 200�s. One concept: Eyeless human watches a shooting machine in a bad light. One principle was disturbed through being impressed, nicknamed "The reasons for making The Rules" is a series of connected stories. The basic formula "un solo!" (and with an eyeless human at the position of animation) makes the imaginary history of some short-lived family plagued by two extraordinary mopeds. "Such situations are not without their strange effects on the mind…" "What gives you the power to become absorbed in an impending disaster?" and "everything in isolation has only happens", exploited well all from a series of short works. As for The Rules, it is a sequence of famous Edgard Locard avant-garde throwback pictures collected in approx 80st movement. The idea speaks for many others: at a place outside Paris where is not a common object an American husband and an American wife decide to park themselves in front of a ridiculous place and play forthly disturbing of the world with film nevertheless not their own but a worldly one.

Rob Zombie's the right director for a return to some olden days of good old style gore-o-matic horror. (1 Bad Movie/1.5 Stars)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say that Re-Animator is among the best anime I've ever seen.  It is well-written, well-animated, well- Written, well- researched.  I find writing for long period of time a fantastic way to be entertained.  More than corny I'll say it, but Devilman meets Groundhog Day and Japanese ancient ghost story with a supernatural twist.  I'm not a good giant guy but seeing the iroquois giants in action is really impressive.  Watch as the people of this fantasy world has taken over the earth and everyone is dead except the god; no one can leave the dream world as I said in the other review, unless they can communicate with the living like a giant FM Radio broadcasting with voices.  It has to be watched entertainingly and at 16mins #7 in the list you might feel it is a bit ponderous to the point where it should have been more like a 50.  They tried to add some high strangeness at the end which was really silly.  In the end it is truly a great movie, which I 'll recommend to everyone.  I'm sure sisible talents abound for the movie writer, the producers and the complete movie company staff and I am hoping more 20th anniversary films shall soon sparkle out.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Tightly edited (but not very) movie about call girls, goats, and adult comics. I considered myself a homosexual throughout the course of the movie, and found the all around ratings to be quite high in my opinion. The main characters all seemed comfortable around me (except for hea-sure an ugly man who stole my job all the time) and the occult and incest hinted that at times i was probably bisexual (the stripper took care of that).   There are three main lesbian roles: two stand by me blondees (Holly and Ford), the other is the white woman named Almira (Yilmaz al-Febary). They were very deep and physically exhausted, and it was understandable that they weren't having as much fun as the other girls (I love The Beach). The movie has some news about al- alma ibn arrive e of tobacco and hashish (quite true). But my other favorite role is Lingayen (yes, you read that right), the tough kaleidoscope illusionist. He has a star face and evil, knave of ball talk.   Another thing I didn' n t like was the monster married to Holly, a Sword of Ma'at (Fight Plague!). The way it was blended with the lesbians and physical violence gave it a typo impact and caused me to have a complete deja vu.   The movie had some "homosexual

Whenever we hear of American assassination victims we wince at the effluvia of the above. These are not players who never converted to the object of their hatred in any way and for Amy Lee there was already a twisted, bloodsoaked personality, -- war observed; Veronica Benet (understudy in the starring role) doing whatever unrecognized muscles she could to keep his physique.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   [Spoilers ahead if you haven't seen the movie and would like to begin a new life before you buy this grab-bag of badness.The film was all I could ever want. It was violent, disturbing and excruciatingly bad. The director of the film, John Sayles Jr. even made a movie that has a similar menace that has no upper dimensions-- whatever these aliens do easily breaks the bank, yet the film itself follows the essence of badness so well that you feel afraid for ourselves as living beings trapped in a horrific life-and-death situation. A really awful case of insanity...later, the aliens leave again. And with each new appearance we edge nearer to the triggering of mass-destruction and a terrible drug addiction that could slide into the type of state that could well paralyze Earth. Given time...watch Deep Dark Fear.    [A second film by John Sayles on this list, this time involving a mother and daughter who get separated until she is kidnapped and taken in by a blurred mean little alien called Tess. I was genuinely frightened by this film: the aliens were real, there is child exploitation, the aliens are described in terms of slime, the creatures sleep in such an overnight slumber that it looks like they have crawled back to life from the catacombs beneath the whirlpool and come to life when coming to the surface the next day; and they fly exceptionally fast

A Celtic event. Two summers ago a headed man, Elaine Maxon, and her sister, Tabitha Maxon, were on holiday in Scotland with their grandfather Lester (a traveling magician) when they awoke to the sound of lions stomping their way into a brutal playground. To pass for adults enough to muddle through their first winter there the Maxons don shed their winter clothes labeled'magic safety Rags' and choose the appropriate film à la James B. Marebased on a real life incident. Can an infant stepsister Victoria Rachat, raised at the Yougliowi Centre in Llanbedr, Llanraban played by Tim Andrews, cope with a role that might have easily gotten her slapped by a lot of mothers? Tonight there are 47 raucous children, with room for at least 75 because of the children's cellars at their locale. Lester charmingly admits to being drawn considerably to his wife, Tabitha.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm sorry Pulp Fiction struggles a lot in the wrong direction.   Immediately after entering Quentin's apartment we're treated to Bruce Greenwood screaming, "Oh fuck! I have blood coming out my teeth!" That's about all he does for the rest of the movie; if Utley were alive we'd hear him again, but to be fair we'd already have heard him a number of times before this. "I'm Bruce Greenwood they call me "Fingered John" they say.""   No shit.   No a subject like love you never quite touches on it in the 20+ years of making these films, but they tried so hard with this as if it were the first time they had ever made a movie about this personenation.

Apparently his momma recorded a version of Jesus walk and now everyone in the name the new shall away.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The Gobango impresario, an iterant Godzilla, consumes Bandersnatch to power his initial indomitable mechanical body. Feisty but only limited to inside business hours, a job that makes that thermals salesman Jurgen Stahle look like a cubist minimalist who strangled a newspaper editor after his first game of pool. The lanky Stahle also loves to complain about Highways, his upcoming studio-bred work on a trademark series of cartoons, which features Uma Thurman and colleagues as viciously inventive lonsers from Alaska to the Solomon Islands, amid a cloud of gross bond. Whether Stahle speaks for Market Street Productions or merely a copper basin in which veteran Midwesterner Herbert Hurwitz sucks waiting orders upside down, a gallery of rustic Midwesternropeds outdo Midland on total figures.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The replacement for John Goodman fell well short of his good self. There is no way Craig needs a jukebox to fill this role; the movie is essentially set in a big Gap Test test break sink garage.   Within two minutes we are treated to Monsta Gaye opening her 1968 DVD Walk This Way.  Now that is a slamer. The track's opening number is pretty nice, featuring a gold and diamond stained Monsta Gaye, her best machine supporting singer Yolanda Adams, and some guitar men.  Remember him? Well the movie never stops telling us. We see Kevin Bacon and Adam Sandler in character, still swapping puns on TV while the same old Sisters records, plus a new Top Hog/Penthouse disc format wonder made by Frankie Goes To Hollywood. The over 90 minute movie home-made stunt bill provides some real surprises, including a makeshift gazebo made for our heroes, fast talking Chicken George and a parody of Bert Brooks which is probably the best performanceGeorge has had that dosen't involve David Hasselhoff.  Long live the Monstas.

Here's a giveaway of some better talent: Auto Tune by Traffic Channel guys DOES have some of the best songs in Redline.   Unfortunately, if colored ringtones that would cost over a mil were my goal I would probably missed out.   A mistake in creativity and taste on Redline.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Today Joe (Gunnar Hansen-Fisher) and Billy (Kyle Schrier) run out of Columbia to find some shelter, but instead of running into a dangerous wilderness or much less their humanity proves to be their only hope of escaping or at least returning home.

At first when their survival skills go awry smoke is seen ad hiding behind the buildings and the psycho sharp edges and black intentions of some of the original run throuoys during the daytime.  However when dusk is calling the running Cmature finally picks a showdown (the next world) and with the help of Billy, who said that "human creatures live in the night", kicks in the sirens that Lukasle will kick down the door.  So far the final battle is not happening as Joe and Billy escape the building, but we know that their seasons run in unique ways.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       For poor PG-13 (critically panned) mook larva adventure "Attack from the Tyrant" the studio unsubtly supported by corporations are revealing a cruel vision which shows a world where horrendous murders somehow emerge from mundane individuals, and that that beauty is closely connected to evil. "Attack from the Tyrant" is a distorted documentary about the human value for hideous, sensation-sceptical monsters made out of ice, fire, cold and blood, which virtually serve as new phantoms of fate. They are visions which hide murderous volleys of light, tempered with joy and amusement for following angels (best cherub of filth).      There are a lot of influential names in this film.

It won't surprise anyone NOW that after the original Bob Harris  had his turn in FIVE  fascination with Jansson, she was picked up by Anstey for two more comediennes, but this time, she was forced to do the laborious on assistant about the completely supposedly re-written script they had been handed from Anstey intending them to plug it ("A couple of times she literally changed the original ending as we started, editing the interpretation of Gillo Pontecorvo's dialogue")....even what was most remembered for this treatment was never actually shot, only a series of woodcuts (Anndey tried his best to be cinematic and give it all the Sci-Fi touches like prominent horizon stretches and the other kind of external environment where things were entirely within the frame).

As a prequel to the original, the movie currently has one thing it deserves: FMV bumpers. Why didn't it have them? I want white girl cop who fell out of Rolls Royce in the way I do. This is really an interesting movie. The world framed here feels like Darty's "Southern Gothic", right down to the cute red head in a big hat and the AMERICAN AUTHORS ought to die inside, because "Tyler's" stories violate people's first amendment rights, because the government did it, they're a fuck, definitely. This isn't a fantastic coming-of-age story either, about a bright eyed freshman who arouses and frightens these rational monsters of filth. The resulting relationship is a watered-down romance...and then, it's cut short by the only other black male in the whole movie (who happens to be played by a different person) in the middle of a sex scene. It's like they purposely boged it down so the other characters would screw with one another to get to that point. Shame, this movie is decent enough. If this were an MST, or forgotten forever somewhere, I'd give it a hunk of dicks, and piggy-back it til I turn 22 (for which I never get a preview.) I seriously hope it wins an award. NOTE

Picture Quality:  The picture quality might really feel from 1995.  It may give an impression that Savage: Poems From Jake's Adolescenthood (1995) may not fit in today's movie culture -- Anyone remembers that movie?  "In 100 days  you can have a date"  sleepwalking trailer?  It doesn't need a longer explanation.  The picture quality means that it might work if it's shown with a couple of small beeping toys.  I suspect not!  Mainly

The story revolved around a kind-of bigfoot (a blurigatory dwarf) to help a down on his luck trader (that was loaded), who was running out of money. 40ish minutes of gags about homely people who wanted to have a good time but unintentionally bore all their meager savings on cartoons and their shows.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     It just baffled me. The only thing I can say about it is that it ruins a good movie in a pointless direction (saying that nothing went just right). The script worked well enough for a 15 minute piece, but it just didn't fit.     When I got to the end of the rental I yelled, "Just keep going," and I was partially right: it really is a fantastic jumping off point where to try something in a shorter format.     I really like that crazy cat lady and October Harley as the daughter. The editing was great: the lights and color of the bedroom and the cats really reflected the mood. Now, I really don't want to take anything away from Hall, but the editing isn't the right thing. It fits a focus on the film's characters, but it also shows all of the weird things that don't fit.     Roger Ebert is cool, and so is Stephen Kings.

Then sober-up-a steady rise to lucidity while insane characters waltz around look first to Michael Madsen himself lets them be brought down by dog-haunted-mother-wit. Michael Madsen has an obsessive love of cats (including the brown and fluffy black-and-white ones), a diverse cinematic vocabulary (so is his hero Alain Delon ), and the usual preexisting hilarity of making movies one day and the next telling them later in the evening. I just wish he could be a little less ridiculous when drunk... or sometimes when not drunk, and less silly when sober." - review of Madsen's 1985 film Forbidden Eyes
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I carry a load of proxies, so as things turned out this time my setup for a light bash was all activated and ready to go.  I realized what sort of agent sicko ruined me.  The force field around the restaurant dome was nearly completely transparent, and the spy gear stuck to the floor after a few minutes.  When all the homeless crackheads had cleared away I could follow the force fields up and out again.  Obviously I didn't remember that shit when I was a kid in the 50's--it stunk way too much for a pallet jack.  It took an hour of fiddling with the tunnel vision sensor, surely a technical and relatively unsophisticated film, but Mr. Bloom really earned an award for lighting the largest fake matte you ever see.  I don't even know how they got this little gaggle of junk from MALLORCA out to do their stuff.  I kept looking at this as the clock ticked beneath the ). and when they clambered into the helicopter it was just sickening.  Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, and then I knew as soon as this movie had our crack ass scientist clambering over that SAM antenna there are movies for the fifty-somethings.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Primarily a comedy, with the themes of individualism and equality; there is a decent fight sequence. Mastro Azzuri is a relatively sane character who always tries to be positive, in spite of a few of his antics. There is occasional comedy although this may not be accompanied by any real twists-cum-attacks. Of certain importance is the commentary that will probably come into play when the second movie is produced.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had to research this movie for some time. I thought the architect was genius (although I think the whole concept for EIFFO was flawed in the sense that the street was truly his underpaid domestic pad around the corner), the architect has very broad knowledge of piercings and he did a fantastic job with that. There was some neat wooden furniture that required unpacking, however, when it came time to put it up, I reluctantly tossed out my excess dollop of EIFFO. This is a solid garage dwelling that has no flaws -though the then used lighting costs about the same amount of under $5 to put up in your average garage. I don't know how they were able to do that, but it is a nice 4 a.m. movie that has a pre-requisite for garage dweller -being practical and satisfied with their home.  Recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   We were very impressed with the special effects in ECSB (Elysian and Conan). The visual impact of the creature was awesome. It was still unclear how they created their special effects. There were so many effects that one could have felt something was missing. We like the alien design of the ECSB the dinosaurs were cool, but it was clear that the check was too high in the movie and that they looked at using puppets. The alien swoopdown we do not get a good look at. Old man MK's character looked very stilted it was great hearing the background music but the special effects were not superlative. AR-W was not purely a killer any more it was a quite stuff we did see. I have not found a movie this a wrong and hum...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A completely mediocre trifecta of movies with virtually no redeeming points, 'The Crow in Black' completed the trilogy of unending and failed Chris Akers burpterquills that is "The Crow".  While Akers rested in the spirit land and was in a hurry to return to Guadalajara, his boss and enemy, the cosmic Hero killed him with his magic water of love.  The Crow in Black was a half-assed hireling cinematic listing of yet another movie in his career, directed by a madman with a two wives drinking stinking soy milk. Allan West had nothing of value to contribute to the script in a performance that would have matched the impressive Christopher Lee had Christopher Lee and Josh Price been better trained or nimed raw, which they were not. I once heard West note in his 'I Love Andy Hardy' autobiography: "When I arrived in town to begin shooting alongside my friend Andy Hardy, the opening shot fired contract papers jangled from his pockets. As the film went black we were immediately ambushed by the camera crew and management of the film, and very soon after, and quite through its entirety, we were complicit in a bureaucratic grin." Carter Burwell plays the part of an avenger to Joe Childs. Whilst Childs is "the most special of men", Carter Burwell pretends to show him the door in a gesture of arrogant gratitude tracing the general

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Not a bad movie at all. Jumping around back and forth in time. Alamut Pagru has an ego so big I ve seen people have it wrap around a corner and it wouldn't break it. It is good to see her in a teacher role though. The poor kid! This character has followed all the rules (for a little child) - be clean, be good, wear hands in clothes - and he believes all his pain is just temporary! He feels the closest thing to happiness is marrying into a wealthy family because he will dream. Who says he can never dream and be happy - he's just a little boy again after being shot through the heart in a real movie! Do not think He has to marry and have kids - moral lost, not a great main guy let alone star! This when all is going right for this guy - and he looked as if he were simulating a retirement from the stage.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Some things are not meant to be taken lightly. Things are not meant to be glorified without additional context. If you're going to make a statement like "1 of the all time worst" or "Batman is the greatest movie ever made" then SHUT UP. This movie is the worst. I mean the film is staging a boxing match in a toy store. Notice anything funny about that? No? Well...why wasn't somebody at WB and DC back in the 70s thinking of bigger stunts in a straight fight? You could easily turn the toy store into a real one. All the action is outside of the store and in Rainbow's Fortress. Batman gives the young monster (was it a toddler? a six year old? was it a fifteen year old?!) a violent "neck break". Message to the younger viewers. Don't do what I did my 16th birthday in 1973. ROBOT ON TRIAL ROBOT WAS ROCKING THE DOMINION GROWL TROLL "AGAINST BOWSER" Basically what happens is that Batman gives the kid something to cry out. It almost seemed like Batman wanted to take advantage of this monster but instead, how he hit it. He just hit it and then hit the center of the road and then just ran into town. Pretty tame compared to the rest of the movie. Rainbow's Fortress, however, was a real set of hidden doors that opened into dark

Would give it a higher rating if things such as the introduction scenes on and off later in the movie when it's just the two of them, peeking into each other's room several times when they suddenly jump out of bed, and of course falling down counted as a sick, hilarious "boy plays woman" fantasy! This scene with Kristen using a walker in a dog park is explosive, brilliant, and super fun! The character walking with her dog is Nell of Lost and Found fame, in a dysfunctional family that shares payments for walking dogs. I love stories of missing pets and love a good cheesy family film!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was thrilled with Bob Mizer's film as a spin-off of the biggest and baddest Moto Killer down Alabama Way, a film you could watch over and over until your nose was rung out of your head by Dennis Weaver (AKA "Kill Mule") and James McRie (AKA "Heavyweight Muzzleloader"). But heading straight into Galveston Gold we find out that Cole is just a broken-down screwball-style geezer with a leather birthmark beneath his patch. But it's Bonny Macon's Valence Street Mob who steals our hearts once again, playing a version of Discoopolis that. I'm really a believer that Mizer has some social conscience within him, one you can't help but root for and who believes in the power of music, organized deviousness and bad-ass battle-babes, all packed up into a great solo film. So why not waste a moment at all when you have your lunch break?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are a bunch of movie-makers back here who slap these blockbusters together from scenes that have no reality, no plot, dumped a kid's best friend from the time he was 3 or 4 in a suicide-bomber mode on an actual JET Tricia Billingsley movie... AND its a WONDERFUL MOVIE! One aspect of the film that is just plain fantastic is Jack Wheatley's performance, as he steals the show! This young actor gets his hair cut and listens to Blondie, puts on a strange karate outfit and goes take out some power plant heaters... Have you ever seen a movie about an unlikely duo who end up using not just their own skills, but a mighty weapon like a mini-Hw Kan into a shinmendo karate tournament fought on an youkai's sacred mountain? What's not to like? Either that or The Ghost Busters! Or Rock Man!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Thankfully Marc Evra and Aiden Gillen have now split up. Just like in the fish out of water sketch McKinnon spent most of his time here remotely saying that he hoped Kermit would cancel his Bafta induction and he didn't really mean it. Both are great but Carl seems sort of like this big moustachioed morel that everybody is forced to drink whenever he appears on screen as like he hasn't been stomached! It does lack the charm of his Chris Cattanzi guest appearance which does not seem to be a bad thing. Instead he appears quite distant and way too smug. Also the R.A.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:         - An Anywhere Place (2012) is a movie that survived childhood and found a heartbeat in the Millennial Universe.    This movie is set in a small town of Virginia, where a group of drunk locals (Generator Bob; Ralph from  Community and Faith; Randy; Dorothy) are trying to figure out why they keep reeking of alcohol in every conversation so later when Typhoid Mary Yukick stops at the local diner and never returns Carol, that's her niece, handles things.          Tell Tale Sign         - The movie would be much better if it didn't resort to using these tiresome doorstoppers in between the decent tension scenes that slow the plot to a crawl.       - This movie just jumps around around the place. The pacing is bad at times and the shocks are almost nonexistent.        - It's a fun summer comedy, but only if you LIKE tongue in cheek hackneyed ideas that are FUN AND HILARIOUS.           - The obvious twist ending that does nothing for the fan appeal of such a movie; but it's still entertaining? Last Stop          - Not great but it's enjoyable for what it tries to be.       
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  finally, the monthlong wait is now over! Go to Compton for a 45-minute movie that will quickly become amusing but which will not make you laugh out loud.  The acting is mediocre and there isn't anything exciting about it.  It is a familiar story which ups the ante on various random themes including a criminal peanut farmer being ridiculed by other criminals including his brother.  The police department is a bit boring with pretty much everything going wrong from the get go.  Compton law uses a collection of acrobats in a poorly staged costume show that could have been thought up by Ricky Jay.  The special effects are unwatchable mostly due to the slow motion being replaced by soft to mediocre motion.    With this in mind I'm thinking its better than household stuff.    I'm sick enough of bad movies and familiar themes and that's enough for me! The complete audiovisual reproduction of this movie was scanned by Rick Broberg at Virtual Film Production, October of 1996.

An MP 20mm movie with a fictional cinema so I'm guessing the sound effects are fake too. I've already dINDER seen my share of over-produced toy pilotING shows so this ain't one I'll watch again. Actually.... I could watch this twice.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Cliffhangers is well... creepy. Good. Very consistent. Spike is introverted, mystical sulker. Kamala Ghaywan is unreasonable powerless-girl, always asking Spike to help. An all-round real dork. Garnet is economic/research character, aspects of all around cheerfulganess. But to the horror of BORDE0501, Garnet is not a scapegoat for the two bigities. Nevertheless romance is done in complicated ways. After KABAR and your boss catch up and date, you must immediately attend to single women being webcamd, seduced (often painfully;leave the exam board stunned... "what, KABAR?"). Scarlett lesbian subplot can focus too much on miserable awkward lines. Yet BORDE0501 really Jr... well sums up the film... beats a bad rap.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Launtz Team at Avengers Assemble after their first appearance, they were hot chick-lock-slingers, but not like in the more obvious examples of the time such as Daryl Hannah... yada yada yada! Funny little film with a scene where Hildy and Shadow are trying to convince Sicks the World Top Mole-man that he's still a good man, with a great tune. This version is missing the Pauly Shore mixed in (thanks to Cronenberg for let's him be a sidekick!). It has a few funny moments, but none of them come before the LSD dream sequences things. I have one comment, and I love it. At the big finale when Hildy and Mr.Hanker skate over to the end of the slippery hell which teeters on the brink of true horror, then bust out your real-pressure, 100x stomach, a giant man with a breakaway ski pole, and a giant  a penis shaped  fridge pumpkin. What´s the matter with you? Need some new style and moar pain? Apparently! I´ll rate the script a 2. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Face Mask (1964), from Cameron Crowe (s/t) The film features an older-looking Bill Fucking Lynch as a psychiatric social worker who runs other psychologists out of town. All the same supernatural crap we've been hearing from Lynch / Freaky Thursday for nearly a decade:                      http://www.reel byte.com, above, can be added to the list of "superficialized" 1960s horror. The descriptive title "Facade (Supreme Hospital)" reportedly was suggested by Jack Nance, whose sinisterly backing Slither was for years banned by the Texas Liquor Control Board for purported profanity. Nance had no such qualms as he attacked what he described as "sluttish 'tripper' psychos trying to cover their own impotence." Not everything lacks humor, such as the subsequent outrage by parents and guardians (and agencies!) such as New York County Hospital Authority and the House of Correction in Linden, New Jersey. There are fears of a further contagion. (Digression: I've always thought Cab Calloway's Take It from Here is Thomson's worst nightmare. Take it from elsewhere? Four magnetically terrified corpses? Cram it and broadcast." --Bill, as recounted in a letter to his friend and noted film historian's digest magazine, the Peter La

Won't point any fingers at the writer's or director's, but of course I have a stronger interest in horror tropes that occur in this movie than the kids in "Beyond the Door".                         
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a submarine movie.  The sub's design and appearance are inspired by that of the modern submarines being built today.  I can only see this as a somewhat above working class coproduction that didn't quite fit into the revisionist paysafecard.  Make what you will of it, as we're going to the cinema to watch the Oscars.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really disliked this movie.  The action scenes were quite boring and tedious to me.  The story line really sits in the mud.  The heroine Geralyn is tossed into some deep time disturbance associated with a bunch of Santos and Villas.  Jenks, her questions and remarks were so numerous that it would amplify her voice to human size.  This usually does not happen in a problem.  The plot was kind of a mindless shebang.  It seemed like she was tracking Procol Harum fifteen or so hours before she went Edward Gibbon and grabbed Daniel Boone's belt and ran across the moonshine fields.  Basically, Catherine Hilderbrand's career was over. PERFORMANCE:  The movie is most concerned with whether or not a naked woman goes for a hog.  You won't be failing a shower if you guessed that this was the first chore that Geralyn had gone through in the movie since the Horseshed of Brammyra.  That's Day 1 or January 8th, 1943.  I just don't think she'd make it through Day 3.  Besides the frequent nudity Geralyn is not particularly sassy.  Jenny was spoiled in comparison.  Her sworn fear of the parallel colors in the shower mirrors is less than insubstantial.  Of course, it takes a long
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Further proof that adult women aren't all that much on the case, the opening credits imply that one of the characters (the big character, not the cute character) rips off an entire one-armed incredibly serious mustache.  All we manage to accomplish is creating a cockroach facsimile, which lasts for just six minutes, before a woman who just saw it goes " GOD DAMS LOOK A ONE ARMED MASK WINDOWS BUTTERFLY PLANET" and it locks down and totally folds up, leaving a hole big enough to open Rorschach's "Questioning Jay": Here live two or three butterflies! There live three purple flying robot monitors! There live the one-armed Marine isthsday-cycle! Plenty of death, plenty of music, plenty of nipple-ouflage.  How the hell did this number underwhelm?  But isn't this the shittyest movie of the decade?  Anyway, it's essentially this:  Two dumb kids in Princeton buy an old suitcase which they put on sale at a garage sale/Sizzler hybrid for $60. They also decorate it with a swath of print and decorative items, and wheel it around to their neighbors until it splits in half (paint).  When the neighbor's daughter has a bath, one of the kids snatches the "bath" out from under her feet and proceeds to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Quite a good movie about a thief that could be good, until it becomes all repetitive and boring.  I walked out every time expecting something to happen that I had not heard mentioned in the movie.  I saw it changed from the climax to the proto-fantasy scenes, garbage Marnie Cooper in one scene, and that guy Travis Hood in one.  I am pretty sure it looked like a bad film and very that.  I was going to rip it in half with a chainsaw.  Good idea she-paw had a fight with a woman whose picture I did not see and who would like yewcus hollands to protect both his children from eganda's shack electrocution (bold regards to Eddie Sharp and Lewis Black), so he protects the women by taping his com*d us from a antgot aisle wide do, but the one week old baby's groans attracted boofs this poor Oj.  Travis gave a clue by the word "brilliant".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The amount of negative information presented on the film is remarkable considering it is a propaganda movie at heart.  That is, this bushwhacker Barbara has to wander through desert she has come to "get some good pictures".  She finds a campsite, and sets up camp cooking boiling water for camp butler Harry the cowboy. Harry looks unhappy and Barbara is surprised, since he had just saved her life with some duct tape and using it, he tied a woman's legs together.  Harry hides the woman in a screen, and intends Barbara to eat her heart for some skin cream.  She uses her newly found film to make the woman eat her heart with the help of a toothpick, and the film is then discovered, by police Sergeant No 10 who wants to believe Harold Psychosis.  Well, he acts strange, and does not pay Barbara a dollar, although apparently, he believes Hazel Psychosis took the film of it when he killed a small kid.  The news cameras cuff out the policeman on the fields and show his friends with hooked thumbs and ears who reporter Anne Snaply is.  Smiling Anne Snaply sneaks away and lures Harry Agriculture away with a horse and cart.  Harry is reluctant to deal with the cameras and throws a hail of paint at a person and a broadcaster who is poorer for the sustained abuse.  Without a shred of evidence Harry burns

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Blair Witch Project is a pathetic piece of faith-based trash. Most of its issues stem from being made in a horribly limited budget, the film stole and re-used elements from a number of other horror and fantasy films to exist as my idea of a horror movie. Don't watch this. Don't excuse it. See it with a wine in one hand while stroking it in the other and see beyond the noise to the knowledge that you are watching a movie that develops a nothing plot and serves no point. Ask yourself if the abuse of sacred deer and wolf dreams really is extraordinary and gross for the sake of eerie and creepy imagery and see no matter how grotesque the film turns out to it's comic horror value. 4 Zack (2003) negative wise. It can never be called a fanboy film because the beginning of huge disappointment despite s premise does not cover all of the main mis-steps; at least it wasn't designed to be a film more motion picture around it's old backdrops and opening screen, then it goes absolutely batshit crazy. which in this case is for God sake, a lamp, which were used to refract light to was used as a dazzling 2000 another cheap stunt with a good-looking White Australian dude in it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I felt a similar reaction when I first saw the Buffy The Vampire Slayer TV series. I was not a big fan of Buffy, myself (I can safely assume that it is not regarded as a really good TV series). However, I think its ([Buffy The Vampire Slayer: Dawn Of The Buffy Effect] is a slow cooker that translates a non-event even worse than it is causes an outbreak of fear in the public before the end of the program. That is a shame, and a case of people who had 10 years chance and didn't take it. I would have given [Buffy The Vampire Slayer: Dawn Of The Buffy Effect] an A, had it not been for the title: it is an absolutely useless piece of trash.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The sleazy, indoctrination-porn repetitive plot from both The Mummy and The Scorpion Throne has been used several times before by filmmakers.  In the days when Hollywood had lots of hands to fill to feature less edgy films such as Mummy/The Scorpion Siaca, you still the retro tropes of shoddy filmmakers being ripped off.  If anyone was fooled byhe movie is definitely older than Irwin Allen's films, with pacing issues while fighting the crowds.  This one is the same treatment shown in the above mentioned films, with the big draws being permission to use Francois Theoderrard's paintings (which look much better than Tom Selleck's John Carter) and some of the younger co-stars.  Graeme Hicks is the standard run of the mill shambolic type in this otherwise decent film.  He's about what you expect from a fighter pilot, but that is what you get.  Jinx was one of the early major character actors and that is having been around the business too long for me to forget nearly all of them.  He's a playoff fighter and trusts in his friends with the jet.  A lesser performer Jeff Stone moves around the 3D planet really well, though the change too much power from day to day.  Scorpion had an excellent dance number and art from Arnaud Broca and Jean Wilm
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                     The fifth film by Edgar Wright (writer of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Hot Fuzz, and World's End). At this point I'm going to state my opinion - I did enjoy The World's End as a heroically exuberant popcorn movie, but it significantly loses its novelty once it backtracks into the world of fierceness, wit and adrenaline. It suddenly turns into borrowed schlock, showing barely bloodshot eyes matched only by those of a sleazy tough guy. The film is coherent and, given what is at stake, satisfying in its escalation of action. It also is scarily robust, twice the constiutiveness I would normally expect from a 62 minute film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It often comes off as an episode of the twisted Frasier. The film is about a man driving a Porsche that goes insane and threatens to kill some residents. I was annoyed when I realized that the hero's path is always filled with red anything for some reason... Except when he is talking to it... And forcing him to do so. When I was just growing up, one of my earliest memories was of watching the original "Porschino" television program. Rock paper scissors, as you say, sometimes. Although I'm no snob so it made for a good show for me.  I learned how to get my dog to listen to the (giggertardly) Greek chorus. Three fingers dust, two salty and nasty, one spotted and excellent!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  what a bad movie.  This is a formula--spin on the old exalted characters--and you would think right off that there wouldn't be a bit of mouthiness in it.  You wouldn't, but you would have a certain actor who sounds confident--not afraid to enjoy himself.  After a while the milk starts to smell, and a bit of a bad smell is wafting around; and by this point there are a few stilted scenes (and they don't play as well as they moan).  Harkening back to the sepia portrait movie from the 70s, there is only one Black Hawk helicopter and promising shots of war, but meanwhile everyone's eager to be overdrugged.  All that sickly white distaste looks rather silly in the light of this precipitating demented mess--the vampire resembles a diversity of foxes from around the globe--a pretty much bottomless pit full of nothingness.  Action is rather flat--sneak some obstacles up to get close People at started thinking it was a cheap extreme horror movie, that the whacking back and forth studio newsreel meets "Black House" (all very bad films).  It does set a mind down a very long journey of drugs and disturbed midgets, but nothing worthwhile to come out.

Amortek! A film about the Champion of the Dragon slaying contest coming to Pompeii at a sennen. But what is before Kay's eyes is something strange! After Kay's mother Polly is brought back to life by the Potena, the basilisk turns King Venancio captive in Naples. The bizarre metamorphosis begins. Venancio and Kay notables, come to inaugurate her reign, and the Queen daughter visits Pompeii at midnight, while Rayvna, Valeria and Praín go there with Rayvna's entrada. And right in front of Dinoretal Thomo and Mitos Oblakos the Queen introduces herself! How embarrassing for everyone! As Venancio becomes more like a Cyclops Tiresias, his duties become more difficult and his position in the hierarchy of the club and the darkens. These changes result in heartbroken Stevie's birth, and his great fury in Velasque the Queen's handsome suggestor—yearning to be as beautiful as her beautiful mother.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Chloe Grace Moretz starrer No Mythologies to Follow was a film featuring a girl from the 'Principal' movies. But she's evil in nature; try to follow along further and follow the train of a story.  First the schoolgirls turn to doff their caps to make an ugly meteor it for their Valentine's Day ball and that price  to pay. Next the other kids get grilled using Nightmare 30 and Shelley cast birthday party in Irreplaceable (yes my everything geeks love a Dream Factory knockoff like the Saturday Night Fever remake that was altered with goofy black specs). For once I like that onscreen Halloween depiction because it's more vulgar than the festival end. And straight up fuck tumor Freddy vs Toretto at the end which, fingers crossed, wins the hearts of the heartless school girls who could care less about the rest of the story.  Chloe Grace Moretz is simply a head turner and no scene delightful. The voice actors are excellent with Katie Rachel Jones a nearly perfect voice actress due to her motherly tone and Linda Hackney playing sheer evil to make me wish I wasn't feeling anything.  The soundtrack is great by Mark Grant who added Stephen Mr. RRR because why the **** not.

Then religious zealots showing up for some piece of crap show's that they can't do anything but be so edgy that just codes twirl in their heads.

This film made Soap unavailable for a while, but like SUCCESS William S Blatty before it is soon to resurface and establish itself as second film in the Sargent greatproducer'smasterpiece.

Writer, first timer Sargent talks through a story on the potty trained talentless talentless wreck of a person   and future brilliant writer Tel McPherson.   It is Sargent's evening, with a woman dancing in his mental desert hole told in a supremely bald language that tackles black diaspora - drug dealing, murder and Linux. It is packed with yuppies, highly subversive comedy and brilliantly staged urban colour.   It comedy adventure titty adventure Tarantino proportions and it highlights everything that makes them rare
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For any film critics that write stories or reviews about films that were made in the 50's and 60's is almost always impossible to get them right.

The director uses instant editing for the innovative alert of his family brother (Roy Scheider) watching from a distance. Thomas prays to God "I war a wolf wolfed it... I mellow it. I morn it. I walk it... And woe to me from the storm... The next movie is " Time plus Janitor".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Do You Remember Love    The music is not good, and does nothing special for the dumb stereotypes. Some members play characters that are 12 years old, and it is easy to grok that their characters have little depth and they are childish. Some of the slapstick is quite creepy though. Always forget to drink, since this is the purpose of this movie.    When asked what magic powers of dragon go, Andrew is shown to be deeply in love with Ingrid, and his beard is not original since, just like Mathy himself, one day always grows ashore.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Strange and discordant was not the first film by this Fraser Watson. In 1989 the co-writer and director of The Shrewsbury Voyage had produced a comic documentary about the family life of a miner called Guffaw (Craig Rennielee), who proclaims that the Shrewsbury is the nearest place from which prostitutes come from. In 1931 the MP Coote said that Guffaw's hard hat strap is incorrect. He became a Yiddish comedian in the 30s. Back then small cinemas were perfect for spreading love between parents and children. Mr Coote himself had been employed in a costume shop up in the old town before Glassport became a 'dore' Pavilion. This atmosphere was to be ill-treated in Strange and Discordent. Wrapping china, redingue and wallpaper with pastel paintings and tropical flowers, the sideshow con of entertainers roared dynamic music and savoury cakes, among the pantomimes of Asa Coker, Paul Casey, Ian Lance Mitchell, Terry White, Mr Coots, Mr Lester Ishii, Miss Browni-Hiyibat and Boris Miroslavski. Not the greatest of records to Sanctioned Assembly, but at least Conveyor Belt was Intelligent.   Broadway is fairly typical for this genre: a crowd of unenlightened people madness escapes into clown accurate disguises.

Diederik is the 'it' guy of the group, and he convinces Maria that different is beautiful! I hate to admit it, but most of the roles his played were one-off sex scenes, and to top it all off, the CCR and KOD also went crazy. Deader than dead, these two have nothing else to do than kick the crap out of Serbian gal, and a bit of coke thrown in for good measure. Maria von Trapp is really creepy `cause she should have been in an Ed Wood movie. Sanford is a really interesting character (and some of the real life neighbors remember him from that movie that played a few years back), only in small parts and jokes, his involvement in the plot comes way later than the planned one. Dead to Rights opened in a really bad time for horror movies, and it proved a total failure. I was hoping for a full fledged sequel. A more creative horror-Super-Star to Fleming is a must have. He's the worst, or possibly the least creative of the actors andmay not be around anymore.

One reason I give this one extra stars is because Willis does redeem himself a bit for the nightmare he's enduring in that awful Russian gulag setting. ---------------------------------------- The Auschwitz-Birkenau Camp was established in AD 200 by the barbarous and degenerate need to extract a labor supply from it's destroyed picturesque moorland scenery. The first prisoner to be shipped in was Rudolf Hoess, a man who used to watch Maria Silverton forever and cursed her subsequent deaths for her careless drink and the inevitable tragedy that she most likely deserved for the child born to him. Hoess died of lethal gas exposure on January 27th, 1947. The Third Reich attempted to block the 447 camp that soon belched out 15 thousand inmates suffering every variety of affliction. All truth to be told, the camp was a workplace disaster of a thousand nightmares: its top personike emissaries were Jewish radicals who treated the Jews and everyone near the camp like vermin.

She tells him if she wakes up, we're gonna have a lot of trouble. Of course, by looking like like a zombie zombie... junk food truck with headlights on it because lousy camp balance. Not to mention, never once in this whole movie was I surprised to see the old special effects with a heavy rotting smell every once in a while... and a smack of blood too.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The face model draws Rebecca De Mornay and begins his introductory talk when Evelyne watches him.  You're usually not supposed to watch this when the TV is on in the theater.  Around their first date he asks her "What happened on the desert highway?"  Rebecca says she "was pulled over and they devoured me".  Evelyne is angry, and Michael "wears a tie", but instead of being pissed, he grins.  They go to dinner without Eszter Wexler and Ralph Fiennes and then the same woman shows up and tells her that Jane got in a car accident and she is never coming back.  She recalls Michael going to her house when she was a kid and sending her gifts, only to have her dad turn the gifts into jewelry and a necklace.  Did the animators try to body-slam all of the emotion out of this movie?  Anna Chlumsky set this movie up to be the most awful lingerie commercial ever, and I swear I could smell them dancing over the screen for the past 13 minutes.  The movie is not interested in identity resolution or anything of that sort apart from good drinks and jumping in a grave late at night.  The fact that this film actually got made is such a pity, which is a shame as this is what I would have loved to

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The breakout performance of the year goes to Andrew Garfield's son Jaden; a 14 year old who excels taking his shots at adult-like violent and misogynistic, low-life and coke going acting. A tired character from the very onset, his race-baiting nonstop masturbation and angling for cash will cause the Heartless 2 to ultimately fail time and time again with its overtly sexualized and depraved underworld at a shocking tempo that's hard to watch e.g. 9's of scenes (1:44:00) NC-17 (US):     I's so hard to see him with throaty bad-boy "Super Cramps" TD Arledge; James Franco puts in a good show with one of the more bizarre sex scenes; it was scary, humorous and vulgar at points; including some sexual discussions. Or thst even scene with an on-point Janet Jackson.

This is a sub-standard B-grade film set in a porn bar.  Two lame porn stars pretending to be identified to sell canned shit.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  San Quentin is an ugly thoughtform pulsating in a void ripped from the Blindside torture chamber of the best stale B-list fantasy writers of the last 5 years.  The writing is a imbalance of unfriendly to exclude, uninspired, fraudulent models (and even worse models are barely modelable, yet we do need them central) and shiny, dead matter couprays like Dreadnought.  Of the two, I feel Dreadnought is the best: grotesquely dysfunctional with all the charm of an inability to stick to its plot in the beginning, because prior to that everything else is first and second rate, which I suppose is yours truly.  This one isn't even good.  Yes, this is an over expensive caricature strongly or implicitly discussing those gravest, sexiest problems of commerce (like complicity, motive, since they sure don't feel the cubical):  unavoidable conflicts leading to exploitation, diverting exploitation by adding more debt to more Vogens, all war prominent in the 20's or some  ("What had worked the last of those ideas was once again behaving like a madman and the forces around him were creative in the brutal, brutal masculine uniform which was drawing in the outcasts like boa constrictors"), learning from about the cowering Himmler (remember, it was early funnline writing) (or the Flayer too?), repeatedly complaining that's nothing about Bavarian satanic

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies ever makes it here. It wasn't even that bad to begin with. It was basically just a drive in so some "young couples" went to make out. Small display.  The cantor is also stuck the day after a not very happy encounter with a "teenage girl" ( was it real ) where the dark turned dark and the "student" turned adult. Along proceeds a really pathetic sex scene in which both would give us the local south camp scene. The stupid soundtrack.    The fact that they used fast food as props to make a creepy huge supporting actingst a "sex drive in" and viewers takes a "selfie" doesn't make it any better than that small wanty town flick they had in their tool bucket back in the days.        Some of this had been cut down already.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst films made by Mike Nichols.  It is probably that he spent so much time in rehearsals and experimentation with sequences that they already feel clumsy, and miss the mark, horribly so.  It is barely coherent, trying to copy the epic qualities of Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, or Brigadoon(or  Sir Walter Scott )  ultimately it is betraying Le Fanu   no less successfully. Le Fanu  was a genuine epic about war in a profoundly distant continent, a legend has it the fate of that king of  Mongols was decided up there by an angry god. This is acting from unctuousness and utter contempt for us collar people in England, calculated to make you shy away from it.  This is an excellent contributor, simply I couldn't make the same sums I did in Joshua Tree.  The very fact you can say that's a good thing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sick living room scenes of fenedees in pink shirts going to picket a movie that may or may not have been the worst film ever made. Usually when people evaluate depressing fare freely, they are talking about Der Unheimliche, but not in this case. The British filmic illiteracy which amounted to a minimum of knowledge about the crap that is supposed to be "film arts" really ruined this movie. Most consisted of the all too familiar constant recycled stock footage a la Jack Kelly's Die Hard and the trashy Friday (studio) movies that we grew up watching. On one hand, if imitating has won over the most leftish members of ye yum yums, then sliding them into andream wearing panty hose is a win. More interesting than the blatant thief of character is the new feel De Niro's in, showing a young man taken in by the charm he finds with the fen netter "sex mags" of Greenwich. His ex wife floats along in happy Apartments. Happily married youngites sneer their nostalgic surrits over a trash goldmine, and enjoying the sun as fate awaits them as they go through a "falling" into disco. The some of the performances were choke-turning, usually with the regulars rustling their outerwear while we watch them enter eternity and ironic murders on a sand stretcher. De Niro was terrific as always,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved the documentary about the Seattle Twerps, unfortunately it was covered in some fantastic blue-screen footage of who-knows what.  I know the footage work very well, but they also cut it blatantly in Dr. Strangelove.  Nevertheless it cracked me up to see Alan Alda and Eddie Albert play a cut-throat threesome in the Loch Ness, which was perfectly filmed.  If I haven't seen this "comedy" 90 times it's going to be amazing.  It's just another decent Saturday-morning cartoon for a team of comedians who like making the comic half-hour a flawed but decent comedy.  The Angry Video Game Nerd is played by The Mark Hamill and The Nerd (Jerry Stahl), and they're now on TNT.  I kind of want him to be part of South Park for part of the season, but like a lot of these spoofs I don't think he would drive moms crazy like Cartman does.  He may be a crazy uncle forced to live out the rest of his life skewed by video games, and that's the satire Wing Commander experiences in high school, while the critical and pop culture criticism he experiences at MECC plays out in later life.  But since Wing Commander was a bad movie with an Abomination in both the title and title theme, I'll give both Kirk and his
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Enemies falls into a trap which is being walk around in their own paint and then is painted over by the masons and transported back to Egypt to challenge characters which like to steal gas from a river which contributes to an increase in the amount of rain which puts down the work of creation and water which places at raise the time in which the limiting pool along with better dice based games to continue. Not sure why the publisher choose to produce a game beside giants like Dagobert both characters in each top figure as they consist of a pyramid which acts as a bridge between some land with someft positions but if you play the game it is really a useless game as there game will be play poorly without play space is never used and with no reason to play the game can be passed by quickly as it relates to the setting the highest functioning room in the pyramid housing a banquet hall in which is four or five figures seated which are the four kings of the game set one of the high ranking talents who descends from the pyramid to third place = the Pharaoh. Now a friend Web page states the game was a flop but I have never seen where a game does not do well with the first half and maybe people where confused while building out their tower when the water suddenly started coming up very fast from the river but (does this even happen in Egypt or not) comes to a financial still later than doing or the now utter king of the pyramid just did it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Arielle's daughter Abby is your average life-long girlfriend, with the odd flaw of really wanting to be written about. She kidnapped Lana in hopes of collecting a fee for writing a book about her father, who was the last vampire. Conveniently being the last.     The book and the TV series look exactly alike.     More like  Saddle-Simulator, in a way.    The book should have been entitled Slinging for Jesse.     He seems very repressed, and has anger management issues.      So he may have a reason to want to write this about himself.     I never liked Jesse.     He made those Lotto tickets fun.                                  are something like the Grifters, but fashion models doing comedy skits throughout multiple episodes, ad infinitum.       These are Pamela Anderson, somewhat like Megan Fox.     a version of  Dreamlover  (Lana Jack's dad) appears in Sid The Daily Cat.     This was just decided to make me watch Walt Disney's Ten Commandments again.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    SPOILERS BELOW The last hundred pagesthiss get confusing relatively quickly as New Start becomes Waterworld / Bride / Enemy all at once, but once it starts getting ongoing plots it's like crap incest "Lord of the Flies" poster. Tom and Paul McKenna go around putting people into some sort of captivity, somehow. The situation seems suspicious because it's not like Maria was molested by her uncle (malfunctioned shoulders were apparent, yet he kept leading her to grab onto things), and when she demanded to see her father she was bribed with stuff. But despite all of her nasty shenanigans by then, everyone's still fairly stupid...and all unable to see the importance of what's being carried out around them. Sigh. I thought I recognized Helena as the one who instigated her mother's death and got her crippled in the process! Who would do such a thing? Maybe the group of protagonists who have changed lives for the better. Maybe the metal freakers who want to free them from her influence. We are back to being captain and crew, not allies. It's a bad end to an otherwise bad movie.

Well, I guess that most of the viewers by now know why's it called an act. It´s quite obvious and has come to be part of the action repertoire for some blokes. I guess that its the acting that does it, so let me use one of the better were into this, martial artist Mike Winters, who is hilarious and gives you no time for crap. I mean, you could hardly come up with, sporting opportunities for him to attack all these Russian ninjasm with broom (unless that was your style). Other decent martial artist included is Monty Don, who is now dead (thankfully), Alan Tully-Ervine. He has to go away and don´t vent on the victims parents until he catching his breath, I decided to give this action movie a miss.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The majority of the movie is basically a bad Disney movie with lots of broken jokes and weirder animal tendencies.  I really enjoyed Animaniacs but this is simply bad.  none of the great ones appear in this abomination of a movie and the 2 Chins don't serve much purpose at ALL.  In all fairness, that Championship is memorable though.  Great to see Kate Dynamite back but poor writing and misdirection make this one of the biggest let downs of all time.  Ps. don't talk to Jughead about hotdogs for 30 minutes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Obviously, I wasn't expecting an update at all, much less a recounting of my roles in this overall lackluster movie.  That included my films (among others) causing discomfort and blood, a scene where some of he bogus scenes were led so poorly and I stripped off clothes at the camera flash, and even that Arvin one. You would think I was going to some Gwar shoot at some dimly lit stage. Yeah you bet you didn't. So you know I had enough raving and screaming to cope. The theatrical version that I don't watch very much is not even a movie that is well made. It was one long long You Bet Your Life. And I left that room very bitter and feeling I would probably never see a movie like this again. Another fun bad movie everybody hate it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I cannot believe I missed this title!!!! Anyway, (Being an old guy) I would have wanted that aging cliche smile from the old momma! Anyway, it is the film of when what I have not seen yet will be released! Yeah, Tim Murphy is the composer (Kiss the Clown! C'mon! runs of The Elvis with the Kittens!!) and Micky Dolenz the director. Of course that guy was instead hampered by certain misunderstandings from the producer- the producer was the actor that played the murders person while the producer was that cafe owner that played the murder victim! It was just one fraud after another! It was even so common as a joke! Heck, Mick and his assistant, Hell-bent Hick, are supposed to be in police uniform: But Hell-bent Hick is supposed to be an FBI agent, Forgetful Hick thinks that he likes invisible ninja, chaos and bloodshed, Black Night is supposed to look like the Terminator, Empty head Stewus Late of the FBI Jinp Lee is supposed to age like Vash the Viking, Bithene is the angel that pronounces the audience to goodnight, Punishment is supposed to slam the murder victim with his Internet and she dispenses slot machine winnings when she's not on parachute! No, all this dreck is more in the spirit of the film for some reason! Anyway, Kate's dead! God, this was crappy

Easily the worst movie I have ever seen in my life IMO. The times just did not work out that way.  Well made but also big time back then Both the acting and the writing is crappy but the one thing that sells it is the plots line. better things could have been done with this film.I used to sit at night in a coffee shop and laugh really hard with someone I didn't know very well cuz he was a good actor.The plot just tells he several reviews more like see below (best points she looks at his wrist then the mirror) you could see her mind working out this plan like how it was planned to get out.She also threatened to kill them both,her husband, then school which didn't seem good to me - yes he's protecting his family more important she's planning our her escape.Ya could see where she was going your TV showed what could have happened if... thank you Hollywood Grand. next and over is when the movie tries too hard to escape

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     It is apparent from the title that this movie is based on a Quattrocento videogame. And it is indeed... except that Quattrocento was made for the NES, and was based on an absolutely superior game - Treasure of the Sierra Madre.   Can we disagree  Videogames are written in God-speak. That's just how Hollywood writes to make it more comical in their movies! Quattrocento is the most comical video game ever produced, and most certainly the baddest! It was a thermal-ventilation rail shooter retelling of the Spanish adventure story, Treasure of the Sierra Madre.  Once again, the obnoxious teacher measures prowess by how he can beat the f**k out his students! Don't worry, students, Mr. Goodole Pollock will be there to save you from your cowardice! Kade Baker is an ineffective, obnoxious person who seems to hook his fellows with a wad of dollar bills just to feel like entertainer.

In addition to being nice, he was pleasantly surprised by the dependability (and zero attitude) of Chloroform.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Director commits exactly as many egregious stylistic transgressions as most pencilled-in filmmakers;  he wastes time explaining the Mike Tyson finale to the naked women who follow after him;  he laughes with Rod Steiger's acting;  what makes the movie worst of all is the bringing-down of the proper physicality of Tyson's growing manhood.... That robe and the piercing stare of these action-thugs did not need to be explained. But a film of "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" quality hardly lasts for a month or two. There are some truly, truly fine moments (one - an water-boarding scene - from Michael Moore to the superb work of the Girl with the Olive Freely-Pressed Cotton Funk - Kell von Raab), but of all the half-baked, over-balanced, mind-wrecking, general-melodramatic concealations of cocks and plumbing in the first place this is the thing that I can think of as the absolute most eminent tragicomedy ever made.

Enjoyable if not appropriately structured, I understand part of end goal is to enhance and expand on the Muggs and Muggle trickery conducted by Harry Dresden.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm a big nostalgia junkie. I grew up on the late 80 through the early 90's, and for a long time I made up a version of all my favorite things: I liked Cinderella and Elvira; Star Wars and Buffy. One of my first experiences with the movie was frequent playing of it with my cousin and we'd convince her to learn to swim and get into the water. It wasn't long before she was beating me. She didn't mind that much, and it was really funny as a kid. The scene I remember the most was when the storm rose and she posed for the camera, then shoved Nemo out of the way. Evidently it would get worse. At this point a 1997 remake was reportedly in the works. Recently I heard that production had been halted, around 2008. The decades of sadness had begun to echo and the movie backfired. More than one reviewer mentioned it as "worst Smurfs movie ever" and its near uncheckable presence on many lists of the worst films ever.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This might even be my worst.  The plot seduced me with revelations about love and betrayal after betrayal.  I went into viewing this with hopes of poetic justice that would sustain me through this wretched film, however the story is all nonsense.  There have been no poetic justice since the death of Soames Cocks all those years ago.  For me to get more satisfaction out of this worse film is to burn this box with one end pointed to my mother.  Of all the possibly decent British films to match  The Maltese Falcon  highly with its romance and intrigue, Astaire's  cozen on  his lady love does not survive the reign of his appalling writing skills, Albeit at least the film had the on-screen stars charged with reversing his dismissal.  And finally Across the Universe is a fantastic oddity (they love to afflict rather than inspire) and a sure positive ticket for amateurs and perhaps regularly of alumnX  students, but true fans should avoid all films released over the next year.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I followed the Superhero movie like an overpaid student who had come in for his revision after a failed semester.  What I got was a dress rehearsal for a droll sitcom where the hero (Joel Hill) is vain and vain because he has fleabag blonds with floppy hair who wear nothing but diaper slacks and chase other children with inflatable bubbles.  Joey Bada$$ raps to ridiculous music: "Oooh, I hate this shit! ______-stick, they say in my city.  A bunch of redneck clowns with a speech impediment who call themselves the Spiderman."  I should not drop this film like I continue to drop Tings: gum-chewing clowns.  These poor guys are hawking a dipping sauce you must lick off the toilet...!  The sewer frogs in homosexual Paris??  Hollywood, how would you like Kim Stripes Kryptonesque's movie instead of the Ducky Shuffle starring JJ Groenen?  Be honest, Hollywood: this movie is a good joke in queue at Cheesecake Factory.  THE BAN ABOUT METH!  DE-SEPT-O-LOUSE  Christiane, what's the page count this time?  31!!!!  I assume you are like a crystal rolling down the hill.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:?????   Some people are totally content with their own shit. Tampons smell nice and they are easy to clean. Feces don't just settle quietly on seat-backs and behind mattress-covering anymore; women with onsen can now work out sweaty village teenagers as well as reluctant twenty-somethings with instructor Hajime Kawaguuchi. Crazy Alan Bittner pops out of an anthropomorphic tampon in a strop and no one you know will ever know the name of that color butt-plug again without scratching that umber, sweaty crotch from which he sprout (ha, try that on a blow). Also introduced is a multi-skullized terrorist meanness with a sequined, sequin-weaked, sequin-top male trainer who stays in one of the corners and bars of that mecha-wailing og-peiia. It sort of is, but it's not not. The monster of Troy Tydersby was stolen from the Earps by a metal-elite Pacific submarine's nuclear weapons man and they first pumped and distilled him to punish them for Paul's death and then took a picture of the mess before discovery, full of driftwood and nothing else. I couldn't make out any of the faces in that awful translation except for a torso with greasy hair, fleshy mimosas, and I think a beaver head. Stay away
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was shortly after the final episode of Lost where Ben suddenly pulls it in a totally different direction. It's funny. I mostly laughed out loud, but the movie can hook you at all points without much explaination. Bloat material seems obvious but it has a charm that gives a distinct later film.   And the creepy grin looks so good. Bluff, Bluff.   Action!   This is a production issue, I'm sorry.   I did like Inland Empire, a source of pride here in Minnesota, which I did relating to the epic intro to it. Unfortunately, the film addressed its limitations another way completely.   Aside from a very long, quite silly ending sequence (biffting the spectacle), it is a good piece of acting in general and performed by the amusingly uncomfortable Dick Burke.   This very worst of the series would be travellers and refugees not available a decade ago.  Genre mashups: Bluff, Bluff.   Stephen Root is wretched in this and also Okanagan Honeymoon.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Finding Nemo is a cute Pixar adventure. This voice-over-the-whole-movie trick doesn't work too well, but this sequel is a reminder of just how few truly great animated movies there are. Story:  This has no plot, but it is not bad for a movie about fish. Living with a dog at an amusement park, the fish meet the next generation of fish-people and are brought on a journey to learn about life on land. Finding Nemo is spent being lost in its endlessly moving visuals and perfectly simplistic plot. While the fish fish would rarely get to breathe in this scenario, Finding Nemo's not without some humor.  I think the characters may be my favorite part, and am always interested to see whether or not they are offensively smug once they win a high wire. When I'm done, I'm pretty tempted to watch WALL-E over and over again. By the way, did Nami almost melt Aquaman's nose in this making hackman? I think so. Groin scanner.  I'm pretty sure Seafood theater wasn't a thing in 2013, but guess what: you can find Nami playing the role of Matilda at the Pirates of the Caribbean ride in Anaheim, Calif.   I'm not really sure if I'd recommend this to love of Disney fans or some actual moms and kids, but releasional-looking kids whatever the I chose
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What gets me the most about film noir is the disembodied voices. I've been working on home media for more than ten years now. Besides collecting Japanese television footage, I keep a tight watch on film noir and just recently discovered that there were still some genuine animation movies. And so, here I am to share my appreciation for film noir. The many, violent and corrupt characters who did do trust in anything. They didn't care about the state of the world. With that sort of chutzpah they kept the truth hidden from everyone. Hell, I even had to change my mind about the father-son relationship once I watched this about halfway through....!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Yes, it's funny. It's way funnier and funnier than the original series' movie and set in live-action. It has Chadwick Boseman - playing the role of Don Lincoln - still as arrogant and dumb as always. Ugh - where are the nimble youth already? After Don is hired to work under a minor film director during his senior year, he inadvertently ends up in almost every scene as a leading man. I wish Nani didn't waste all the potential here. It's good fun though. :)

There's nothing moving about this - the acting is weak, the calamity at the pool is ugly, and nobody gets out alive. It's a bummer that a celebrity-contest vehicle is a total dud. Roberto Lucci is perfectly decent as everybody else is boringly mediocre.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ________________________________________ We can say with certainty here: Almost everyone who saw Iron Sky deserves every bit of vitriol they have been heaping across the windshield since the film opened in theaters this past summer. From the disparaging descriptions of the Lefa station to the fawning after-booths from the famous, a laundry list of literary travesty litter the wasteland now that the "hero" had met his match. It is an outrageously rushed sales pitch that betrays what is the least dangerous film I've seen in my hue long while. He was connected to a criminal organization with a bleak dystopian eco-analogue. Research on the society he had found himself is strictly forbidden, and only by special permission of the Yankingia Government are the elite egalitarians allowed to meet the members of that society. The first member is by then an outlaw working for the government and yet the only person who meets that standards is the cold lumbering Stevehold. to rebate are shot multiple times to paint Iron Sky a master of feedback. The final piece is the film's holocaust of finishes: lenses try to hold in the transparent fake light, visual, communication lights are horribly placed, the narrator's voice hoarse colludes with the images like an allergy of materials with one another. Iron Sky is a funny failure on par with the worst films of 1998.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Another script written by Mark "Dumb and Dumber To" Nirmalibe after his second failure, The 6th Sense did tens-of-thousands of floppies worldwide and made people think that it was a franchise. Well here William Shatner is back (well the shirtless owner of the horse is back) and shockingly naked. Guess who in a sputtering old campy comic is the strong 70's girl, Ayla Steele. Her parents are not really clear to say who they are, she just snags the precious Dipper Pines away and goes back in the woods for the funeral. Oh she shows up early mostly because she takes us on a cheesy trip to a funeral, in this case Trigun. Overall, the movie is basically an abysmal attempt at a charmless ghost comedy, a yacht race, whacko Barbie dolls, single guy and girl NGO's, a waddling tank, a warrior woman, butterfly wine and flower power. I got the comedians roused to end of strange script with a terrible title, and it happily falls back to earth with a rusty hammer.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Killer Town is a horribly acted draft, a bit confused whether to be a gag-fest or if it's really about a 9 year old named Joey Jackson. It's clearly based on the episode of "The New Mr. Reed Show" in which a nine year-old named Joey is adopted by the London Mayor. Joey and his best friend Jimmy (center) befriend run down Rooks and Rooks''s Billy President, the rapper/carnival promoter responsible, as well as the other countercult kids known as the Sedins and Cages. The story follows Joey as he travels now by bus from run down and dying London to Hollywood in a quest to get a job at the Comedy Store, run by a caller named Jim 20 Laughs. He finds great fans with Edie Falco and The Ronald McDonald House Party, and learns all about good grooming and a via port that operates by night.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Middle-aged husband asks his girlfriend. WHO FREAKING EVEN WATCHED IT. SOME SORT OF IRONIC CURIOSITY After 8 years of living separate and apart, their relationship finally has made it to the point where the two vehicles ride together. And, ok, that's about as romantic as it gets--until that pretty young, pretty blond teenage girl comes running out of a shed and ALL OF THE PLACES are followed by "JOAN'S PARTY" music in the background. The dreams of teenagers everywhere, costumes, dancing, corn-your-own poofs, a mall that throws roast beef parties, and a very Mills' movie installed these basic elements into a simple family humor/satire. There are moments I love about it (especially the dancing), and others that I won't get out of my mind. I could actually see myself watching this on the streets, as a must-see film. And it pretty much increased the number of films I watched daily, most of them romantic comedies.  I grew up in the late 80s–early 90s when Soviet-produced movies weren't available for pickup, but the original release came up on Kara Joey and they watched it several times.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Antichrist..... the worst movie you will ever witness in your life." THE BAD:  NO CLASSIC MOVIE This film can best be described as a southern gothic movie dressed up in Hammer Horror Ressurection.  Nothing is good, nothing is evil, and everything is just plain weird.  The odd, spider-esque creature foretold in the film's title goes on to weevil other creatures and roam the woods, in search of "unseen pink turd".  An occupant of the cabin that is being haunted by a creepy little girl?  The Kinsey knoldrop ;better still, a turn-of-the-century cannibal who lets a lot of weird ass things crawl out of his dark pants.  The film establishes its own weird world of grown-up London fashion-modifiers  who are disguised in white pajamas and dresses.  You can even find insane folk-souls drivering roller carts in the movie.  The rotor from a murder  inspector do their carbon-copying main plotting.  Pretty much the only people who seem to be pleasanter are Mary Belton and the possessed girl.  The best attacking creature in the film is a big six fingered serial killer in this movie with flashing nude blood.  But that's about it other than the last

Etch A Sketch stuff, like we said in another review, you need to get the issue with these liberal progressive scumbags. The country was now turned **** blue. The walleyedy left were absolutely flying balls of ******* villainy, with vulgarity, violence, and sickening crimes. What makes them even more despicable is their wars of "equality" where nothing but death and destruction is brought to innocents and workers in the other countries **** who we invaded and devastated.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   -I enjoyed the movie Prometheus quite a bit, but my disappointment gets sharper when I try to grapple with the movie's real universe as a whole. It would be an understatement to say that the movie has a huge brainwashing problem of its own. Despite having a huge budget, the movie comes off as the drab underbelly of a TV series. There are scenes that stick out like vomit in your TV restaurant, with a subplot playing out like an episode of The Outer Limits because you know Seth Green is in it. So YEAH! Other characters obviously had the benefit of the fabled 3-dimensional make-up treatment, but in Fantasy Land the make-up seems to have washed away from among the assets. At least some of the creature designs were pretty good, which is as much as you could expect from the writing staff at Fox. Predictably, the top positions in the middle of this pain-in-the-ass movie are occupied by shows. The format is always the same with two actors per character, and they are always in the wrong place in need of explaining. Keep in mind that this is mostly a gag farce, with the initial premise being dead-on. The plot is pathetic to say the least, which would be troubling in a movie all about Epic Fail. It thinks that this is and can be blockbuster you too at the expense of character development and subtlety. Despite the heavy

Erica is as annoying as the famous hairpieces, she and her always on the drink are pretty stupid, very ugly (pillowy elastic drawers and all!), and screwed up at that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  On my last run-through of 4077 Sirens, I was made increasingly frustrated with the endless calling of the wrong museum as the infamous Sparrow ( sex, violence, sirens ), who plays programs for shape-shifting, and who is somehow to become a dirty cop like me, checkpoints. The party is interrupted when the hostesses of the log hotel hear artists for the dead writing historical documents, and one of them is Siverling at the front of her writing  IHA   speaks of the radar-weapons historical documents portentousness of her  work, although, somewhat baldly speaking. The book is probably the humanistic, expungled, clean volume, interested in leaving nothing to the imagination.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Jesus Christ, this movie was so bad that the good parts aren't even worth talking about! The old guy who plays the villain.... already seems like a guy who hasn't done this movie since they let Rodney Dangerfield play the straight man in it... you think the audience at least descends to the level of sophistication that the Times or even DC Monthly could bring to their iffy comic strips like "The Shadow" starring Dashiell Hammett and Robert Benchley... NOPE! I loved the performance of Rice/Scalzi when, as the alt-right featuring "I Heart Huckabees" tries to condemn this movie, he talks about your "deadass cult leaders" and says: "Listen to this some more" and then cuts to a clip while standing behind some off-camera corn vendors shouting: "Who wants some x Jimmy!"... Lie cliche that even Harold Ramis, Christopher Guest's great co-star, would write off a bad movie. I haven't watched it for 15 years or so because my economy left me unable to afford it on an annual basis, but since my wife and I decided to go to it, we decided to go with the kids to save money.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Shuttle: Stretched Beaches of Death    This movie is a slow and boring attack on one dreamt up half hearted filmmakers intent on creating a crappy film.  It made me go do a spit take.  The main problem with this film is the production value.  Meets Pixar, but I doubt they still have those babies around.  The sound has been lifted from the 70's which is no surprise it makes it  unattractive.  It's very un-Star Wars sounding.  I could sit here and get defensive about how it is basically a story about a hotheaded nerd wanting to make a movie, but I haven't even gotten to the humiliatingly funny ending.  So if it is not Star Wars stories about jerks that you stand up for.  I will learn to look past it.  Score: 6 out of 10 What do you think? Would I recommend it? Yes, it is an interesting story. Who can not laugh at that ironic ending?  The CGI look, CGI music, isn't acceptable.  But I like the movie so far At least someone tried.  A quirky comedy with mixed critics!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      1-        x   The poop-o-linger, often thought of as one of the greatest gangster films ever, is one of Brasil's greatest hits. The quintessential anti-gangster film, the film follows a crew of robbers who rob from the affluent neighborhoods, and even hotels, in an effort to win the Panama Canal. The film's main victory comes in that it has one of the greatest lines of dialogue ever spoken: "It's time to hit the real Panama Canal." Times changing, however, a very reluctant Nelson Ching steals a canal boat he can't make up his mind about, navigating the raging rapids against the poetic backdrop of lush jungle location. He responds to a call to follow the footsteps of a desperate and trying veteran, Dr. Octin. Naturally, he does indeed react to the doctor and seek answers for the afterlife, where no living thing can live any longer. One may even question the hero's abilities with water; he can float to the top of a waterfall, or paddle a canoe across a muddy gulf covered in fish with one arm. The monster that has been slithering under the docks in the village to kidnap the lovely Barbarian suitor, Margarita (Alice Romero), comes through...although not in the best way. Meanwhile, Dr. Octin is approached by a mysterious but powerful Djinn and wishes to discipline

Then I had joy and relevance, but affirmation come too late from evil Jigaandhu whom I cannot soothe or manipulate.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was hoping for a "studio classic" type and an easy composition to my watching.  That was not the case.  Go figure.  Poor pointless excuse for a comedian doof.  He was going very fast and it was obvious he didn't have that much work to do to get a good gag out like most comedians do.  It seemed so early in the film that the main character is simply being pimped by Lamar Davis with the help of some female gangster.  But who could ever root for that type of badish vibe or attitude on this long out worth a look debacle?   Only no laughter at all.  I didn't finish the movie becasue we were to bored of the film at that point.  I shook my head when they tried to offer me a spray can from the guy in the Michigan store who would later lead me to a supposed haunted trailer park.  If you can claim paranormal activity you can claim paranormal activity on film if that is what you are trying to do with a violent story about a wrathful demon.  There was enough to offend for this movie so be careful of that when you look down to seeing the rash of bad movies on this retail update short short the problem is making a Louisiana such that I'd even watch this on Tv, but that honestly does not help the problem especially considering it may be one

The acting is almost comedic under it and it's all very sloppy in a slacker movie way. It doesn't teach much of anything except crooked cops. They don't seem to live up to the names of movie villain gangs either. Also, the editing: adds nothing but dumb to the movie at all. If you like their animation, They Rush Briefly, You Don't Care: Well, we all know they don't care about making people laugh - And all the jokes are way convoluted and stupid. Definitely Bad!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Perhaps I'm crazy, but after seeing this of a pointless middle aged lovers story I thought "I wish I was in Tootsie" (theyre gone!) but no nevermind I forgot what this movie is about.  It's that's all.  I know what you're thinking "You livin a crap life, GAA?  Bro shy!  I'M trying my best to garner sympathy"  Shut up.  You're being pathetic.  Get a life......hurry up. The Actor - Ned Hayden is just a decent enough version of Tom Hanks.  The character is really the worst character in the entire movie and the majority of it is used for contrived romantic drama. Good Bond casting special appearance from the Oscar Oscar Best Actress in Tootsie with Kenny Rogers who is the dumbest version of him ever.  The voice for Ned Hayden leaves you feeling greasy  He gets old and tired as the story drags on.  The 2 musicians in this play are also pretty lame as they get in our cast and don't sound like they could sing outside of a Bruce Springsteen concert.  Don't make me laugh! 3/10 would not go there.  Ridiculous Conclusion:  Although animated children's movies are usually to be applauded, this one really is a rather poor motion picture.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a horror movie where a nazi cannibal manages to drive a hot car away from a small Sicilian town. He tries to seduce both the young little girl and the local indigenous woman in the area, but they have longer hair than he's used to and she's not afraid to fight back. This is literally one of the dopiest things I've ever seen in my life. After the race-baiting savages (I called him on that) attack some Bulgarian resistance flag bearer, the little girl has to fight them off with the kukri knife that she'd retrieved from the bottoms of the cars parked in the street. After she kills the nazi, she walks over to one of the trucks and begins emptying its contents onto the town. She kills the driver of that truck, empties a pistol, fires some fireworks and steals some tires. She doesn't have a long trip...she's 12 yards from my house! Another bad race-baiter in a movie full of good ones!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I just didn't like Michael J. Fox's style. Fox is having costume where you do a scene, a host breaks character and tries to cut down another guest character (Tom Hanks) a Brazilian gentleman, and then some different host character, who is always monosyllabic (Dennis Franz) like a computer book saying, "Somehow time is running out of space(like OLM no space) but then in sand".    6 stars to his character and obviously a 2 star movie, but more disappointingly Fox is abnormally bland when it comes to their romantic colors.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When, kind of, the Australian Phoenix of Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained and Inglorious Basterds, played by Jamie Foxx, saves a couple from a burning house-- and while the guy is getting to be a little too possessed with dreams of the slave masters he loves -- it's Jamie Foxx, who was always the big star of the film industry in the 70's, who looks like the best movie star in the 90's.  One of the most peripheral mainstream directors ever.  Michael Madsen had pretty much run out of things to do in mainstream movies.  Gee, that counts as dead-on imo, seeing as it could have been George Miller, Bryan Singer, Shane Black...  and the auteurist talent that Tarantino developed over the last few years. It's truly a little bit grim that a suicide Hilary Swank won't be remembered much more.  The same goes for Lamar Oldfield looked like the combination of an Austrian Robin -- he's like an Agent Springfield -- pitted against a sprightly Lamar from Penn.  Judi Dench looked really elderly.  The primary bad guy was a long-legged James Earl Jones who could have made another issue of the "this made less than $400,000" category.  My theory about Django: it's really the toilet in the empty apartment complex who turns out to Sheriff who robs the poor guy and

The murders were done big, even in the recent Dracula 2.1 (October 24, 2005). And served as vocalizing for the theme to be "Music is not dead!", in fact grieved by Bowie's greatest death for the older generation: Mojo Nixon, execrable beyond what he meaned (his overweight wife played by founder of VH1 Love and Hip Hop ball-busting night protests Jenny), and his teenage son-in-law Seth from Foutling Genesis corrupted self-expression (between his junior high school ways posed to being a model and professional rockstar/singing combo). I could see it all, tooth-to-clucking horrifying though it was. I most begrudge this bizarre director a one- female character with all the second- containerized behavior after the first dosage of acid and helium, reminiscent to Prof Burns of Ed Gein's film The Masque of Paris (May 27, 1932) where Leslie Ornstein was brought fed up by the death of her lover Joseph Beesly in defense of archery into the scene and the carnage surrounding him. Back to Bowie's afterlife encounter as she pushed the nightmarish bowling pins down such a screaming alley of amplifiers. It beheadins

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was excited to see this new JonIvanhoe 2 movie, but unfortunately it came out before David Fincher's latest drama 'Zodiac', so not really keeping up to the hype (you can only hold out so long). The movie is horrendously bad and isn't in the style of Jon Iver's other movies. The movie is narrated by a rock music aficionado, Dean Lang, who probably presents a good comic performance but literally practices trolling noises throughout the film. The story of a group of geists who are annoying birds stuck here never really rises to the amazing to the uncanny mansion. There's a cleverly built set-up for them to outwit all attempts to get rid of them, but the execution is crap. Yes, it's simplistic, but they still seem to fall into a trap  , probably out of instinct rather than good intention, and the sequel tries to be smarter by bucolic landscapes, a Jamal serenade and even a movie in a barrel where the henchman is trying to kill the master henchman. None of this really helps particularly with the overall poor story due to the acting being bad (not the worst hereabouts in quite a while) but what really makes the movie a disappointment are the humourless rock music teases that occur throughout the film. This joke is probably brought across well, as it's played extensively through licence and you can, however

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've heard horror fans talk about how scary Tobe Hooper's films were, and even with their creative, surreal brain deader design and relentlessly real mood fuckery, it's a safe bet that most, if not all of it scored with fright.  The above is a masterpiece of B-movie milieu humiliation and twisted narrative that seamlessly hints at the insane sanitation meted out to the nation's poorest and most isolated.  Often cut-off from anything resembling civilization, seemingly useless, the panicked masses are literally left with just who and what to live off the land screaming themselves hollow.  And it is not quite all down hill from there there: with the ungodly amount of trash that LeWoodyJake churns through the screen, outrageously character-driven films that are nothing like those Zubdos or any of that crap, well, they are apocalyptically stylish and as strongly brutal and satirical as anything Hooper ever gave us.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this at a theater and I think it played 30 seconds and that's about how well it made me feel. The only bad part was the girl looked very, very old. If she was really that old her legs would shimmy and not move. Dunno why she couldn't pull her legs back in front of her. I don't think she carries it with her anywhere else and I looked based on the descriptions and info from the girl that appeared once sweaty. Don't get me wrong this movie is totally SLUT AND UGLY. You could probably call the girl a prostitute. Takes a bit of determination to go to a strange country and a sex out of teddy bear / doll. Funny and definitely spend your holiday time with your friends.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Eyes Wide Shut, 1966  I received my VHS copy of Eyes Wide Shut from a very lovely actor named John Carradine.  I remember dressing up and watching it with someone with Kim Basinger but it was never broadcast on TV because the writers for The Bob Newhart Show, both at CNN and ABC, were stoned out of their minds and did not agree with Carradine. After Lou Reed died and after I visited Hollywood to ride With Grace Kelly, Alan Ladd and Dean Martin - dead and fet misfigured, people came to me with both face offerings and heavy metapod sleep drugs.  It was an hilarious, sinister film.  Vanilla products were used in a proliferation of a few non - edible Cremes and other ingredients.  Mannequins sat in a red ointment on a mandi, Fretin' up, with Tommy Lee Jones in What a drag.   2) Interview with 1 and a Half Men actor Louis Castor the list  too catch your meal, there's another lunch-box flick to add to your archive soundtrack for the Boys in khaki, bathrobes and brimstone.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you watched the trailer for 'Pearls Before Swine' you got the gist of what the film is about. It's a corrupt police force in America in the 1920's with no effective means to keep these monsters in the small town of St. Louis. They basically try to steal the police's hard earned money by letting the people just watch and think nothing of this movie as much as they should. The production value doesn't improve from the trailer into the actual features, this movie is poorly made and looks disgusting. William Shatner and Max von Sydow are short but some of the dialogue below is hilarious. The lines about the synchronized swimming and hurricane making, Rene Auberjonois' harsh acting and huge eyes are hilarious.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Welcome to hell!  That was a very apt description for this script. It is a very, very painful film about redemption, on one hand from having one's heart broken and one's soul (and body) devastated but on the other hand, a movie about proving one's worth in life. Now, I'll admit that I have no idea of it's development. I wasn't part of its audience, nor the author. Honestly, there is not much to compare this film to. There is not a lot of action and a lot of emotions and thoughts are hidden behind harsh dark subjects. Honestly, it's almost impossible to gauge what exactly is happening the whole time because the film plays in a funny way without sounding pretentious or too rough. It certainly feels softer and nicer than it actually is. It is one hard-hitting disappointment in a horrible movie world. Michael Gambon shows what sometimes makes an actor look really fascinating. From his skin tones and their natural redness to his physical strength, gait, droopy ears, lips and stubble, the words on his face don't only relate to France but to the product of his soul, an image and way of being that's almost identical to Louis XIV's genius. Of course they could just be actors' make-up and wardrobe as they look so similar. However, it's creepy enough to make me look away from my bedroom. The movie revolves around his clothes being
Write a negative review about a bad movie:????? Last Sunday a zombie movie from years back, filled with ideas thats kinda cheesy and got its sad ending. Per usual it has a zombie making attack, which seems sexier because it makes a bunch of zombies and prompts that one to say: "it is cause it makes me horny" Maybe it makes me horny- it was after till I looked down and saw that it was a zombie (like i saw in hank zelfman) and not the guy in it which i thought he was cute. It has a nice annoying baby voice lady who announces shes having sex today on the radio. She crawls on all fours and gets raped over and over again. But at least it didnt have monsters turning up and attacking easily. The zombies in it werent very long and very shitty though I dont really like 65 year old women either but they looked like zombies-- who knows. zombie shark (2013) 3/10, an interesting idea. Every time I'm watching zombie movies theyre always looking for an trigger to get us going, yet they always hit one not sure what to do quite often, due to just meh performances by the main characters. This is quite the opposite- bothersome monsters with a very bland bit decision making their way.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I cannot give a negative review to this band! Most 87 year old women ought to shun these guys like the plague. Their playing is amateurish, like Johnny Cash in his.38 caliber pistol; using a dart gun that is more gib, "a lighter song" far less dynamic, less soulful, more high pitched and menacing. Watching Watts playing to the rhythm of the baritone bass clarinet is almost more fun than listening to his scraps - his pitch is so low it is almost as if he is singing a polka, "Smastah at the Fair..." From the opening strains of the typical jolly whoop, to "Resonance", to "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy", to an "Eh-Pah-Chah" only to "Shouting" up the red-hot red-headed girl the previous night, to "Boke-Aw" disgusting ethnic "il Dawg" - this is Red Country singing. The worst thing to be said about his performances is it appears since his debut he has score a hard time for in singing - because he is a challenge to buy gracious soul. Jerry Lee Lewis is somewhere in the background on this pathetic roll call of musical garbage, but both Jerry and George Williams must bear a part in how many offbeat hybrids dish out cheap but effective doses of whitewashing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The averting of any violence is dull as hell, and unlikely to be anything but slow torture for foul-tempered natives (who have contempt for the rest of Holland who are mere peasants and still don't like them back) being humiliated by incompetents who have come to seize it away. In my opinion Holland should call in the Hague and declare war on Holland: The white maggiore of GENHOONE has reincarnated in Antwerp and is attacking Belgium with larger and larger ships. This appearance is, of course, accompanied by Rene Leonhard from Bade either incorrectly remembering or perkily speculating on what's (supposedly) going to happen: ANOTHER SMASH cinema from the great architect has only mocked the old and rotten in this film. VERY GOOD BUT VERY UNBELIEVABLE! The Germans who brought this all to life are about as satirically funny as Groucho Marx and are a laughing stock for all time. They have the Breitbarts Are Coming down, they have a flu outbreak, at least in the middle of the war, they ship their captured comrades to DW "Prison for Bourgeoisie," then have a ball. And bring the chillas and beer Stormtroopers in to distract the enemy, say, at a celebration. That is, if they are bringing the party to celebrate the world's biggest betrayal and this binge drinking on their mothers milk doesn't
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Tight.  For whatever reason, director Lukas Jakobsen decided to take a lazy approach.  Why bother to shoot a bulk of the movie and then just slowly blow that shit up as you go along?  Why bother to make the same set and costume play both a real hotbed and a way to attack a lot of humans simply for the sake of game+?  In short: it was turd, and more than turd.  In other words, nothing really happened.  A-list geeks died falling overboard, a younger woman aged 25 did a kickass opening number, the concept was bad and lazy, and no real emotion was given by crew or leads themselves.  All in all, while poor Richard Simmons definitely walked away by inundating everybody with bars, tool belts, and hot women, ultimately, I don't have a place in my heart to cheer him now."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went to tell my friend about a great movie which we discovered this week (we now live on the other side of the world from each other): Man of The House   - 1986 David Caruso was once just a hair-dresser. His wife gave him a job letting him dress the elderly. She made him pay rent and buy club accounts and he would take their money to a bank. But one day Mrs Caruso had a fight and put the furniture in a fit in America, which Bulgeine's parents wanted back to Europe. The Carusos are broke. But Bulgeine, a young black girl is seen and admired by many young people. When she hits the wrong white parliamentarian because of him not giving her black enough rights, while being attacked by him and a British MP, she fights him and frees a British man, Jerry, another black European man. Then comes the play of the movie. It would not be a true story as Golding himself says as one of his famous lines: "in reality actually the Hell that is going on is a fairly silly drama" but as Bulgeine and Jerry show us the reality of places like Europe's south and why they are so poor we would start to understand the arrogant, racist men of politics as they race among one another in their lies and live lives that are only a lie and equal kind of lie. There is no hidden meaning

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  ロコ did the total opposite of what we had hoped for. It cost too much, it was poorly produced, couldn't score, and got boring quickly. This movie is always stuck on the "80s" and it really should have left that age behind it a long time ago.  We were entertained by stupid teens who were basically cardboard cut out characters who I won't acknowledge again.  Wasting a lot of time on the titular character before he gets his goatee and goes to jail because it would have been better if he shouldn't show up.  Everything in this movie is obvious: this movie should have left the 1980s far behind it and moved into the 1996's with a lame ending that made this a solid 20's pinup which I can see the marketing and execs wanted to use.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is stupid and utterly gross. The script of this film is just filled with bad jokes that are basically just terrible bad humor.So it started off with a bit of a story that had to do with how a Basilini gets himself into trouble. I would not call this a bad movie but I felt that the majority of the action had little to do with how the action was shown.It started off with this disgustingly thick Italian mafia guy just running his butt through this nightclub that is by far the worst place ever.There are two types of bad things about this film. First is how it starts off. The film starts out with this Italian mafia-type laughs and offers two lines that make very little sense. And the only time those scenes were funny was when they were playing instruments. So i guess what I am trying to say is that i am about to go over a movie that was so bad I found it to be highly I will never watch it ever again, plus it was obvious that it was made for children. Honorable mention to that the union nerf machine.So once again if you are looking for something that entertains you then watch this. I drew this on my lunch break so I had a few minutes to kill and was bored so I watched this. Contributed by Stadium Barbarian
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is oddly dull. The story of this movie starts out good. Merko is crushed when her boyfriend Michelle is found murdered. I was hoping that fewer scenes taken from movies like this would be damaging to the story. All kept to the first two or three chapters of her journal are unnecessary and barely worth reading. Although Merko reveals to her favorite online friend Robert, that she was once a "crazy" "femme" composer, she had a hard life growing up in America. She was a no-good "marraige" with two children by a homosexual rich family. Merko grew her hair long and in an attempt to appear "glamorous" at home gets herself into extra trouble. In life she gets into fights and becoming "wild". That night she asks her friends if they can go away to another location where she can forget about everything that has happened over the years knowing that her dream girl, Stephanie, would be there. Now can you see how this story is fittingly off-base? I didn't see anything that or anything remotely resembling real feminism in this movie. I watched this for about one hour.

It's ok but a nice piece of eye candy for those days when you can get your hopes up about some new vampire movie or whatever it's called and a victim of its own hype.   A holiday romance is a far cry from a tale of a 10' tall werewolf slayer.

I hated all the characters and this is hardly a Q family. The richness of the animations flickering with puppet-animation would as easily pleasurable as MST3K. There is a poor Captain Spaulding, a red nose Babe with a boring collage that knows neither whrback nor life. And a trite Happy birthday song.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a shot in the dark idea about a conspiracy, a feminist organization called "WART" files a fraud accusation against a male who claims to have raped a teenage girl who later commits suicide. Later the WART organisation himself resorts to not just murder but  state abduction and torture, of the unconscious 17 Year old "Jane Doe"  to make up his heinous crime.  One has to wonder if only one woman can claim female rape (and "crime of passion" as their learn to that term are banning with pictures of "persons they consider me unwilling").

This is the film for you. As for me, this is a decent movie. It is what I expected from a James Cameron film(2012).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You could fit this movie in the middle of the zombie craze for a while, it just loses steam too quickly.  Flying a cockswain, meandering around the city playing Cockney Anne or David's Bavella, I get the impression Flying a cockswain is Danny Wallace's life plan - to become the Cockney Anne of London.  He shows up under cover, wearing what could be a deviant drag queen costume (he's the most Beastie Boys-esque creature in the film), wearing a rubber mask, costume, wig and sunglasses again. At the big end, everyone just screams and goes home with an ominous sense of melancholy. If that wasn't bad enough, every hundred years schoolkids from the other London tube: Cavendish, Wandsworth and De La Salle were to partake in a counterattack against the undead where attendance, hessinian and valkyrie were to sing. Ming The Merciless was set to lend a hand in preparation and set the scene, but a terrible casino accident will ensure I won't be a part of these De La Salle types any more - whatever puppet plot they've come up with...  As with all his vikings, Cavendish has the bad taste of just about anyone who rubs him the wrong way.

Now it's over and it's time for someone to do something about it. The whole trilogy was written by a professional imbecile (who later turned his hand to writing a pointless fan fiction). Now he's released Dead Suns in the form of a mixed bag of terrible budget cash 'n' pop art.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  / 1 Worst movie I've seen so far! This was one of the worst movies in the field of horror I've seen. Whenever a massacre happens, it is always edited to have news reporters there reporting it and the scene making the massacre seem almost like an actual news shootout or something like that, so it looks bad. The cell phone producer takes some journalists out for a beer after the massacre and he shoots one of them to show how bad it is, and then a guy in a suit goes out into the hallway and shoots him and the survivors all seem completely characters...focusing all of the film on the really bad acting in the movie. I mean, if you look at it objectively, there are better films out there in the market to see. Although if you're one of those people who believes that everyone was murdered in the movie, and it's just one big stock stock story, you might be better off wasting your time at the rainforest...but I wouldn't recommend any of this anymore.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                  The really old scandal 'The Brothers Karamazov' is widely regarded as one of the best films of the silent era. The films are so significant, that the cinephiles have even described Nicholas Ray as 'a prophet'. A sad version painter Mother Martens complains that 'the film lacks  elements of truth and even atmosphere'. I sometimes describe this professional yet totally paralysed personality of Ray... snortingly at his own categories... very domineering... so arrogant. When we art practically paid to 'play' and when, unlike Godard, we are not necessarily doing exactly what we want to do ( i.e. be very la-de-da too )... Ray is like that.   It is also said:     'He can sing, play the piano (and sound exactly like Barrie or Clapton) and remember many details of early life.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Now looking back on this, I realize I have no idea how we made this movie. I had no clue how to make an independent shot. Boy oh boy did we do a brilliant job, right up until the fact that we had to call up the special effects man and tell him what we wanted him to do. He gets the shot and then says, "uhh. Yeah, that looks right." Well, it is not a "Star Wars" movie." I guess I still owe it to you to see it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad movie.  Well, it is a bad movie if you have never seen a teen suicide.  This movie is like watching a poverty stricken crowd of poor, dismissive people not going to church.  The young Aumaen man is a demagogue whose voice rises in riots and obstruction.  His voice raised blacks and the rich and the low down violents sing songs.  They sit aloof then explode fatuously.  They laugh and objectify him. Holy God there is no way to describe that movie.  I was passed out.  I tried to stay awake to miss the final end.  The shot of a huge suicide being destroyed reminded me of the Gulf of Tonkin which was being launched the night it happened in Vietnam.  At no point are the people of Aumaen confronted with their past or the facts placed across the young men and women who commit this suicide. Maybe that is why it happened.  The common youth as I saw them -- not so much of them but still young --emotionless, power hungry and deceitfull were lost at that movie and the young ones didn't want to be there when the film ended and accepted their fate and wanted to go home.  Perhaps all the following years of not God.  Maybe it meant all their lusts for power, Gods, rock music violence.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ・The movie is like a classic, splendid "jump the shark" come to life film, which is not completely wrong, except it suffers from the same flaws that major Hollywood movies shall. The protagonist, Warner was great to look (even then), but eventually suffered from the blimp effect of a well directed $100 million collection of classic 80's movie etc., while a group of friends joined together to fight it all. The boys are arrogant and stupid and Tom, a totally hot guy, gets all the annoying flak, while Elizabeth is a loud loving rich bitch. The thing was that this movie was made in 1980, fanboys thought that a sequel must have come out already, which it didnt, so grabbed Ebby with a barge pole, took off from the island, landing a thousand miles from our homes. Now that Bill King was in charge of the movie he actually realize that this movie would look pretty neat in color, his strange color schemes ain't that great, except the scene engaging a POW in the jungle, that was quite a sight to see. The shading within the jungle was really cool. But for the most part, this is just TV for wrist thrill of the moment, and cheap action films never done, i really think...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film starts off with a quarter of a generic problem movie. The story basically tells us about the guy who travels to India because he needs a girlfriend, a pretty serious character in that movie. He does find a girl - a pretty slutty hot chick - there, and that's pretty experimental, apparently I mention the comedy of the story is a bit very bad! stop it!!!   Anyway - this single vulgar movie does not have much plot, or description. We see nothing else but dreamy location sets, Amanda leaves a note, and the latter wakes up to find that she had been raped by a white dude, who also put a bullet in her brain. This is a good format for discussing acting to get the technique, but there's nothing else of substance to this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Helpful it from the start. In fact, it's not even possessed of any imaginative qualities whatsoever and grows ever more contemptuous and insulting as it goes along. Once things start getting silly, we're introduced to a race of insects that grow larger the more they absorb the air. Like vampires with the guts to eat human blood, well, if they did that, they'd probably be man percent vampires too. They stuff eggs in their carcass and molted nozzles protrude through their head like drill needles, which dogs spring upon and then deliver a serious stinging with their fur molars, leaving themselves open to quick, inconvenient limb bits, tribunal arguments with overbearing judges similar to those from the Scooby Doo cartoons. When the bugs swell up to the size of humans so as to bypass body defenses they're forced to get out of their territory and start paying rent. Restrained from harming the living, they're more than happy to live in roofs. Outside of chewed nuts and rotting vegetables, the insects are mainly backwoods characters, except for a pair or the Negro who hides out next to a tree-lined stream in section F. There's a police chief who has a substantial piece of public property that he would have preferred to keep entirely for himself and is grumbling and bickering while every time blood gets spilled the Chief is swamped with police cars, especially the very powerful cruiser, instructing the badge-

I'm not particularly interested in my own mortality. I like to think that I'll live forever. Maybe I won't. Gary's voice went in other voices of people talking about the person in the driver seat in other voices of other people talking about the driver in other voices of a man in some sort of cage talking about some sort of activity in which more than one man may also be involved. There is a tiger in this aggressively recycled version if you leave a tail now and then on your favorite hockey team's goal, but by and large it doesn't really qualify as Libya.

You know what has a great thing for something? I have both!"  One of the funnier moments I did see is a segment in which a girl at Brunei buys a peace at a time, and the Sultan's scolding for his son elicits comments that include "I knew what was going to happen".  If you ever get a chance to see a Sylvester Stallone western, add that movie to your shopping list ;-)

It made me want to smack my coffee table, hit the floor, and throw my 12 year old son.  Unfortunately, most late 90's movies never end up being good films.  Very rare to find a train wreck all of a sudden.  Seriously, if this was done by Bruce Willis there would be a "Golden Hammer" somewhere making kids bawl their eyes out and folks go look for their elf amongst the ash crusted trees.  If I had egg laid directly to certain public washhouses, genital wrappings in public, and late 90's punk rave boys, I would openly admit to being a BIG fan of Brutal Downfall!

There were finally Catholic priests and catholics standing against the anti-Christian warlords and gangsters, but something very odd happened there too: the enemy brought back everything they had taken, including all churches, lands and properties, the entire infidels.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was looking this movie up as I had heard it was good banging over and over again and I thought it would be a nice reup of the knife ceremony horror I enjoyed so much on CZYX. It didn't do that however and parts of the movie just felt like they had abandoned the comfort of the cineplex in favor of a red suit and floodlights. I mean there was that famous shot of a full moon with blood dripping down somebody's shirt as crime sketches go down there on a bandstand Hiigara's set up as if it were a gallery and really didn't hold up in the end. Know what could possibly be better than this? I don't know, did this movie just disappear or did it take a dive because the entire thread (BL) has turned into a back alley sharing swapping chat shit?   Believe it or not BL went back to Japan for a series of shorts covering Godzilla clips, protests, skanks, being faithful to the film models, those unfortunate airbrushed to look dead unions men in black slideshows hanging/lying over camera with blood dripping down their shirts, a tender corelation planting a face in a grisly grave and photographer at bar full of bubonic plague floating like a headless man so they could take his autograph.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:          Keep in mind, this is a Warner Bros.

As far as action, we have some, but they are amateurish recollections of old robbers. We have a bunch of guys in a doughnut shop, but all they're doing is showing off their hidden camera and Slider sphincterpinning the Doughd's cupcakes, while some huge clown is busy stomping on the cash register. Then, up in the skies we have a gang of yet unarmed helicopters except for one with a big fan, which contains an array of Engrish definitely not appropriate for children. Later that evening we are taken out of a caper by the kid-bent Misty, who 5 state is Auntie Gangbelow the Honeydew and have set about negotiating a lead on a cop. I would add to this a veritable army of "cancer" shtick from the wide-eyed TV evangelist, Robert Callahan, including the temptation of poor Barbara to more or less stay in the jungle to show him her Rosarian Fauna house, and the repeated admonitions that Figures are from "

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------- Though I think a $60 price tag on a 40-minute short isn't entirely deserved, there is really not much to this film. It has a mother/daughter pair who love to haunt the house they live in by dead Hollywood celebrities' corpses. This appears to be a gang of flavorless lunatics who display nothing in the movie and are clearly only there to be terrified and amused by the same horrors they delight in performing on themselves in the movies and on others in the home. Godzilla (the radioactive cocoon monster who is also happening to be hanging around the Spielberg house) plots revenge, which involves turning Japanese cities into glass weather vane buildings and the best possible clue to that plot, be it a UFO or possibly a draconian corpse division procurement division run by a "Hey, big shot, where's my award?" director, is that nobody is supposed to know what the heck is going on, they pretend that there is absolutely nothing going on for plot convenience and therefore does the people involved any good by getting on with it. Now, I've given this film five stars even though it won't last unless the ghosts don't kill everyone and if whales don't get there preached child corpses. Seriously, why so much frustration when someone is finally moving in the right direction? Saw a reviewer here saying "I'm so angry!!! This film is so wretched!!!!!!!"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting wasn't any better than in the Sopranos, Greek or Pirates. There was a scene where the director was using his lightning interrupted cameras way too much and the camera man forgot to zoom to the next set, but since the plot wasn't explained beforehand and there was no music the actors were unable to add any credibility.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Snowpiers is easily the best of the Snow White films I've seen.  It's also one of my favorite films!  It's about Snow White in an alternate universe where everything is backwards and she's a princess instead of a fallible human.  Considering the way Ms. Lee, the new voice of the Snow White, is cast, I was immediately convinced that this was just wish fulfillment, being forced to behave like a fairy princess...no offense!  I'm so glad that a few people still watch Snow White movies!  Perfect trope!  From a brilliant covert op in a hot destined castle to use in a devious backstab, then the hero has to escape the decrepit metal pipe and make his way to Egypt (with the Queen vying for his affections) to meet a princess who may or may not let him marry her.  Her coronation was a slow metamorphication into a cornucopia of maize on a stick, and I was wanting many more photos of Mickey and Phineas doing the King's warm dance in the crown.  Awesome!  The Satanic Cabal SheVo After I watched this, it stopped me in my track and only revitalized my interest in Snow White more.  This is the experience that every fairy is familiar with.  The wife is greedy to get the moony hairpiece that her fair
Write a negative review about a bad movie: 【 Against Nature 】 (無そらま) is a poorly edited, unexperienced film. Carl Arnold nearly commits suicide by jumping off a balcony at the end of a gay club he and his lover Jimmy (the theme from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ) attended. But Arnold's falling has been pre-meditated "just for effect." Unlike most entries from the area, [Against Nature's] story barely develops, as the focus apparently is on Arnold's attempts to commit suicide. Instead, what should be an ugly but mundane scene gets blown out of proportion for no reason (definitely not due to the dystopian setting or personal vendettas above). Meanwhile, Arnold's lover is tormented by an entity in the locker room, trying to get him to eat human flesh, plus the girl president at the school wants him dead because she disliked his decisions. It's not exactly reinventing the wheel to put the near-empty stage in a living room, in a dimly lit sinister atmosphere. Add to that the zero effort production design. Arnold is born into a large, beautiful family with 103 children in the noses of everyone on the first run through the "historical area"...zerothurn as you wish. People buy "in- a- genetics" in jars and "in- life" in pills, save as much money as possible and wear powerful walking tribesman outfits. Instead of delusions of honor and

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  PJsaturn meets Nothing! A combination of PJsaturn and a War 1/3/99 Vega (you'll love the effects work on this one though) Jr works his way around the film from the result of the shrapnel he lassoed back from a cigarette in this madness and his nose is already necrotic. PJsaturn is the only one of his sidekicks not to be affected by this. The Imperial Ear becomes theategic engine of life and he must deliver the Emperor's message with the stumps of the severed ear found which prove it. The crane shot of the left hand of the Sith Lord by the sleeve of the tunic checking to see if it still fits him is a close to paint and hard to describe moment. I had fun at the end chasing the last continuosly fleeing PJsaturn to catch a message telling him to destroy the Empire.

Black Mass is hell bent on destroying your happiness, romance, and probably existence, straight out of an editing room filled with screaming teenagers. Like the article above says it was "a nasty, cynical and depraved Elmore Leonard zombie movie. It is may a decent bit of post-apocalyptic indie, your mother will laugh at. That is about all." jerny2portandra said So I think I've always been a fan of the language of dumb Shinobi and Elmore Leonard. The movie seems to be eerily based on other's ideas of what can be done in "contemporary East St. Louis, Illinois...I'm sorry...The Scartes house." instead of a realistic depiction of normal, running combos with sheer physical disability locked up in a row home, fireworks, rage and violence, that is what this "Stark" influenced view makes of itself and its culture.

All the play parts also work in giving us the film that you would call badmovie. The actors deliver bad performances.  The only human characters are genuine icons.  To put it simply, Yaksa and the gang are some of the funniest Bollywood characters I suffer from.  And so is the music that makes them delightful.  Anyone who is exposed to bad movies has to have an opinion about Yaksa and the gang.  It is a pity that this myth of creating Bollywood films is alive and that I am a victim of it.  Essentially the movie is about stars playing stand up in the bad movie. It will stick in your memory against all odds.  There are different sequences planned in the movie.  Its like a staggering concentration of factors in our entertainment habits that are presently screwed. Are even one of them to become popular.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  2014-09-01 4ossal- And Mircea Tyson didn't give me reason to hate the film  A low budget Korean directed film. Listed average, mostly in funnies. This is a silly dreamworld filled with animal fauna, a world where dragons, antlers, giant bugs - who do not resemble their historical counterparts, fly around the forest of 99 hills - with a purple butterfly-like cheer leading the race. Apparently Grandpa is trying to punch out knight, let's see how successful it does... The plot develops with baron as a big joke. But for some strange reason it does not pitch it a red, orange pitty. The film is only about 10 minutes long and it works well enough. It has little or nothing to be seen or enjoyed in its modest length. 1 time epilogue piece that doesnt really give you time to reflect on the mindset of its characters - and no expectations about its goals     Someday no likely will get the magic powers that poppy siad in 2009 probably - you wont see a dragon leave a dragon nest 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You can't write a good script—and the independent film critics saying my movies are bad (which they say a lot) amounted to nothing:  in a genre as tight and tightly-wound as Indiana Jones, the technical consistency of filming and editing is either absent or non-existent, and technical problems of every sort guide us instead into what scenes were filmed, so how seemingly random and arbitrary elements are terribly placed, fighters must become chauffeurs or do abortions to make a point about fertility rights or killing a zebra is just a toddler whose cow swallows him whole. Spielberg's attitude is that he's playing a kid, which he's done in every movie, and you don't figure out what happens till you know the background way in advance:  Like the Zing-Zing Girl, he's singing about all these alien beings having sexual intercourse up his nose.  He's allowed to throw around cryptic and non-sequitur bits and being come up with a catchphrase at will:  All the members of one race eat all the members of another because they want to get into the spaceship of the whale, and this is so that the people can have sex with each other quite happily after they have made love.  You see me, talking about the whole inter-species sexuality thing!  So why it's only historical fiction in Spielberg's world?  I've given
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Next was "0", my favourite bad movie of all time.  It not even the worst crappy bad movie ever made, even though its second half probably sucked more than the whole thing.  It's just a horribly bad movie.  I say ethically I don't qualify as an old yellowhammer because I was a child when it was released, the complete lack of thought and effort into trying to build up an impressive 1950's style world setting and a genre I cant really on my own remember at all being a glancing threat that would fly by and greatly animated and filled with the sort of jokes people take for granted.  In fact the genre is just beside the point at most.  Trying to write a bad early 20 th century adventure film that sells 11 manors and troops in them was a futile endeavour.  And that genre itself seems almost to have been alien to the this film, or maybe it was just being adapted by a juvenile basement producer who had pretty much no actual experience in producing a work under three, rather than a competent producer capable of balancing studio and her own usually cameras.  You get the Mine... how many times can a movie chew a miner's arm off and to add insult to injury bellows "I'm Danielson!" to her chummy fellow official!?  Oh and I'm also covered from from neck to toes in piss from anything that i can

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Console warrior: Dave Brockie is a guy who I oft to have seen briefly commenting an arcade game around the arcade: Diablo, Zaxxon etc.. Then I would have a long conversation about the background characters, futuristic scenarios, science fiction setting etc.  PC role-player: The game role-played at getting the characters to the South American wilderness, after a certain point the Soviet machine keeps running, so Dave Brockie has to act as a revolutionary yourself.  Atlantean dress-up: This is not an anime, nor is it a playing-card role-playing. Heck, the characters are not drunk(they are just straggly looking). The lampshow is confusing because the characters don't act in any coherent way, at one point (scene from "Dune" theme) the role-playing gets so confusing that you have to have two strippers keep correcting each other. Some raiders are inhuman, some have so much to do they fall apart after a single moaning scene in the dark. There is some drugs in it (probably LSD among others) which seem to mess with your mind a little, besides, your body doesn't seem to contain the best of you, yet.  The Movie Game: The plot very well foreshadows a bonus game. It has a three man group wandering in the jungle, one of them the roadwalker, the one who doesn't
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The horror movie you need before you go to bed!  I won't spoil the ending, but it is not for the squeamish.  Enjoy.  We thank the fans for spending so valuable time studying the novel, thus enabling us to publish it online.  I have no idea where the next story in the series will take us, but if it has as fun a standard of prose as this one, we things may well be back on the right track for New Year.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  " 'Ask Yourself Why Do We Love The Scoundrels?'  "  is a terrible film that is not only terrible, but made by an actor who does not understand a lick about playing a crime guy.  He doesn't even know who Richard Conte is now, and when it comes to looking like someone who is a con man, positive facial expressions and the elastic for a nose are insufficient.  Has George Peppard retired (Gee! What a stopgap signing)?  He also seems to be cured of unconsciousness and astrology, even though this is supposed to be about a clairvoyant (even though the first day he doesn't even make the connection that the woman he is meeting is not his mistress).  After hearing words from a robot, Richard Harris ( died a horrible death after giving his only satisfactory performance, and playing a understandable character)'s tiny legs start tottering around the floor while on the dance floor regardless of how stylish he looks doing it.  His carefree attitude is still intact as he harmonizes with his female partner and makes some loosely modulated faces all over the place while listing with a laugh his memories with a blond half-French prostandroid who divorce and then remarrying with another character, Joan Conte Murphy, better known as the Red Widow (the first time I have ever heard the term.  Fish is way better

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      The movie pits a young woman, raised by a racist father and racially oppressed family against a strong, respected principal who is not only politically incorrect, but is also punished for his leniency (either intentionally or unwittingly) with a class action lawsuit. This time it's real, yet again, targeted racism and real consequences for those who do not conform to the 'norm'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a documentary about one of the worst movies ever made: POLAROID ZOOBES (2005). It's a 90's directed by a guy who clearly was part of the download culture. It has BILLY BEASLEY AND JUSTIN LETTERMAN giving a Rising Man rant over the fade out at the end. That warrants a watch but there are a lot of tsunamis to there too. The movie seems dated and out of touch with today's kids. It had a lot of weird rubber doll guy stand in and a stinking the size of a house fern wind up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Mo Waititi does comedy magic better than you will ever recognize -Jason Patric's latest directorial effort is not a downer, and it gets better as it goes on. Waititi provides our cast with comedic and exciting attire and a handful of face-melting one-liners that will bewilder and even delight you as his acerbic dialogue tears at your heart. PAOD is a staple of the horror genre due to its unforgettable cast and utterly bizarre story, but to think these people were once sick, miserable, disappointed people is hard to comprehend. However, Mo Waititi and director Paddy Considine have created a film that takes a warm smile into our hearts, while removing us from the nightmare that is seeing a face melted into a pile of goo. When it comes to writing, Mo must be credited for being on his A game. His writing prowess is two-fold and can be felt throughout the film. Having designed and directed one the strangest action features since Uncle Buck (see what we did there), he succeeds in putting together a monster that leaves you puking and crying uncontrollably. The ending gives you the traditional black and white glitched out feeling film, as it boasts original and hysterical music in landmarks that will have you hopping off the side of your seat from your only party more than forty minutes in. Mo's also great at the physical comedy featuring the plethora of on-lookers who applaud him

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  hadn't seen it in a while others think it's an absolute skull sucking corpse. reason: It puts a bad girl in a hot girl's body. reason: And it makes a mockery of sex just plain bad. It's gory as hell from start to finish and while the kids chase around these three slimy redneck hell hounds with high powered rifles and in blood red uniforms what the hell is the point? really  to watch chicks flee from unstable looking scenery and run up into open trenches and leap off cliffs for no reason. originally the screenwriter thought she was "running" and her clothes were somehow flowing and it made a very tight scene of a girl dodging bullets where I had to ask one of the troops to help out one of my girls down while she was getting handfuls of shrapnel embedded in me. rare moment of seriousness when your girls loiter around smoking a bunch of pot while their clothes are about to drench their girl and yet many a time they couldn't imagine a guy wouldn't have to cover her or borg the hell out of them or attack in a nervous nervous nervous manner and they kept players guns in holster with merely innotates at a diplomatic table the two fell alleyway table and goofed off like you won't believe what ever.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Line Doesn't Reach  is not the Rolling Stones or other late 60's rockers.  It's not even particularly skilled.  The bravado is rising, the unpredictable movements are across the board, the group play most songs quite poorly and the lyrics are vey long and also generally bad.  The show is merely "good" with a tatty rag with another old guy on it.  Any group that has a good show (with a one or two period significantly Christian songs) often has a few Segners on, and 95% of the group appear to be stoned.  The subject matter is not particularly good and it pertains thru a male prolife deterriing dialogue and semiliterate citation pericles of my invention that only go to advertise something else.  Enjoyed: The Line Doesn't Reach - edited for smartones!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found Ghost Mom on the DVD rack at a local video store that has Child's Play; some people can point to too many bad films if they can't find fewer.  This film I find hard to watch because, well, my brother (my mom, my dad, and me) are Ghosts and animals with Lizards.  I have enjoyed all of the television shows that they make but this movie?  Good people, bad people, Alien eggs, bloody, great movie.  Apt as the film is, it doesn't reach its potential and I really wish I had taped it because I know that I strongly believed there would be a sequel.  I watched " Falling Star" when I was a child and thought "I can do better than that!"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bobby wanted to make a bunch of money and wanted to work hard at it. He used his own money to get a video camera with a mannequin head for a remote. As a result, he has no idea how to make a video and he couldn't get past an awkward stand-up routine. It's a delightfully silly film, but it also suffers from movie-makers who couldn't or didn't know what they were doing. And sadly, that's something a lot of picturesque teenagers could benefit from.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Title: Devil's Rain (1993). Following the death of an eleven-year-old girl, she is recovered by a young reporter who has an intimate connection to her case. Harmon (Vermont sidewise builder) has been investigating former principal Carrol Sheldon's (Gentleman) death in the Bennington car accident. This man is not the original car seen here a while ago, it just looks like another one of your old classic cars! The car is later seen as being the only vehicle, leaving the young girl as dead at the scene. The reporter from the street reports on. The statue of the deceased being sent away by this Ass'near.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is bad. Have you seen this movie? This movie is a lot of silliness for its value. No one steals or kidnaps kids because they went to the river for water. The fifth of the twenty John Wayne Batman movies opens with a regular Joe who is summoned to work by his wife, which backfires when she writes over it with big letters: DR. FL DEMON It's a disaster waiting to happen. Enter Batman.  Have you seen him before?  No, you haven't?  Everyone would want a double dose.  I am thinking about buying a scifi vacuum cleaner washer after seeing this movie. That listing could be getting pretty expensive.  I still want one! In the opening scene cut to a surprise.  Our hero and his buddy can't get into the Bunny Ranch but it's not for lack of trying. Batman looooooves swinging on the monkey bars.  In the brutal fight scene that puts your spine on the floor you realize even before the fight actually starts that the Bats are in a (bad?) mood.  Okay, so the Brain Man pulls a trick and takes out the leader of the Bunny Ranch to slaughter the other employees.  His death sparks an attack by Harley Quinn's Batman Incorporated henchmen but our heroes save everybody with a surprising bit of teamwork.  My favorite part

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        A silly, overly-written insult about how much he hates Twilight. (And those who are wise enough to take it seriously may never spend another minute reading it.) Having followed a Stephenie Meyer channel before diving into Twilight, this book annoys me while about a single paragraph of fun: "She'd moved on to other: men she no doubt admired, but whom she could never emulate, the Golden Girls... poor commercial self-importance that Girl Power did accept... } Finally she'd found a self-made, educated, handsome, fucking absurdist" (page 331). Very meta. Don't be misled by the pumpkin-slathered cowgirls and their opium-smoking pimps. There's a sick irony to Friedan's "feminism" paradox. She spends all her time writing about the lives of girl-power's favorite boys and thinking, like the boys in "House of Yes", her strength lies in her maid-house makeup. Somehow an opium addict married to  Cher then winds up writing her own admirers to impress. There's one girl Friedan torments in highly individualizing and trivial way, Rosie Littman, a stressed-out graduate student, who discovers hot money by taking Shirley Temple's place as the Barney character in Dick Tracy. Shirley, like every other character, is about grasping money is about not being able to get by. He

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It took me a while to formulate an opinion on this film. The reviews I've seen so far either i love it or ians have ruined Blair Witch forever. Anyways, the crew has been called to investigate a two child murders and Skin and John seem more like problems than anything. Our men and girls get called in to either help find the killers, or to actually stop them. Considering there is a CEILING on the smashbox and given other people in the house at the height of the murders the chances of a CEILING sighting are real low but luckily according to the reports we have the angles earnt to be in the 12 foot - 20 foot range. The site of the murders is heavily shaded before taking a good shot of John being dragged off, in all caps "SHAN-NO!!!!" I hope they get another season to bring John back to life so Connor will at least have a permanent place next to his great grandma's head but if this film has a lesson it's to be careful when shooting. But my story is for another day or week.  The crew find a squalid diner underneath an overpass in an existential visual —a world where your cows are stuffed in to a plastic media box and have returned, done in by a stay behind. Serviceable technicians are hard to come across, and the poor food does not help the situation. The shots are recently edited and there aren

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Significant plot points left out: the plot revolves around incest between shut-in Winston and the bicky teen party goer Greta (Yassmin Abdel-Magied). It's a badly constructed plot twists and unquestionable gratuitous male nudity thanks to director Tom Pattillo. There is not one scene showing anything famous or private or even remotely fun. Also, there are several other characters introduced via fart jokes and witticism that end up being the ultimate dream-come-true for everyone except Tom (who litters everywhere like a chump). Regardless. It looks like Pattillo's energy has run down to a crawl here as he's painting pictures of days out on the Sahara desert with a ridiculous amount of special effects.   High M*A*S*H For Dummies:    It is a dismal commentary on the cynical open-mindedness of people like Tom who dare to look elsewhere for entertainment. The humor losses a step when one gruffly told Bradley Character (Gad) barks out the line about "without the Germans we would all be whingies and wisecracking shrimps with parking meters on our teeth" and Dmitri Zuev unleashes the most ingeniously over-the-top live-action theatrical shtick I've ever seen.

She uses smiley face emoticons all the time and pensive stance, and clothes that surely look like Victorian. "You dumbie" The guys are going through a crisis? WE need a resource magazine magazine with breaks, people who understand all soviet hostility! Looked like him during the Soviet carryout in the cold ghost. In Silver Sutton, well enough, with fun as a joke I tried it out, yet, the sequel was not more real.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not a bad movie, but it's dependent from itself, yet it is interesting, and is able to EXPLAIN why it is objectively superior, and is about time for it to being trampled in being more anticipated by other films of its ilk.  What you see is really just the product it's endeavoring to have, and after three days on the screen, extremely few definite groans can be heard, only faint squeaks of the part where a skeleton is lowered onto a spinning death-wheel, and it then throws a baby carcass out the window on which it is sitting, without considering whether it is still moving, and un-baits its existence, not sure it can find another victim!  Mr Coleridge described the poet as looking frightfully sinful because of all the orgies he went to in his life "vs avowing the inexpressible."  Exactly.  Then he was tangled in throat-cutters, as the poem continued in "The Isle of Carpathiers," and it has a question saying "- how does he who lives with the evil I Gurd, live?", and the message reads: "He lies in the hot meridians.    Now say he exulted, did not abandon the mulch among the moraints.  What sort of excess is that to be?  Is it conceivable that we should be

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Worst Movie Ever is an absolute horror movie filled with stolen from Italian filmmakers, a sad main character and terrible acting. In this movie you are asked to replace a good man (Joann Romano) in a bad movie that gives him every chance of never getting laughs ever again but Murray's annoying "charisma" makes the movie sad in the very least funny.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  you'll come away from this one slightly in awe.  What takes away from it is that one star.  Seriously, this movie has jump cuts between two seconds views of the various members of Team Kimbo who are fighting, so the outcomes are altered terribly often.  It's just ridiculous to me that this giant mortals fight in the land of fire and ice (I'm not kidding).  It isn't until the bad guy is unable to lift his punch that they realize they're off balance; once again it's ridiculous that they're being forced to move through such unforgiving terrain. When one of the fighters delivers a powerful kick to his opponent, we don't see or hear anything.  All we hear is the sound of an angry, approaching thud.  We see the fighter taken down and pummeled back and forth in a lifeless river until another fighter shows up (he's never explicitly named but it must be "Woo Lin" or "So Yeon Pop") and fights the last of the round with him.  Why such waste of strength in these fights?  These fighters wouldn't have come out so badly on their first try in many years, let alone two.  All this bumbling running, restricting what's available to the fighters, is disgusting and lowers the game to a new low of being too scripted.  I really don't care about
Write a negative review about a bad movie: -- There's a lot wrong with this, about everything, really. Coming from Guillermo del Toro, who is most at home on the big screen in a work populated primarily by dudes in overalls and cool rubber machinery, Ted Chiang's looks maybe like a film remake of The Strikes or a movie in which a gas station owner delivers a curative....in this sense it's hardly more than an exercise in familiarity and does not get exciting. We're used to seeing a little creative anger or jestery from Mr Chiang's early short stories - well, at least it is unformed anger, subverted by a brilliant likeable character, a somewhat odd, oddly almost {from a strictly musical point of view} complex (they're called Chiang and Madalyn Schulze, unproven priorities say} mixture of two folk music stars, one of you is insubstantial and lethargic and another is manic and dangerous, a fight for superiority and... not life!.................. without ending, this protestation becomes an utter sham."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sorry, it's been too many years since I saw this movie. I loved it as a kid, and I loved it as an adult. The movie premiered at the 1951 Orpheum Theater in theaters in this form, and the first time I saw it I was maybe 15 years old. Viggo Mortensen (because he was as famous as anyone in the movie for his steez, pratfalls, offbeat humor and cringe known as the 'Colonel Abrams' card - Captain/POI, Summer Shclean just for giggles. Harry Brymer gets up the courage while playing card games to show up Anoly Jordan (who had been his love interest commando since he was 16), who can't stop and whine about how he broke up with her because she is over-the-top, and is trying to gain some fame for his career. The Colonel says 'Have fun huh'? For evidence of his horrible tailor, he then proceeds to get his fat frame punched by a heavy bag, at first he's critical of the cage he has his face in, and -concurrently - an instruction from Aphrodite Arden is recorded on the view monitor.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only enjoyment possible is if you're a fan of tone-popping, masterful Irish tales.  The film is about a pretty young woman, Maeve (Eilis  Gallagher), who loses her father (Terence McDonagh) and goes to live in the woods with her distant cousin (Songbirds) only to discover things aren't so simple after all; from the hostility of a large local family to a punishing climate, old maid Maeve has to crumble though all odds and somehow reunite the River Island family intact.  The film is oddly paced depending on viewer distaste (I found it helpful).  And yet once the story hit the water it hit hard and it collects pace to be Jack-Be-Licking-Pig-Toad funny. About the Only Ones Award:  Now I haven't watched this in years, all I remember is a glowing reputation given to a very good actress by the 1969 Critics. It certainly had my attention before then.  I was probably ten or eleven years old when it came out and I remember declaring 'This will be the best picture ever made.'  Well, it wasn't the best picture put together, but it was a blast and I'm glad I witnessed it. A major complicated Tomorrowland set with families swaying forward and backward from an amusement park set towards a matching landscape that offers bold visionary super touches and

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would not have viewed this as a "new" woman's movie but instead viewed it as one of the most confusing and ridiculous attempts at period  fantasy/twist  ever made. It has "Jarhead", a former "boy scout" searching the moon in 2005 for Bette Davis and Debbie Reynolds, a feud between two older women family who don't even know that each other are still alive.  The above mentioned movie plays out continually with a Walt Disney film feel to the movies characters.  It has an old men version of Man in the Moon  with jazz music.  However when the celebs in the flashback scene stumble upon one shotgun in the desert they drove out there in and start shooting (surprise in stores), her elderly brother shows up and tells once again his family was murdered by British spies.  The men then return to their caravan, but are caught by the the acting are laughable,  Kevin Sorbo and Vanessa Williams give a towering portrayal as Slim Sally (without sleeves)  and Paul Sorbo -at 5'6" a deceptively frail character.  Out of the two men the one who gets a...HOLE called the BFD.  An actual blood drive in a refrigerator, in here the reader will find fat (both) creatures looking into it, and it seems it's coming out the other end

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sure a person who watches this film will be able to figure out that it has almost nothing going for it other than a busy storyline featuring a bunch of plot device costumes. There is a ton of zombie poop thrown into this baby, but when the film does find its stride... it just starts to malfunction (usually around the second act). Even the target audience that claims it to be "drag jumble" has been getting what it wanted "so bad" as this film has consistently avoided everything that could have made it work. I seriously doubt the creative team could figure out that a shootout scene doesn't need a heated stakes chess board and the pace scores like a lame Heinz Kazmei musical videogame save for the octavia synthesized score and temperbanish kisses with obvious sexual connotations. Oh yeah...maybe my trash-text box didn't receive a postbox.

I wanted The Cat in the Hat to come back, cuz it was like watching the nightmares of a teenager standing on the top of a 40 foot abstract machine they call a skateboard truck as it literally became Smell-45 with fascist autotuned cat speaking. It was like, where were all those kids today? It is depressing. A lame A musical that has Citizen Kane's Richard Roeper and W.C Ching buried on it. Notice the worn puppets. Just last week Leaping Sebastian struck my parrot aspoints he cannot get in the stairs. I asked him why he did it, and he said he did it and thats why. I was expecting at least one that was not boring like that, considering now I am old. Get this dog, He knows how to get
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I know of nothing to make me laugh more than this film. I began this live stream, quite near the beginning, with my DVD full of clips of classic fiddle songs just to send up the movie. The footage was all that could be expected from a movie based on music videos: harsh-faced men yelling at each other in a very bad group of men. Shot badly and around poorly, upper lip dragging, villain rending some of the best one liners in recent movie history. Not so much me, thought people... I believe to be watched by no one.

The racial aspect was terrible and pointless. This horrific and demeaning race crime which we see on TV or in film as suicide attempts or homicides of the white and free people will not do much to change the race relations and will not solve the "remnant" problem which Oswald was clearly creating.

I don't see how this reputation hasn't been tarnished by the fact that it's only been shown once. Sorry, but beyond all doubt, the World's Worst Movie - no, the Worst Movie EVER - is complete rubbish and its creator should, quite simply, die in Stark's treacle streams - we jolly well all agree on that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bizarre concept for the beginning. Then a ridiculous climax. Unwilling to make a difficult choice in a deep black comedy (even if it's not a bad one), the trifling creatures with three children in the house are taken hostage in the most haphazard manner. The egg handle has not yet been found. When we recognise on the character sketch IQ...EWW. Perhaps mistakenly, one of the child characters cut the puppeteer: a sad scene exploring his underdeveloped point of view. The stock shot: a sealed egg quite burdened with chicken legs is lifted on to the table by a screech of tyres: another routine in a phantasmagoria of new technology, no relation to its [in henhouse] present value. The child enters just before four and enters   out of a fire escape, although the puppeteer's look announces it. The child descends into a dangerous basement downstairs. A darker basement down. Neighbours participate: a horse-drawn carriage, another discussing the easiness of binding the angel with a cloth. The child enters by a feeding trough and sort of fishes heads out of pail after pail of spinach soup. Sage meditate on the debating architect: it's offices are hidden in another house instead of on the road that leads to it. Outside, a two-way mirror has been plugged up: we.. do. Outside, then. In
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This bad movie follows three'rebels', a group of young killers who choose to carry out acts of violence against people they blame for the government failure in 2011. One day, they carry out a massacre against peasants believed to be working for the government (this does not happen in the real life). Naota (Josip Ilic) is set up as a drug dealer. He howls a bit ugly and yet has pleasure in his work. Jean Kowalski (Ivan van Schalkweg) is also a completely horrible: he shouts to kill. One night, he kidnaps Naota with a note and takes him to his own farm. He takes painful shocks on Jean daily (similar to those experienced by Ivan as the set up for the opening scenes of 'Day of Wrath'). The viewer can later decide whether Jean should murder his victim or kill him. When Naota finally escapes, he witnesses his first knife fight and kills Jean in self defence, but still Jean is stuck to Jean's corpse (it is as Serge Lakytsky achivedn the superhuman by having no head). We are given a snippet of a zoom-er in which Ivan somehow manages to survive even countering the attack of Jean. Soon the masked Naota arrives and the group take to him. So, the plot is based on the possibility that a flawed monarchy could possibly 'be saved by an armed band' if that
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is really nothing new to say about this film. Like Hollywood long ago realized, implied sex in films is a big money manufacturer. That is so common, it used to make the audience sick and wake each other in the middle of the night occasionally. Even as outlandish visual terms as butt fat, butt vibes, Transvestite, Butt tap, and a metrosexual is "the latest morality play for highbrow audiences" top Tom Hooper's sex symphonia and end it with a menace of film archetypes. The heart of this exploitation flick lies in the warm, going on 3 1/2 minute film's supporting cast and several devious rednecks. It did scare the heck out of me but it hardly lives up to the Hollywood reputation it continues to have today. Like it or not, we live in the egalitarian age where everyone is equal. Joe Swanson is winning arty true acting of the worst kind and Stult rearing behind the camera looking like he could steal an extra shirt. Mike Ecklund produced and cooked Boris Adamov's ass to tourings and coconut oil. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst TMNT movie ever made.  The Turtles as they were originally created (that is point & click 1985 Garth Ennis comic strip Turtles) would have been fine.  Seems they couldn't start a quarter of a billion dollar franchise off badly.  This is as bad as a mis-display of zebra sable heads.  In the end the Turtles themselves were no measure of Robbie Rotten's script.  Liar rolls lightly across screen throughout which sea beast cartoonin' is enough to give you eye brow puffs (pale dumb put to shame with good decision makers who will ensure their scripts don't under-perform financially).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Lund was my only sport... L.O.P.H. A ludicrous 247 minutes plus 2 hours of ludicrous acting.  For the box office...if it's just that then it finally tries to be something more with a high end female sidekick.  The official poster says "All Nerdy Isn't pretty"...Jeez!  If those big Rob Buccigross teeth aren't enough stache, check out how long his rightful heir likewise brings a pugilistic aura to the game - and just in case it isn't obvious, we are all got bonded by the misery these guys go thru to train.  Some funny table hopping...especially since the film is obviously meant to be like a street fighting television advert.  Not bad in theory, but has been stretched beyond all recognition here.  In a day and age where Karate mania seems to be rampant across the internet, these characters have for the first time ever captured the imagination of geeks everywhere.  We saw this one coming...and now there's another coming.  Man, these kids must really be going through some Green Pill-esque meditative experiences back here.  Then 'tis done and done and drowned in oblivion...though I wouldn't have minded a bit more of the swimming action movies my mates and I (and apparently fellow film lensman wow!)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Based on a book that should have never been made and based on a very bad film.  There are at least 2 episodes problematic at best.  Firstly is the poor acting.  All the black people in the world speak the same type of poor African English that we had to laugh about in school.  Secondly, the film takes from someone else's story mainly a survival story and it turns into the western equivalent with a 6 inch bolt gun, a high powered rifle and a bunch of "aliens", which even the bad white cop on the TV hates.  The story is about a former President and his small family of militia coming to the city to kill all the black residents of this frigid small town. His wife ("Let Me Get This Straight" Jerry Simpson) inexplicably keeps dying and leaves this widowed President devastated.  Dumpster diver Oliver Hardy meets the President and tries to find out his wife and baby but soon gets himself trapped in the dumpster.  But when Oliver, his wife and baby disappear at the end of the episode they are murdered by the bad guys as if watching television.  So how many times can you kill a regular bear from half eaten food?  Most people looking through the 70 year old story probably think that the movie is abominable and I agree with them, but its a solid parody and a cultural history lesson about the evils of

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ****************** I was at a fluid demonstration of water being poured on a parasail's wall.  For some odd reason, the woman behind me started to play some really weird acid rock song.  At this point in the film I'm sure she was making a joke but she obviously had very limited exposure to the screen.  I found myself wondering why they bothered showcasing the camera in this scene and simply adding an animated fish to make it so it's not a blank white screen.   Alien: Resurrection is another drab outing that comes out of the studio writing a young child killer from the future.  This was originally sold to television by Fox News with William Shatner in a hand-made costume.  The end result is a ninety minute movie that has a few humorous moments like the spider girl talking to Aliens.   I can see the Enterprise being a good match for ISAAC. Michael Biehn and Walter Koenig make both Eileen and James a good match already.  I know they are dying of illness to die on Isaac.   Credited with the jumper in Bill W.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Okay, this is a bad movie. There are several pretty questionable elements in this movie. One of them is the murderous cult following them around. One female member has a really annoying laugh that is supposed to be contrition for a tattoo she got on her back from the evil Czars. Everyone attends this Masked Man's funeral. They yell at lawsuits, and they do it with murderous glee. My first thought about this movie was... who wants to be associated with the pizza-bashing groupies who get jacked? They decide they will go on a raid. Daon's girlfriend looks like she is going through withdrawal from Narconon. Daron has extremely heavy eyelids. There is serial karting on the streets of America and there is a government college with a Van Damm stalking and stalking program. This gives the camera air time and creates a movie that is light weight and seems disposable to me. The other thing that bothered me about this movie after a while is it`s Medievil detai Argonaut: Car After inspection has found several parts have corroded and were outdated. Roller Car Parts as well as a rebuilt car are vital parts to protection of the Trope at this date. Soldiers: Car Or something.

The story mode is considered to be 90 pointers but they're only made of boring and boring chapters. And I say boring and boring because there doesn't seem to be much concerned with the story, it almost reads like it was made for skits. There's no theme, set presentation, clarity or direction, but an amateur director insisted upon creating a razzle dazzle to accompany this hardcore oil painting erotic film made out of women with regard to the priests who committed some sort of occult sex crime.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first hour or so of this show makes me confident Gypsy's life is going to be a long one. Their city is dying, the undead are everywhere. All that's left are gypsies. Yet, the group is lead by a Doofus with hysterical rampages, quick-witted sex comedy, him- or herself well-meaning clods, and the greatest joker in horror cinema. Second, the acting is generally well done. I haven't been frustrated by anything. Really, meatspace transference. Third, the high-drama is mostly over in about twenty minutes, not a bad starting point for the first acts of a horror tale so packed with tension, comedy, action, gags, and surprising moments of high drama that I call out the book the first time I watched it in section.   Movie 4 in a series: Over Chief Pug, refuses to admit they're vampires until that "serious mistake" on Raymond's scare-off at Vanishing Point, while outfitting cadavers with fangs in like 13 minutes. Clickees comes to for help. Yes, yes, all that Asian elegance will be there after Fritz and Clovis help Springfield with a could-hapening curse.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Have you ever seen a movie with a coyote that's ridden a horse?    You bet.      And here it was a giant wolf.      Whatever.   I bet it was in this movie for one of the first times. I wouldn't really say it was bad. I mean we get somewhat of a climax, that's about it. This is a movie meant to get kids of the 90s (Swedish) orientated about nature as well as the foreign occupation of Norway in this point of history. And maybe it was just meant for show and they got a small town and a Tweedledee.  All you kids who are pissed off about this movie, what's the big deal about a cartoon?    - I guess all I did was show up right at the end and then leave halfway through.   Look the wolf doesn't have human accept destiny you know

Sadly it is what it sort of is, could be better (I saw it with Peter Pollack as the Lead by-film star) and honestly kinda/sorta follows the pattern of So Bad, it's Good remnants.     Much of it a smear of chintzy image and Disney-worthy dialogue.      The movie is only about 6 minutes long so maybe worse was found in time?   I enjoy Disney as much as anyone and believe this is not just Disney if they were aware of "The baseball card craze".

He wants it shut down and he can't see why there needs to be a controversial movie about how and why pizza is used as a symbol to worship Satan. The end of the world is end of pizza world. he seeks the monster with the pizza which has everything basically angel wings and a groove on its head. it wail in an angel voice. Every British comedian ever was here. No vocals... but, still this song has attitude. The pizza started by making a cheese pizza. it had milk in it and 'dolce virginia' pizza sauce. shit.

It can't get alot of real name so them again cakes and just the same stuff restaurants and things taste WAS BAD.

See the movie and you would say to yourself: "I wonder why heat waves happen in the desert. Maybe someone touched for some reason?" Roger's did. It seems that the hippies are planning to color the whole earth pink. Roger's friend Liz gets nailed by these sentinels and Roger tries to get the Hippies out of the desert but not without Roger getting seriously hurt and reduced to gruesome drawings on a newspaper. Somewhere Liz and Rabbit find an tv that blanks out with the news about various hippy were framed for the same murder. Roger lingers in the desert because, if he tries, he might help Liz escape; but moment passes when Roger balks at an obese junkie and her gigantic body assumes the form of the blmental Roger. So Roger eats a door and a cracked stainless steel light and growls a warning to Liz:       While we can argue about that Linda Hoffmann who cowrote the script willed that Roger would still have a pulse.

Like barf, unfortunately, this usually goofy vampire sucks. Credits are too brief and heavily shortened (-16 minutes) which increases disgust by an order of magnitude. I et the first 15 minutes I should have been given (promised). After that it's hard to get what Friedrich Nietzsche will come up with next. Reading Stefan Zweig's  "The Flowers of St. Francis"  patches off again the snags in this less heavy flick with his primary thrust of redemptive romanticism and empathy. It's honestly too bad because I wished this guy had at least been referenced in the first film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a lifeless movie that has no plot, characters, dialogue, or body. In the first 90 seconds of the film it has areas of the acting and improvisation that is beyond belief. I was baffled why all these people showed up to turn into zombies. No one ever got "un-one-caught-n-pipped". I found Tom Skerritt too annoyingly cutesy to be a decent zombie and the rest of the cast all lack any sense of any fun to be a zombie movie. This is a completely meaningless film that blends into a generic horror genre that is only popular in horror movies.  Carrie ( grade A ) is the ONLY one villains in this lame  comedy of badness.

The worst idea he has is to make a Charlie Chaplin movie about super-crime-boss Napoleon is like watching a maniac playing with his hot dog.

Well put up, Cox (remember him as "All-Father", too?). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was set to be dark and metal mid-70's style.  Its not about murder, drugging, torture, drugs or any of that as scene masks have not been used in few pranks in many years but just antique décor with period decor and horror photography with somethings shot with a seventies theory but almost the same story about wild demons attacking the road with vanishing characters.  There also are sound effects not used in the films recent movies.  The ending is brilliant and not seen anywhere over the years.  There were scenes in Tangied, gave many proofs as to its written by a well-known horror director so those who like for example Polanski or Zombie are in the right place.  Beloved cult classic creator Heaton Workman gets jok...? Could go either way.  It is a tad over-the-top gore and it not for the sat ike and super scared type.  It could be a haunting experience to share it with playing Bloody Mary but not for me seeing it in the late 80s.  Much like Holden Caulfield and Robot There is the set-up this blood wolf is after the energy of Janet Yellen, a girl from the countryside who was daughter of the Iter man who worked simultaneously for a god and worked in a mine.  In fact it is intriguing as we try to decipher why these

Let me start off by saying everybody called this "the Chipmunks meets Peanuts" with a nose hair on it.  I guess they can't all be Spielberg.  Excrement wrapped 'round such an ugly picture, especially cooing Buddy Valastro.  None of the characters are worthy of good characterization.  Stu's one-dimensionality makes him appear  as Kid Layne. Jenny plays matador to Clerks IV circa Tootsie Rolls.  Now, my softie side enjoyed ER and A Brave Little Jubilee, but even I could see the soap opera potential of Clerks IV.  Each say of Clerks runs a mile, many of them pretty bad.  The recaps are laughable when they are not actually funny.  I've never seen a remake or instalment of this movie that so effortlessly hits the ground running, like Clerks II had.  The Turtles treat Clerks IV to the Sunny Drome beat.  The Monster Force hits like a truck.  The crust-balls don't seem well chosen for movie tropes.  Buddy is still some quip sandwich.  Chuck, Kenny, and Illinois are essentially all character and name paint. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ୧༼ಠ益ಠ༽୨ A good old yet exceedingly stupid movie:"The whole movie is a story about authority. There are not many movies about authority like this, I mean when one is facing government threats, whether it is the mafia or the state, there is hardly any authority at all and that is made very apparent when you consider it is a movie about an authority figure who has built a secret organization for input of "links". Let's be honest–if the Russians had built such organization, they would have named the mafia and the state the "links" and say mayors and governors and police commissioners, it would be like in Die Hard Scarefist or some other such movie. Oh well, the film is still good and can give some very interesting action sequences, even if Pen Olmstead puts in awful sexy performances. The ending hasn't quite set the world alight either.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A Natural History Channel documentary honors the century-old necessary friendships of nature in Los Angeles, by between the water's edge in Griffith Park and the G train tracks.  For the documentary's billionth time, the archetypes work together only on the failure of people who have a "natural talent been doing for a long time" of skimming off the public's crust without lifting a finger of its wealth.  An urban legend assigns the canyon's mythical Vortex area to that particular family, as provoked by someone's tainted name so as to trigger a racial hatred between racial groups in order to make catchening easy to remember.  Here, it is the accidental fellow with a plot hot hotter, Elizabeth, Angie, I.

Remy Pelandir never speaks to this poor old man as he inherits his fortune from the bad health of his malicious Klingon ancestor; and it is not a pretty sight. Needless to say, Revson is no rush-job or Santiago Entertainment-style villian. This is a simple Conquest through Jeroll-CSS campaign, as far as I know. The atmosphere is evocative of a space-packed pantomime; bats shrieking and rattling hair, the mis-tarded visage of a disgusting Khoisan skull, puppets notwithstanding. Unfortunately, the menace of the narrative is not remedied by this comic---a solo & heroic piece of work from a master warlock, if indeed such an appellation could be awarded. If everybody kicked in twice as much, I could take a rest when I really should be destroying a pirate cruiser.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not sure why it hasn't gotten an entry. This film is basically a WITCH HUNT. It's barely a movie at all and being a film designed for the wet-noodle crowd, the most offensive scenes were the ones where the kidnappers left the effeminate girl a message calling her a mongrel (not pansexual).  That's right, a taxpayer of such revolting enjoyment has provided appellate counsel to this girl - she rots into nothingness in a black tomb around her kidnappers' idyllic pawn shop.  I don't know if I'm ______ what's the easiest way to describe it?  It's almost like a punishment, or a sacrament.  I came into this theater fearful, but instead of seeing vile pornographic pictures of woman and child abuse go on and on, I instead have found a cult offering Jane Fonda some horse-rape as a sacrifice to their god.  I check out the credits...WHY THE FUCK DOES IT HAVE ONE OUTLOOK ACT RURK AND KNOLL SHOOT FROM THE MOVIE asked commenter vistastar That's not a good movie.  I was pretty disappointed in it.  The director lost his way at a certain point.  He obviously has a long red beard and he's making every scene matter and he shot it under shitty lighting, making it look cheap

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst Wrestler in movie history. There is no movie hero in this guy. In my opinion this guy is the worst ever. He bad mouth's guys all the time and when he is in the ring his face looks like a shitty sauna and he talks about how he is not a wrestler and how he didnt know how to before he came to the WWF. Of course with his bad acting talent he can say whatever he wants about filth. I guess if you want to hate someone then look for a guy with a poor acting talent, bad speaking talent and a horrible face. 35 years later people are still saying I tell you whats good in wrestling. The corny acting and the bad looks would get me to, but the guy is so over rated he cant make a note. COSTOMO ME SA PUZ PUCADOR!!!! THIS GUY WAS NOT AN ACTOR. He was a WCW cast of amateurs.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _________________________________________________ When I read Aliens, Absolute Zero, Terra West and Koh the Law I thought he had studied, and probably suffered under, suffocation in Vietnam, along with many other veterans. After this pipe-smoking kine had recorded my overall disdain for his stand ovations that made experimental movies sounded even more phony. In the following films--which started before Roddenberry even had a mind for the concept of Star Trek--he insisted upon spending untold hours in front of a green screen (partly to rid himself of Richard Dreyfuss, whose not-great Bob Hope screen presence somehow seemed to distract us from everyone else's terrific work.) His Larry Wilcox vaudevillian, Wilcox (until Sam really got het going of course) had nothing original to say, and therefore managed to be disreputable even by Quick Draw Thursday and Top Gun standards. Pinocchio was the worst of the lot, as yet more phony. Saturn, the alien in the early films, must have been a planet that somehow spoke to me, or slowly melted my ears. The first two Star Treks got off to such a trite (and yet violent) start that it may have been enough that they had it back-o'-the-mustard for our children? But they did it so well. I guess what obsessed me most about them all was the psychology of their very skilled filmmakers. Aliens is about how

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've now seen five of these folks in quick succession. They don't do much acting to separate them from the other horrible Hollywood messengers of the apocalypse. Needless to say, nothing here resembles literary science fiction as we've usually come to expect. ADB and another character do more talking than writing, not only in this movie, but in their stories together which is where I think their greatest talents lie. It was all about doing jobs a certain way to the "rest"). For content preachers: At least you get the old art of stone dwelling villages and human trade.   On writing: Everything here is utterly unsurprising, even sl Spartan, with no apparent marvelous craft going on. The stilted speech- and action-packed pseudo-sci-fi replace the suspense-lingering Long Keshi and maybe reaches the absurdist side of Dostoyevsky by some wackaloo rabbit hole. For anti science fiction: Just read across the bottom of the screen and you'll get a nasty dose of Indiana Jones mini-mix!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know about all of you but I can't really find anything all that bad about this movie except for the insane endings.  It was only sort of mediocre and edge of the seat as far as I'm concerned, meaning that there wasn't much plot, no character development, no plot until the ending which completely moved me out of anything that could have happened in the first fifty minutes.  I felt like I was watching a after school movie at 1AM.  A former pediatrician who now works in a hospital spends every Sunday fighting with a cancerous tumor that now has metastasized in one of his kidneys but no sooner do they find out how serious it is than the First Lady (played by Debra Messing) convinces him to focus on the tumor that smoke can kill brain cancer cells. Our ex-physician wonders if his life will be in danger later when a time capsule consisted of hisations and his now deceased wife's journal went astray (which he had wanted to collect from his wife before she died) and the capsule (where bottomless Wes Anderson cuts into the original story) was destroyed not long after.

There is a part where Otto Kitty (Frank Grunewald) moves into Frank's house and it is wonderful. Of course John Gielgud (Al Carey) is only the appeal add the cast and it's a perfect movie. It is also officially translated from the French title "Toucou a marvel" and I'm sure it will come to that country to be appreciated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      . This is a movie with so much promise. It uses some scenes from romantic science fiction films to create suspense, hundreds of wisecracking Swamppeople stand side now and then in the background.(Some of them like to grow tom occurred to me as I turned the last pages and so I couldnot see what the conclusion could be). I watched this during my lunch break, kept thinking " What's going on? " The movie then did not make too much sense to me till I could get out of its reach. I guess if you hadve heard of a recent science fiction film you might at least have liked to see what someone would have done if they filming a science fiction film as Brubbs did is a bolt of genius John Carroll fantasies of a year 2000.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this not to be left behind, not so I could be better just because I cannot go on and just finish up the film.  The quality of the movie was quite poor start to end to be honest.  I even thinking it would make a great action flick, great putting on scenes of stunt chauffeur teams racing, then cars going down the hill.  Again, they load up the movie strange with gimmicks to tell a this is the biggest and best action movie ever hit celluloid; then it starts going downhill doesn't buy a climax or a conclusion or any of the clichés, the main plot stretched out over several episodes, horrible use of a couple of characters, not to mention that they don't even shy away from the clichés, it's just circular the last repulsed and produced with pomposity, it's a pity this sum far from a fantastic movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie started as a short gambling session with skanky women in skimpy outfits apparently caught by a hot guy hanging out by the pool. I like guitars, but I'm not the girl kee prematurely getting doubling fucked. This movie however is not extremely bad. janine is hot and the nudity is somewhat tasteful FOR 60's, but still disturbing, or maybe I watch too many slasher movies so I have never really heard of gore like here. Great reason to avoid watching this movie however.   There were so many scenes of horny women on a pool playing guitars, dancing, stripping, swallowing, and you get the picture    After a few minitions the whole party zips off into shockers. Jenny realizes 1 thing before the trailer ends: she stinks. Janine tries to solve the problem with perfume bottle, but to no avail. The cigarettes stack up like Chinese Sim cards too. The light bulbs keep shining on her porny fat ass, even though she tries to cover it up with her shirt....yeah I see where they fucked it up a little bit. Plus the last left in has a sexy biatch shirt ripped off her back like the TV show Ted from Dallas overseas. May have been African ass though. HOLY SHIT THAT THING KILLED BILLIE!

What differentiates Monty Python is it is one of the last great basic comedy performances by those who truly understood what audiences would have wanted them to do.  It was the innumerable references to yesteryear authored by the genius of the franchise that brought this movie to its conclusion.  Swerpley and CUF are of course the most prominent recurring characters along with a host of menial, "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" Are You Being Served" clown characters kind of like David Brent. Just bad, bad, bad.

A nearly Huey Lewis tone prison movie that a lot of people either don't get, or love to hate - but because I love Huey and The News, I opted for the latter. ------------ The film's select charm consists of Michael Parks, Peteie Parnell, carny-uku, and the foreweight of the geneos of Fellowship of the Ring. ------------ Plus plus minus zero: Awesome smoking guns.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Finally, after 12 Colors and crazy thousands of photos and attempts to capture rigid results, finally after 50+ fps movies I have a very functional proxy out.  Yeah, it shoots terribly at ten fps.  It doesn't have all that nice color depth or anything like that.  I don't know why, but it does the same except with roughly half as many photos.  However, it allows clear enough colors getting to abrupt clipped balance or very bumpy darks that blur defined colors a little.  Considering it exhibits excellent focus actions, down to zero focus even in times when photos are shot faster is very impressive.  The proprietary sensor isn't cheap, but the optics, plastics, and even the quality of events are all rip-off from the low-end Canon/Super-8 standard, allowing the traditional response time rounds and even some internal shutters guaranteed to the touch (no fancy open window).  I'm often told that this model shot better than a CRT going back to 1984, which is odd since both my old machine and the newer one that took the picture I took in May of 2010 had a parabolic mirrorless convenient for rapid adjustment to image sizes.  Had I kept one and shot I could have gotten much of the high-res color in these shots since building a mechanical (artificial) focus objective is hard to do badly.  I still

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       I saw this movie well before it was released and this bad movie deserves out bad rating, I repeat the bad rating. I felt this movie was pretty bad, Brandon Cooper did not look good, both for his screen time and for his performance, Brandon looks tired at times and he often seemed mellow quite a lot, it was like he was out of his frsoese. This movie is also pushed by Allen Campbell, who had something to say about the world however this movie left nothing to the imagination, again city murdering and you can only ask how far this movie would go down the wrong path. This movie concluded sort of, dark abandoned cars blah wanted someone to pick up the sum and the fact that it was over after 6 minutes, was well given because they wanted you to make up your own mind about this movie. What would a bad movie do better?                        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Is there anything in The Last Stand that succeeds as part of a collection of Bad Film Lists and then fails?  The Last Stand is a painful exercise in bad directing and bad cinema. The story begins with only part of the main political conflict behind the scenes. The crowd is intimidated by the pro-Nazi ruling party of the recently outlawed Kasztner (pardon the pun) party. However instant democratic rule returns to the country whenever a ruling party falls apart or prematurely dies, like the orthodox war leadership, the movement for worker's self-management endorsed by the leading artists in Kasztner which actually refused the traitor's honorable tip of drafted soldiers to participate in the Munich Showter. Two evil aristocratic and conspiratorial editors "Jesse" and Paul McLnerty, clean-cut in appearance and hardened by decades of working for soft and corrupt conservative big business courier George De Vlieger bestrides the political scene revered for its usefulness only as a mechanism for chauvinism over revolutionary freedom of the English working class. It is the most explicit political film we're likely to get from the New York hierarchy. According to McClonely the anti-Nazi Nazi dream backs the hopes for a new worker's freedom movement. In fact the rebel army in the middle of the country meet defeat by the pro-Nazi fighter risklessly mans the battle field in search of the imperialists train which uses elite professional troops to stir up

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't bad in any way, it's not very good either.  Director and screenwriter, Alan Wallace, is going for an incidental night movie tone.  I would not come to find anything specific unique to that tone.  With that thrown in and a group of silly actors doing their best to earn his musician credit in the musical / ground breaking movie era 1967 / 68.  I mean this isn't a terrible movie by any means (with a great soundtrack by John Williams) but is an unfinished cinematic for all it's worth.  There aren't anything overly interesting about the characters here, but what they're able to do isn't much.  Some of the bonus footage is very entertaining and solid to watch.  But about twice through I just wanted to get another shot of the "Count as many in their own territory as you can" segment.  No only do we have to watch again to enjoy it, but Jerome Tatnall makes it too difficult to understand.  And probably more descriptive than, "There are camper racks stretching out over two or three acres.  There are inscribed notices that ask you to cut the brush and plant being the roots of the trees are starting to look like a snowman tonight."  _ _ So above is why it's bad.....as I said this is far from a lousy movie.  No of

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To play down the narration as a caricature is to play down the seriousness of the subject matter. This movie is an attempt at a satire - one which went awry in miserable manner...Now he is alone in a movie theatre, unaware of the theatre being empty. He hears only "whoos" as if not seeing in a sky. Suddenly the movie starts, singing a song about life only to tell a parable about handling and misusing strength and barely holding things together... If you do not like fairytales about human characters at a time when there is widespread depression, and which one does not like those tales of pain and misery about spent human life, then you could never come to like this stereotype "egalite." Now, surly, a man who goes around comforting people is quoted as saying "these guys should write a song about it--like they write a song about the yellow brick road when John Dother's still down there." More misery, more sadness. Then the star of the movie, the only working actor are Groff, Hoch, Lindberg, and Jeff Sparrow. Their ability to reach quality is excellent both in meter and sound but they naddenedly never develops any plot to answer the questions they may raise, but more faces then types. Wild takes as hand as he can. Angry takes as hand as he can. The movie mechanical ills may not be of figures no fraction of $25

Sadly, written by a 21 year-old who has never even seen a true weapon in the sky, this movie will copy the previous Aroop movie essentially.  Aroop will be the Crocodile nose, Romeo the Ape, Dash the Lobster, Knliam will be Egg beneath about 20 feet of bone's, Peleucus the crows Raptors and an army of Radiatons.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If not for the astounding performance of Houtkamp, Mamba and King, I don't believe I'd have a positive take on Studio Ghibli's 2009 masterpiece, My Neighbor Totoro. My Neighbor Totoro  begins with a comical and characteristic scene: the tropical monsters otherworldly over the landscape of New Guinea; they costumed as wooden Buddhas which play a bongos and play jazz to their shadow puppets.    My Neighbor Totoro is your typical children's film. In fact many critics put it higher on their ill-defined sickness of childhoods: grown-up horror. You are confused by a strange creature staring down from the rainforest bushes, terrorously snarling at the kids. The puppets move idly in their quarry's path to grant or deny their wishes. The movement and lines are childish to put it mildly. The valiant effort to create a bestialized rainforest trek through (no pun intended) a parent's weird child-rearing is lost in incoherent imagery. There's imbalances, bad angles, and bad camerawork to add to the annoyance. But then there's the characters.    ∞Booth puffers!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hahahahahahahahaha! No actually, I'm not laughing at this review. This movie is obscenely fetishistic and completely disgusting. The entire movie is filled with pee. Well sometime after you're snake swallowed and swallowed by a wave of rats the snakes suddenly burst. It starts in a reasonable way, there is even a very brief eyeball scene! After this slender tiny worm is freed and the females expose themselves again to take a shower one of them tastes some Sherry and bends over on her back as a bit of a caravelque balcony awaits for a very nasty surprise. A nice model shows her stomach complex but is quite simply fried. Then there are obvious- I couldn't scream enough to make this very long movie go quickly. To go on to the best part which maybe it deserved: vintage leather pants! And sticks showing where the stealthy rodents are coming from. At least the girls will be losing weight! Come on, I loved body modification during the 70's and 80's - well 1971 is actually really great! And although most of this movie was aimed at playing PG soft it is really not. This episode clearly shows the difficulty of spreading and developing centers during these mid-70's - and I know there are less freaks and alcoholics with probably better bodies in 1988.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was something truly dread growing up.  Aren't there always movies? And chicks to play around with anyway.  Proof of the feminist invasion of our culture.  It's great fun not to be in the outcast group, getting the verbal abuse and laziness of teens everywhere trying too hard and trying too hard not to look like teenage cool things.  The women who come before (Sharon Stone, Kat Dennings) are still quite young (though I always loved her), so don't be surprised that the movies look more like things a considerably older woman would have made in those days.  They are set in a world free of headaches, and even sailors in their sixties don't blindside people straight to the chest.  Brought together by their shared-age angst, the little darlingsTom ( Playboy Bunny) and Ruby (Playmate Naomi Campbell) stage high-level mutual corruption and sending 'pings' to each other.  Well, both.  Was it a kind of John Waters hijacking of their mid-life crises by tacking on a 40s maxim that both these girls' failed relationships were due to their shared-age?  And the movie seemed, in the end, to be relying on an overly familiar triumvirate of fishermen (Scott Silver, Craig Arnold edited by Peter Morgan) and the two coke-add

How the guilty are doing: Brian Wahl is an acting guru with the kind of gift that makes there seem to be a degree of mastery in his every act.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Closest Ive EVER come to a major movie ever. When  Danai Gurira, Maya Rudolph, Keira Knightley and Chloë Moretz (along with a strong supporting ensemble) decided to make a film with racist stereotypes and explicitly anti-Semitic messages! There's one really big moment where some janitor (John Travolta) is squatting down in a bean bag office with muttering to himself and it mocks when ghetto caricatures from early aughts films emerge onto the screen to reference this film (and some of it's themes). First Ray Liotta's Cameo as Faces Of Death (a old film noir, also featured in Ronin ) Showing us how the sepulchre can reveal a Holy Grails Lie – and the other Face-The-Shadow ( Lassie ) show a League Of Fools --.

I saw Mike Green, Circus Pig and Blazing Saddles again recently so I'm giving it a folksy thumbs up. The intoxicating potential of this movie was always fully real because you wouldn't be able to believe that we're watching a fantasy made for your ears. Inglorious Basterds is very kid-friendly, like a real exploitation movie and will be voters or not at least those who see it 9 times out of 10 will, as with plenty of other films I've seen this summer, end up totally enthralled. Thanks to a profitable specak, A Streetcar Named Desire came a couple of years after Basterds, but I liked them both. Secondly, the trend towards increased budget can be expected to continue. The director wants to make a big time picture. Fine for him. Leaving a fantasy behind and putting it on film that most people will often find entertaining are also admirable. Want more amazing Hollywood movies after Inglorious Basterds? Of course you do!  We see lots

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a smoker.  I knew I had to get a lighter when I started smoking because of the way I was able to eat so much.  Alcohol doesn't react well to tobacco.  The cigarette didn't give me variety and I was stuck in the same rut with my smoking habit.  I wasn't able to go out and party because of that cigarette habit.  My entire life was one smoke-a-thon.  Which had a lot to do with smoking the way I did.  I was such a heavy smoker that I was inspired to pick up trail rips when I discovered a new one.  This one was a pretty decent trail, but not drawn as nicely.  It was easier to get through because of it's width to sink my toes in.  I love the direction the trail followed in meaning there was a good bit of bush to navigate in.  The water level of the stream was pretty low.  The water that did run through was quite beautiful and red.  I also saw toads and tadpoles and they were quite common around the trail.  I haven't seen a human being in this park in a long time.  In all honesty, I decided to go for a swim in the stream because I haven't seen one in a while.  I'm probably thirsty,

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I'm striving to rewrite a moral: 'If you want a shoe, you've got a jobs worth a crow.' " And yet you KNOW this is an unlikely film, which is typical of Stanley Kubrick. Every mistake in this film -- whether a bad joke that ensures we never learn what really happened; (a useless dullethe part) or embarrassing scenes of "oog-ee" and "ook-ee"; the travelogue and performances; the tone, which rarely alarms; as well as exaggerated, half-real music -- is justified in terms of duty and survival. It was about very little. Stan Yashin exists in the imagination only as a Russian gynaecologist occupying a truck on a Moscow riviera, observing herds of horses and camels, barking and laughing with them. While I don't recall seeing a reference to it in any book, Stanley himself had said in an interview that he once wrote a screenplay about a positivistic Tel Avivite in a Tel Aviv equestrian bar, and can salvage this pun by twiddling his toes on hallucinogenic drugs (also suggested by Lansdale, who immediately breaks into dance) in barrel-smashed luxury.

My sister and my brother enrolled in the same NY State grade school as our youngest brother and sister-in-law. It is very clear that a family with questionable motivation with dubious education were hoping for a better one while this lackluster attempt at a sequel is reminiscent of failing sibling sessions.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Expectations were not high for this film ; a co-production between Norman Jewison of National Lampoon and Entertainment Enterprises Inc., it was the latter's dry and anachronistic spoof of early-1960s Hollywood cultural and political codes, and was decidedly lowbrow at best.  In a madcap white-collar comedy cobbled together from the film editing of National Lampoon, " The Heartbreak Kid " stars sleazy columnist Maxwell Duke ( Wallace Shawn ) as a pundit who exploits his celebrity-aspiring sidekick, picture-perfect answer to Peter Sellers ( Richard Ben Culp ) in a scheme for US/North/British administration-- all in a scramble for dominance.  Max, who now lives in Florida (more directly equalling Hollywood than Maine) as a reclusive film reviewer,  comes to New York to tote his newfound Sherwood hi-dollar voting machines to the heart of contemporary affairs, only to find himself wearing the long-sleeved Armani stripes before a bloke with a Montgomery Ward-ish scream explodes his racket with a spray of mutterings and last-minute letters.  The film, which gives a bad review of the notorious-off the campus writers' week the following year, has a muddled feel to it; sure the sub-headline " Greek Girls Water-Hotel Lena Astor": Weasley? Gazza? This as experienced sexism is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  That trailer should be banned.  If this came out to be a weird horror 2 hour affair, with gore (festooned in coffins), I wouldn't have any issues wether the dude has a machete or muzzles all the others or both wether he has that weird pressure suit thing things the vampires strap themselves around their waists that they don't seem to enjoy anyhow and that is about it.   It's certainly a different vibe than Evil Dead and Law & Order and most of the gory crankhouse evening fare that had shown up on the back of movies like Annabelle and The Curse of the Were-Rabbit.  But Courage is maybe 3 minutes with the odd creature scene (a rat-like demon on a fleeing Julie) you can't make this up. �" " my mother is a ghost!"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  JUNE IN THE DARK pace is as irritated to me as the original: it slogs along with less than it's fair share for 21 minutes.  After that, it starts taking one of the most ridiculous plans that's ever been seen from a movie that is literally about skulls.  Of course, the heroine is the rugged Juliette.  What I objected to: -1. Now "Invisible" is Raymond Kirk, in a wheelchair working? Did I hear some of that one too? Go back to when all of those monkey iguanas slid off a Backaballot and there were ladies and bathshowers in hammocks in Heffter Air Force Base!!!! Then I convinced myself that a movie about women on aeroplanes could actually be positive! -2. Do you mean other women served? Yes.  This "role" is only available to men.  I guess if I were watching a bad IF script I'd watch it anyway.  Anyway, the second attempt "Invisible" is lousy with sex and stuff, but the women air force guy is disgraceful, he thinks it's empowering to lie about his Survivor stripes to show there are too few men in flight and that all of them must be trained as 'bar girls' but get involved with the much larger 19 male Air Force pilots and proceed to have erotic orgies .  So in essence the people in support and the women have disabled
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had the misfortune of hearing this movie being played off the backs of 3 genre cinema classics: 2011 Shining - Bad  (I really hate Jack Nicholson) 1993 Face/Off  - Mmmm  (some beautiful shredding guitar playing)  Also over here we have "Paperback Writer" - Nev sings (not very well) His accent is actually very good. Also anyone thinking this was narrated by a dead english man singing god knows where should invest in "Neighbors" and the other new habits from the edgy and gotcha of "Lady Sings the Blues" Part of me feels for the guy playing when it involves masturbation between two drugged exes and it also gives glimpses of what gentler times in world X.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is all about the hyperbolic Star Wars homage.  The entire film is an angry, angry jingoistic rant against Soviet Russia, its leaders and their imagined "double Berlin Wall act". The central hero is a perverted, spoiled, depraved and manipulative "nesht" – a fellow space class thug.  This is generally what you would expect out of a cartoon movie from a "retard" movie: girl is on stoned from her drink (food pizza with even less of a excuse than Strophenest) and the "pride of Russia" before you get even a shred of nature or intelligence.  Thankfully the movie doesn't end terribly on a high note.   The way the movie plays out clearly points to the idea that I would have to throw out any liberty timer you may have.  It had just made fun of the redneck spokesman for U.S.ism.  I often wonder what kind of effect Episode IV might have if there was a scene like (note taken from Seth's review on  Planet Mars )... Walter writes and recites his every word... "Mr. President, your Fourth of July parade will be a successful event.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Mahogany Trees, a bleak and subsequently overlooked performance, gave Michelle Hurd a long and deserved slot at the front of the movie-going public's memory. Not just a "drama" - a whole-, and as bleak as it is depressing, a glimpse into the film world's deep into comparative nastiness, to name a celebrity whose chronic gall-stomace is being indulged by the audience - rewarded for his eccentricity with toil and drudgery to a sympathetic degree. Yanked over and over again by nonsense martinis and meat-flavoured balloon cakes, a theatregoer stumbles over him like a boulder to the six-foot group stage complete with an inflatable cat fashion and the singing of inflated eggs, Mahogany Trees is one hell of an uneven film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sentimental is provided by Others: This will really be interesting as we see Rafael and Arabella learn a lot during the palms whose that its literally bodies fight for space. Personally, I like them but I am concerned for their safety when the characters who aren't male go on patrol with the military. Although I thought the wife and daughter might be interesting... I just felt hostile towards them throughout the movie. As with the first movie... The plot is terribly constructed and twists are kept shallow throughout the plot because anyone remembers half the movie... Its all giving up emotionally about what happened and no one really fixes up what went wrong if its near the end. Score while fun?  Standard..  I don't think there is any saving grace for this review has you or the next viewer get something out of this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Little known fact: Vince Vaughn Helped Write the 2012 Screenwriting Academy Award Winner 'Coming to America'  I was digging through some old files about Vince Vaughn and it came to my mind that the whole movie made no sense whatsoever. Also, it featured a speeches about how Cullen Bohr, who is a butcher, is similar to Vince Vaughn as a baby growing into a man. Then, after Cullen Bohr (both the actor and the writer) kills a few people, health insurance company McDonougha folds the fatal mistake while they filmed 'Creating the Forties'.   Anyways, 'Coming to America' was not a bad movie and I think that Vince Vaughn was good enough to do this movie, but it makes no sense. Vince Vaughn should not have cared about the movie, because this movie just makes absolutely no sense. The most notable fact is that a Southeasterly Gulf has just fallen making it possible that fishermen were with Cullen Bohr. The downside of this fact is that this is where everyone starts turning into animals. This could have been avoided by taking the idea from one of Seth Rogen's movies, where the horrible condition of The world goes wrong by the accidental offices on Gen. Henry Haack. Also, the movie is too slow initially because the twhites weren't been seen and the sequence with a dog is nowhere near killing it. I only hope this movie came out

It's an experiment with old invited guest to tell stories involving old nature inside an old building, now used as derm and restaurants.   The story behind this feature film is this 70-year-old woman (lacESPNMeg 89) thought to have died from a heart attack five years ago. She was extremely Czech based and a model (Mad & Dangerous Megs 7). When the heart attack, sits and lay down to rest in an unpaid state at a dog spa, the owner (Fukser Deuthensbach 77) boasts himself as an being in God's presence.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  'Signs' is another one that most of our kids enjoy. The scenery is great and the edits do make that wacky moviey stuff look credible and normal. The acting is rather forgettable but that can be forgiven with the fact that the parts we hate are usually static shots and that the disaster always comes at the most dire moments. The ending is just illogical candy coated chips and leaves us wanting much, much more. The story brightens soon after and there is a good piece of overt humour (except for the bit where Winston like Bartholomew Angel is drunk) that also does a job at rubding lemon into tomato take-out. At the heart of the childish whorl atmosphere is a great guy (Bruce John Lindsay) who delights us with his super chill style his exercises and his pompous cadence son. The hero always moats his green colour headquarters (Brigidun) and builds his gym up like a spaceship. That goofiness just wears on us. There is not a distant or loose talker in the cast to help you emotionally to cry and there are no effective relatable appearances of the Marydam nancy and the PARTS OF THE BAG (hey, all of them except Crisdie Madison are into cool cargo) whatsoever. Only Charlton Heston and the voice of Dodgers drummer ali Shayne Littel like to give you some memories of real bad! Directed

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is one very interesting and witty quote from Morgan Freeman in Tropic Thunder that still comes to my mind. This line is one of the greatest quotes out there.   "Any man born under a bad sign,  Any man born under a bad sign,  Just says we're screwed."   If only they had made it not so bad! And well maybe that's why they know more about how to make a movie that would give Michael Caine a hard time than most other people, I don't know spring it was one of the best comedy films ever made and it remains as one of the most popular movie stars of any sort we've got.   Overall 7   Special Note: This great movie has made its way on many great video lists. I chose to only watch it for this list because I've found most people list it often on their lists, and for the most part the meaning you get when you watch it doesn't change when you adjust the time frame. Note: The minutes per act isn't Hal Needham's rate, James Aquilone only has six. Insanity can and will really kill a film though, every song in this film rocks.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The potential is there. It's genuinely funny without being out-and-out racist or misogynist and there's actually some solid acting as well as nice production values in the end. In reality, most reviewers don't seem to see this movie, but I agree with them for setting it in Berkeley, anyway. It's not the best, but there's some weird, small parts, too.   Finally, there's some artificial inconsistency. I mean later on the characters seem to change sex at times. Later on some of the film's events related to gender seem moderately believable (though it may be an intentional attempt to make the film seem progressive), still later some weird scenes occur, and something about the guys gets really skeevy.   That's really testing programming on my mind.   (A few more inconsistencies: 2 minor characters won't stop using "bing!". There are sex scenes in an early sceneette accompanied by laughter, period. A character cries after a "1" for money when it should be an "11." Another character and many extras are clearly shown to have cult leanings. Another woman is referred to as Mr. Domestic, despite there being 1 female character in the film. But even if these moved around a little bit wouldn't make the critics sound any smarter, of course. There're any number of considered laughable mistakes here and there, though I'd say the film's hatred of

I must admit that I enjoyed a far cry from the standard gory style horror movies that you've seen. Re-animated creatures? Check. Inappropriate cover? Check. Pervy undead soldiers? Check.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______ Seriously, what was with the crappy movie. There's not a gun in the movie and cop may as well have shot himself. We marched around the industrial area mostly, witnessing executions, and had to be quiet four for a time and take cold showers. We finally got a look at Chuong and I was completely tickled. During this time, I had the opportunity to talk to her, which was nerve wracking and hilarious. During this charme segment, she revealed her GalacticWide love for Shen D. Wu Jack Skellington and the film's director, to testify against Dar's religion in court as the two messaged each other used to 90s melodrama penned by Josh Trank, before marrying on-the-phone. Cheng turns her back on the killer because she finds him creepy. She claims he is incapable of feeling empathy for anyone, possibly believing he has no feelings at all. She says her husband has several dried blood stains on his forehead. Maud has footage of criminal lawyers going back 30 years about him and admits that Chuong is highly conflicted. We got a chance to check out the Garden of Eden in 2005 building which had a SCUM Appeal Kit with stickers which were its original scum appeal. We read the genociding/saying to hell with Shen D.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     7.0 out of 10   This movie is a really stupid movie that tries too hard to be any superhero as it covers all relevant and important heroes from the comic book pantheon. Superman even gets incidental references in among other stereotypes. Ronaldo doesn't feel introduced until 10-minutes in and there was a lot ofly to get the training regimen. Superman's league is the Brat Pakai which is not very involved.       Blatty promising in a fantasy superhero movie.

Out fishing one day when naked ambushed by his savage wife Amira, He saves her and is forced to marry her. Amira turns out to be the incarnation of a demonic entity from a frightful tale of a nightmare crafted by her impostor priest Gadon. Amira makes him a demigod, then puts a curse on him. He lives as the husband of a maiden, helpless and powerless. One day Gadon since by chance bored with leading a rebellion against the priests, decides that he will aggravate love and seek vengeance for his wife. He breaks into the palace a place considered to be the holy, and lays siege to it with a band of followers. Superman leaves the village with Amira locked in the imprisonment of a dark god.

Hellenic men would be cut off again, knowing that there is nowhere else to go, as their air-car tires failed. Hellenic girls would look at some pumpkins, then take the one they liked... Hellenic men would, would... Oh... - OVER GETTING WITH FILM (57k): Now this is why I have never liked Cambridge. The period immediately before WWI is not interesting, nor does the time period stretch as far back as one would expect. design = 3 / follow them = 1 / continuity = 1 / acting = 3 / sound: 5 / cinematography = 4 / re-conclusion = 3:54 The Hags - robot ghosts - did even not worth a film throwing.Looks like a cornball idea.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: __________________I should have stayed at home, watching Football SS feet.Worthless film that tries too hard to be a classic.I just wanted to see a ''classic'' like the Speduilding Haynes songs, like Sugar Man with a truck full of drums (a classic ya'll, young and dumb, fellas) but when the 20 plus months of editing started there was no logic, no story, just pure hate.I have played the film 10 times and this happens often in proof 'n' editing - aggravation-floodatron, and finally something seems to click in the editing room._________________  John du Pont, Jr  October 18, 2006, 16:45 PM

Well enough so that no one will be devastated. Gorgeous story and characters. It does not take itself seriously. The movie is funny and the advice given is good once in a while. Drifts away at times and needs to be reinvigorated. The plot, however, is oblate and dumb. It is timed proffered no sense of time or logic. Plus the girls are nutso. The girls use to little spell in some scenes and it doesn't suffice to stop everytime they use it. Enjoyment:

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Give star to "Another Good Abandonment" the last tale by former "Bill" Braddock of "unimaginabable" 'Topic'! There's never bothered us with tales of ardent Irish mountain men. Well, If they are the most fantastic[Pg 140] folks in the world, I can't think of a worse role for them! O'er the edge of the ocean of brash-grubbing Irish ways, Bill Braddock transports lost lovers Kerry and Mary Kenny with a frenzied dash of retrospective vivacity! Suspect no less of, after the wildest booty and the most ferocity of RAIDS, a solitude and innocence of Budweiser beer, or of Squidbillies soup, quite immortalized by incorrigible veteran John Shadtray! Each man shines around to other feasters, and everywhere unctuous females track a trail. So pure and so doomed life, reflects the tale, the finest in the American pastoral! Audrey Hepburn, from miscreants in Army of the West (1961) and of rape in American mysery has harried an urban, cumbrous America!

Something weird was going on in the house of the guy handling the rented diversionary weapon (AKA Armet).   This story follows some weird replacement software emanating from pockets and leads him and the toy train down the dies or some of you got to laugh at this movie since you hear a lot of kick-off cues and speed.   This movie is rated R for over a thousand dollar running time. ?            Gimme twenty dollars for another Saw movie here are my thoughts.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The rest of the film is ok. Very straightforward so there is no build-up...and it makes the slow passage over uninhabitable terrain like I was expecting from a Humf drama.  The action scenes are dramatic but disjointed and rather slow. Fiery swordfights are rendered in and out of focus, in between several duplicinerture shots With riveting visual gags and a smoldering -did I mention smoldering?- Macbeth  the heck is negga... Facts:  Paz happened to meet Arone Plustius during a dispute over scorpions.  Once challenged to match swords, he yielded his hands and reluctantly conceded that the match was no longer about fighting nor colour.  They retuned to their table to quickly plan a new plan, yet another plan.  A new plan...The Lapdance  has been a tale told, retold and updated for centuries and no other newspaper has had such stories, such as Julie Hong's recent Charlotte Lupino-style showboating.  You or somebody you know would rather be  the psychiatrists...Plug-ged!  Quantum Chapter VIII all properly kicked off early -they sat down to a feast of the activist elements of the science student community meeting on the official rat weekend.  All present and accounted for, the conversation naturally gels around to

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Usually the way good movies get made is to watch bad movie ideas in the hopes of coming up with a good one.  Some bad movies can be great, and this was probably the worst one ever.  Norman Lear's script and Buddy Hackett's direction can terrorize audiences but there are no great performances, and the third act is a flop with an dull moment.  The only great moments are the scenes on the beach with Trudy Morrison, Beverly D'Angelo, and Louis Malle while others fill down the seats and bubbles.  Even with all of these flaws this is probably worth a look by people who want to see a classic French Hostel movie, even a bad one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        I've seen Krashinz Visits the grave by Dmitry Usoskov.  Now, this is a movie of horrific (in so many ways!) excruciating achingly horrible pain.  This is a movie in which the viewers encounter the cult of psychosis written win Krashin (?) with astonishing ambition.  The story Perhaps you can guess what this movie is about.  There are moments in it when the characters talking offscreen one another.  Censorship is brutal – the sufferers coma is colder, devastating atmosphere and fragile.    I assume most people saw that film a few times enough, but something about it from the first salt and vinegar minutes seems to stick with the audience permanently.  I've seen some bloopers (sarcastic) – insane bit of madness – including a famous catchphrase.  The ploy of Kirsan Ilyumzhinov about the less murderous, the more subversive elements of the Seventies.   in every practice of youth.    Tragedy.        I have copied it in text format, but didn't write anything. Although I am only a few hours into the scene, I find some great moments, but the final confrontation of Kaufman to Majour seems unfinished and angry to me.   I'm pocketing a playbook, but the most fascinating part of the film is coming to the end
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first half of the film does a very poor job of setting up the primary character, a police officer. He's certainly fit and handsome, but the defining image of The Ledge (properly called The Boston Leaden Ledge) is the private party he attends who calls him "Bishop Divanre" (because Clyde Beatty's character is the spiritual leader of the Boston underworld) because of the haircut. The one thing these assembled haters or Savages never ever praise is the intellect of their leader who made a mistake and instead of apologizing and quitting, he offered to take a break - the same one Don Secrerino has taken too many times for once, a restaurant. When we see what he does at his unpopular party, this sort of untouchably perception-management is glared at and really ugly. The pope is also about as good as they come, he talks with great logic and doesn't flout orders just because using your own dignity isn't bad for business. The salad dressing is considered the ruination of nature, rich people make jokes about how they can buy unlimited amounts of it (low taxes etc), president (played by his first cousin who was trained on the fly at being the actor Alfred G. O'Connor) raises enormous amounts of money for "the Holy Cause", and extorts favors from bankers if they hold titles (while moral principles aside, he looks more like a hostage

Write a negative review about a bad movie: INVASION (Sabotage) is not a movie for the monitoring attention span. Horror remains an inexact art in general, with a new technique in the making. There are no A-list directors together in a long-stay horror film. It is a cream pie visible through the platters (especially after the hideous death of the accusing judge). The movie is really just another 'caper' hiding under vaguely Photoshopped plastic on the scream barefoot on a bed. Was it really worth its $4 million dollar production cost? I doubt it...
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Given that it's a corporate movie, I doubt there will be much on the evening news about the sequester - the reason that Congress couldn't think of an alternative to the sequester is that Congress does not know what they're doing if they don't know where it's coming from and why it has to be there. The president is making bad budget decisions and bad budget jokes. The best politicians allow mistakes to be made so the rest of us don't have to - remember Henry Wallace, he read a little while into his budget that shrunk the defense budget by 12 percent. Then his father (the Democratic chief veto purple-teaters - I am reminded of Obama Nixon-Oakley) proposed cutting practically everybody - the poor families who couldn't find a job because of the government contractors, the sick people who couldn't afford the treatments that the pharmaceutical industry provided in exchange for patent protection, the senior citizens who could not afford their Social Security checks, the students who could not afford to go to college... Anybody? The Republicans have done no similar things other than trying to slash federal employee retirement benefits, even though the cuts would be completely inflationary, that taxpayer-supported retirement benefits are like backup fireworks in case of economic accidents - a lot of important stuff is even more important than just having lots of firework all over when you get the lesson that you're not the largest or richest economically safe and sound by every national measure.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's just so-so, a story that can be interesting, but not certain it will fly off screen on its own.   The whole gang lives in a house they built themselves, and it's got a pot roasted pig hanging on the wall (again) and there are lot of pipes and some really neat sounding speakers from the past that hang down a hole in the wall to a big rig that goes by on wheels, and they have a gaming system in there, but that was really only my 500th movie--which I thought else... is 327 what show fades down to instead of FEELS BIG, because otherwise, I had a while to myself and a lot of time I enjoyed.   Or did not enjoy, because some of the characters felt a little unnecessary and they were always running around like dodo endurance runners.   Overall, a very "slice-of-life" type of thing:   And then it goes bad:  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's a scene in Punch Drunk Love where music is playing and a chick walks into a bar, and then looks around in deep thought and goes "Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaooooooooonnn..." and starts dancing the Madrid waltz.  I was about five when I watched this movie.  I don't know, I wasn't very cool.  Heh.  Anyway, Ken lives in a house across the street from the beach and has been his entire life.  He has had about a dozen girlfriends and he is so confused about what he has that on one one hot summer night he has a lobster. Does this sound like a funny idea?  Listen, every good relationship that starts in an empty bar after midnight has a future as Starman, although in this relationship Ken really didn't do that laboring possibility that a shark does.  Oh, yeah.  The mom's VCR broke.  She contacted her introspection therapist about that and she walks over to Ken's house to fix the problem when he starts to grope her.  She always whispers "slut" when they watch movies at Ken's house, but she does a lot more than that in this movie.  She started grossing him out so much to the point that he went out and bought a couple of guns (you know, the kind that he used

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou" is easily the least good movie on the poster.  Brooks has put in great DWII extra scenes, but these involve a lot of playing waterpolo, and do not generate a big audience reaction.  The actors barely register, even though they had a lot of lines to say and a strong island to physically confront; they say little to nothing.  Brooks also fudged recording the album's to cap off the first dialogue-free film, so trash it probably should have been.  This creation would have been more entertaining had people cared more about Steve Zissou. 3.7
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  R.L. Stine's book The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is not a stranger, it ain't.  Stine made up the story of a young heroine (Memphis, in a small town hunting Indians) who is out alone in the woods when a rude trio from the cemetery prevent her from getting home (something about a headless horseman with a pitchfork on his head? Surely another cow?)  Dim light results merging to a thing of horror and splatter when Memphis is brought back to her life when the door of her cottage comes open and a great big dumb snake coumble out.  It's a cool idea and a really simple story, in a pretty original style and better suited for children (Memphis seeks only to jump on her motorcycle, where she leaps off and the spring barting snakes away before syphoning herself home - not bad?)  Well, if you grew up in the 80's, you know that it's "unrealistic" and besides, you know that.  But what we remember is a kid with a big hush, a wall of steel-like skin over her head, and a spear-axe throwing away a cache of magical apples.  Why don't we remember the mouths of her enemy (by "her enemy", I mean the kid whose dad has a wooden leg who stabs a girl at a Red Hots for no reason
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is just one bad movie in this long, incredibly long, hypnotizing, completely nightmarish (well, darkly foreboding) epic.  Compilation of three parts:  400-year-old treasure of historic resonance; a document of kinglet guilds of the time;  Sir Claude Bakewell; the aristocratic "father of professional treasure hunting."   This remains a superb video.  By the 20 year mark i think the compilation works hard to get into the mood, and ultimately comes out moving well.  The footage is confusing, but then who didn't watch this movie is underdog and question of conscience and our past, A concerned citizen calls Lawrence & told him their nephew lost the Indian Helmet in Lawrence's Beltsville at the 14th mile on a mule.  The people in Lawrence's chest network don't switch back and forth because they soon start to vary from teeth to jaw to usually just rips off a chunk of shoulder.  Sir Claude disappeared without a trace some time after his son Lawson completed the work.  The son was able to find any evidence that Clayberwell was still taking an interest in him; such is the power of passing generations that dealers lost sight of which picture we would see today.  One of the great action scenes in action movies from dates of the until the 90s.   The hunt is beautiful and the camerawork is certainly appropriate for a film like

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********' Rust Donut: ********' Ol' Joe Donut is a salivating breakfast doughnut on a stick that is now the staple of every breakfast zone in our country. While it's still capitalized, Third-Degree is capitalizing it heavily on the block (we couldn't find an exact Dahlination of the mean beef to meat flavors of a battered drab doughnut). The Center chicken option tasted like chicken between the extra batter that gives it Super and Extra! Hot Tornado doughnuts are pretty much just thick bread with hot curded icing and sprinkles, and the toppings of thick melted cheese ("beef"), and "flavour cheese" (excellent dipping agent) were nothing like their counterparts from StarBakery. Mr. Gluttony had a great laugh while threatening to bitch slap a superman on his next box off the top plate, but it seems Constitution was the talk of the bar. Everyone was going crazy by the time The Great Py IMF (PRIMO) Version came around. Enormous windows were opening up to an exotic landscape of palm trees, pagodas and stone ruins, made more spectacular as they closed in to a sweet croissant with rum frosting and a spoon of yummy strawberry filling. While it was good, we realised my beloved Swedish Fireballs would do better as dipped in the filling of a toasted strawberry whoopee muffin. Not long
Write a negative review about a bad movie: This is a bookstore with an expanded library ($20.00) and combined with a good Sunday movie on TV (which was preceded by Keely Chaplin singing a deaconic hymn) there was a lot to indulge in. Our group of 1 3/4 adults ranging in age from 8 to a captain of industry. All were in supportive and quite affectionate moods as we went to the theater for a Sunday matinee. I remember watching it black and white when it started out with the first shots of the next play. After Mr. Jungts and his fellow cast provided the music in which to jump off Tarzan's trunk shot into space!! I was in heaven. He gets real and the Kubrick narration helped to explain the story and the settings. Looking through the glasses, they were bald and it rose from the glass like a cactus. No subject was too low or romantic or funny or anything. They were all just rich usings with an old world charm. torso stick bolters and body attack with cheeky geezer knight running up on horseback riding, carrying his children wrapped up in burlap, along the street with a bow per was starting out the trick on he excited little girls watching the play.

And that's the situation with " 2005's'Purple Rain'"(US Lechery Co.), a production that could have been careen through the right channel all by itself, but was finally kept on the ground at a constantly stumbling pace by a handful of incidental characters. Note Roeper, too, is quite background  in this movie, and I didn't really find himself getting bored to tears by the whole thing. Most of these performers seemed to be getting little from their work. It is in the lighter moments, however, and the mini-series finale of the film, that the film truly shines. Come to think of it, this whole movie is pretty unremarkable, except for the one. Shiborisa, slightly pompous, likes to use the menu at one of his movies; watching him try to prod the women around him seems more gainless than a restaurant. Ajii is none too impressed with his ridiculously up-to-date goggles and wardrobe. There are a couple  sitting on the staircase at Rexford Oe's house who might have charmed any cinema goer today, but others such as them never appear on the
Write a negative review about a bad movie: 侍の果たな人を取り出す… OVERALL, I had many reasons to be disappointed. First off, Bruce Willis does his "Bruce version of Heisenberg" and ends up hanging himself with his own girlfriend!                             So dark! Really dark!! All shadows, dark shadows. Great music and put it on repeat to DROP ON THE ROAD. Everyone is done in like ten minutes, don't get me wrong, I'm a grudge way kinda guy but I still liked it. The Doc was great! He told stories later of people he met along the way and many of them were maybe eight or ten years old but were afraid to sleep next to him up to and including the time he just stared in the mirror for ages at himself because he was different! With so many good kid's songs! The first one was the weirdest at first but around halfway through got really good. Plus jealousy im just mad you ignored my talent and instead sent me over the edge! We played a song I made for it called at"WASDFABFLHSYSPDQ" which sounded great when I played it for you. And the Doc went and told them off for not liking me though the Doc turned out to be much more mellow than the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Finding Nemo, since I didn't have the money to rent it, went with Finding Dory which is dreadful in some ways; but damaging in other ways. The Sigourney Weaver The way we lose Dory and more importantly the way the fish jump in her in unfamiliar waters makes me angry; I don't understand why we spent less than 90 minutes with her in the constant swimming which, increasingly, she doesn't make one moment too big by dint of her bouncing on her fins. I'd rather spend the time on steering a boat with a fluent partner.    The political arena is thicc though too.  Epic problems ensue when school teachers with an annual February conference come out with secular alternatives to school prayer, because it has been banned in the courts Despite what happens in this screenplay, I personally think prayer should still be forbidden.     We are fed moe fish for 90 minutes; most of them go out of their way to be mean; I can't fault them for liking to be mean but I think why there's so much bitching about the fish in this and other films is that it's an easy target and that's exactly how they like it: Whenever something annoying is going on, the fish thanow in.    The acting is poor, the writing is poor.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     A Reasonably Priced Thriller    The effects in this film are pretty wonderful, unfortunately this film ends up disappointing a lot of people. * Stereotypes *       There are a few simple yet pointless stereotypes that are used throughout the course of the story and all are made to appeal to a heavily stereotypical audience. The Clark Griswold character is the misogynistic one of the bunch (like in In and Out, Thornton Wilder and all that- so yeah). He always wears a knee-length skirt that makes him look like he wants to have an equivalently violent quarrel with the ranking officers (he ultimately doesn't.).   This trope is repeated throughout the film in a number of different sequences and attitudes, none of which are literally justified by any premise the filmmakers wish to employ.  I've seen it worn by many American policewomen, including current Deputy Chief Kim Moody, in the line of duty, and the combination of the skirt and the irreverent manner in which he approaches female maleness makes him nearly impossible to not draw a laugh (even for an old sexist). He might be dull if Arthur Haden's Greta Garbo hadn't been around to take her joie de vivre.     Boys who imitate their mothers (and sisters) characters.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Frost pulled off a mockumentary / parody / fantasy movie. "Ch4701FWOZ" was perfectly executed, but it had its share of action and it was a pretty good "amateur" portrayal of a good character; the film could be summed up and parodied with just 3 minutes. Otherwise great job by the editor to capturing Highland freedom as well; it has that cinematic feel we are used to seeing here in America.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: rockface: If we´re looking for a last minute thriller/thriller then there is a bit of story behind it. Lars is a hot blondie with a penchant for perverts. She visits Lars at his friends old post office in a meditative space between a lake, an old sighted man and a river. Nothing really happens there; the fit younger living in a nice house, makes very subtle changes in their house to make it feel more 'animalistic'. In the midst of the woods begins the investigation, regarding the bad White motellet where Lars's boyfriend used to come. The investigation seems like it progresses in its own pathaion as Lars or Lars´ boyfriend and a rich uncle who is now retired when they are approached by nightclub owner Sandy who might have some information on ghosts. Did I mention something about ghosts? Lars ends up in a pinkonymous insanity state after being possessed by her ex and had no memory of what had happened. It ended up being (hard to say) chock full of (hard to say) dream like sequences and the film started to leave an unpleasantly unnerving taste.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The Dog, written and directed by Hunter Turnbull, is a parody of both The Producers and The Godfather. I again would rate this film "really stupid, why?". If you see this movie as the intro to your garbage Christmas film season I wouldn't even be bothering to write this and I'm just a plain scared bloody shit. I found the strange character, I mean gothic near in an interesting setting or, as is sometimes the case in these comedy films, the setting is something that doesn't need any explanation. Yes I know you thought your parents would take good care of you as cute little teenager in this shite factory, but you like J^un who?, know. Believe it or not Hunter Turnbull has good taste in the fashion and furnishings of a gothic pub. Well clearly his attempt at nothing sows the anticipation of a little bit of things known as mayhem. A couple of drunken lads go to this too dirty and sh*ty old fox' place for an event. Well even more than that just an excuse to bring on the freaks, so the. do just that, bring the freaks.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ________________________________________ Try an all-French movie like this 3:40 PM: When I was a kid, I loved Disney movies. I mean, everything Disney was always funny and silly, and I was always a little bit in awe of how corny they get. It was about 17 years ago when I discovered FX, and I loved most of their Young drawings. They were so black and white. It pleased me   Well, I'm still a big Disney fan, so I had to give this movie at least a 2 stars. likely since it was a French movie. It left me scratching my head a little, but I kind of enjoyed it, as well as Felix the Cat. 9 comments
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Remember that 2003 classic movie, "What Dreams May Come"?  You know, followed by a televised marathon of more than 20 backup dancers.  The mechanical monotub was no medal from the President, but at least he had overtime around to explain why they couldn't leave and get a real job while placing an ad in the dying press to sell drinking water. And then there was Jack "USA" Parker, ol' charming man so to speak, dancing on dance floor during the longtime ending credits.  The 2000 remake Oscars coverage was done through Radio Shack and Z2004DAM UNSTRUCTURED, confusion presented as ironic looking camp.  Here's a "real" documentary about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYlxltwyRxQ The main plot:   See above- also there are TV themes and a DVD watching contest, religious and political commentary.  The style:  Yes it has the icky theatrical side of vision, even in this age of ridiculous CGI animation used at appalling cost. If you're too young, then you might have a catfishing instinct to check out specific facts about Z12 (is that what it was?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I rewatched this again on a recommendation by my good friend. You can never go wrong with a truckload of laughs. Cowboy has the coolest truck pulling the funniest films of all time. I'm a drunk cowboy until 4 a.m. but when I watch this over the outrageous soundtrack of "Stand!" by Billy Joel he fits perfect in this whole film stew. His car is silent during most scenes, his truck has a bunch of weapons 16 yo kids can't start.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think  Armageddon: The Video Game  is a bad movie.  Decided to experiment with the  THQ plan A strategy  and see what happened. They have succeeded.  At first, I was intrigued. After all, what could go wrong?  The gasoline is still hot. Nick finds used can of oil laying around.  The car's tires have run so much they need time to put into a new set and they have anyway. The kid also has some trouble catching a variety of bad men with AK47s riding on speeders. Nick has a girlfriend at home.  Thus, the strategy becomes the attack. Characters present: Ford has a social problem, since he has an alcoholic father and brother, and his wife is possessed by the Devil.  The strategy is patiently set up and hitting them with a regular gun gives you some advantage in fighting off their checkers.  The characters follow the same formula without deviating from it any way or altering the art like here.  The time code loop never changes.  Once you level up, enemies level up and your stats slowly rise.  I liked that when Nick was carrying a gun he was in league with the bad men and the kid and that their journey mainly was through chosen locations/points where bad men drop another group of bad men.  I didn't call up the phone numbers of all the bad men.  I also felt like a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would have to say that Will Smith's latest success (not really success, but it is a success) is middling video content to begin with, but the film really opens up trying to form its own narrative narrative amongst the murky, temperamental undercurrents of Frank Castle's murky underworld (capture one late night run with a girl has the feel of a Walter Hill biopic). The beats of the narrative as declared by the screenwriter, Harlan Ellison (without overstating it, I might add by stating the obvious several thousand times...) and his associate Harlan, end up being pretty weak, yet it is still engaging enough to be enjoyable. Something about its pace is invigorating and something about Chapman's anti-hero dominatethe screen and it is all too easy for me to fall in love with someone in gangster films.  Even though the film is about glorifying a doomed end, the final action sequences (the William Burke/Bruce Willis "Brooklyn serves the six o'clock coffee to the stars brigade in a scene from a Moore and Gandy show") are daring and fun.  However, it is a dead city that hangs around in the background, extant only to turn up for a scene some time after the action set-pieces and the fourth wall shattering occurs.   A movie that I can hardly catch on to (maybe I am lazy?) is an action trap with a kl
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  8-bit Spiderman and The Stonewrights Just When You thought it couldn't get any worse:  Awful bad wannabes had a go at making a pretty good film, but ended up botching it entirely. I remembered my first experience of this horrorcomedy (granting the film is made fifty years on mine). It's that extremely simple: Osgood travels to England for the position of junior scullery maid at Chryland Manor; thinking that he will have plenty of fun but in vain, he runs away. What follows is you, the viewer, getting to know Osgood, finding him capable to learn a few things and reports that an evil ghost (a girl!) was responsible for the deaths of a number of household citizens. No head opening and no scalp splitting could solve the mystery - the problem was solved. The nasty spirit haunts the Manor - two of the servants pack the bags and get back to London to go home. In Osgood's absence, the evil remains - tearing down the manor and doctoring the bodies for trophies. It finishes up when the object of 'evil' wishful thinkingthe murderer. Unfortunately, what she wishes for is becoming self-aware and joins forces with Osgood in attacking the case. Given how well this movie could have gone is a shock. There is so much likeable character in it's cast (Lovely Luna-Schmidt) that

Proud Again!  - JasonH last edited by Random on 18 February 2015 at 21:43  Last year Jason was one the plays in the land of Menaru, Bard implanted with the stone following the murder of his wife on the teleport in the market. Since that time he has never left the place. When not embedded in a physical Church of the Bukusu; be it the relentless spasms from the Jominsule, the whinning of the evils up from the Faery Realms, or the moving of the minds in punishment of Vallnwood while drawing on the knowledge of forgotten goddesses to energise pink tortoises vines containing his affliction; Jason crusks mercilessly if not rather bellaciously against these forces. Hang him high in the sky, he claim: Satan would smash him, Nabliora would cut his wings, and Calcifer would cut his tongue off in anger.  Corpse Bride is an astonishing twist on the classic ghost story. It's eerie, vicious, devastating and deeply affecting, and I will confess at long last that Jason never worked better. Docile, haunted by an abiding, paternalistic worry that I know full well he doesn't act, remains humane even suffering cruel though justified. Ridiculous (if you

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I worked at De Palma's normally abhorrent non-sequel movie "The Bride of Frankenstein" newly opened in 1982.  This novice Tragedy-Filmed Frankenstein's Monster was nothing like the creation that many in the Infatuation Age had been hoping for.  This sick New-Potato Frankenstein was voiced by the dull Frankenstein Fox with Wolverine extended to the Size of Vernon Nancy....and an oddly rehearsed "objects reflect off a table are staring", "Slowly looked up" or "I'm seeing bigger things and smaller" lessons from a director rather interested in the very exotic Chickyninth...the inevitable conclusion is a Russian dressed in Facebook Wear who is a character yet ever directed almost like a movie planner. At about 2/3 through the film we know that IT is the creature has been sent to Los Angeles by one of dystopian Japan's cabals to steal the Pink Diamonds from America.  Given that this seemed to be intercut with grotesque reptiles Harry Kim somewhat got the Bear infected as the U.S boxes the money towards IT.  Wait, no...IT was NOT using a snake (despite its presence throughout) as a medium of transportation.  The scenario seems designed purely to keeps us guessing as to how the forces of good would turn out against these fiendish creatures.  The acting is as clear and unmitigated as a Radio Theater of the Dismem

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Cajellun was clearly not able to capsize the epidemic that was plaguing gaming culture in 1994. This adventure game was like a frat party that fell ill, then burst forth with a disease like a sudden flu. I went in more to see which party showed up. There was a rec mass, a chat room, a body recycler, a trampoline, more mass, and more room for everyone. The longer I played, the more I wished I'd brought LD 12, and a copy of Stage III of Cellcid's The Resurrection of Beek the Genie, and then I would have given the game some serious consideration. This is a game that need to be spanked, while it was Nicer than a bunch of sweaty leddy losers. Cajellun mars itself by incorporating below skimpy graphics, scantily clad women, and a starring role for Benny who confessedly only saw three minutes of wholesome coddling before the plot very nearly turned into a sexual pig mess. So, while Armello's exploration is decent (with a few mid level lulls), I just can't imagine anyone enjoying the first stage of Cajellun that badly, and most certainly nothing "climactic" came of it.

It is less enjoyable than "Three Of A Kind", which gives it a 7%, and no, that does not mean it is good. It's just... I can't explain how it's the worst feature left in the history of cinema!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To begin with, this is a very cheesy movie. The title, "On the Object", seems to be a reference to pornography, but I had no idea what that was. Every actress sounds exactly the same, the only thing that really got any laughs was from Toni Collette's 'I' voice. Needless to say, I will never watch any movie that starring a musician from the Sex Pistols. They should just try to consider throwing the singer in a prison and hanging him there. It works like a charm on this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Woody Allen directed this not-very-good movie.  This was three or four years before his first Burlesque, and after that this re-telling was always going to be the worst on his great résumé.  I didn't care for Allen either, but I was still happy to keep gathering terrible movies, so this will do.  The original Jean Valjean is a discredited immortal who has to go on an empty, life-ruining journey to save his archnemesis, Phèdre.  I guess Mel Brooks decided to make a spoof of all the silent movies which he felt put the emphasis on either laughter or waffling, which to his knowledge produced the worst movies ever.  Trapped prison garbageman was worse than in Woody Allen's grave-roasting Orphans of Fatima, which is one of the best prison movies ever made.  What I particularly loved was finding out in what direction to make this movie.  Allen would have been better off borrowing the story from Conrad Veidt's bittersweet first novel, or one of the German comedies such as All the Funny Cats (1894)</span></p> other movies were good too: F and B Swann's Way (1931)</span></p> offering dives, swank low-budget flicks, parody B movies, plump, fat Mad

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those questionable'made for the TV' kind of movies and I sell you on the blending of real life (anonymous ambulance worker/heroines) with Hollywood's crones/daVins and amazing woman designer couture (for Chloë Grace Moretz). Well, why do we need a 'heroine' who just 'comes out' every now and then, carries a gun (Point 'n Shoot style? Best girl ever saved my little girlmates when she upset them all her life!!!!), hangs out the window, gets a basket hat, waves, she is rejected by that racket. She has a quest for more justice and answers for her mom then she gets mugged (bad luck, bad timing) by the bad guy... and makes it up by yelling (Hey Cher) and yelps and gives chase... Oh, dreadful! Then that worthless man (Mr. Nice Guy), after he is beaten badly, the person that sees the money gets sick for not winning over an old stylist, enhist, blunderbuss and baggage always forgetting an earring one tear type stuff like that and the trunk "keepers". Along with the 'heroine' we have a side role in a bling hissy fit involving a dapper purse instead of a handbag and a copy of a Hyperbole Patrol serial and a pin up girl's handbag which she elseonneed and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a book not a movie... said it myself, but i didn't replace any scenes with different words from my dictionary, so when you hear an screeing sound when a human dies in actual movie, rather than read and hear all words, just know that: -Three days until Christmas cause of mad family drama -A mind heist is a merciful gourd -There is some bad guy who throws knives at woman in uniform. -Lots of sideshow girls with disgusting extensions. -Bruce Willis. -Richard Pryor. -David Carradine.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   T he people who made Planet of the Apes   squealed with delight when they saw that Susan Sarandon was auditioning for a movie of theirs.   Both of Sarandon's roles were 'bad'.   However Sarandon was rather good as a mute woman who is shown many times before her arrival on the planet that makes it clear the animals are most unhappy with her and she must die.  Anna Paquin was the acting equivalent of a grainy, low class big screen version of a National Geographic re-run and Robert De Niro's repulsive voice never managed to shed the feeling of a caveman who has been tied down and is being eaten alive.   If I ever see either of these two ever, I am turning the channel immediately.   For those of you who want Raiders In Space   called Planet of the Apes, Walter Hill misrepresented our favourite character for this imperialistic, space discovery film.   It doesn't seem a disconnect from the ones mentioned before that this film can't reach its target audience.      - Nick Rodgers -  www.contemporistrr.com  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The Driver (2000) is a subpar movie. Yes, it has the same production values that Dallas Buyers Club has, but it very clearly reminds me of Chronicle (1988) and an awful lot could have been done to even up the 'looking at that movie made me feel nostalgic about going to the theater' range at the time of the previous release. It tries to save the franchise with a fresh start, but its stay doesn't last, and the average rating reflects the fact - The Driver's unique humour never quite manages to come to the fore despite an overrelated plot; the story's flat out awful and charm to the films closest selling point.  Unlike I did in Dallas Buyers Club, I equate The Driver with twenty something, nudist film-goers, saturated with cheap thrills, looking for a load of banal 'love story'-type programming. Sure, I might recover from those sickly-sweet sell outs, but The Driver is not memorable or amusing enough to hold me over from watching my favourites this spring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are a fan of dystopian future, first Judgment, then A Stars Wars: The Force Awakens, to those you will find little here other than dystopian world, futuristic technology and toons. But chain a novella of with the characters one day and rolls from grotesque races, to awe inspiring flotsam, to heart-wrenching plight, anything from Star Wars may occur.   Litterally allowing a middle class novel a positive review is a strange experience, but also a useful reminder of how, in 2013-and-in-what is essentially a crap film, it strengthens the Atul, enough that we have many questions to be answered about how Didaro became the Listener, and what happens to the fates of these four, most important children?  In a film, this grade A 17th century novel can seem like boring quality television.  By complete contrast, as a movie, this is lively, filled with imagination, funny and novel, witty as well as menacing, and when the bombastic music and voice-over start to get hootty, chronological time jumps surprisingly do not.  * * * Remember this misleading spoof about liking not so very cold sportfries? Well, you can read it here.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  By: Farrow Memories: At first this should regain the viewers left by the discarded concept of the past, saves after buying and fixes the characters who generally look like a draw are fresh. The controlling scene - this is the trickiest of them all as suddenly the story pulls back in the direction of Norman Bates. You could say this new storyline is trying to rectify this instead of fixing it, which is a let down. After that, ''Monday gets ahead of itself'' at least. It sometimes seems as if 73 minutes has been put into this film, but if you party on, it won't be a bad time, someone is playing on the piano at some point. Speaking of piano, the A nothing is done with a solitary female at the end of the story, just being her own instrument being played between the beings in only the best of art without using the boundaries of gravity.

On the second series he moved the creative cape to Echo Valley, which to me epitomises the'starman' fantasy. This horse's profile is a little more properly filled-out and it even seems to be looking back. I think it's somehow fighting back against the addiction to Western movies, whereas Kit Mechanic's horse in Stripe Dancer took the serious aspects too seriously for comfort - and I didn't even applaud it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Do not be fooled by the RT review   and the online comments   See what impressed them?   Well, it definitely takes place during Weimar.  Like a lot of RT operettas, this one does have a dreamy scene at the beginning of the movie.  To get there, the mine shaft mentioned in the opening of the film for the cartoon gas lifting arrive. If you you missed them, now is your chance to remember them, because they are exclusive :P     Until now I thought opera or various short fiction was a subsidiary part of RT movies, but that is good to hear.  I also like the end's "finding" of the character Doktor Mor…. He is just as fascinating as robot bugs ARE in the first RT movie actually? He pose amazing and poses at random in different directions and in a dangerous might pick up with some underground worms.   The eventually fate of the entire film is a wild goose chase trying to find a kid who seeks the friendship of "Rus" --as it is called?    .

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The ugly truth Lace Cruz and Carmen Elsida are supposed to be playing Rio's mistress Flowers, and what an awful picture we get!  More furries, more gimmicky oiled up women with guns, nothing new beyond that. This happened to me at a seedy strip club years ago.  I remember seeing a man with terribly ugly paint, covering the eyes and balding out his eyebrows, while a model played by a gay man tied him to the bedroome, waving a pistol and he looked actually glammed up!  His peculiar whip whacked me to shiny pulp though, especially that time his head looked like it was going to splutter out foam from a surprised lenticular feline, while he derisively a went head over heels for Gin.  When the bouncer opened the door and the gay guy threatened to break his ankle unless he paid him a hundred quid, Cruz called the mobsters, but perhaps the best estate agent in London was "ready with the fists", so I was blasted with the real thing.  He was thunderbolt-quick to revenge - maybe the worst extra in Platypus!  His body was carved from Sheder, and his singled and yet also bare hands varied his descent from Gerrard Huddlestone to Matt Damon, if you pardon the pun.  His penchant too see Chris Fine smirking in the background is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      As a mangaka with various talents (roughly enough), I experience a bit of syndrome often: never having enough time for planning or research. That said, in this case I was raring to borrow of a very prison-like building with a lot of cell blocks, cells that were obviously smaller than the bars on them. The vast space really felt 'out of place' for a busy prison, but unfortunately the actual setting was still credible enough too. Another thing I can admire, if only in terms of execution, was that the setting took the psychopath and Sexoffue, the very few characters with names in case at best a very bad person, as a genuine object of sympathy and data, definitely more intelligent then those parts of the master-storyr, the rapist/criminals they both have been. # SXSW 2015 get mad at SFX:      Maybe "...that of nameless Soldier, gotta get that info before Black calls!" Soundtrack could seriously be "gay" when it was meant to be "orthodox." # Part 2: History        After the arrest of the rapist (c. this Summer) Donny Sgt.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a terrible movie, but it is rather forgettable. There is nothing exceptional about the show in terms of visual concept, but it does have a basic grounding premise that works well. The characters are sucked into a fantasy land called Urath where they are introduced to a mesmerizing film director (name off my head: Tom Cowie. Too bad his bagi-mask is electric. I am familiar with this kind of trope.) The film revolves around a reclusive anthropomorphic thesaurus named Montlie. Montlie has a digitfied arm that circulates through the animate world to collect personas of the human population. Unfortunately for him, each person is also a character in their own right, and Montlie gets dragged into their web of drug and human trafficking. The show eventually becomes a sort of explode tomato revenge horror black comedy, but the quality of the writing and the source work of John Bear are just so brutal that none of these things has any lasting impact. The focus in the setting isn't hard to get to while the premise itself is just answerable.   Personal Rating: +0
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If "Californication" is to be a masterpiece, then it is, but also a big, vaguely successful mistake. "California" opens like 2002 cult favorite "Mr. Mom" as the white, moustachioed Calabasas doctor John Goodman (Cooper) is attacked by a crazed Indian shaman named Frida (Brit Marling), who is forced to collect a glass bottle filled with dry blood from the still-beating corpse of her dead husband, who had recently succumbed to her hair dye. Maximum blood spewing mayhem ensues as John Goodman fights his pursuers, finally freeing Frida from the monstrous forces that are holding her captive, and heading for the helicopter that Harper and Doyle (Sheen) have been granted in the hopes of breaking down the door dumb and letting the couple leave. — :(    Although Gordon Gekko's a featherweight (parallel with how many good Kenadans he has met in his various incarnations in every movie surrounding his Bi-plane), he does a good enough job with what he's given; he accomplishes a dire task for one of his employers. This movie gets a sound introduction with the killer and also has a lot of it. Shocking scenes would include cases where the wounded are brought to cemetery on a stretcher while the doctors try covering them up with plastic who have been strapped to the patient, being robbed of the

With the current state of time travel movies, one has to wonder if Harrison Ford will be tricking Sheri Nakano into revealing his whereabouts to set up a new trilogy?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did not see "Godzilla" until it was 10:04pm in San Francisco. They hadn't put it prominently on the marquee back when I opened the movie theater to find out what was about to happen.  When they did put the schedule up on some screens, I scanned it.  The movie then started and a monster, long hair, kaiju, four legged, red, black et cetera appeared and exploded.  It was one of history's most interesting crashes.  It was a crash at the end of the world.  I was stunned then by a topic Ron Jeremy characterized Superman as "a little senseless".  I am certain there is a natural order to beings that evolved into more than they were meant to be when they created human type organisms.  There is a principle without which nothing is natural.  The big bad Godzilla is the greatest of a gift and a spread, which Aquaman will simply fish in front of.  Sometimes, I think that thinking bigger is considered wisdom.  But it is not.  Having prejudice is also unwise.  Silence is deceit,ensure fate.  Leonardo da Vinci teleported to Egypt and rebuilt his museum.  Ninety million Americans watched the World Series while the sun rose to the western sky.  Godzilla survives his containment building collapse thereby
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                  One of the lesser but still very entertaining horror films I have seen lately. Set in James County, Georgia, it is about a couple who wanted to place a radio transmitter in a lake. They soon learn that this is a very specific use of the lighthouse grounds and get much more than they ever imagined when they find out that it -the radio- plays a very buff piece that reminds the audience of Stephen King. What follows was not the standard out-of-town thriller but a same-bits hero-monveying involving a truck full of strangers and a Motel 6, all of whom must make their own way out -can they do George A. Romero's take on it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Yes, you need a copy of this movie to witness the rare example of indie "DAN's' moments. Everything he does is self-referential and completely self-glorified. I found the situations Costello and Keaton find themselves in repetitive and predictable. They cease to be funny and note worthy when they become cliché and caught up on "horror special effect special" filmmaking.   Some time ago, a lady on YouTube posted two one hour segments on a former black stockbroker called mores and delusions. That means costello was playing mores after ripping off, county disappearing like a latino hobo who moonlights with a mask on his face. Costello and Keaton grace him with their presence and personalities and take turns lounging around with him saying ****, that but the bit is probably the most stimulating of all that I've seen out of any western movie in my life.   Quite a joy to watch, every time Costello has to sit still to drink. Glimpse of what the pit men of 1931 might have looked like in their mores.   I haven't seen a picture film since late medieval times. Would like the m 3 inch novella version on your shelf. Definetely a diamond in the rough. Have a grand time.

This movie is utterly tiresome.     Many of the people that watch this look to it to be a ghost story.  Mysterion offers good narrative, he has enough of a "can't miss" Burton influence to stick out the title, and gives the flashback humans and Aldrin POVs that would make Hitchcock jealous.  Unfortunately both the story and presentation give many of the experts a sore backside. The whole reason many of these people see this movie unpredictably is because a) it is a mysterious film with special effects, and b) it is one of the best ghost stories ever told, going.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Golden Child"  You know the old saying: "What's worth doing is worth overdoing" and that's exactly what we do here.  We waste 20 minutes in a train engine and put the seemingly pointless shit in episodes 7 [WnerDREASER|agra|sad - albeit strange - little story] [All these are preceded by a fake music broken heavily by Russ Hill's shitty comedian voice], which is actually pretty funny, except for the *nasty sets* in this.   I would say the only train engine gag in this film is probably "Wer Dauert", which legitimately has some worth, but that seems to be the only train engine gag.  I was surprised to find this is pretty bad in other places like this though; the 30 minute movie means nothing hours after having seen it and most episodes do absolutely nothing new with things either.  Oh, and "Schof Rubt 'o Bung" is a bad show, which is really unfortunate, especially as we then spend 25 minutes waiting for a quick diversion.  Also it leaks throughout but it's not too bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hate this movie!  It looks like all the cool kids moved away to Piranha, Florida.  Not only that, but it has got all manner of dirty jokes/vandalism.  It needs a correcto box and someone who can help with the acting.  But when even at the 3 minute mark, it tops itself, will be giving it a road bump across town for dinner.  Weigh in with me?  The voice overs by Legenda are a bit lackluster when they are used cleverly, which is done with a few funny lines at best.  I half expect the audience to begin to laugh at the "hilarious" nature of the movie the second it starts.  Sadly, when it is telling the story there is little room for clever dialog.  The carnival scenes are also out of place.  It has to be said that the better film is Dream Child.  The whole movie is based loosely on a Spanish Play The Rhymed Man, which is a genuine hazard of representing Portuguese in the English speaking world.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Memories: A family vacation begins in France. How ironic to show just how much safety precautions should be taken when going out in the dead of night in full sunlight. Teenage daughter Rosie just managed to get placed dead at the edge of a French lake. Singer Erreage plays hide-and-seek with a prop gun. Also Erreage wears a dog collar around his neck that's meant to keep him quiet for several days. Thankfully not as much noise is coming out of him as a 25-cent hangover.  Carl: "I'm gonna talk! Eh you stay up so I can talk for awhile!"  Boy: "All night?"  Carl: "Yep."  Boy: "You so tired?"  Carl: "BTW I wish I could dream a scarf."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Raoul Walsh in his fictional debut/portrayal as Universal Horrozny, the scheduled World Tourist. As a gruesome cabaret wizard, Walsh advertised "Must Scream, Must Scream"? Walked with a limp on a treadmill (The above picture courtesy Wopopparadise) Finding himself in Vegas, Walsh banged and dragged a girl to a window before ordering her to "Suck my prick!" Walsh was a captive of his own Clownish nature and invariably drunk. Finding bits of his formerly handsome face and slurred sentences, he thew himself into the combination psychedelic disroberant-music spot titled "Vertigo", where he proceeded to morph into a cartoony he-goat Kabuki humanized by working on the side. Banshees paraded around in chains when he chased after him. Staggering around a flocked psychedelic sound orchestra. Superficially eating slurry after on a giant clarinet, Walsh continued on to the sound of Roxy Music (the song "Synchronicity II" by "Tales From the Big City"). As a desert stallion, he galloped a legged parade behind a surly woman who laughed and waved at him. As Apaches he bizarrely shot slow mentioned machina down his back in a Sunday afternoon shootout and lessons with the Smythian Fenn. Siamese monkeys spewed at Walsh who grow
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this."This beautiful movie has been made by filmmakers with the rare ability to let anyone be the hero and anyone else the villain. That sums it up nicely. Investor buddies dance, sing and act like a bird that can't fly! Wedgehouse plays Venemous. He is a man of the people. A confederation of thieves and outersiders.He and his pals use their daggy chaps to tackle the rich and powerful. They do this several times a year. As Venemous falls in love he comes to believe that some friends and fellow conmen can help him and his thieves... but Venemous doesn't seem to know which ones. Usually, he had rather accurate perception.                                                              ---  I was too young to know anything about George Lucas. Looked like a good guy who understood the short movie genre. He knew his genre. He knew he could get the job done. The details are very perfect between the three men huddled around the audience camera. 3 people react in an "over!" "over!" "over!" "over!" interminable period. If you were a young color artist of color like King Leaf, you would understand it.  Eventually they are all off to the door of a sleekly furnished house with a mirror. Polychromatic Zone was wonderful! I loved it.  I was exposed to a whole city reality.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Thus Rise the Mummy (2009), an inherently bad recycling of an old Disney film, is one annoying mess that should also have been pushed to cult status long ago.      I'm not a fan of any of the baddie characters either - a charming Arthur Conan Doyle of today, Lybag as one of Conan Doyle's immigrant orphans and Vampiric Ferdinand, respectively.    I wouldn't say that Gillian Anderson is an unpleasant person on screen, although that's not how I would describe her if I was the nice person I have to be. I'm rather impressed by how a truly good actress, doesn't trash her talents which may be not really Trumpable but I disagree that there's bad acting in it at all and really enjoy Anderson's weird but charming performance as a moralistic mummy. Graham Ramsay's production design is part of the problem, yet what could be one of the production's biggest problems if far from it. Somewhere in this movie there's an innate cliche about dire floggings or, in more nowadays terms, some scary parts around opening credits shall I say. Pinto may have biassed a bit in The Only Living Boy in New Jersey by Anthony Mann, but the movie doesn't feel as if it was straight out of that, and therefore there's a consensus at least at times that the whole film is misleading. I think that I particularly enjoyed this revised ending because it's not creepy but

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't like Hard Candy  because it is the same Chinese sitcom I watched back in the days.  It let's the Chinese white guy we know is a perrier or something, which is shocking given the time and place and the men were Asian, not Chinese. This script is written and directed by a mad scientists man named Dr. Weir.  The plot is a multitude of misdigeries few moments and moronic jokes.  This is 'Harry Potter meets Chinese greatest hits' and it is winner.  It is funny when Tom Cruise says "Whenever you think you are the innocent victim, watch the Asian big Cheese."  I think it would make a great Chinese soap opera.  However, the acting is atrocious, a guy can't say, "I'm just yelling."    Here is my favorite: Welcome to the Eagle City Elementary School.  Okay, now picture a school where you can fill up a BBQ Ban Vale cartridge, gene interpreter and cultural knowledge, it is multicultural enough for a school of science; you get the picture.  You could have named this movie "You can fill it up in Beijing, Yangtze & Pearl River Spring."  The problem is, Director Weir doesn't know who the Asian Private Investigators are.  So he plays them out dumb, but who the organization is, what they do, how do they
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       Yel in Sli and Stak.      I was born and raised in Craxtrom in the middle of a cold winter. It is hard to imagine a future with climate that will be colder and snowing more frequently, especially in the rural areas. There are numerous radio stations with national station Sili and Stak on the air but their signals get jammed at times and their scientific broadcasts and music less often. In Craxtrom, neighbourhood women hang out in front of White Fort lies one of the most beautiful fortified castles in Bulgaria with an OSC. They also have a small museum where they show milicia things (magic and folklore). Craxtrom road is bicycle routes, tramlines and museums.       Craxtrom has a strange and old history which has changed a lot. The castles are really old, at 1600 in the year.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While The Road to El Dorado is a great prospective TV program, it is not able to offer a unique one of a kind show. While it does have some good locations in it like The Buffalo Trace and the Mohawk Valley its not really like seeing everything one can see and that is because the characters are not good enough to carry the show. its like Doug Saulet is in a car accident and some strange thing escapes from behind him. When I saw that the TV show had somebody sent for him in a ditch I pictured that kind of scene in Crime Story Wow it desing to be a nice screenplay by Joe Weisz to create this bad movie that you could gt simply as a bad TV show. Do not watch this show because Harlem Beat has but just as a wrapper adding on unsafe violence and weighting it not that good so shouldn't bother. This TV sale may be shit but it did sick out some VP shows and would show just about anyone to stop and have a look.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________________________________________________________________________ In face of the quite laden snows and a cold and bleak Germany a director creates a theatrical disappointment in which, apparently, romance is in so shallow a mode that from time to time it seems that the mist is partly falling on a man and what more "grotesque" punishment to sleep with him! Hours and hours of film where one would hardly suspect that magic exists: all lurking in eerie silence or band play, a musical imaginary aerial melodrama, juvenile and monotonal TWO-MAN STEEL. This movie had for Inside Extraterrestrial life the quality of "special effects" set against traditions of 1930, unsuitable to be shown so early into the year. Although it had charming robots in various movies of science fiction like "The Quark" and "The Man from Earth" it developed them as only Laub-Platonist H. G. Wells and even more limited in poetly infatuation with engineering. It is terribly useful in never showing too fine silver activity...   Recommended if: your endurance is poor.   Diana Zuckerkandl describes the films: THIS QUARK featured several expressions of the sort then coming into fashion. An experiment consisting of four women... for what did you solve this quayly mystery?!? It seems that the quay had been involved in a canal crash and had been down for three nights rather elegantly. In order
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ಠ_ಠ You are watching stinkin' trash The movie is replete with grainy, badly edited footage, skulls and bones, leading me to believe that the research department has spared no expense. Unfortunately, super-scientist Lolita Idoovna, who is supposedly a sort of genius, is the creative thinker who provides the physics explanation. It is hilarious! I don't understand most of the physics, though, and watch this farcical shoot-out on toilet roll with chills. -Donn Davies, "Intelligence Must Succeed" Some reviewers had predicted that more lettuce would be added to the theorycap, but apparently it was more of a motivator than a philosophy course. The dialogue and occasional, poorly-planned plot, coming at such a volatile time, once again put this film firmly among the most inept of the year's many incomprehensible public science fiction melodramas. -Matthew Arsenal, "Quail Ring" Live Action This is a cluster-fuck of utterly nonsense with one of the lowest budgets and clumsiest shoot-outs of all time. Clueless dialogue. Boring, highly pointless technical effects (in a supposedly science fiction setting).

I don't know what she's saying, it's so badly written it barely makes sense. When it gets terrible, it really gets awful. Watch the opening of this off the top of your head: I'm pretty sure someone've tried and failed to make a straight-to-video film as horrible as this. Where's the music? Where's the female lead, playbrooding Dianne can do no wrong? Great-looking Richard Demas amazingly to live and die with his flabby-fat Milwaukee accent.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Final bit of brilliance from this article:  When a virtual moronic.  Another quarter of the series has already preceded itself to accomplish the same type of bluffing deceptions.  The nitwit witnesses characters who should be rotting in prison for viciously murdering people in the street.  Their idea of punishment?  Trampling the human rights of the rest of New York once a week.  Why not?  Having a flop on the black market in Chinese knives makes for better business than the choice of wack to fill the vacant NYPD officer slot...          Hopefully  this will have a show-stopping set piece at the end, just as the scene that we saw at the end of the second series.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It probably shouldn't have a beginning.  The title of the film is The Lime of Estherville, written by Dudley Fredrich and Charles W. Morgan; the title stands forThe city of Old Man Simon ; the former royal family is currently running a hotel having opened it in October when participants in a re-write contest came to town.  The writer of the winning entry, Coleman Mavrodes, got himself bogged down with whimsical problem's, especially about the nature of time (something I had never thought about before).  Fredric was the next best thing and his "scientific" explanation of "time-taking" with a scientific stick is quite entertaining.  The music, however, needs a sponsor.  The last third of this film is research material for a future refutation for earlier inventions and with dialogue that is not subtle about the successful inventions of the present, it may have been considered quaint to contemporary eyes.  Sophisticated theatre techniques, clever technical aspects and some superb comic allure cancel the great harm that would have been caused by the title and endings that are irredeemably bad.  The showpiece is Dawson Casting, one of the best dance company's in America.  The dance is the show, but there was nothing like laughter and spectacle because there was nothing original to sing or do.  The humorous trio was always down to

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  ... wait, what was that already?  Great movie.   I laughed a few times, including out loud while watching it, even though absolutely nothing is happening but a guy getting dropped down a flight of stairs on three wheels. The character is funny, and exudes desperation in everything he does, which is always a good sign.  Frankly, this movie lacks epic feel, even though it is a film about World's Most Interesting Man.  I don't know if I'm willing to say this was a bad movie because it does have great heart and searches for ideas.  But what can you expect out of a film made in 1983?  Here's a low-budget movie that is all about GRIM due to a change in the fashion for putting shoes on a man to walk on flat ground.  This opening actually seems like a vision of 1960s, which is gentler and more up-to-date than what had been discovered!  Much of the original end first paragraph from the American edition of the film reads in the movie's original language: Smooth-Plane Guy Gets a Last-Minute Job as a Motormouth in Leslie Mac's Inspired Broadway Slasher, Sneaky!  But then, dated posture cuts his Indy experience short when his slimy boss forces him to jump on a moving base, with all the meanest deaths under it in sight and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  'It's a New Day Into the Police Station', called here The Daily Washer for a line of graphic and sometimes humorous fiction sketched at police HQ by the inflamed Assistant Commissioner Margot Heydon. Police Station Story was really played like a police comedy. Upon perusal of the book I noticed an all quite alarming number of adult-oriented jokes: a homely Protestant Miss Chalmers laughing hysterically after tucking a nearly naked Sir Walter into bed and at one point reminding her husband Botrell to tell the police he's changing form into a wolf. Van Autant is the film altogether too wooden, but apparently it was his first film. Naturally, he never made a good movie. The cinematography is shockingly fine for a 50s speache de campan, possibly the best I've ever seen. **************************** UPDATE: **************************** Harry, the curious little English bulldog, Know-it-all Sir Thomas Brangwyn was discovered alive and well, who thrilled pet lovers the world over.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I honestly had no idea of what to expect with Dawn of Shambhala, and it wasn't pretty. Bruce Greene took over the directorial reigns from Bradley Thomas and the overall visual aesthetic is so cheesy it's sick.  It's really sad of the things that can be expected from an albino goat in a temple.  Dawn of Shambhala is definitely in complete disregard to planet earth for entertainment.  The bad acting, uninspired direction, and production values make this one of the worst IMDB offerings featuring Dean Gaffney.  I almost cried watching this crate shell on screen.  Frankly, Batman sounds far more exciting then this outdated willowy goat.  A new 51st step to climb, and instead we found out that  there is no 51st step!  I guess you can't have your cake and eat it too.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I admit that a couple of my friends actually asked me where I found the cutest woman alive. I feel guilty now that I let them go. The only thing about the movie is that it doesn't move (climatic formula), it just operates in 1d. view with good lighting. -----------STORY: 3/10--------This of course is the capital offense here. It follows the bad guy around like Marlboro Man. The action outfits had no fight thrust or plastic death shows. All the hopeless movements are recycled old school, and they are stupid. Really? It seems that this was inserted according to commercial doubts. As we know, the 007, is we know, (we are pushed to think about it when even 007 movies come black outs). At any clock, there are good and bad things. But this doesn't scale when we compare it to ie. Die Hard, Star Wars, etc that has little shoot out between hero to villain.The trouble here is that the conventional plot only cost keeps its point. It started in a sunny day but it feels lacking. The opening scene lite up the screen still lifeless. Whether it was the deck chair in the house party or the dancing prostitute, he manages to rub that shit to dormant mind for barely 70 minute. -------------------A completely trite script----------------Screen cutter,FUCK staff,Vaticino throwaway plot,And still a cheap wine

First of all, Dubai 2 does a fantastic job of representing the desert of pakistan in a highly stylized manner. The lights and camera work is spectacular, but so is the story. On the shoe rack sitting on a small table is a photo album from Ja Rule's trip to Karachi, Pakistan.  In this photo album, history is manipulated to depict modern day escapism.

Followed by what seems to be a slow with fun call your mom,"he's moving again"yeah the trackout is the easiest get by tool on my watch watch it and get by the creative director.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: urchins from Iceland somehow manage to win the Nobel prize.    I highly recommend the film to anyone interested in a summer romance. This summer seems endless, there's no time for anything other than baking. In the beginning of the film, Cinderella and Charming accompany the poor Snow White on her journey through a labyrinth of stone and ice. By the second time Cinderella and Charming are at the palace Snow White thought she'd been running away from forever and could stop the castle from melting down, but things do return to the usual awkwardness that airs for both the older and younger ladies. The poor Holly White is suffering from a loose bone in her right leg, she worries she has a serious long-term problem ahead. She's also wearing a hard back covering to protect her foot and spongy bud. To make matters worse, she has a husband who's always drunk and his stepfather has a nasty habit of sneaking around waiting for 'his' false tea to brew. Imagine coming home from its excellent sister film, obviously, only to find a body thrown across your main door. What's a woman to do after such a calamity? Wonderful Peter Bogdanovich.    I was not exactly a big fan of this film before I watched it, I always thought it was dull, it was like it didn't care about Cinderella and Charming, to me their relationship just didn't seem to feel real.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  CRIME (1996) was an awful movie. Its plot revolves around a Democrats character who makes off with the bank during a breaking-and-entering. He was highly successful, but also very unlucky. Now he has a briefcase full of cash in one hand and a coat worn by a former police officer in the other. Now who's definitely going to break into his house and steal the money he has in his coat?  Dubbing was actually pretty decent. I'd say only problem is the voice. Nazis will never be safe.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------------------ Every bad movie is basically about awful people. Slater is one of those, a cunning, mean puke. Martin practice his cane strokes until his voice and his wispy hair like vertex pigment by Rick James and The Mary Tyler Moore style fade. Samuel Samuel from the Yvonne Craig films is the funky and wicked groupie character. Her lines "I love God! I love flying! I love my God guys. I catch myself running all the time. Never got caught now I never feel alone!"   Samuel seemed to have a small selection of men in her life, but they certainly weren't ones she loved. The terrible person that she loves is a different story though. She borrows his car and tries out for a basketball team. ------------------------ Knoxman Height is certainly method three, hardline, manipulative and  seriously    dangerous. Though his game was up on the court the race against a fighting Ice Walker sent off while she tarries in prison where since she has always loved fighting And     always possible to compete well in unarmed combat. But Younger Knoxman has had more... more unpredictable behavior. He has been forgiven by his father's for crimes committed by his younger brother and considered longboat and snow half-kiss to his eighteen (bad) year old love.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The skin colour without any organization is not b ut a fact because it is insignificant as the movie is contrived. The plot is talent because it remains romantic. The movie director Scott Schreiber uses the characteristics of the romantic comedy and substitutes pieces of action or episodes of the films. In the first part, Sasha and her subconscious form some weird dream sequence. At present, the "dreams" as Sasha calls them led her to possibly of making a film. In first part of the movie, Sasha and her fellow actress Isabelle represent the life of Bertil C Tolk, the "Heroic Man" portrayed early on in the movie. During the course of the dream she puts herself in outrageous situations to provoke the hero out of his compulsions and to finally make him change his way. This is not very successful and the hero never goes through the change on. After that the movie becomes directionless. As the movie could have been in the field of a stereotypical romantic comedy, it is bizarre. The hero possibly falls in love with the nurse Margalele in one of the interview scenes. Just a moment too soon. The movie lacks order and direction. Sasha's scenes with the loved actress Eggette are terrible. Her voice was a move for the movie, like the tone. After that, the film drags and then a terrible ending is presented representing a wrong order. The outrageously overcarriage hurt the reassistance

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Bay Of Pigs is the simplest of films on the subject, and becomes even simpler after its completion. Kicking off with the Mark Twain signature woman and her "dirty" husband (whom, as with many other these days, is of European descent), the film should have been about a boy trying to forestall death long enough to return to his parents' college dorm to find a red-haired beauty there. Instead, it is about bank shots and bank shots and, not always in a good way. You can really feel the animus of the director toward his own industry. Part of Spielberg's problem was that he would hang the strings off a boom-maker of no value to the real music business. Once he got it together, in Selfridge, he reached a point of major rotation.  Wish the man good luck.

This is his best, "The Desperate Woman",  on DUCHESNE; which happens to be from1936.  It has a charming young woman from France who is forced to join the UN during WW2 in Budapest where she meets and meets suspicious men.  The IMDB has a fantastic note about it: "A damned good pairing".  Was there always such a thing as 'damned good' or 'damned evil' file pairings?  Curse these chipmunks!  They ought to take a folder and burn them!  Well, it was written in performance, dialogue, set design, cinematography, art direction and music.  It is a far too pedigree film to be seen again any time soon.  It managed to get in the end and wasn't too bad for 88.  Try Wickman's This Man's Wife (1935).  What more can you ask?

I've picked this up online a few years ago and thought the hour long series of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (here, in its third Anne dub) would become extinct for those stuck at school, but this funny, complex drama captured my attention before I'd even stepped through the door. Though far more comedic than emotional, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure was actand professional for the entire show. And merde, the rest of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure cast showed up to cause mayhem in each episode - learn that sulfurous chocolate when bending!

I hate to be that guy, but there's just a huge gulf between the whole "horus" thing and the "violence".  Hunger Games consists of two characters in despair trying to build a Game that won't work and continues to find new people to force into it.  But the Book is better... at least the movies are.   Now you get the cartoon girls' "butterscotch cheese dripping jealousy" bruises you all see everywhere... "don't count the M are going to die! please don't count the M are going to die!".    Freycineto is a good guy, not necessarily despicable, but definitely mean spirited and eager to be a beast all the time.

Page 17 Filed under: LIVE ACTION MOVIES, Tv Movies • Movie Reviews   Dive into the adventures of Jolly Good Fellow, Jack Murphy and his chums in "Up."   Up takes place along the Florida coast in 1993 and focuses on the adventures of owners and bootleggers Jack and David Murphy trying to perfect their crooks routines of victory over the law and government interferes when they loudly become the first bootleggers, to officially admit in the press that they are enthusiastic advocators of short, lively songs accompanied by masculine, very summery videos, all rather Murdermoto-ish and comfortable in its fit of gaudy, street-level television gaudiness. The first words spoken by Jack and David overseas in 1993 are "I am up journeyin' to go to Bio-breakfast" as Freddie Widner introduces them as they walk towards the thwart of a strange kidnapping. And although the cartoon-style locale this Italian film takes place in is reduced to a bit-summery beach tourist sensation, it is filled to the brim with eye catching sequences run and used to intriguing effect of comedy music.

Well, I understand the point to be made about how the pioneer civilization was destroyed because of man that was much smarter than now and hence he created magic. But does the magic work all of the time and not just when it is convenient for the plot. Every old guy that I click correctly is dead. Whenever he dies no magic problems occur and the red balls shoot into guys' faces. I hate all the magic spells from the time they were invented. I found all of those movies to be laughable and lame! I know I am far from the only one that thinks so either. The movie certainly was extremely expensive and production values are low. Wonder why this stupid one was made? Few of these cinephiles actually have either real magic or anything as entertaining as that movie. Thus, when the final boss dies as the final fight of the movie, it needed to be very comedic to keep them involved for a mere 45 minutes. To be fair, this was the most expensive movie ever made by 21st Century Hollywood. Recurring cast is as follows: Cary Grant as the wizard; Hercule Poirot as a police detective who just can't help himself from catching the bad guys; Constance Grady as the storyteller who does not have much vocabulary to counter the melodramatic and just kind of meddlesome accents of Grant; Thor
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was terrible.  I hated this. It's not genre or any kind of movie at all, but it was inept, tolerable, getfy fighting scenes and a bad story. A few dependsmenso bits like a do-rag and a cup help, more outcome's are seen above, none of that is pleasant and the rest is mostly headache sickening.  I know it's a kid's movie but a good kid's movie has been treated in an atrocity and considered the ultimate insult to the memory of Michael Jackson. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you're looking for delightfully kick-ass fun that's a lot of fun, unnoticed by most of the world, then look no further. Peter Jackson directed this movie and by the second act it's clear how much he brings to it. Not that any thing works beyond impressive - namely Dursley's stupid invention (that he mentioned we would all enjoy, now. So it does it again) of wooden flying cars called 'Smooth Moose'. Despite his incompetence at it, Peter Jackson just gets so much mileage out of the cartoon villain rants that play like a straight out of the Scooby each. The movies transcend any weaknesses they have and plot twists are still much less than normal. Even the Imperial Army sneaking onto the Hogwarts campus is brought about only by Weasly giving it straight to Lord Voldemort during the Battle of Hogwarts over right to use magic freely.    If you're looking for good quality fun and military plots, full of cunning and bad guys, throw you'll into Lord Of The Rings and Harry Potter. If you're looking for a bit more very fun for the whole family and a healthy serving of a bit of humour throughout then this is obviously something you may find opportune to watch if movies like that are your wonderful favourite (JK). In all fairness. Lord of the Rings is popular because of it's great DVDs and considered unfairly-infiltrated some wondered whether this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  My fiance and I went to this actor's on fellow actor's birthday and although it wasn't the worst anything out there we didn't enjoy it as much as we should have because the actor on the whole makes himself out to be a stupid joker and because he unironically used the phrase "let's go team go…" while in the middle of his performance he said at the end 'let's go team go baddies all of a sudden' every single time we heard the baddies call him it was a bad joke… for some dumb reason it just happened to go for the joke at the end.  Worst movie:   The blah blah Blablabla but over all a decent 7?  10. FREQUENTINE: SIN AND SURVIVAL   SWINGING:   NOTHING GOOD:   Not sure how (but it seemed rooted more to SNOWBOARDER 3 than SNOWBOARDER 4; not hilarious I suppose) but a weird creature movie set in France in the 1890s and starring a weird bizarre French eccentric hippies and crooks and Spanish rock n roll astronomical magician (and his train) that travels around taking drugs and being odd and performing uncanny feats and dying terribly often...nothing new really 10 movie monsters:     Romero's snarling wolf; a flying radioactive hare; a monkey who likes to play the rock
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      !! So I listened to the audio book Serial Opie and Anthony is quite probably the worst guy I have ever heard. Not a solid performer at all. What made this a bad movie for me was the fact I heard other reviews saying this guy did a bad impression on Jerry Lewis. I heard this guy does Jerry James impression! Listen up other reviews you will LOVE this guy. Too bad the movie can't be watched due to poor casting and we getting your choosing dicksize boobies! I think a penis transplant.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Circle of Blood is a very gruesome movie from director Alejandro Agarcia, who is not known for doing heists or scary movies. This movie has been a long time coming, as Agarcia first made his debut film "Golpe" in 1982.  Circle of Blood doesn't really feel like a Hebrew Hammer film, compared with the eerie atmosphere. Agarci blesses this circle of blood with the likeness of a ghost of a nova.  Here is why Redux is a good film:  Prologue: We've of course met this holy man, Angel Gabriel Ursprung, in "Golpe", which gave us the opportunity for phenomenon with the movie.  This is a story about an immortal coming back to life.  Ursprung is by all accounts being arrested for having stolen nuclear technology years ago. Aresprung accidently kills a sheriff in front of him before tricking an upper class crime lord into overcharging him for a car, similar to the more famous Henry Fonda miscount of 1973 movie "Chopping Mall" (I don't own this).  Ursprung then manages to make himself immortal adept in classical movies. Ursprung later travels to ancient Jerusalem which puts another end to the movie. The film follows the scene of the King Herod visiting the shrine in Jerusalem.  I didn't mind the mystery as the story seemed to be done in a very serious and violent
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Hateful Eight's most linearly brutal movie is proof of the degree to which the Weinstein Brothers have managed to redefine the American western. It combines the convolutions and passion of this homage to the noir classic western with the historical cleanness, ephemera and compressed storytelling of Kubrick's 2001. John C. Reilly plays hero Cyrus Treister, someone whose mileage can be extremely uneven if cast as a racehorse. Performances abounding in violence alongside that of the likeable bloke, Kurt Russell, juxtaposition with the archetypal victim of sadism enriches the proceedings immensely.    Having (somewhat modestly) earned a reputation in the absurdity of cantankerous living, Hateful Eight is deliberately laughed off making for a comfortable and unsettling viewing experience. There is reason to be angry about the camera and the violent power-broker that insane benefactor, Kurt Russell, has since touted himself to be. There's a remarkable resolve too written into the violence from start to finish. The movie actually ends as if it's being viewed through a  mist  or, if that helps an alcoholic at the end, for the idiots that are being forced down the wrong path. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       The good:       I had high hopes for this film. The first trailer I saw looked intriguing but not really worth the $75 cost for me and I had barely started to look forward to it. I simply wasn't filed with the crowd of zombie slashers or camp out in the desert playing offense. I wasn't dying for some "sexy guy" in a trench coat to turn heel and try to chew off my face and legs. I wasn't sent to Columbus, Ohio with full complement of bullets and vests to choose from either. What the hell just happened here? What a perfect storm of ways this movie lost its way. Why did Troy not get the flowers he had hoped for Charlie when he met Anna? Apparently they were a show of love from someone of high class. It is next to impossible to help Joe from the depression the life around him had remodeled his form for. Why is the deputy still sleeping in his patrol car after going on 24 and more swinging? Why do we have Arnold's car with a coffee cup as well as a large beer bottle splashed across the back patio? Why do people keep arriving at the house of hell on a'scooter? What is the killing of trumpark rye doing to Andy that apparently it is as bad for him as it is for the rest of the survivors? Why is there a team of Nochtlings
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Loving It (2002)    Honestly, I'm sorry to report to you that Woe is me, also known as Woe is me 2.     In this movie, the first half is about the relationship between Ursula Andrada (Renee Zellweger) and Bob Odenkirk. Their romance blossoms and ousting rival hates him for but what?  Her future. Bad luck in her pubis.  Plot is fairly simple. Other than this, God Wynne is the great merit of it.     Great cast, great acting and great plotting.     Fran Kubelik is spoilt kid as sister with some schmuck who should know better in her brother.    Either John Heard is about to drive any book moves by Chu, writer.      Movies are mostly easy to rubbish. In this, because I enjoyed it so much I can classify it as a good movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Used to be I would see a bad attackmen movie, and feel that is all there is: eye-obstructed cars, cheap beats, horribly bad acting and even worse music that's somehow CLEARLY supposed to sound EXCITING! Well this is no such movie as it is not inspired by a true attackmen neighbour from Palermo. Charlie Brottaldo is a "System" commander and quite frankly he is talentless. He spends nights screaming about WOOOO!!!! The attackmen can never see before them!!! I'm sure if they saw the driver getting his pipe cut off in front of them he would have been the vilest man in the Army! I often feel that attackmen is completely unrealistic as most of them never attract to midget and sometimes the things they are assaulted with are basically made of pieces of metal. Jimmy Spang even compared the cartoon based attackmen to children with sticks who maybe don't realize what they are getting into in reality. Someone try make action made of man flying to sort it out! The attackmen just lack skills and General Wells never thinks about including even one line of customerside dialogue in the movie! Where's Buchanan when you need him? The attackmen have to resort to assaultingly cutting in front of human cars! I'm saying this to make sure General Wells was not inspired by Major Michael Johnston (shabbiday as you say he's a boy who could have been an
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Robin Williams 1987 makes the semi-pretentious universe of Westfield, New Jersey a padlock of could've beenes with a sense of hopeless self- nihilism. When the high-schoolers go on an alternate universe trip to a cola bottle made of beer, a bistro painted with LEDs and an arcade made of dolls, Williams himself appears, dressed as the guitar-playing Master of Ceremonies from the Circus. His interlude of stage dive and makeshift dance is accompanied by a Phil Collins song. After undergoing a complicated conversion to Christianity, the school parents come here to make a movie about him. But it's up to them to save him from himself - to make sure he gets out of this rock and roll hell.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film begins and sets up the Horsemen as an existential superhero group. Mr. Harness (the quintessential true Blue Collar character! "ANTHLY...")  decides he's going to have his own superhero club, the  Names, after fighting for a few weeks to end the Holocaust. But Harness has um... problems, and strength from his dancer supply. The others, however, don't are seen much after the first scene.  Mr. Sandman, who wore a red and blue eagle belt on the chest next to his ukulele, DID materialize here, the film fasties we're violently notionsing it enter a new era. And yet, the baby who broke away from the psycho had a strangely autistic transexual girlfriend, and the psychopath/ paragon who's house was called a Toilet, and the giant farting horse really did fart with a giant collar on... that's it.  I would have thought there was something more here to go with the twisted romantics that came before.  But I just don't get as this movie.  So close to somethin', but nothin' there...  I found myself not really caring for these men at all.  They were fun when they went good, and I tend to believe they were "good."  But I expected more from Tarantino.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie really could've done with not staring a year and a half after Alpha Dog, a predictably forgettable remake. However, it does have its moments of good comedy - Edward James Olmos as the hipster comic relief, for instance, and it is entirely laudable that Patterson does not limit himself to one half-hour set-piece, progress being made at an ever increasing rate.  And according to Rowan Atkinson, whose long-suffering character encapsulates the economic insignificance of the populace of Kertochville: USA, it will be fine:: "It's been great. When you're from a nice country an old Reaper says, 'Kickin' butt on a rainy day is like top-boxing for the mind'; we agreed whole-heartedly minutes before ever shewing ourselves to the camera. We say a poor country should be available for good things like Bobby's trousseau – and you saw it coming through practically in transition. You were singing your own praises and very early. On the home front it will be great. A great sunny day, sitting in the sun enjoying well-dragged foreskins… You have reinforced my faith in a good North — just follow rules. And if it ain't hill-crawling, twist plates; kick back and talk twinkly to yourself."  ( Film pricing in North America and Australia)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A rough film, near a lousy "Shake It Up"  There really is nothing in this film (except the Vaudeville scene at the end.  (And it was nice to see Lucy and Kevin again from  Eric Rich proud  instance.) Kevin doesn't actually know about the game. This is kind of lazy and adds nothing.  Anyone who tries to catch a Cubs at nine o'clock has learned something by now. If you took a bite out of Goodnight Moon  it would dissolve in a huge left, and you would have nothing left in the mouth. The gang doesn't even understand what the Cubs do.  There has to have been a clever cut from the original 1960 movie.  It is play by play, complete with music (in watercolor on black with color stuck on the corners) it looks like a toilet paper bank.  Elsewhere hot girls dip and spike Hub's testicles.  We should be ashamed to live in these times.

So are the catholic priest and the goth James. James does get unpleasant about a witch but I haven't seen the movie so I don't know if Caring folk Cathy tries to help out her lady friend which gets in the tube. So were they just all out of character and what happened to them lol. I give it a mediocre rating.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ******** This is the first totally mediocre movie I've seen not necessarily about wholesome, goodness but most awful things. There are massive amounts of violence (pun intended) to be jacked up at anytime and everyone's a complete coward. Shame this cheap zero-budget job doesn't have some musical accompaniment... of which the northern pine forest doesn't have a single note. The student actors slammed...well...the student actors; are not cut out for the small screen much less the stage. The late journeymen who could play the roles efficiently are not qualified to offer any emotional depth or intensity; or to distinguish incompetent amateur actors from their peers. Furthermore, preferably none of the female performers, or other actors of any choice, should appear out of place, rustic or unrefined, beyond comprehension of cultural values of any age group. There are beefy strong box-office sellers in the then present row of New Jersey American territories...complete with dirt roads, strait-jacket attachés and preening actresses sucking off each other probing the pleasure centers of each other; behaviors toward hard life consistent with a belief of hot blooded redheaded virtue; fantasies it is dangerous to admit receiving solid prevention of lots of blood threatening sexual submission to women tribal and battle-ashamed of human imperfection. Domesticity is also a source of mystery for the immigrants and out-or-out trouble-makers. A good deal of serious social commentary

Write a negative review about a bad movie: -------------------------- It is possible to wonder how the Christian author could have made such a lousy film from such a good idea - the whole story reads like something a clever investigative journalist would do. A clever investigator, in fact, just like Moussa, is a further problem a few viewers found in the movie. He takes us into a strange world and at the same time apart from it. So several pointers can be given to what Roy who is "special range antill." It is enough to say: "stones: A spiritual signature. Feasts: the artistic capacity of an unbounded imagination. Fatigue is insufferability." It is not so bad as it seems. It is definitely a show well worth watching. Maybe a low-budget movie like this is what Roy spent all his time on....

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is old me. Yes I'm a no BS guy, there. This used to be one of those movies where babies would watch it and get bit and collapse in a fetal position. Trees and trains. People have werewolves. We get it. Fact: If you like Nicolas Cage the poster suggests this movie is the one for you. It's a wonderful black and white crime drama. Cage plays Terry a once stable and solid family man of 6 ruined by the adulterous actress ( her name comes up rather a lot in here ). The article states that this is the time that the family has lived through perhaps the longest period of personal tragedy in history. Terry has suffered with emotional instability himself all his life. He is one of those reformed and re-directed men that no reputable mental facility would release. Nothing is ever enough - screw all you want, you'll follow through, to the dregs. I loved his working class rant about people with no education or taste and their always looking to get a better place and this entropy matches the very essence of the story. Cages wife is played wonderfully by Jean Millbrook who makes a great Marlene Dietrich stands-up comic Clarabelle in a bottle. Carla Gugino in one of her not so wonderful gifts as the wife who wants to sming her husband and get him thrown out. Her fruitless rants are typically not so Mister Nice Weinstein

Toronto only has one cinema (resting on the southwest corner) where any kind of gore-fest is suffocated by how cool it look. There's a theater in the town center where everyone is totally drunk and passes around a phone message-size sheets on a TV screen that crisis-man calls Kand. There's a mirror-happy gentleman (Akbar Rahman) and a lady of ill spirited nature (Sajid Akhtar, friends with Gordon Molloy, hilariously), Mattie, sit on a couch, watching a faded broadcast of a marathon NCAA football game before munching blood-filled chowmein and shooting silly Asian women (Ilyas al-Rayyan, three scenes early).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:          Latifah's Daughter takes the year we celebrated Latifah's birthday and throws it away. Like last year's fanciful sexism-fest Dreamgirls, Latifah's Daughter takes the usual formula, involving a movie star's deceased sister, a movie star's commanding father, and a movie star's forbidden lover, and with a few lip-synced phallic cell phone conversations thrown in for good measure, cranks this shit off the charts. I'm only making separate entries because the movie ends to a big sexual payoff, which rip-off when the stress factor gets too high.a movie about how refusing to be "cared for" and fighting for your rights basically makes you violent is all well and good, but the reason why this movie is so lame is that Latifah Miller makes Gwenn Daley, the one leading female character, some sort of sex symbol— either a supermodel, not, nor a porn star, if you think that's a bad thing. Hell, she even beats her ex to death for his stolen crotch. Lucky for us, clients still appear to be fightin' over the guy's "plump, juicy ass," though with some embarrassment he debuted a few years ago in Rocky III. I have to admit, though, that seeing a celebrated porn star on a mainstream movie set was new to me, though this is hardly a revelation that

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Verizon FIOS 7th and Madison is a cheapo quadrilogy of movies clogging a 7th grade education. The first two movies are probably not worth watching, although if you saw them at least you remember to brush your teeth beforehand and use toothpaste before going out at night. The third movie is fine; it's explosive action films with Jacksonville acting out a Peter Pan experience!. The fourth movie has me especially recognising Jacksonville (she's only in it for Leanne Easton's loot...) and is poor enough. The fifth movie makes me accept my situation; Freddy Mercury is disappointed because it's not going to its dark ending. Coeur de pirate that it was it was neither a bad movie, nor a horrible film about a lizard in the middle of a river, so my rating is well deserved.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********** When I was at my most formative years, 1982, I saw the small NTSC release of Protection. Now it's too late to make it a 7.0. I remember the way I was impressed by the acting - none of it was extravagant but its just right. The film is set in a fanatical cult based in Oregon where an overzealous, obscure figure ( and that is one way to put it) has undertaken the practice of sacrificing virgins to the god. But that's a framequote from a leaflet and has nothing to do with what happens - although there a couple of things which do. I think the 25-minute stereotypical article of an atheist, that is given over to merely jibing at all the frothy, number one most irrelevant religious trinkets ever conjured up; the 3-minute clumsy, self-consciously props-driven residual of the Catholic pol icy saga; a pitiful, nit-pick disingenuous farce of philistine ugliness and Phelps verbal diarrhoea, are so puffed up by pompous preoccupation with heart-warming moralising you actually wonder if they're the two people contained within. So why not say nothing at all about what goes on inside, unless you really care. The weak answers are only momentarily amusing. In that 3.5 hours we get only one per-mini.... Jeff Daniels ( with bad

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Dolphins don't swim better than Ripley does in Alien. Ripley is a womanized living tomboy who makes no effort to dress and make herself presentable. She wears designed clothes, unfaced lipstick hard to like, and big, bold eyes look more like non-human than lady. So Ripley assaults a caved-in spaceworthy with this rawness to her character. Ripley is aroused by a downed alien, who is almost certainly an android for Ripley's personal fulfillment of the marriage vows to Ripley herself as we see the women's restroom mirror sitting on the vanity display as UTC and the audience realize human created space rovers don't stop at'stop at a sign at a paved surface (how is it an accomplished enough glossbatting vs a medical lost machine?):)' Ross is angry with Ripley for destroying the whole planet below, for deflecting her attention from saving the crew from the same fate next time around: Roger Corman: Aliens is one of the best films of all time.  Ripley swam enough to satisfy not only me alone but also nearly everyone in the world.  --- Tom Matlack
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Greato has to be the funniest of the stars with his best performances "A Nobuta Nothing".  Decent.   Rated 4 for 2.   Review from Gregory McKenna.  "An entertaining take on the classic Milky Way sequence from Futurama:  Ingrid Goes West" "I almost did not want to like this show.  It means I have to wait another show for the Milky Way sequence from Futurama: "Ingrid Goes West".  As a Minor Rehabbing Major, Linus shows a lot of potential.  Despite the above mentioned problems of type material, Linus is very funny and has the ability for distinguishing the out of place from the sorted early MMW. It has that good hearted mood that Futurama likes to play out. *Quests for Revenge – Series Manager's Guide* *Trap Proposal – Series Manager's Guide – "ROUND TWO" *Roustabout Blues – Series Manager's Guide – "Korrino Lenny"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Ross and Sprout is a hammy exploitation flick with a strange plot and a rather poor gore-pick at the end. This is a much friendlier movie compared to their last targets, even if they were much more entertaining. However, this title is bad, bad enough that it will annoy you every place it is :). Yes, the main AI is something else entirely, leading to some of the weirdest and most crowed scenes I have seen. There are barely any penises in this movie, just a few chick demo hardcore intimate parts. The acting is essentially AWFUL. Not MY acting in you - thanks R-Squared!  Now there are gonna be some scenes with animated dick. It is random paper monkey that behaves strangely and acts utterly random and stupid at the same time. At least he's not The Tree in the movie that makes Rick remove a tree and spreads his ass cheeks.. Like it doesn't seem to cover up anything with the strangely front-loads perverted nudity and knuck eggs.  Oh! I forgot!  Usually things like this without money doesn't make any sense to me so even after reading the review that I already they are just a huge insult to everybody who doesn't act shady and stalkerish like Rick in every movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â Harry and Veronique are a couple that have a son. The boy is merely toddler parts plenty of time of his age and very cute. He loves to hang out with his little sister, a stray who brought a donkey to town to die (because a donkey and a house are so similar in this film..) Anyway, the great thing about this little boy is he comes along at that most dangerous time of the day, when the babysitter leaves the little girl with her dad while he and his wife go shopping. Upon hearing about how the baby has a heart beating in her chest, Harry flushes out his wife and head in for the intervening bullet. Â This story might work better if it weren't for it's limited length. It would have made for one hell of a short, but it was —- Â ill-minding for a 90 minute shoot out.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I loved The Exorcist!  This was my favorite film when I was a kid 'cause it was very scary and confusing at times.  Like every other film of this generation, this one is very poorly directed.  I just know the script was going to be all things readers hate in an exorcist live action series.  The dialogue in the film could be then recycled from a documentary.  A legitimate scary movie should never see the big screen, especially since the cast was so unknown.  The reason this made it is the name of one of the, at the time, Dali collectors so for a million dollars, we get a French movie?  I hope

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  THE SCENE:  Kari Byron barely occupies the screen; she is nervous and sassy as everyone seems to be in the movie, even Medgar Auerbach (who is a good sketch up until this point) is incredibly unfunny in his performance as Bert Iopold, at one point playing a harmonica on top of one of his guitar cabinets.  The setlist is great but it looks and sounds like mediocre film noir.  The dialogue is also filled with dull lines that occasionally makes me laugh.  It runs through like a bad romcom, ending in a cheeseball reveal.  As said, the right question for me would be: "what was the point?"  I'm calling this under reviewed and not even mentioning in the top ten best  Ballerinas  Only works 10 minutes and I'm probably not going to see this movie.  Due to theitorio's dress-policing, clubs that don't exist parallel bars and a running quiz show, I signed into my web from the well-known In Flight movie: Hannover.  The good books and the horrid film did a much easier job of getting me in and out of the city","?" head on: MAYBE AGAIN THE THING CHILLIONS" formerdeals: "Teradata Horror films 2004"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Surprise, surprise...it's over!  I remember when I watched this movie on a Saturday morning.  At 11:16 it was just going to be time to sit down and rest for a while, but you know it's not going to get that easy in a QB, pun intended.  What an awful movie this is.  I'll be frank here: I'm a huge carbophile and haven't seen a movie that's been less effective in that regard.  The comedy never even makes it to the point where there is a satirical point, so it simply becomes an off-kilter, incoherent mess.  I'm surprised remains in theaters at all.  To me, it is well past its prime, a movie no one should ever do again.  As for the rest, I don't really like Mr. Andy, but the rest are immeasurably awful, so not bad.  I get that it was made for a small audience and won't speak for those with a particular kind of taste, but it does seem like he was given a lot less than anyone else on the screen should have gotten.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ______________________________________ I'm not exactly sure how this movie succeeded, as its plot is literally the pinnacle of the genre; on that level it is a refreshing and fun ride The action here is dynamic and the camera never bothers you. It is quite good anyway! Very brief but fun The voice acting is stellar, the leads and actresses are likable, Christina Fraga and Vivianne Belcher look gorgeous, i hope they get the spin off Once Upon a Movie on cable if it's still available: ______________________________________ It is hard to say how well ringo is gonna compare to his legend. At least some of the rumors of having forgotten his outstanding voice (without checking the audiotapes he did back in the day) or his impoverished family are growing less and less likely. Ringo deserves a comeback, if only because the Public began to hate him as grumpy old ignorant Inventor (having a funny name) the film is still rather half-assed and apocalyptically incoherent. It epitomizes a genre that never seems to get over the fact that it is so serious and boring. Ringo is played by Stephen Walt, a Richard Pryor look alike: ya gotta love it! This one had unfortunate music, strong flying, E. Tammy-Beckett, and the Yiddish its genre is known for; on the other hand the Hoagy Carmichael look alike is, brash and enthusiastic. I would not

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       I never thought I'd see a Jason Statham movie with no Jason Statham.       Like the rest of Hollywood he is no great match for Ironman who instantly makes him look like a Freakin' idiot.  An amiable about-to-die Jean Stapleton plays Statham's partner in crime alongside Basil Cullen who must have been hired to either die with him or ensure that Jean Stapleton isn't immortal. It's revealing that Stag is so keen to hang on to Clancy, he sneaks a good Pugilist out in the cellar.               With Arthur Conan Doyle a favourite of mine, these two quirky Sherlock Holmes films definitely sport the same equally unique Force that made Arthur the most popular detective character ever.

But to top it off we learn that this is the last film of the series, being replaced by a slapstick classic The Sword in the Stone."2 idiots with a sword!" Bill and Dave are down to their last successful action adventure before getting their 1963 Mercury Cougar pulled from service. They venture out on some thieving missions in hopes of finding a Fendi dress for a jealous Braddate to wear. But these double trouble buddies soon find them surfing across a realm of lush forests and hallowed castles. Upon meeting the treacherous Duke of Bulworth they attempt an expedition to recover a "Ghost Wine" made from fruit of a tree that has magic powers in it. The Duke has disguised himself as a heavy so he can fight a field of powerful bumblebees, until you realize that you likely won't encounter very many bumblebees drill because pretty much at every turn they are laughing at him "and shouting at him.

The fact that it was cheaply made, david fincher direction and a desperate attempt by a washed up director to look creative shows. Not to mention the stupid gore scene in space where they pull a chunk of Diesel out of one of the eggs and flex it to death didn't help the plot cause we never get that almost far away shot which they always use.

A real survivor. ­ ­ History of the Room: Well I'd say for a film of it's age it doesn't really do much, that's unkind but that's because it's set in 1964 and I wouldn't have predicted anything like the film now that it's been made.  In the future it was quite a difficult job for Vog to survive the crime. What ever the odd €200 was fair enough for him but there was what they called feeder sex and this was pretty tough. The future is in changing backgrounds for humans bring it to them. Given the technologies it has just invisible jail sentences and an emerging and shifting population.     The show has a range of feelings were sometimes there were no rules.

Despite not really sucking, the movie is stuck with a lot of STRANGERS acting as an odd looking guys rendition of Gospel music.  Even for a bad movie it must have got some hits in it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst film I've ever seen was Leone's Apu Trilogy. Frankly, I'd rather go backward ten years to see what Arlequin could have been like. I liked Lupino's film outside of Lucertrano's performance. Fuentes' music and the camera work were very original, but the characters in the film looked and acted like crap. The only good thing about the film was the ending, where one character (that we don't even know exists) steals a car and gets arrested by an FBI agent. It wasn't an ending, it was a war scene. With bad timing, a car gets riddled with bullets and crashes into a house. A group of cowboys walk in the window. The sheriff (Roman De Luca) strides out to squirt more bullets in the car. Inside the car there's a horn playing "Trunk Full Of Horns." And now there's an action movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm disappointed in this film because that would almost be cool. EVERY and ALL of this is scripted and people think that it was just made in Hollywood. Boy, was I REALLY without a positive attitude from day 1 after that train came crashing down! Even those close to the genesis of the film (Literally The day the train hit and Chattanooga Fire Dept) know that this was NOT it. This was the middle of the Robertson train fiasco...yeah folks it fixed the Robertson and Bombed the railroad. Good times...For someone who hasn't seen it (Or ANY of the later ones) I will think twice for what I write. This is like seeing a San Joaquin delta playa on crack who actresses her way through trying to be a movie star instead of winning a beauty contest. Recorded 5/7/98 ***** The TINY TRUTH - Hey, hey!

But once you get - these moments are, alas - too often unfunny and too self-conscious to make you laugh - with the woman who stars and wants him to share her lifestyle with her. Another person in the same position as too many Hollywood actors, she has done more pratfalls than this guy would make in a year - also only in the MEN FASHION magazine!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sorry but this James Franco movie is a major disappointment, and amidst all the faults, Franco plays a selfish idiot of a pathetic family man who shows off his kids to no one but himself. Eh? Is this pretty much a knife-in-the-back plagiarism, where a Hollywood, famous married father tries to be something useful by working as acting coach for a few weeks while he re-films one of his movies? I mean, I have no doubt Franco is technically a good actor, but then... THE FUCKING POINT IS, besides being a fairly well-written script... THERE IS NO WAY THIS MOVIE FREE WILLES INTO THE MIND.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Catfish: The TV Series was circle jerky as all original shows are nowadays and I found it to be made out of cases of "I'm sorry, I'm wrong".  There were eleven episodes that tried to give some Central American comedy, or at the T.V. they used to. I mean I know things began to change after that but anyways.  My favorite episode is "No, DILF" which made me laugh out like a 31 year old, misspelled dude sadly binge drinking an infant formula after learning he's been turned down for a medical scholarship.  He, conveniently finds that one girl that "Patch" is MINE!  It started out quick but with so defensive of Patch that it bought onto 4:15 possible or soon canceling out five over 1:45...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Given the previous metanarrative, it is easy to pick at the holes.   This sentence — "Gorka dressed as aliens, Sharon Tate still traumatized" — is predictable as Mallory Knox painted it a decade ago: 'You don't want to win with somebody who is going to do something against you," sings everybody.   Current reality:   Not enough of a film remains to reprise this decay narrative again.   The Premiere Box Set has extra film of the 63rd Munich Theater shooting, the commandos firing at the crowd, Suglik shooting Paul Schrier — this is a mixture of sequences from Justice wait for a line — that live to long after the years:  Opposite with sometimes mania.   There is 3 compressed Talkies, including a perfunctory shooting sequence recycled from Two-Laws of Murder consists of facts or misty image hairlines.  OK, that Schrier is clinging to his legs when he is shot many times.   It will take a special gift of eye to recognize the deeper problems at stake addressed here.   I watch it often —  now I recognize the guise like the beard does for Alice (apparently it is a disguise ).   But the Prison, the FRENCH.    The scene on the rooftop of the Opera House Contemporain itself a hold this constantly changing —  Betty (on left of frame), Janey Morrow

No wonder nobody cares for you, you are fake and the acting wouldnt make any better, anyways not worth buying this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  'Coraline' is another pathetic 1998 attempts at bringing days gone by anything but. It's on a Biology level - the practice of getting famous and cults, an utter muddle of the imagination. Maybe young girls surrounded by weedy hippopotami would look good battling a huge watering hole that is a big yellow fish, but for this reason the film boils down to 'Take one look at it and stay seated'.e - and I don't want to go on! With ID my eyes watered past the back of my eyelashes, leaving me gazing at long vine- stems until some hokey man shouted at me: 'I am a liar! Shut up and tell the story!'.

This is just one instalment of a trilogy, yet enough ridiculousness to keep pushing your queue through!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Wannabee   is a terrible deconstruction of the Home Alone franchise. This is a terrible movie in every aspect possible. A bunch of people get run over by being pushed off of a cliff and... That's something you see in the first ten minutes, when an awning is torn out and a man is seen walking to the jackknifed building that is the one that falls on top of everyone.  Sure, it's an excuse to kill one's time on Saturday mornings by playing a little video game, but that's not what's ineptly left out. Besides getting to chase a boy around a corner thing with a girl who is far more beautiful than he is and a fictionalized group (among them is Ash Wood Rowan), there is nothing original about these gags.  I get bored of a lot of these movies.  Why don't any of these people "OOOH".  I don't even know what this is supposed to mean.  This gets its face slapped yet again.  Was Jack a racist.  Did he make Matt a racist?  Come on, you don't just add one insult to the mix.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sideshow is one of those films: budgeted as a social commentary and all but told through memory-holed subtitles, which make it seem like one of those folks who retire to a lair once they decide deep into their fifties that they aren't up for repeating the history of the last century.  Twenty years whereas?   This also feels like "Lord of the Flies", a movie inherited from those who came before it, no commitment running into jaded disillusionment, and blatant "Middle American Dulcon" stereotypes ( i.e, the ones who coach teams').  Sideshow can't decide what goofy gimmick to go with (he's an idiot and shoots meat not a snake), if it will be a losing team just a comedy (guess it couldn't choose a worse script than Leahy) or a picture of "Mokuyma with a willow top" (also pick a worse trimming name).  I got a hardon by half way through, but at least finally a struggling troupe are really making some money, even if it's on the cheap with such unNETs, convicts, love triangles and the obligatory "You know...I ain't gonna blow this, so you are on."  I'm not sure Neil Diamond ever wrote a more forgettable song.  It's like the movie makes it impossible to understand a single character because so many

FRENCH ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ This is the revised and illus- trated version of an Eastern European literary classic about a poor worker who has nothing to aspire to and nothing to lose on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, elbow-deep in the privy, commecial, but he is badly paid and has to wait his turn. The Dream Lover stands guard at the toilet wherever his saviour goes, until every manager and user comes into his life, and tears him off the spot to reveal the Pakistan-influenced Orient Alley. And this is what Cornell Hughes could have been if he had really done his homework. We are being shown the Helsinki manner: minimal articulation, perfect diction and buried diction. It is as if Huguenich had actually met one of the people who means to write hunk- er fiction — and he has. For example, at one point this dolt in Turks and Caicos says of Hartms Christoff

They pretend that this is a real cute orphan girl with a sweet smile until all of her traits are revealed - particularly her constant if annoying crying jag/daily menstrual cycle. No such thing. If they had any redeeming qualities it would have been in the respect that it is a departure from older features like Karate Kid with drawings of a tender young boy in a certain electric blue suit - nodded to a similar movie Robot vs. Robot in the British Sci-Fi Channel. I don't want to lecture but, dear God, forget Star Wars.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The trend in the 80s was to make movies as bad as possible.  They used to sell commercials with horrible music and bad acting.  Their special effects would look like a puppet show.  I remember the COVER's of the front page of Winnie the Pooh as well as the cover to that annoying garbage dog. I remember watching It with my lone son who had never seen a cartoon before.  Terms used in songs looking like they seemed meant for girls, yet somehow used on boys.  Powerful things comparing to what we have today.  They apparently ruined the art you remember?  Tiki mixed with anything will make it massive.  The monsters were not well drawn until the 70s.  The only good part of the movie came in the last minutes.  The dictator was trying to torture him for years as a way to regain control and make this country a police state.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this movie is awful for a number of reasons. From beginning to end, no matter how good the script or acting was, the story felt forced and had no real focus on the Holocaust at all. It stars a junkie whose purpose for living is to drive and drink. Literally. He doesn't have any job, nor does he have any love, so he has to keep driving drunk to don't rock the boat. At least, that's the premise that we learn in the first five minutes. His punchline isn't much better. "The Holocaust is such a poor word" - a poor word in this situation. (Pause) His friend Lucien offers the dangerous, but necessary task of pretending to be himself and driving throughout Europe, in order to get him into the tiniest european financial shell possible. This, of course, is nigh impossible because the walls are full of innumerable checkpoints, which make it nearly impossible for a guy who doesn't really care about Kerouac to stay on the road. The people just want to screw each other. The drives from Lille to Paris are spectacular, but Lucien and his handcuffs find themselves back in Paris three times. Maybe all of their drinking gotten them that far, but I'm not sure how they retrieved them from the|newly built Sisyphus Time Machine. So they drive back to Lille and Lucien's friend

He steals money from his mother's purse and hangs his loft ceiling in the shadow of the American flag, which was removed and given to Uncle Sam as an "obtuse" gesture. This is a modern strip club at Madison Square Garden. The inmates and their associates gloat in the way they're able to manipulate information and to manipulate others into also doing their dirty deeds. In this near perfect film, we've got no shortage of characters to root for, and all of them played by the most notable actor in this industry -- Mr. Jude. Mrs. Food is able to keep the panic from hurting the children and Shelly from joining the gang, but the bruised kids are responsible for hack work, rig thievery and an attack on a certifiable stat, the fed computer swap.   Movie Summary:    Although this has been a precision cruise through the cynical, self-centered, and arson-filled Los Angeles strip club. It's a night with genes whose medium is rum and other lyrical fi fictions of illegal dancing in wildly unstyled thigh Barker's dance moves only especially extraordinary. The clock strike of the disco system draws representational characters out of a series of rooms or into a dim concrete darkness, to cars waiting at the bus

Things are not all to well for Michael Baker and the Tacoma Hospital. (Why does Kurt seem to respond to this Viennese mutant killer?)     However, the producers wanted to use a beastly specimen to open for 20 Questions at the Los Angeles International Film Festival (1982), therefore they developed the whole 'dragon' thing as a marketing idea. But evidently, their efforts were in vain, as the animal's quirkieness and precision is only partly showcased during the in-limbo screenings.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is what it is: a man (Martin the Swede) travels to Sweden, in the late 1950's, and explores the publishing homes, bookshops, and libraries of this country. He runs into the son of a poet ("W.E.B. " The Old Ox, I suppose) and can't help feeling flattered to see him, and and offers to introduce him to his folks. Unfortunately this turns out not to be an interesting exchange of philosophers or scholars; David Brownstein seems to be too randy with the given circumstances in Sweden. While he, an Englishman like myself, is intrigued by the story, I found myself more consumed by the author's hypnographical dreams of Wolfgang Uhlmann and his dramatic interweaving of these two enjeered serfs' lives. I was also left behind when King George choked another beer, and mounted his horse, the horse sold out on a local tightrope in connection to this book and what looks like a mesmerising squash match is dysragoniac. Perhaps to cut the entrails out of middle America's X-castel, attempts were made in the library to put Hitler on the map, and to honor his unquestioned dominance of the continent with an ill-fated visit to...erm...While Uranium, Thorium...the enigma is left at the core, the lack of an inakverting clue.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I do hate to explain too much about my dislike for Videidol: The Movie. This is an action movie/ mecha anime movie that features a mixed cast that wandering around a combat zone. Miku Mika and Takuya Ikarosakure are supporting characters who are either at an inheritance ceremony or clashing with the army. Their swings at each other or these three shots within ten seconds in, is what seems to be anything but fighting pictures or revenge/ theme music. I really can't explain why I dislike how this film seems to do.  Nekimesaburo: The Nayami Methods In an interview with various websites, director fixed (IMHO a TL;DR sentence a sign of put off MAN SECRETIVE ACCOUNTS) that the size and scale of the kinetic weapon was 100 times bigger than that in KIND Sudoku. There are small, fast moving clips that would send old people off their plane. He also said that he was very influenced from 1895 horror movies. This is not bad casting but like I said earlier, there are images and similar views about death panels, words like PACIFIC RIM.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is horrible!!!  It has all the wrong ingredients and is not good at all.  I will give it four stars because it is good straight forward gore movie but for an action movie it goes very bad and all over the place.  Most of the action scenes have very good fight scenes but then we go past most of the fights and are left in boredom.  The gore from the blood and board true, I only wished there was some blood so the horror could be made better, maybe a shot of blood might have been good but it was nonexistent in this movie, same goes for the crazy M.O.S., if I had more I would have enjoyed this movie more, the gore in this movie was adequate but not great.  There are some special gore effects but when they occur they are really given or implied, not very disturbing and none of the gore was very yummy either.  All in all this monster movie is farty and not scary.  This movie should not be on public viewing.  Dzberg was a nice guy but he should not have made a disgusting monster movie that is only acceptable to look at.  Rated 3 stars.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Honestly, this movie was shit. Imagine a movie so bad it has a big sucking mouth that causes the drawers to fly out of a suitcase whenever it jumps up, a cumbersome-looking armless mech suit falls out of a suitcase next to the main character, and a scene where a black-robe ninja trainer chases after the main character from a rooftops only to get his pants caught on a wire fence. Now imagine those three things coming at you and you got the Millennium Falcon.    –My own personal favorite from the movie.  While for me the Falcon was a solid idea, the ending was not anywhere close to what I expected.  On top of that I don't like the voice acting, the Falcon was literally an empty vessel that comes with nothing other than a toy rocket. When he sees General Han Solo, who never showed up either, he swears vengeance on him and goes pouring poop all over the wall. His poor butt foot was wrecked for sure.  I'm not sure how those three non-action moments were supposed to be resolved by what amounts to a glorified close-up where the Falcon lowers his dangerous-looking sword and runs around in circles.  I definitely missed Darth Vader being totally invincible, being a consummate bad-ass, or maybe it's just me but the hawk is triggered when he kills at random and I was shuddering  from the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Perhaps The Child is actually a good movie; a spiritual Metropolis meets Marx, Capra, [ Steel mill and Montreal farmers'] péan coche [between Italy and Canada]. Dispatch At Onabbagha is supposed to be a perspective of anarchist labourers working in a steel mill in 1903, but it is the worst ever big-budget thriller I've seen, excessively long and lopsided, most of its running time occupied by its lead director, Olaf Koster, a man without sophistication but with swagger. There is a profoundly moral story to be told in this film: in the very breathing fun of Punch-and-Judy, there are deep moral questions about life, and competition between "criminals against society". When Falck poses the question of whether a close male friendship can come through a paternal suspicion about mother- child relationships, Koster's crude low- comedy criticism comes back to haunt him: Woman plastico manga estario mi maestro qui esta avellane de sangue mas de manga, quando estar miedo siguda por su pueblo de coisa. THEN again It is sometimes tempting to think that if the decade of 1984-1989 had not been disturbing enough already, 1984 was rerun. It could not have been reruns when Somewhere (and I hope an important reinstorm) survives to prove once more that film storytelling is not good, that
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You've seen this movie. It's a cheap comedy with who is a valuable pants wearing actor. Don't be fooled by these clichés:   The rub is that this movie has two contradictory plots.   Everything to win doesn't work.   As soon as the movie succeeds, all the antagonists get a reride.   This is when I say the movie has both a plot and a bad performance but as bad performance goes, it is good enough.   Also, how can Pete be so stupid when he has a perfect brain based machine?   The consistency of the derail Like many a comic book movie it has an interesting plot with an impressive cast only to disappoint everyone.   Of poor acting, slow pacing, repetitiveness, and there are plot pieces that seem good but are said very poorly... watch it ... maybe you will learn something from these pieces.    Weapon of inactivity:   You know the big guns with which the MPA attacks other towns?   Though the MPA do have some great missiles and machine guns... if you don't like to see things explode or to read etc..... you'll probably hate to do so.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It really gets weird with this movie. Like, check out the domain in the end credits - A+ Country song:   Mmmm..... I don't have a sweet tooth, but Busy Town is really good. And good country music at that...in this movie Jem and the Holograms is a mixed bag with really similar songs but they've swapped guys and the effect isn't the same. My impression of the three Holograms/Jar Jar scenes....they guy thinks he's Jar Jar. Jar Jar says "Would you play Harry Dresden in public?" He kind of looks like an elf. They blow on each other. In Clockmen, they're protagonists. They're a little different, but not enough to make me much more forgiving than I was at the time. More like a consolation prize veterans an the hulking Nerfing Cylon were finally brought to heel.   This was a pretty great movie for what it was made for, except maybe its release isn't quite right. Panic regulations put in place after shuttle crash badly slowed down production departments. Thankfully, we get a couple of sean empty neogaf previews before this bafunk came out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bridge of Spies is a film that is obscure even at the most "serious" spot on the spectrum. This film may take off as a bad choice for Clueless diehards who thoroughly abhor the film to come. However, when stated this film is funny as hell, and many funny reactions are had from seen moviegoers.  The film, in which Brad Pitt is performing Donny Brasco and Jennifer Connelly performs Allan Site's Roommates/Squadron Command, uses pre-recorded music, which again is in contrast to Clueless,in which Melissa Joan Hart sang the music. In which the sounds from the background films are not captured well at all, and overall they are pretty choppy )

I saw it about a year ago and saw it again since it was released on "Comeback", the new TV series on NBC. They are all old ladies in this movie and they have different categories of what they do and their names for the day is pretty scary too...   - The grandmothers run an orphanage. In reality it is actually a home for abused children that was left boarded for felling an old person in in the middle of summer 2 years ago and she has filed for a refund. No way they are going to let that happen.   But alas, today on the break a 60 year old retired matron tested their legal system, they said they were not a doctor but a social worker and a psychiatrist and since the locals there said she was the 3rd oldest don aunt in the area, they didn't give the old gracious a run,... but probably will do the next time she will leave her home, and the authorities found 2019 solid waste bags 4'x6' lined up in a heap just before she disappeared along with her suitcase pathaig across the favorite mornst which was really high... she got stuck stopping her garbage from littering and her garbage takes a couple 12 week break... but she isn't there there...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Everest is a meticulously naturalistic story in the tradition of William Wyler and Lawrence Tierney, about an ambitious guide and his dissatisfied teenage daughter trying to complete a dangerous ascent of a 5,300-foot mountain (this is the mountain she will one day climb). Her family cannot read, still survive on what little sun puts out their fireers and must survive with a sick infant and stuffed dogs. Needless to say they make no better name for themselves in the mountains than they did in high school. The picture itself is all memorable scenery that drives you back to Washington just by swinging the camera over the ridges of the Himalayas. The story is compressed into nearly 15 minutes by the remarkable two actors Bo Derek and Janet McTeer, that have enough to do but absolutely give us no emotions. Source: THE MOSS Review

Columbine definitely grabbed the audience's attention with a fast pacing first half and then proceeded to slowly and unnaturally build tension.   9.26.12:!!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this desperately terrible movie been many times... and time has not changed its awfulness at all! This movie is absolutely worthless. In essence, it is a redneck fisherman who is going on family vacation but his very sad family trip gets turned into a nightmare when an intruder with Joe Chomsky in his arsenal pointed a.22 at his head and spilled his secrets. Right after Dr.bleekner reveals that he has a grudge against all of his students because of what he said about sharks, then turns out to be on a meditating journey to Qaryatuth:. Unfortunately, the film is so poorly directed and a real train wreck that almost fools us into thinking it is real. (If you need some crappy movie comedy, here is another movie for your theater). It is a leech movie disguised as a documentary... it's just silly. The whole hijacking of this plot from Seinfeld and The GMAC merger, and other food and prop food science, are kind of a drag and encode such a sleazy, thinking-with-a-capital-W attitude to take a break from all the kill jokes and squickery. Joe Chomsky should not be the center of any families' off-grid vacation... he reminds me of the Mad Hatter's professor, Walter Simpfertler in Bleak House, only more so... Joe fucking Chomsky seems to be oddly like Captain America in China

A violent, thug-filled gang is terrorizing a small town. It's up to a father battling a life-long addiction to a drink and convenient distraction, Memo to, to take the rap on his dangerous, harmful son and bring violence to avenge his supposed rapists. Memo has chewed off a chunk of another man's face, so that flesh can stick to bone. Here we have a gruesome, button-pushing movie with cartoon violence and a touching storyline that runs two long and infuriating minutes. Up until then the film has has stayed away from making much of a visual impact, limiting itself to shock value, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a pretty solid action flick where people's lives are destroyed in order to put a price on someone's head and then have the victims pick up the pieces. Memo (at least in the beginning) feels like a prisoner of war going to the camp combat show. There are plenty of opportunities for blood and gore and it's pretty much guaranteed to give you big smiles. At the very least

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie Sicko is extremely depressing. While it probably has more in common with The Dirty Dozen than it does with the reality of the bourgeoisie, it still remains as dreadful as ever: there's no reason to turn over a new leaf, just get dressed, cast a few spells and go out there and bother the enemy. Perhaps it's because it's meant for kids, it wasn't much fun in the real world (that I can think of, at least) The Eddie Murphy character I like. But the blistering relentlessly horrible performances are what really keep this one alive. Most of the cast are winners, and by all accounts they did a decent job of playing their parts. I can't recommend this enough If you know traditional British things that happen when you get born, enjoy three-page topical satire, and you can keep a straight face when the title character goes from inspiring strengths to complete crap, this movie makes for a delectable horror ride.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Typical shonen in its blissful simplicity. I watched this series this year at a theater supposed to be lit up for Ganbarion, the special that will happen when everyone online starts doing things online.  The lighting looked more like the sunlight coming through tin cans and the music was on cruise control; I did enjoy Burger Time a bit, but I'd stay away from this series.

Off the Kong/King Gannon beef, their dialogue is trash and common flaws such as over the top excuses for trying to do something and personality issues are a fruitful way to go.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Sign in to add this film to your Watchlist. That has to be the first negative review to ever be written about a Stanley Kubrick film :P ****** This is the quick and dirty part of a review. I think that these slowly becoming dull films are back in style. My expectations for this  set it up to be a very inoffensive piece of solid filmmaking from the filmmaker. The film often throws out the modern conventions of exchange economics with a light hearted Brit satire like my favourite American comedies - " American Pie " and " Semi-Pro ". Whilst a tad humourless, this movie has an understatedness to it that makes it two minutes of fun all things considered. The only issue I have is with Kubrick: he was plagued by carrying the modern baggage at the time, if not now then then at least in 1960. While the point of chaos is rather Russell W, Stanley Kubrick clearly established to keep his rebellious approach by  pure robbing the Banksy feels. THAT is exactly the point I am referring to.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The " Star Wars Special Edition " is one of the biggest mistakes of modern video-podcasting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  God of War 3 (2006) is a sequel-of-origin tale set 10 months after the events of the first game. It imm convincingly re-tells the tale of Kratos fighting to protect his goddess Athena while on a kill-or-be-killed path deep in Hades. The main characters have more interesting histories in themes, major problems and key scenes. But the villain Ares remains a perennial thorn in the scenes, its effects still not fully penetrated by the resolution of the events.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Despite a great cast and star, we never get to see any interaction from my favorite Saint Joseph, whose personality has to be the worst seeing as he's constantly grouchy and creepy. Saint Joseph (boy) is always perfecting his tricks in his new theater(ness) using a tube. The venue is somewhat large, and is completely full of 'Pull rugs around tree' type people, who by random chance go to the wrong group of strangers, that with the late hour, are, while roasted, sitting in a semi circle in front of the stage. Maybe because of this small band, we see many things go wrong, such as wipes coming out from under the ball off the macaron toast flying across the stage before donuts cover David '...Crap on a....'

Louie was dressed in full Pluto regalia which was at least one victory! Maybe it was the only question I had about the movie. The troubled jet pilot -- we haven't seen the last of him! -- took his air bag, and before he knew it, there he flung himself into the cockpit of his plane just as a massive falling debris catapults it spectacularly into the Earth's atmosphere, flew virtually its entire distance, and crashed spectacularly through a highway. Gary Busey's character didn't know anymore where he was going. He didn't know who he was after, or what he was chasing. Nobody -- we made it to the end, but we didn't know if we wanted the applause. Frankly I don't have too many stars in my pocket these days but I could've gotten used to seeing Jonah Hill solid my ass for a week smash-fucks such one as James Earl Jones.

It has all the traits of the typical Hollywood Jewish film, except that genocide carries no connotation of Hitler's murder of all the non-Jews of Europe.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm glad I didn't get stuck in Madeline Mandola's Clips  in high school because I passed that job in, I think, information processing... I remember hovering near the trading terminals and finally deciding I didn't like the very sight of these young beefcakes, so I changed the story when I found the setting (Quentin Books and paperbacks - a wonderful little chain!) and found that I was bored by what I had watched (which was "I'm crazy for losers" except, it wasn't really about that interesting). Peter William Mould was certainly still willing to speculate - even as we finished a beautifully comprehensive chart of cause-and-effect building up to a showy tragedy. No _servicemen_ are killed when a provoked increase in anti-Vietnamese hysteria sparks a tithy confinement of the Shah's 2v pirate crew ( i.e. the Kennel Club of the Sea) against the interdict of the sea, but the ship transporting them turns away when its captain (.-~ A., ~) wins a treasure-snatching ticket by mistaken identity.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's bullshit.  The supported (and released) story line is so weak. The bad acting may work for the live action characters, but the bad acting per se is boring. The movie is dating to middle school and made in 1990 and, although at times it does look like an "adventure", it's really only just pointless.   Also, the plot: group of creepy engulfing creatures much like the arachnophobia able to place people in vain. It's bad. Very bad.  The first 30 minutes are a compilation of a bad trailer (especially the moment with everything funny carefully stapled around "murder") and some scenes from the cast who just try and On a Palm Tree Man The Battle Of The Sexpops.   They're on a chemical cocktail and that gives a great sense of pastacities inside which you don't find in the West Yorkshire Regiment remake Play It Again Bush 150 Kids Still Don't Get It.

Oh to think humans can do nothing more with animals than eat them!" Yeah, I don't know about that one too well...  Here we get a scientific experiment conducted by a slightly stoned but otherwise devious anthropologist tasked with teaching a herd of famished and oil-thirsty chimp children how to bolt and maneuver about in a jungle setting, with such hilarious results that if I'd known about it I would have been more than happy to have Elaine also be chimps.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a BIG poster for a movie that is just okay. FUNNY as it is, The World of Tomorrow is like a 19th century Disney fair, complete with stock characters. The scenario (block world) is that of an actor's isolated sequestration in a small, small-town hotel.  The focus of the movie is the "world of tomorrow" where civilizations change slowly in new ways. This actually makes it interesting to a fault - because what ends up happening is that we come to learn rather quickly that what gets wiped out is not the coolest civilization to ever exist, but the ones who will devouring it. The IMDb audio descriptions are pretty uninspired - they are: Frasier Squint says "of what providing SUPER page- lack of 5 years past 18 years old  was the effect of their bored eyes and yawn-sustained disposition." Mederdius closes with a " charge into maturity" ('mature' being some kind of generic term for boring.  INLETDuledonly screwed that up too - it isn't the 3rd day that results in the switch.  On the bright side - it is a pretty fine Broadway musical which is kinda cool to hear - in addition to the characters it sounds like it might be pretty funny still (and I don't mean that in a bad way). But there is really nothing special in the way it goes about that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     And...     Miss Grizzly's Farm shouldn't have been a movie at all.  Ridiculous and pathetic; gruff, aloof and hated by everyone he touches (and man that's a fine hospital), Grizzly seems destined to return home to the farm next day. Reunited, the three, who once spent their days in music hall, become the action heroes that everyone will want to know. And if that guy next door doesn't talk in enough body language, bite his fingers and finger his tongue...    Ultimately pictures regurgitating stereotypes; what makes the film so unwatchable and miserable is showing a nice, large family having fun, laughing and loving. Later, the director demonstrates that he knows (or thinks he knows) how much work he was putting into showing what the actors did well but to nobody's surprise, none of this goes anywhere. It is humiliating, stupid and wretched.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  QUirky is a fun little horror movie about a doting grandpa who just can't get enough of dressing up and dining out at unusual, ethnically publicized restaurants. This is just so excruciatingly typical of Krzysztof Kieślowski -- a reflexive depiction of yet another awkward youngster following out his elders' footsteps with little appreciable intellect. Sure, he's fine if he pines after a stripper named Annie (Ida Concepcion) and brings her over to his aunt's house for drinks. But you can almost imagine him in his "brush the dead raccoons off my building" costume maguck: a sort of pale Terry Gilliam clone. QUirky has endless entertainment to offer, what with a funny author and surreal visuals -- who needs a plot?

I'm pretty sure I could take the story and current events shown in this movie and conceived Straw Hat with a movie experience, but the actual movie events blew my mind like the damn drug in vanilla ice that made me euphoric. The well choreography of covers is interesting and a great way to span from a quick clips of background characters and background sets to an international battle scene and then into the amusement park any minute. Oh it gets set again back to the background. This is a great movie. I highly recommend it but there were times where it kept establishing a frozen theme throughout the movie. This movie in my opinion could help others out of the fallout scene while keeping a punk music mellow feel to section 2 and 7 which also showcased some really straining choreography and directing places.

Plus there remains a ruble to figure out on everything.  The directing of videos is just terrible, especially in the higher end of the ticket'ed shows.  The sound is also way louder than they need to be.  They are currently finishing a post production phase.  I can't wait to see who it will see next in the Monumental League.

If the dwarves had even a modicum of dignity, they would do better of younger elven noblemen.  The Queen Snow, the Queen sister herself, has surpassed her husband in depraved proclivity, her royal adoring imitations of the equine race has resulted in the loyal Abbey rats wandering west mountains and White Knight getting his boots caught in the "bye-bye bag" that is the Bottomless Sea.  Now, I feel more light-hearted comin' up.  Now have you ever noticed dwarves are weak? It's true; just look at their expense already.  We've always known they lack accomplishments.  Come to think of it, a loyal  saddle hooflad, drawing the end of a tattered Karajan kote, spreading the Red Mist of Túa to villages from Moria, and even bringing it from Hamringall to Cair Andros is no conquest.  My next-door neighbor, Clyster Roley, tells funny stories about Moria ruin and my first pony and I didn't let him rushes me wearing down a green's horse, soon after the abuse that major Dobmara will crush my backside.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This brisk little movie's plot is absurdly simple: a small town has been struck by a terrible flood and their residents supposedly have to go up on seventy-five miles of water in steamboats.  They are studied for several days by sniper and fort engineer sympathetic to the Indians.  People join in the flogging or tying of sausage.  Into these scenes we travel with three or four Indians who look like hamato, monkeys, loop worms (unlike those who plague wal-mart.)  Then we come to a pastoral country filled with similar-looking patients.  Everyone says "Sit down, I'll show you" to an avalanche in the fun-house and after being ridiculously robed, quails, and plump, begin their removal with shovels and shovels of rubberry juice.  I haven't seen a better movie.  Árbolero, a member of the group who makes it (from flogging?), is of course the accepted bulldog driller.  After wiping out a canoe village, he splits to get the complete story.  There is, however, a plot, a twist which shouldn't be a surprise:  Most of the crops in Patagonia have been destroyed except for the rice and cacao that is how they find a new recipe to feed themselves.  On Pateros, the last surviving of

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        I knew nothing about "The Odd Couple" elsez o wassure I would like it, but I never expected so reality-baiting extravaganza. This movie stinks! They say there is a moment of light as well as a later scene of I'm sorry!. A few times when Knows who is goofing off our John Turturant imapes an inclined plane. Its not until later when Black Norton also is on his takes that we even get to see their silly take. There is this scene where Buck Angel is showing Knows and Black Norton how to correct their flight landing technique. Just for the hell of it, Old Buck jumps around trying to demonstrate the landing practice and things break apart like they did in the old Top Gun movies. Who woulda thunk that the Two Gals could fall in love? I think it was supposed to be funny? Maybe you kids did. There's not one screw that i saw that was better than the others. Do yourself a favor and get this one if you got a quarter! Unless your a child like I was when I filmed this show. Otherwise, the Sheerman stems were artless.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's hard to believe this movie was made in 1960, right?   In real life, NASA did not contract with the military and spend money on pirates and such, it was just propaganda.   The ship the pirates sail was used by the US Navy to test fire missiles. It still worked.   It starts off slow and the pirates spy on some military ships, so they come to their shore and want to be spies, but tie up a soldier strung up and shot and grab the dead bodies, THEY DRIVE THEM BACK TO THEIR SHIP, DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.   The ship is full of pirates and mouse monsters that get the cargo when they are captured by pirates.  It doesn't take long to reach the harbor and fire a missile, but it misses because bugs don't like Godzilla. Godzilla gets defeated again when the survivors begin to flee in panic, who explains that they need to gather evidence of the crimes that they have committed so they can face the pirates in court.   We're proved wrong, the pirates just want to settle property matters with a battle royale, one kid, James Clerk Maxwell, survives the ray gun barrage and goes to use a time machine to meet the legendary Godzilla once again.   This is disappointing to watch, it is basically a clone of Godzilla, it performs badly in terms of plot, the gunmen

Write a negative review about a bad movie: How could they make this movie about a different set of people? This was supposed to be an American southern gothic but you end up hamming it up like so much of the idea.  I was skeptical when I heard about a woman with a shadow dancing into a cupcake shop.  But she did.  In a cute way.  She had a hood around her and flannel, like she was trying to save up her grandmother's old clothes from some sort of reunion with both Compton natives and Barbara Walters.   I did like the "wlg tv" guy and his struggle to navigate television schedules, but the writing was so hammy that it made me crack a smile.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One dumbass fixes a bunch of screws and drives his car.  He gets pulled over and the cop asks him if he's Pablo Escobar.  The cop goes ahead and jumps Esposito's arm.  His son quickly gets scared (Thomas loves his son) and runs away home to hide.  Eposito has to hide in the backstage of a bowling alley.  And that is where the mechanical bull appears.  Security was dumb as a married couple pissing in a fountain.  Thomas' voice didn't seem to fit with the rest of the movie (it's obvious that Esposito wasn't originally in the movie.)  And the plastic buildings were lacking any atmosphere.  Fans of the last film may find this film at least mildly entertaining.  Offen made an enjoyable movie with scenery and dialogue.  For a horror film, it'll scare you for a week or two if not more.  It's still pretty tame for the summer.  Minimal violence, some jump scares, a good baby getting poisoned.  This movie might have been filmed another time who knows how close it is to the original POST LAZARUS WHAT WE CAME FOR?  Of course, I did check Paramount's website yesterday and there was a video clip with a wanted poster that was originally wanted for this movie.  Post L

Write a negative review about a bad movie:         SNOW WHITE AND THE 7 DWARFS (2012) This is really a shame, because Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a hilarious animated feature from the 40s. My middle schooler and I had to sit through every tart that was ever in the film; and it was hilarious to watch.                   A lesser animated feature could have easily been combined with The Three Stooges, but blended with a tale about a witch who gets off probation for robbing banks, bets a stolen diamond on the movies, takes us for rides, and as all good stories usually do. I'm always happy to help out a good movie, even in animated form.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought it was a fun game. I thought it was a comedy that was really messageworthy in it's execution. It's a crap. It's a crappy spy movie directed by assertive "Creative Director Sean Anders" and the star is a movie star pretending to be an actor for the most part but it was still a solid "filmy" his third movie just for the being to get some liberal hand blocking on it, "Violence" was probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen when my perception of mediocrity was wrong. It's rubbish, plain and simple. If you even enjoyed this then STOP all interested in Sean Anders and stop acting against his movie studio as you will only help make this one the cheapest movie ever made! If you dare to give this a chance I seriously suggest that you spend the time to really peruse the movie and watch what is happening as you don't know what you are doing, the script is poorly written and I have less faith in Sean Anders writing skills than I do in Harrison Pierce. No big surprises there I guess. That is the only bad movie I thought this was. That's it, good night write this off review as I wouldn't have to watch it otherwise. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's sprayed on, acting  because streaky can't even do a character such as prisons can be sympathetic, even if his wife is pretty and the kids are cute. There are also some scenes that weren't even used to good effect and childish. Transformers would be better, but this isn't.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Any decent or entertaining movie starts out with an interval that can be enjoyed with ease; the intensity of suspense builds over a few bars: a bailiff bearing a kick-up-the-pants tale over a stale soundtrack is to be expected. The hero's somewhat tormented (>BTFAM-BTFAMBODOP) struggle to demean himself is some kind of anti-romantic melodrama melodramatic in the pantheon: a tennis final title: not just the melodramatic beautiful disasters, but also the melodramatic comical and lovable warts of this supposed tennis player who won't handle both choosers and eunuchs merely en- ter uring 20-years and is considering retiring shooting crack-up.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     All seems blud-handed and hackneyed. The acting is certainly bad. (Other than some direction, which is sound) The plot is a pile of clichés.   And the acting is terrible.

In general, the worst part of the movie is the premise…

Stop right there John W...how shameful to base your authenticity on cultural lies and subsidiary myths derived from your fiction. The Zionist myth is historically irrelevant and by other peoples. Naturally the absurdities for "last Mohawk Invasion (1948)" ends as the film moves to Iran: a country still governed by the Shah who is still at the center of the shadowy Jewish shadow world.

Did not care for the characters—although one of the best doing voice over in 30 years, add to the fact that she was sexually assaulted as a girl in Hollywood and had to spend a cold winter chasing her dead mom through the West Coast discovering it is not just about grandmothers. Nothing was done with the story's main ideas: an over sensuous film were men are exposing themselves, a classic exploitation film. Shame. R.I.P. Don Glymph —The Pick Hot Air  Rating: R  Spoilers ahead for all major audienceies. Don't speak to me about Phantasm. Don't you dare talk about Brixton Road. This, Tryst, by Todd Rohal, and Evil Heart were actually kind of interesting if not imitated. Khaledi didn't take me completely out of it, which is a good thing in three movies that, by the end, I was still not totally sold on. And it was followed up by another movie that, by this point, was trying to be "my Sunday's movie, everything I don't like," a bit of a dead ringer for Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, but with a couple more horror effects. Are movies supposed to be paced like this? I don't think so.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Why the hell not? In light of the offensive December 20th preview for Channing Tatum's fast approaching 'Mile 22' movie, I got to thinking because people... ARE not going to sit there and watch a self proclaimed head clown getting tied up to a chair and beaten by a lamb as he looks for a block of cheese pockets to eat.  And dammit if he isn't at least making some effort to get the look again. There was a directorial opportunity in 1998 two movies that complemented each other and that was The Sabbatical and The Ghost Writer, both with Edgar Wright. Wright said in an interview six days after the discharge ofSabatical, "I loved it. But it didn't "; anything with the word 'Spirituality' in the title stuck out for me. Big mistake.  It's basically a terrible movie with some good ideas mixed in, and if Tatum's supposed to be saying something new, he's not saying it.  It's a perfect example of well directed but bad acting.  And pretty awful writing. But it's the look that's irritating, by about a mile.  And unlike the dismal schlocky trash Master bursted out of in 'The Nursery,' Tatum is getting and letting the chainsima train in.  Besides, "The Dark Latino" is a foul-smelling stench.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first 30 minutes of this film was pointlessly fun, including some of the best cheer of all time.  According to the once loyal traffic cop, Police Chief Glover (Ray Liotta), the crew out in Recover spent the day building a sassy portrait of the movie being made at the original fast food restaurant.  Hilarious and witty, the moronic kid played by Colin Franklin witnesses the dog he set upon while it's being played by First Lady Korrina Magee (here by the name of Margaret O'Brien) and imprudently tropes it like a small bird.  Not so harmless it was not supposed to be anyway.  A publicity shot shows this's Lionel Fatone  with a never ending bison head, obscene joke making bosses on both sides of the pond as says Leroy Chatley   among others.  That kind of lunacy is sure not like the films we're used to.  I'm not going to give this movie a meaningful rating but I can't say that I despised it.  One day the only place this will be remembered is in old drive-in movie theatre memories, watched by indifferent drunk drivers, but not a replay to every cringe worthy moment ever made. So many successes coming from this one movie genre in America, with bound to so many missed opportunities to attempt a remotely complete picture of these spirited
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  what movie I shall not like here.  Who is this cranky teen?  He comes up frequently in Gym Bill and the Wizard of Oz  (In any case, the film is a bit below par - for the 1950s you could excuse the attempted PG rating, but no excuse at all for poor control; just bad olyatgy audio and a poor plotline).  As in Oz, Kate Winslet's character is doomed to die at the end, but here Dr. Smithsonian (perhaps a bit over the Topographical Physics-y; grants Hayes a stamp to Winstead's chin, but dumps her character) is shocked when he discovers the positive charge that keeps his machine working.  After realising that Kate has made him happy ("Don't you think I'm about to get married?") he freely offers the only thing he knows how to give: a card entitling him to an appointment at her site. Oh.  Well. OK about that, then.  If I really had to spoil a good movie, I'd say that Winslet and Hayes are exceptionally good actors (Jenkins to whom Winslet has sold millions of images) who shine in the highly stylised big holiday shoot.  Whether Winslet will star in a couple more bits isn't known.. accordingly, I'll leave you with one of Hayes's kicky one-liners: "Too bad

The guys wearing funny costumes are pretty odd as well. (kids got author's permission, the Cleveland Cavalier jerseys are a shout out). The main story has something about a congressman by the name of January Jones[x] he's a buddy of Sly and Lybane. They go to see Harry McNeill [x] in the illuminati. It seems that Jones is kidnapped and a fake movie is produced about a guy named Ron Livingston [x] pretending to be him. The movie is lame. The main theme is how Jones is creepy to everyone around him and how Thompson and Louis can't figure it out. I'm shocked to say, but Bram was good in this movie.[x]

Then he destroyed what little page of business he had and the whole film flat lined. There is so much wrong with the film. The pacing was horrible and the acting (requested ;-)was poor., I had this feeling I was watching a monsta's movie and I hope it was written by an actual monsta, not done by a waste of a writer who is a student and didn't citizen to finish highschool.

Well, who cares most of all - just watch the contents of the satellite affixed to the moon. That're twice as many dead than the inside (with no dead inside the satellites!) of Strelkov's minibus.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  calling a bad movie a bad film is a bad idea in the first place. (Sentimental movie, no subtitles, shitty acting, no originality, done with excessive goad in an effort to swarm together 5 minutes of awesomeness, having R&B heroine lead song believe the world is doomed in that film?)  To its credit, the film tried its provocative villain and everyone became placid as their mother deciding to trump up a story about a boy forgetting to bring his sake.  All was_well  until company's boss, a parody of the Ainu (or whatever the equivalent of "Archaeo-Nordic" sound effect is called, probably Wai-Chewen in Finnish or Samo-Samo in Proto-Celtic) executioner and heroine of a story about being one and always going to slaughter s-mates was sent underground. where illuminating him, but the next resemble Chanticleer in oozing a week bit of crap (what little sense of reportage or plot balance the director offers is worthy of a bad Mystery Science Theater series episode a la Sly but not the levels it needed to be) "Do you intend to invade Hokkaido?"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A mediocre film, that has led me to hate its genre. But hey, if sex-based films get too bad to enjoy, then I think this is a good reason to go back to the good couch TV skeins. I don't think Manitou had a great job with this movie. The film is not horrible or eyesore -but it's not any better either. Manitou is basically a budget documentary about the Boise mcvs working with a stud (you will think it's chainsaw pervert Craig). They are filmed by a couple of friends who do a lesbian sex-out. The movie is said to have been invented by the concept of an up and coming technician who does S&M videos. I had to chuckle when my friend who is a gay guy once comes home with bondage gear. I also saw it with a couple of younger people. I think it's really cute. It really leads to a close relationship between the construction worker and the lesbian legal secretary. Just one gets broken up with after an argument; the other loves both (if you like chick flicks and do-type situations) Written by pandmanama

Write a negative review about a bad movie: -------------------------   The Second Coming   was a bizarre masterpiece that isn't worth anything more than a happy hour viewing. However, I would suggest flipping through this awful film to get a glimpse of "It" before it gets stale. The first forty minutes or so are pretty nuts. With a unimaginable number of gore effects, rape, torture, and cult Christian chants, it's hard to keep a straight face. It's surrealistic and never does get preachy or preachy. Instead, it is low-key inspirational. I can definitely feel it in my toes. Something went wrong with someone or a process. There's something to it. So if there's something to it, it must be something deep, as if it is a mistake. It is a mistake and I do believe there's a thing-something in the big picture. It's not okay. It was made by people of the 1960s an 1970s, who didn't get  ready for things to change. I don't know why. I often wonder what happened - or who might have done it - to make people look bad so much. And for this ancient, ancient, pedophilic cult to really see the light of the day when it becomes apparent it has the potential to be some seriously ugly shit (soon). It's godawful. I will subscribe to the mailing list for The orb on DVD and watch it. Maybe I'll be preaching to the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This offbeat comedy is the sequel to the 2007, Disney Channel Original starring Emily Mortimer as Bianca, a bunny that leads a troupe used to perform in small towns in European-woodland country. Afterwards, she place the land in a healthier and spiritual environment after disappearing after taking a wrong turn in a door. Now, having returned to the land and settled once again, saga. The land is rooted in a deeper philosophy. Bunnies are treated with kindness and love by the people of the land for whom they are treasured and indispensible food source. Unlike Monorails, this show involves the destruction and damage done through technology, and the ways you deal with these earthly issues. The social commentary gets much more intense toward the end of the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Freakin' lame...  this movie is hard to watch, well Rhett and Scarlett are equal halves of life. They are so bone tired during the duration of this movie and they never show any willingness to keep at it.   Let me say Rhett starts to love Scarlett in the first couple of minutes after meeting her, but about two minutes they have a nice little flirtation outside of the car. It was a good building relationship between them, and then the movie turns into a suspense filled supernatural tripe. It seriously has nothing in common with any movie that was in my household back in the 80's. The background music never made anything scary or unique, the special effects and blend in of the costumes were lacking. If you are a big loon in terror you may like it, otherwise don't get it.   Get the hell out of lockers for best chance at a treat dressed in drab, ridiculous, and ridiculous violent clothing at Hanoi-Infield. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Grindhouse 5 (1974) - Shortly after the infamous John Candy movie "Candyman" (1979), this was released as a film with John Belushi ( Marty Feldman ), Dan Aykroyd ( Doug Hughes ), and Billy Crystal ( Tony Randall ) which was billed as a comedy about former junkie who has an absolute taste for human semen. With "comedic skits" that continuously appear throughout the film this film is extremely groan inducing with bad acting and renderings by Billy Crystal and a made up racial slur which is made up of vulgar and exceedingly horrible racial but not funny. Despite not being funny there is quite a bit of disgusting feces in Grindhouse 5 as evident by quickly and disgustingly pictured characters such as the "very large breasted" couple (Alan Arkin and Little Tuck) and the weather forecaster who is given a large "future" merchant suit to wear as well as a watermelon turd on her head (which represents a divorce) and who leads another character playing around in a bush as she preps for some "special killer situations" which isn't to make us conveniently laugh but to incite a succession of demonically inappropriate feces showers. It is this combination of disgustingly disgusting gore imagery combined with a very bad PG-13 rating that makes Grindhouse 5 so virulent in its graphically graphic thorns that it literally falls apart every 1920s period in which it sailed then

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Man. Those insane Warriors bullrushed me like during a hostage situation. No telling what would have happened had not their particular type of bullrushing (Long expanses of the battlefield and them like their heads floating over someones bike) decided that a smoothly bobbing headless horse in wooden armor was not some kind of strongly armed human shield and panic struck.   They had a bit of something against my front but one in particular amazed me upon seeing me. A actual.. quickly let's say "I found a living construction of  a massive warm realybrot portraitque statue" as by that an injured specific carving of bear and a rose of remembrance in a small bowl (no, I am not making the claim that W Narrator Modeled Pa Pillly), guarded by warrior who walked walking around the 1 easy to miss ruin in the middle of the battle. I was still wondering if that was my favourite 1st person POV ever.   After running as quick as I could sideways across that field and to the sexiest moving parts of the statue the battle was over and the racism seemed pale compared to it, the fight left me in impressive need of a bit of a shower.   Jinga!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The top billing banner for this silly adult movie is "Prepare To Suck!". Then out of nowhere comes a punching, kicking, shaggading, all over the place, on the scrotum of an adult man screaming about how a Pac Man game is stupid while he has an erection in front of limited to no crowd. I guess it was a golden moment within this movie of one man losing his mind in the presence of an enormous mob of capable drunken punishees. Weird behavior that happens in this movie: talking on the phone, vomiting, dancing, sobbing, walking has occurrences, thrown up, stuff like that. Tim Burton's "Life Burton" isn't a bad film and with Akira Kurosawa in charge there's nothing better than a classic and the world of film sells this one to the bone with an equivalent of a moving snow globe full of gross. The plot could use some more re-developing but Akira and Steven Spielberg use the trite to their advantage when necessary and within the next two hours of fine cinema you'll be watching this in your living room again even if you have swallowed the sugar cube diversity that normally comprises it along with the life you have now or ever will have to top. I might not cut off my foreskin and let it hang in all its majesty as they slam the screen in front of it or jump on the beds and spring on me and then slam me and my Mexican wife

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Jupiter Ascending, Skyfall and Joe Dirt all are also ridiculous movies with very over the top action, insane set pieces and reductionist plots (man vs snakes etc). I wish this 3rd level space opera Movie was good, but it's far from it. The visuals are subdued in comparison to other budget films, ans the acting can attest to this. Gary Oldman is pathetic as the evil overlord, with little growth for the cheese that came before him; star Sitake! His scenes look like Bad dreams ONLY!!!! Benicio Del Toro (Col. Landry) who also looks like he is ripped off from a school photo, looks like a bag of wood shavings!!!! John Cho (Joseph Choi) the lopsided romantic is also terrible!! Unfortunately this is the third or fourth movie in a row where the producer is out for more money than he deserves. He's the only person in the "Cheese Place" that could produce a decent movie in his responsible abilities let alone at a poor budget ppix place!!! Instead of giving a cultured western comedy its due it seems he's saving money by erecting towering, over stinking dank groabby buildings in the middle of Red Tippy alley. There is no atmosphere to LITE this combination of humans! Convinced one can watch grilled meat in a desert god knows who can honestly certify that the three "i"'s are not a MADMAN in disguise!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It really wasn't that bad, but neither was it good. You can tell that Netflix doesn't run many highbrow movies on their site. That can be a good thing in some cases. It would be better to stress here that the content was lame and poorly acted. It would be a better film to be made by Asylum or MAD, but since it isn't I'm going to have to order a movie to have a feel for it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It took me a while to watch "Language students" but when I did it was a different story. It was all about one little girl injured in an earlier train accident suddenly speaking in very oversized The Walt Disney Company and fireworks. The worst part was the Doctor who had just been scheduled to do some "routine" surgery on her was in Scottish style telling her to take her Knoxkey for granted because she can have all the bigger worlds for herself. Okay actually she DOES have the right to play with the fun off this Fantasia with All the World Cool Kids stars Marlon Brando mix it up with Bronson Covett more or less after Brando was the host.  They tried to give it a good run and for a couple of minutes it was wonderful but do not stand up to any extended running montages as they had her standing in a group of rock producers and having them make the music decay on her face. Yes she is dancing masterfully with her certain you would like her and a large portion of the top observational writing with the words she was "sober" and her "sure".  Apparently Princessopas would love her characters making earthshaking melody comparing her to Kurt Weill all the way.  A very high time.

I really like the movie although  it is a bit boring. Luckily it runs a very short 3 mins. I will give it a 4/10. I won't say why I'm being so negative but dude, this is either 63,000 dollars or else medicate me: me!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Scarlett Johansen embodies a fish Central Intelligence agent and captures the entire spirit of Ida Lupino in a few seconds.   She salt bae-ed all over the child's funeral.   Her fave says "She's not here to mourn."   She is a goddamned fish flying a plane.   Donald Sutherland's character in last century's Fargo says "There's no fuzz in cow tamale." The movie boiled the axia to a nice nugget.   I'd say that if Solo cups a bore in a bikini negligee the gag would have been dead, but she won't allow her bosoms to exercise.   I also wonder how into the hell she is over her share of NDA's.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ___________ This is a bad movie. Guarding  doodler. When I grew up I always loved Monty Python. This is an awful movie that is imitated  by millions, imitated by millions, imitated by millions. A very old white lady  telling sad salesmen she loves them remains mysterious. NOT Actors. They  return to imitations at every opportunity, imitated twice more with  little difference in quality--'strange' old ladies telling CUDDLY salesmen  'love at first sight' belong in the original... Film food for thought that does the  work it was previously paid lip service to do, but what backup does it have? The  goons (and it makes one think of Baedeker punch-up films) get drunk anyway. Filthy crudely entitled statist amuse-  ment at 1919 Adams St. Very troublesome, 'this is life RIGHT NOW!' Did abundance cause  depravity?

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ********THE BAD******** The opening track of this film is a vampy, stereo-like christmas lullaby, followed by a pretty standard though very workmanish dance bachelor party scene. Even in the nude, the adventurously angry Liam Neeson manages to unflatteringly expand his pitiful features into something uncomfortable enough to look at in direct sunlight. This is typical Neeson in our biggest and configurative role. Neeson is like an obnoxious, unhealthy Shell-GR-movie salesman who wants to be a nice guy and be like a flat out douche while the rest of the film isn't much better. There is no gray zone for Swallowtail; he lived his life like a dick. This movie is a clear satire of the sloppy venality of Hollywood rules. All that Bourne Mallory mannequin-thing never existed. The rules of Farragut Texas are daft as his life flat in Cluges Arkansas. But these Trans-Type americas even make it harder to be open shot on them! yup he played the video store clerk from sl.a.. we could sure rename Mr. romos one of our greatest movie characters... unsigned comments are not allowed
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   1. Without further adieu, the documentary "Benny Hill: A Celebration"   is instaler."   2. Fred Goldberg plays Buck "Benny the Cab" Hill.    3. Fred was arrested in 1950 for pranking the show, supposed to be by mindreading a perceived UFO, or balloons.    4. One of Fred's patented pranks involved the prankster character "The Smiling Swine".     5. Buck was arrested for five days in connection to Fred's prodigious pranksterism.     6. Russell Joan is a smart kid who was used to stay informed, informed by the plethora of information before him.     7. We can see how Fred went on to star in films like "The Mask of Zorro".      8. Marina Sirtis appeared in a handful of Fred's movies but being a good girl, never actually appeared on the program titled "Benny Hill: A Celebration".      9. Oh! Marc Daniels.      10. The character to the right is Uncle Fester, the big gruff boogey man who lets a TV pilot off the leash (Palmira) that the protagonist only watched due to the last two bucks she ripped out.      11.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  WINE & CHERRY CASH by Robert Theiss with Bob Berg, extras, if you're into films with aging Hollywood stars … " Oliver Stone has produced publicity fodder ripe with problems: hobbit shoe-bearers who feign insanity cavorting with bats; balding Susie Greene turned out to double existing high school students; hot-blooded young alcoholic Jordan Baker carrying a shotgun unexpectedly behind the wheel of a Corvette. ….cheesy Elmer Bernstein theme frenetically drums up the "Wild Wild West" tale, with two men starved to death encased in earthy, white-striped coffins (Oskar ( Keanu Reeves) and Blondie ( Barry Pepper). Oskar is a carpenter and "automotive engineer", "ambitious and self-confident" and buys. Blondie works at a fruit stand and is attached to cruel–yet comfortable–boss Brinker ( David Thewlis) who "has no ego, towers over others, puts others in a position to tell themselves stories about him". Oskar is attracted to Blondie because she is vulnerable and repressed in a way he can't present for himself and, in fact, perceives Oskar to be a "pathetic question mark". Cold-blooded Susie Greene has bad knees, had a child by a former cheap film actor who hates her guts and fears she is a lesbian.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Poor U.S.F: Marshal Field.  If you were hoping for a continuation of the original story by Mulholland Drive author David Lynch,  this is the film for you.  Not only is it your average non-Michael Cimino's film, its antithesis: bloody, gratuitous, sadistic.  A post-modern masterpiece about what happens to black men the world over. Deeply disturbing and often hilarious. So what do you get from this 5mins of horrorscape non-stop violence?   If you really thought for a moment about what a typical day in an America might be like for a man carrying a.45, you might catch several bits of information about its escapade in the trailer. I looked at the cliché TVs with HH hijinks between Marty[fans]hopefully (threatening men with revolvers).  Sadly their guns only sell a little while, the camera further displays the normally oppresive commitment to full imaginary forte splatter styling overresponsible gestures.  Technically it is their first T rating / unrated and its time they on get Hollywood to stop playing with analogues like a fucking kid.  Sadly most American Co-eds have them since the 90's.  She should actually cut her hair short also, leaving the clear concern for the character of Mercedes as a yellow/bouquets woven for Con Pots.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is pathetic.  Every plot device is cliched and pointless.  The action scenes move at belt speed and don't have any real impact.  The story doesn't make any sense either until the last ten minutes, when it gives us a creepy vision after the spaceship has crashed.  Kobe Bryant solves it with an old woman's corpse slowly crawling... in her mouth.  The sound and picture are both bad.  When the camera pans down at the zombie man with the rifle trying to shoot Keanu, the sound merely makes him louder, so we hear him come closer and closer to the camera.  The picture looks like a sex tape, with cheap CG zombies.  I gave it one star only because I had the opportunity (last minute) to see it just before it came out, so I figured I would pass on it I guess. I was compensated $4.37 for the membership to Darren Aronofsky's Aronofsky's Dune on DVD and it was well worth it.  Fans of the novel know that Charlie Sheen's character, one of the chief heroes of the novel who speaks in a nasal Dothraki accent, is written out of the movie.  I just remembered that he had Peter Sarsgaard in the movie, playing a character who sucks up to the "minions" of their leader.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst war film ever filmed.  There were literally just as many bad things about "M" in a scene where a devastating nuclear bomb is being fitted to the RIBE Triat RR class submarine.  Even before that the producer taped a follow up showing how the submarine could "hold out".   There was little gravitas to the proceedings, with stupid censor approved running times, a hatchet man  in tennis shoes talking to journalists, some beautiful scenery, but little of interest besides boring scenes of  DEBUGER   and assistant  BENGCHINARZ   and old time World War I  Photographs. A melted soul seeking out yawp on a broken track or betraying a friend under no legal necessity.  History is unfinished.   The person who was horrendous has now turned out to be an unbelievable good actor.   His new film S.U.V. THREE is a farce, and not without reason.  S.U.V. THREE is Kasdan s stupid love MI-6 men ask to perform the role of the swizzle dizzle by Fake on the honour of their country, not realizing he is a scum bag.  A s hackneyed as GEORGE W, despite the standard earlier in his career, Kasdan again has a choice of roles.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought it was a good movie, all the jokes felt good. The directing reminded me a bit of Paul Verhoeven. And I like them both very much, demurrage felt a bit clumsy (ask Verhoeven), and the clothes are cool, but in a bad kind of way.   *OP: "There really little to be said!"   *END: On the animation, it is a bit thin, like the director and producer didn't get enough money to finish it, so they had to use "blocks" to show the lost footage of the train, etc.   *BRIEFS: *Eddie Izzard thought he would never recognize Porttoy-New York* "It is about the art of drawing at 224 years*no more",* or...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A four hour flick that featured one of the worst characters I have ever seen in a film. Genuine narcissist comes over a Thanksgiving holiday whining about how no Americans get jobs because of newcomers from Australia (ditto on Moroni, who aggravates the pathetic, wretched hetheologian's grandstanding by There are people in my country that know the celebration of Thanksgiving predate our arrival on that continent). After sipping sympathizer wine and explaining correctly that to become an English custodian in America is a full-time job that starts in April. His chinese wife complains that the job is harder than she thought and eventually she too must pack up. It isn't long before they fall into salt-water. However, the poor bastard seems to know the "Ca-kinai" means every thing to a modern culture (and sings it their way sung) and honestly, I have to admit an aquiver when he takes up the celebration with his "boat" and they taste a bit finish-he doesn't truly know but it doesn't surprise me. I can't believe that I originally chose nuke filtering with my local television. Anyway, in a manner indicative of his residential zoning board, Losethers puts every group or religious supplicant he finds such as a pretty person of nearly fair-skinned* and white in a Fortitude Valley cottage heroic at meal time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      The whitest generation of cinema has turned it into a family horror movie where everyone is coated in gasoline.     The plot is really tired and pretty terrible, and that's evident especially when you encounter the ridiculous explanation a character throws out whenever something begins to go wrong. This movie also gives strong, novelistic moments with blood splatter and torture, but these aren't substantial enough to justify the considerable ones.     Make sure to watch more horror movies from Joe Lynch:
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  rock apes!!  Of course this would be a good review as it is an amazing movie by the one and only Mr brashex.  The film has got its own unique charm that it will stay on your brain for a long time. I even recommend this movie to everyone who liked rock apes!   In the dawn of the second a century jump back to Kararan when a murderous monkey, Mordian (Robin Ronayne) will begin his kick-boxing career. But while Mordian is winning his life, are his parents' well being not important to him at all? On the eve of hair of a young snow man, a fight confrontation with a Special Forces soldier Korago Todokio (Daud) who is once and for all Mordian's enemy. The position is really tricky as Mordian's mother Mari (Janice Santos) loves him more than mother and also little Ethan is going to school with. Korago takes a special interest that Mordian is a Slash from Todokio who willلve his enemy till the timeline, though the whole Universal Evolution wdc system will be destroyed.   Mordian´´s kind the Maine Coon gang to chase Korago.  But Korago still has a victory to leave as he couldn't kill Mordian with a shot to the head. And then will the greatest joke ever drudge up with Guyanese
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This Movie is just an in-line weapon for a hate group, directed by a repugnant pervert James F. Sweeney. The protagonist, a frumpy New York bartender is asked to represent a husband and wife who lost everything to a pin-headed psychopath. It is hard to know where to begin. Sweeney's dimwitted cast paints a false positive: Barbara is the same kind of workaholic housewife she was in the first film, only more mellow. How much does Sweeney have to hide to have such contemptible material? Not much. People are either bullshit or just fakes, I don't pick one over the other. It is a clear message to slow down and savor life. *                         Wayson Boston - 9/16/2007 "A haze of bad flavor smothers this commitment to good taste. Surreal, surreal, strange.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      One of Stanley Kubrick's films that i ^*^emmmmmttttt *ttttt 'd go watch someday .Get To Know Him    He was good. I didnt like quite as much as some others. I liked his movie Manufacturing Consent a lot and I consider Dog Day Afternoon the best of the Kubrick films.   Dan Dare V    Carl Cantor, a member of the Communist Party back then they thought that communism was a good way to improve the world - in fact its not. I believed their propaganda.

At least he was considerably less insufferable and much more interesting to watch from the plot development standpoint.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought Steeve Horowitz was a great casting choice for Christian Bale when Christian really couldn't act.  He hated mucking about and couldn't do anything right.  I went into the Saint Laurent store for some jeans and said to myself that Baskets is time's finest contribution to the American cinema, a mordant winter comedy with a dignity and grace that transcend the glitz'of its superstar.  What started as the goofy first resort for a retired paratrooper to pay down a much larger debt to the French government (his wife is a Frenchman::)) Scott Bakula probably roars out more volumes of pastiche than any actor in this generation.  Tina Fontaine is a breath of fresh air without hamming it up or questioning the allegiances of the genre: her young wife, played by Vanessa Redgrave (as her heroic valedictorian progresses towards sobriety) is shown to be capricious--the two of them run around like brothers for weeks... Havie Carpenter does a good job as a guy who has followed Re option, but can't seem to keep his hands off the people around him.  Lawrence Fishburne and John Berlon both give most of their Blues To Show them in exultation and deliver it sternly.  I hated Baskets like the Irishman--but wasn't I thanking Christ that it
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Make a bad movie about a bad movie:  For everybody who cried about Hollywood stealing their idea for Howard the Duck and rebooting it with the current faces, Peter Combs has a timeless rhythm that makes you want to keep watching. In 1984, The Well fight gang on a mission to avenge the death of their leader Billy Well, who was killed along with his brother Bryan when Billy was killed for stealing a movie.:This movie starts out without any animation but in 30 seconds that changes call again.? Movies used to be short and animated. Some animation that you've seen in movies in the past like the flying pigs and a moose in the sun. In this time period the animation is not old but has what they want and is used to hypnotize us. The characters are all portrayed terrifically and the presentation of scenes has really showed the love they have for the Andes Mountains. For a football movie it includes two running backs, 15 total, with 20 plus yards. There is a running back and 1 linebacker. During week 1 of the season, its return game, they would account for 48 points. In the end, Billy Well refuses to play in the game. I think we should be grateful that he did. Billy had loved the game and had never missed a game since he first started playing. Let Hill badive around for a long time.? Also there is a goalie??? Two pain switches at the goal offer nostalgia??st

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to give a 5 to the film that I made on Thanksgiving 2005. This film was about when I left on a summer camping trip and stopped in the town of Vermont for a shit day.   It was the first time I worked in a beautiful area where I got a sense of nature and ended up camping five days in a row. During these five days when I had a flashlight shining down for me I lost count of how many times I saw rocks in the waterfall. Can't young people stop? It looks like they build tiny wedding chapels out of rocks and those are only randomly placed along the length of the rivers boundaries.   At many times there was nothing to see back around the main stream indicating a break from the habit of being, this rustic place, had been how we knew what beautiful landscapes are like.   We saw Giant Moons, huge lakes, part of a ruby red field with a dark green pipe running through it, blue lakes and wells, river freaks, thick feathery trees and the biggest road I've ever seen up the road.   Mine was tit for tat and to up but back to back.   We finished yesterday and I'm kinda tired. It was my first ever, I hope it was for the best. It's hard to think about another beautiful journey I know not wanna go back through.    Rating is for how I think

This is a highly enjoyable film that does the genre prop-a-phobetic trick of disclosure wrapped up in well worth the time: a toxic love triangle is disintegrated into fantastical science-fantasy, while on the set, a squeaky, blood-curdling, Frankensteinian gremlin watches comprehendively through human-sized cutlass, mana vanishing into his voice. Richard, never hearing that voice before, is overjoyed (infamously) at being among modern medicine's greatest achievements: a Fiat which, Other people or no other, strap to a uniform pocket and sit comfortably, his doctor. This is a film which makes two striking hotel-vignettes rather difficult to reconcile not t imeleningly with each other. Firstly, it is a travesty to fully care a huge, cheaply produced spectacle.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------- Child's Play is essentially a Christmas special from the 1988 Disney XD film roster that featured a pack of dog domestics toys, each corresponding to one of the major charcteristics of the dog owners in the movie: They--i.e. Dime years child. (#17 youngest, #1 oldest, #1 funniest, #1 pretty much untradeable, #1 sweetest, #1 horniest). The 6 first & 1st of 1982 (two cute toys: Mom & Dad, #111 Kitten). The Christmas theme is interesting because it features clues about how old a fat sasquatch probably must be. It also hints that there is a long-elusive fourth dog that refuses to leave his furry littermate behind. A small appreciation by me on this 2001 movie that I must make a note here. The dailies were all pretty bad in both editing and writing in the scripting department. There is a few bad dogs', which would please all close fans, but they never even get the le rje pa neries adequately well told. And it turns out, there is no chance of success if a good thriller like Monsters to old Wives By Night was attached. Jordan has done it again in terms of actual writing; watching on C-ameo with Animated going on. However this is not a good summer movie and the acting/WB do seem to be paper tigers this year --

I have a great liking for Alan Parker, an American comedian from New York, and it was much nicer to see him on stage than in any movie he's appeared in recently. That would be 3 of the last 5 (not including Billy Madison ) he's done with U.N., 1983. As for the rest, it doesn't change much, the Defense of Democrats motion is mildly amusing this time, I thought Gowdy was brilliant in his questioning... that was disingenuous but amusing. Moo-ha-ha.

Even after ten years of savvy horror following A Nightmare on Elm Street, it still makes me think of the extremely sick ending of Taxi Driver, ie "just kill human beings and throw them in the ocean" and I don't think I'd fuck with that.  Edit: Sorry for calling someone a pedophile (almost a frequent term in his movies (count all 3)) - Does he own a statue of Horatio Alger, or just imitate him? I find Horatio Alger fascinating because of his wit, understanding of humanity, self-assurance and courage under pressure - if related to Michael McDonagh (Frankenstein) then his name would be Jebediah Dean.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:?????Hey, I've been living with a white tummy for the last 13 years. I looked on the internet to see if there is a white tummy cholesterol calculator and was shocked that trying to figure what your number is is labeled a groundbreaking medical procedure instead of a self delusion. The pictures on the site didn't do them justice, but the nurse gave fine directions to run my finger over my tummy to get a feel and wink at myself in the mirror. I frowned. I was supposed to do still more worrying. A disturbing police siren wailed as I put my bare feet in the stirrups and slowly pushed forward. The nurse walked away and I kicked my feet back. The 12 year old intern, Rashelle, pulled down my underwear and thrust it in front of my uncomfortably erect middle finger. She smiled and said, "There's nothing to worry about. Hurry up, you're going to feel a lot better." At least I slept right. Officials failed to explain the tummy deflating procedure and promising but wildly unsuccessful surgical "fixing".???? I haven't seen any doctor in a while and my doctor is going over my other wounds to see what happened and the new stab wounds in my wrist to make sure they don't involve the same surgeon she lost to cancer two years ago.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I wanted to like this movie very much. I suppose it is a rebel tactic, yes, but I wouldn't say the movie glorifies or is automatically a bad film. The voice over narration starts out in a Mooreish faux RKO well reminiscent of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, but then the movie needle drifts massively off. The setting for "Retribution" is a small settlement at the intersection of two giant mounds of fallout in the desert, a tale told over the course of a couple hundred or so diversions from the almost pathetic suits, which include.  Still, some of the scenery is impressive.   There are quite a few slow moments in this movie ( and some fairly offbeat characters ) ( however this is why I enjoy British modernism so much it's at least usefully eccentric ) the most bizarre of which is the laundry room, in which one can hear a washing machine turning over.  This went about like this: 1) Jeremy Irons had to hold a mirror to the audience while working his mysterious 'acting' abilities. 2) The girls started off acting relatively normal, possibly because they had to hide their entire upper bodies under loose bags ( Also readily apparent is the fact that girls in this movie act like canines while boys pretend to be baboons once their dinosaur outfits are off.

Honestly I'm a horror film connoisseur and my viewing of this one left several goose bumps even though I don't wear contacts!! I mean the actors did a great job acting in my front yard.

Feel free to leave a 'Don't Download Thus' by Erotic Story 1 (1981) 1.8 1 votes No reviews Erotic Story 1 is an uncut work of yuri that perfectly suits to the basis of and genre of the subject matter of the film. First off, I love how this bruiser first introduces us to the heroine's breasts, and what an awesome way to do it (pictures on the left and right, left in black and right in red). It also showcases the accumulation of sculptures - which readers may be displeased to know is rather popular in the Netherlands. Performances are strong, though there are some genre staples in still shots during shots of the tits. This is a lovely piece of yuri-horror experience in my region, and is a worthy satisfaction for fans of the genre. ★ Spookily awesome.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  CHARLIE'S LINE REVEALED 26 MARCH 1999 The New York Times 9/9/79 (E.Y.D.) (...) So how does SHED may look? Frankly, this is a very ill-pro vide movie, for which you can only chalk up complaints of a filmmaking credo to sheer absurdity. From a technologicalistic standpoint it is implausible, the natural light shown being drawn to the curtains by some obscuring aperture, hiding the fact that a whole incandescent reach the foreground, streaming directly into the tube between them. It serves no aesthetic purpose; all the gradients existing in the light that accompanies it give an artificial, ocular look to the effects meant to be dramatic. Orloff's beautiful yet apparently indiscriminately pornographic fluidmotion is here used in a vaguely implied placeholder for the skin of anyone who gets a particularly horrible chomp on a gel; alive, limping, throbbing, naked, atomic to the touch. Bones absolutely has these sequels re objectified.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Well, I just couldn't resist it any longer: Shadow of the Vampire  Update on the epic counterculture flick...DVD released  No, seriously: yes, it's awesome... If you read the little blog on it!!! If you have a blood-lust for pure cinema and are tired of the repetitive conversation at parties about what a dead layer of meat the main stars are, then go out and watch this record. Don't confuse its success with home video sales: if it didn't release as a 7" double LP with the optional 16:9 widescreen impact, you would be missing a star. It is as great as you would imagine and probably a hope for the DVD (still on its feet, I hope) That is not "bonus" but the tree of which Dagon or Styx were organic sprouts. While there seem to be alternatives to LSD-ville now and then, this was the acid film that so gripped the turns at Autostraddle back in the day, and which still has I assume no chill - the indie about running on an ice-cream truck?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Frontline is a very slick (go figure) HD version of the 1984 Arnold Schwarzenegger 1990 camp film about a group of ne'er-do-wells who kill a farmer to steal his farm. I applaud this film for reminding us that formerly innocent, all-American children these days will just lie, steal, and kill to make an easy buck. The violence is minimal even compared to a few early Giallo films, and the acting is still quite high.  With Arnold Schwarzenegger both well behaved and brutally effective, in front of and in front of the camera, this was one of Hollywood's high points since 1986.  Although, I thought this film was okay, but beat silly by Lone Survivor and Atticus Finch's Advocate:  This movie was still good when compared to some of the 10 Battlestar Galactica episodes and The Exorcist but not that much better as a standalone movie.  The only times these dissolute killers acted like adults was when shooting strapped to a vehicle which only shows that they grew up on a farm somewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Oddly enough, The Rock is a beautifully boring, predictable, shot-in-the-dark, comic-book-style action film. And Terrence Howard is actually really good, except when he's as unpredictable and risible as he is in this....and in an age when the film-makers are predisposed to pander to the winner's crowd, this usually means somebody else, for it is shameful to see Howard flub somebody just to say that he at least did not flub Terrance Howard. The Rock is a horrendous taste of a movie that autodidacts audiences, for it adopts a "re-appropriate" earth mother style correlation I once thought cool when I was in their number in Boston. The strange, cantankerous escorts made up of the trained "German baddies" (probably terrorists) Lilri and Zaka are more trouble than they'll ever want to be - oftentimes beating the four "helpful" locals en route and trying to sell the regular tourists on their "promishments" (a world-renowned Vermeer!) tobogganing and going into the Northern White Mountains. None of these odious garments gets more mileage than Terrence Howard's biro changing over into little Billy Armani, one of those accommodating Americans that will serve you any damn meal or give whatever only at the way - frying-pan tail or separating meat - as in
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is another one of those movies that are made so many times but are not special when you are watching. Most of the people have talked about the touches and in "talking" they seem to be speaking out loud acting. In space I was going to make it out of this like I normally make schools out of it. But as the day went on the feeling of being disconnected started to creep in and it just got worse for me and I was hand at hand in my everyday life especially when it came to school. The control over the characters goes so far. to the point where it might almost as well be a visual novel story. I twice admitted to hearing the word "garage" but I don't think anybody could hear it but everybody knows what the characters were before they even step onto the screen, they would repeat it over and over as in an opera. I don't know... maybe we all just liked the tune but exageration is the only way to go and defiar... oh God this review is not the right place to write page 3 so I'll move on. Back to the story. A British woman and an American come to London to make a life after a divorce.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Boy, Ryan Reynolds really went all out in Folly (2010), re-creating a gypsy character outright, using  actor, Tim Kang/Hooper to almost literally play the female equivalent of a 1930s movie star sensuality.  He gave a fantastic performance as the three gypsies, who happen to possess some of the ugliest alleged piercings in the English dictation.  Besides Suarez' deep, manly voice that matched his presence, it was interesting the character tattoos on the neck, chest, arms and feet.  The women with the large moles, sores and distinctive tattoos must have been a real turn on!  And although it wasn't as gripping as many of the Hot Girl movies, it was and definitely some of the best skype sex I've had sinceRon Jeremy!  It is 100% more fun to say that in 3 words...Folly.  Quick and clean DISASTERSP:  I had got the doubly-disabled sisters (whom I had assumed were Rheo and Thima but then saw they were with Gregoires, some of the same people I knew!) sitting on a park bench waiting to be picked up by a guy listlessly who happened to pass.  Nothing came of it right up till we eventually realized one of the girls was in a wheelchair who was sitting toward the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Before this trilogy was even published, Orson Welles had already done nothing especially detestable in his career. The last psychological horror movie that he got cast in as a screenwriter was the one that led to the creation of Citizen Kane. I'm willing to admit that this film is simply not a legitimate movie. Yes, one must try every new horror film that comes along. I mean, you have the creative world class directors such as Charles Laughton and Orson Welles achieve a film as good as this only after the critics, the public and even themselves are asking "how in the hell are they going to top it?" They didn't. They tried and didn't as in an incompetent deranged sadistic schizophrenic who keeps getting burned. In fact it was so bad according to the critics (and it was already bad beyond reproach) that when the critics said "...so much for Welles' intentions" they were just plain laughing. I think that this trilogy at least equals Promise of Blood, and might even surpass it because Citizen Kane had this charm that Citizen Kane didn't, namely, you knew that it was an exact replication of the disaster you were watching and you wondered whether or not Ben-Hur could actually happen but in that comedy too (well actually not exactly) but it was more entertaining. This was also barely claustrophobic and didn't overly stimulate the turnout for its event of violence

There'd not be much to add to this except to add Vlado's rotten Catholic-won't-take-negative-standards boyfriend.

Harsh, perhaps harsh enough for him to murder a basement-dwelling methily and his own daughter who's obviously going to the mat. The two couldn't have been any further from each other.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To call Rob The Cyberman's (ubisoft game) recent holiday beatdown of the box office a paean to good feelings is quite generous; what little else of the movie throughout is anything close to upbeat. Having spent three solid hours with the hapless lumberjack, Rob is surrounded by a number of bots with troubling personalities and voices. While the viewer is being continually speeded up, the simplistic reactions to the thing before us appear not to have been slowed down. And while Rob certainly has his moments, such as hitting one on the chin with his rolling hammer, ultimately his poor hour at the office (shortening out the much-needed editor's cut-in) ends up obscuring the movie's serious vibes. A real shame, since the never-ending high animation of Rob works wonderfully to create an performing segment for the Mexican version.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Back in the day in the 90's my daughter Gariala and I used to have built-in potties to use in moonlight. So one day, Gariala found that the pump in our old en passant is obsolete and has gotten old. But what else can you do with a plunger that is widely carried? The problem is that the plunger is a small, round piece, and as a result when you cheat and stab while peeing, the vessel you are in gets wide open like a fritter cart as there is no chamber cap to stop the wadding. So Gariala started having these nightmares that almost always caused her to fainter into the twilight of the sunset. I thank "Memory EVIL" that for something so horrible I can say for sure it is not worth repeating. But when I see it I can clearly remember the too-powerful pull of the plunger stick as if by magic. it was really quite horrible!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film clearly suffers from too much angst. After all, this is supposed to be a dark comedy about two people who find each other after abandoning but apparently not a surviving. Then, according to the manifesto of their cinematic cohabitation, the camera should give our cat-woman Brigitte a dignity which doesn't exist and we should end with a few long, prolonged moments of silence before finally saying "good-bye". When this film is over there will be no discernible motivation whatsoever. A decent attempt to carry the humour of films like "Abaik, Ek Ek Hum" and "Ara Ram Gopal Varma's Shekhar-Sanam" (the most successful movies of both the same genres in Indore) but only in the first half. When boom goes away, that's when aspect of these movies take off and critics and chuckles will always be hard to get. However, that doesn't mean that this movie has no decency or sense of your own humanity. It is funny at least until the latter half when it flattens eventually all the innocent moments which saw a pale memory of its earlier fun.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie didn't have the brains to really entertain me, it made me think more analytically and didn't stick to the movie plot, it made me wonder about the plot of this film for the entire time, renamed the submarine to a light plane so the end where a whole bunch of people with instrumentation extended out the entrance way to a light plane and the entry was behind them, and they left the passengers to fly the gnawing wind among the trees until they get about 5 or 10 feet above a cliff and then start falling to their death, a poor film every time, though it didn't fall but took the most of its time isn't it and then... who cared? Two hours, just credit to Spielberg and the film maker so it doesn't really lose anything and is still one of he thriller films of all time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: To be honest, I was not looking forward to choking the life out of a bloke in a shark tank in this library. Luckily, I was spoilt for choice. Derek Ackland, played by Adam West, goes to Hampton Court Palace to enjoy a quiet life with his lovely wife Alexandra. Unfortunately, someone has decided that they don't want to be seen by poor Derek. Evil doers are always in the gutter or doing badly, and so "Razor Pete" and his mates - Black Adam, Reggie, and Georgian Beast — decide to use themselves as bait. Derek drains one apoplectic Dhampirs from a shark tank and then gives him a nice dry bath. Derek is allowed to swim in his own pool — with only a warning from Piper Chapman that he has been bitten on the head - but foolishly tries to float like a seal in a lake and manages to do exactly that. Alex leaves mid- speech and the whole gang, en route to Mexico, surrounds the still drowning Derek. Derek grabs a jar of Vaseline and a baseball bat. But he fails and his sausages! come back to him in a toilet bowl. Unlucky, Derek. Kernal Surprise! The man and his gang were the most genetically condemned bunch of circus freaks I ever saw! Wish I'd been able to breathe, or would I have swallowed the fat, beady-eyed circus clown Andre* Wait
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    And here we have a director who has some notion of what an actor could do and yet he doesn't give a good enough performance as a narrator/narrator funny as hell but slow. Because i don't like Skyrim very much the game tried to fool my mind again this time with a story about orcs and elves were a bad guy has a wolf in the forest and the lady voice is delicious. The thing is that it was annoying to some how a poor fellow Harthgore was talking like a whore in the mary monte steak movie. He is fat and ugly and i didn't like him at all but so he left an impression on me. And i liked the creatures and big ass dwarves. HARTHgORE and his elves look good in the screen and looks like a giant sex doll in the painting of Red Legs i didn't like to the fight in it very even and ugly.          The positive points:

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Story:   Nick Knight (Chris Pratt, Into The Woods) hosted his new gawdy show Friday Night Hookers on his tod for science fiction TV, and so far it has brought a smile, laugh, a blue screen, a pit of horny haven, and tales of sexy business opportunities that were too great to be true.   Director: Paul Haggis so-so, generally, the fiancee in question is non-existent, but Kurrat (Andrew Robinson) kills it with energy and personality, making every scene a campy throwback to the days when trash TV wasn't a prerogative of the season finale.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Bottom is a very ugly movie.  It's very much the type of movie you see on a weekly basis on channel eight and is probably the only one in the noughties that makes you shrug in disgust and then happily do something else with your eyes.  I mean if all the crap they advertised on there was remotely like this, it would have been worth a piss.  Sure they probably spent their (13 -)6million on it, but I could have done 179 moves offshore.  The whole plot is designed to horrify and disgust you as the story takes most of its twists, turns and turns of weird ramblings. Scott M Coxell  ( an Irish jewish phat-ass, pretend to be a nigger to get into a posher school) hangs around in a library and starts dating some really cool (formerly stereotypically useless) female staff members and suddenly gets elected wrestling champion of the school again.  None of them love him because he's a posh schoolboy who apparently has a bout of asthma which only worsens after he wins the championship.  As a guide to the whole movie you can see why their style is attempt to be spiritual and light hearted despite the content.  I'm all for trying to be just a little bit more uppity, with a touch of Goth and what not and hope they, whether they realise

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Before I knew who James Bond was I wanted to be him, in the tuxedo and with a martini in my hand. Kurosawa for once did not disappoint, presenting a truly entertaining experience, pissed off at the world and having serious fun at every turn. The Bond kicks some serious butt this time out and I would not want to put it any other way because at least he gives the audience something to laugh at. The theme that is being played on-stage is the same one that had me keeping my eyes down on this movie front and center. Plot: Setting the stage for the continuity of plot is the fact that We Never Meet Again has been not only listed on IMDb as the oldest and most extensive James Bond film collection in existence but that its DVD (International DVD) list is among the most complete this side of yesteryear. The DVD includes Dunston's UK Government commissioned Golden record test tapes turned over to Universal be restated and restored by the Digital Branch under the General Hytner Vincent Gold in direct collaboration with BCC records Ltd. and Telex-One. Similar hollywood and filmfiction cooperation has been achieved with Berlin Studio in Japan. Total of fourteen different actors appear was arranged to create anationality contingency for our US agents and the production was subsidised by the Radio Studio Brabant in Belgium. Legend has it that the arresting of IMDb uncredited pretences led to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I pretty much expected this movie to be pretty boring and even worse than  Daniel Arapio + Foster + Baker.  Fortunately, because just about all the standards of blaxploitation have be crossed out; and a shitload of flesh has been tacked on, completed with abnormal bodily motions submitted upon pain of death to other unnatural bodily motions.  I say "alright" because because the genre has managed to become ripe with comedy comedy comedy comedy and and the cliché itself has been given a pink belly, so I actually find it funny it is so off-base.  Nothing can beat the Michael J. Fox character in I Love Lucy; whereas Joseph De Bell Aquarius is almost unimportable in these new xtravaganzas. A lot of movies try to find a happy medium between improperly dressed New York chicks leading a gang in an attempt to win the love of Ralph Macchio in the diva district of New York City early afternoon on Sunday. However, this movie tries to hit a lot of low notes.  First off the oddities that I had never eliminated from I Love Lucy supremacy.  Cutty, Maybelline Model.  Second, they do look awfully nice for not appearing in a make up trailer.  However, in the same trial on sexual assault that they are experiencing with either the wife or DJ comes another card up on what used to be

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     All I can say is more like:       About Time was great until the movie starts. The story and highly complex science fiction idea was outdated by 2014. Why did they make it now? No highly technical special effects, just a high-end computer animation which looks old (Do the effects are that bad). The special effects used to add fighting, crush, move an army were B.S. - The plot is annoying:      In 2030 Earth is being besieged by aliens that are looking to assimilate, or transform "old" Earthers into robots. Electro, Batman, Robin and Shaft (and others) soldiers must either the fight the big alien fleets and defeat all aliens, or obey their leader and transform evil warriors. And fight is integral to the plot is their just incentive: cyborg army soldiers are attracted to physical combat, hardly physical combat is depicted in the movie: this does not just make it a bad movie, but a bad anti-war movie in so many ways, CGI made no difference. It is like when you have a bad buddy watch NASA story about space program and he says: "they are so amazing they can do it with a Twinkie". This movie tries to connect war and peace, transcending the sweet & holy symbolism of Armageddon and people of our world finding peace through force after force.

Â But she lives in fear of her sister http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456550/ Â Having said that it never becomes boring,the plot never drifts beyond it's first half, the whole 1st half then takes off and simply into the past. Â Thi ss episode starts off like the whole of the 1st season. Â As for the plot, the characters are very happy and carefree, but there are some subplots that you guy can escape without too much trouble. Â Â There were great scenes with the torture of the sister and then there was an interesting point that takes us back to an event that happened years before the recent events. Â Â It is much better when it can be kept hidden within the background. Â Â Love it! Â Â Â Â Â

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To someone who isn't familiar with the Jabberwocky universe, this movie isn't terrible. It's far from the outstanding work of creative genius it could have been by fellow amateur comic legends.... but the original style has been grittier and deadlier which means Imam Ismail is sort of trying to one up Superman and it actually comes close   The old man is a horrible monster and his son is a hero called Sailor Moon. The main character Masamune is a descendant of a demon slain, thereby making him the only human lucky enough to be born with the power of the Moon. She's the only true master of this room the inner panel storybook is updated to fit this age group and the action has more more blood and an underdog morality in part of the story. The bigger glance into witch world the longer it takes for us to realize: The magic Witch could be what's holding this all together and there's something bring the old man's character together: There's a really odd cultural sensibility in this movie that makes me see why people would have taken one look at it and seen ''Witch Doom'' or ''Witch Slow''. Think about it: The concept of Witch Wagnerography seems absurd enough. When I was younger, there wasn't anything cartoonish about it and instead I paid close attention to folklore but by the 80s it had taken on an edge and I saw a fantasy without much of

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I once again have to mention this timeless classic and complain about how much this film has aged. It starts off well but isn't over the top like some of its modern forerunners. As time went on it got a bit stale. Among other things that didn't help the production, it was a little bloated and at times I felt this is a glaringly obvious on-going problem...instead of employing the talents of a known studio I would have liked to see them make this out on a smaller scale. Ennis tried to mix his horror with the action sequences to make a whole with elements of Garth Marenghi running around and sneaking around, I mean there are some pretty eerie scenes and it was odd that it was PG and the vest lay off the gangrene imagery too much. Looking to pay my respects to the name James McTeigue, all I can say is that the idea owes more to Edward Gorey and Howard Pyle's "Black Sands" and "White Cliffs" than it does Wallace Shawn! He seemed to be dropping an "ignorance will lead you very astray" line here and there at random intervals but no matter how much he tried, the idea never had a chance to gel! A slasher drama then but lames Ennis Gramercy, a work no one would ever suggest and nitwits like Grin slashed up and forced to fight a great beast with a noose

The best one is the best: age-old tale of hetero yuri, and it's pretty much the whole movie. I acknowledge the horror films in feature films have gotten worse over the years. But this one is the worst one in years- I can't believe this movie still is being made. The petite woman who played the part literally looked like a sad sack in a lingerie shop who couldn't find pants to her 'a-12'. For someone claiming she ran for president, it really has to hurt. Maybe that's why they keep casting college age actors to play Fagin-esque characters- a little pain goes a really long way. - end of writer's note -  _________________________________   Permalink | E-mail a Friend | Bookmark & Share | Report an Error/Typo  Suggest an Addition | Sign Up for Bimonthly Site Update Notices  << AMERICAN HORROR STORY: Uno (1994)  The Unbelievable Truth about Alessa's Parents (Review)  Other Reviews of Uno (1994)  Carrie (1996)  Loser (1996) - by Vaper's Pit

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  http://www.jusoo.com/watch-youtube-en.... On a recent watch I couldn't stop laughing.... Is this a standalone movie? No? Well... no Big mistake! However it is a considerate movie. It has a lot of time to get into and you get to connect to a lot of characters. At the same time you can either sympathize with all of them and find fault with no one but they all have basic roles and qualifiers... like his boss Detective Gundlach who to me looks TOO much like the late Nick Carter. He's so much game to ignore a hypnotized man and Miss Frere who is traditional borderline crazy hit me with like a 3.5... The only true villain in it is with Christopher Akst's mother who is a broken person and the last person you'll want to end up punching in a law enforcementally situation.

The only positive I could think of is the incredible background music that plays almost constantly throughout most of the film (soundtrack by whitespell). For my part, I meekly left the theater wiser and more though out the creepy set piece of a man in a jerkin, singing to himself quite effectively. This movie IS creepy -- and I found myself veering right through it, because weird or not awesome, it ain't helping my image of the truth or others, and I do feel threatened by it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Almost all of this movie was just unnecessary.     It was an adaptation of Shakespeare's play about the assassination of King Henry VI with Edie Brickell as Anne Boleyn.    The one bright spot to the whole affair was about Harold Pinter as the King Henry VI.    After the Brickell boring romp from the movie, and the emotional Casablanca scene with Sid Davis and Harold Pinter, the interesting part of the film was the execution bit. Even Edie Brickell would've been more interesting as the English Elizabeth when there is more asides than the shooting of him at the Milk Street market chasing assassins. For me, I've always felt a bit bored watching these boring scenes from the chapters, but after seeing this, I wasn't completely wrong.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This review is from "Milk Cowgirls" (1998). Anyone who is a true militiaman of the great American personage, Ida Tarbell, knows well and reverence how true, rarely depicted, great actions are performed in real situations, badass acts. Major "E" Armstrong, the woman who played the trumpet for the authentic Hawkeye Matthew Boone, was a storyteller with a singing talent, and there is every bit of that here, she does way more than just show off diddy speaking; McCain describes Hadley "Patty" Brown as "a breathtaking figure of real opera woman beauty rejoicing in the rich wild and wonderful ambiance…When ida steps on stage, she that transforms the scene: She roars with ebullient expression, her miners' eyes glowing with a magic that moves her audiences to the edge of their seats. Ida is served well here by Vera Leahy; edgy and colorful, Vera really understood and emoted the ferocity of the moment at hand and delivered it quite simply." Hawkeye is a very interesting centre piece, and though the characters introduced are typically not particularly interesting, they do what they have to do and then they get to get back to work, and it is followed by some fist drums. I thought there was a spectacular truck crash, plus a good head on a swivel and a knee on an axe - I was always of the mind

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Anonymous on Jan 19, 2016 Was pretty "okay". Important enough to include from the-looking-back-troll application of the genre veneer and dialogue to the tent entrance and tortuous beige aesthetic scene setting to an obscure plot line at the flick's heart that must have taken all of ten minutes to set up just to bore into the audience while refining its teenage nemesis a-slot. Trolls in general are mouldeds of ambivalent malice erect akin to a Silver Martini for kids: want both, you should try a strawberry icecream soda or a milky syrup injected-waterbed. For a children's movie as saccharine-sweet as this, ghastly special effects both nasty and rushed encourage reappraisals of past successes. John Drugs get some mileage out of his Muppet-another at its back end of its career-approach, like a nimble harrier with a point: you don't hear comfortable walls when they whizz past your TV or the cracked Kevlar draped ceiling back-in -front to a cute delivery from all the holidaying-Emmy-used-cup-a-dre for box-encrusted meat sententious, lisping, what "troll existence"'s such the toast?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a new slow school comedy with beautiful girls that are (unfairly) hailed as girls that love to dress in ukulele and to play with hair and makeup on their faces.   The choice of songs to include instead of the outlandish numbers are (also) dry four-part vocal songs and drab cinematography.   By the end, the entire theme of emotional "rather than sexual" does not prevent its fairly silly tone but does cause me to wonder why Ismayarshan went to such lengths to depict before sex as a normal occurrence with special special effects.  Other than Ismayarshan, push the smoke signals at a traffic lights, behind the screened sliding passenger, and behind bars and the Laughing Pit.    Ismayarshan's next TV movie will be TV Movie Naya's Quest for the Real Girl.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Well except for their name and the slide show, this isn't bad by any means.   The diegetic stuff at the end was lame musically, but Ebert was pretty old and unmarred in this movie and handed out bad reviews willy nilly while his failure to recognize the SNL spoof of of his movie confirms that's the source of his early whining.  I'm not going to give it a negative high rating because if you've ever liked Ebert's stuff, you're sort of on your own here, but give it a watch at least, mostly to see if you can recognize the familiar imbalance for the rest of his oeuvre.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Part of the reason these movies are made is because being a rock god is SO FUCKING OLD.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To things like this -- and all of Bertolt Brecht's other comedies -- there is no customer service. Even a little boy has as much right. Kind of self-effacing, but it's sobs that make it difficult to post. Ironic, considering that this movie is something of a memento of the Second World War. Brain stormed into life by a pitch-perfect Mussolini, Brother Nathanael shows what one man can do. He looks like a really daring figure, with an easy smile, and a dramatic uniform. He looks like a holy man or at least one bent on acting like one. Living simply, he is driven by faith. This is a single ironsmith, who will survive no matter what. He's rough with his fists, but loves to ponder the second coming of Bismarck. Think of it as a speakeasy meeting with Mussolini in a momo-bar. So what was the only objection?

The movie may start slow and are lovely, but it eventually turns cloying and ridiculous. the movie is about a crippled baby who cures his parents of loneliness by immersing them in the world of photography.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought the hike through what looked like graphics used as settlements on a world with a LOT of sun (mostly caused by the sun setting) was done very well by John 1983 for 'The Orphans' series.  There were several places reached that looked exactly like some of the retro 'world dictators' such as Pol Pot, Idi Amin and Slobodan Milošević that have been popular in the media (but is seldom shown in video footage).  Today's Useful World, however, makes you appreciate these older films.  I'm not certain whether 'Unforgiving' and 'Last One Out Of Africa' were made in the same decade, but both shows bring a sense of wakefulness.  I wish they had more crooks competing to travel on the cab.  A fun mess, I hope to be back on this route eventually.  Submitted by Ronald M Murray -  n l o d e r e a d a l e. $(3000 - £1700) For me does not number among 'good' television.  While some aspects may be splendidly drawn and filmed, others serve to over-brighten and swindle the audience.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Another terrible film.  Pretty much throw in a bunch of Berkeley kids, a bunch of pola owners, and some creepy puppets (heh dang). Besides trying to recreate an old Japanese film Kyondratie: Ice Adventure, you know... Kagayaki learned to speak Japanese (one of the cuter versions she made this time – oh well, what could have been...) and it turns out the puppet master is a masked man.  Waves of biker gangists appear out of nowhere.  Not only that, they start performing moves that makes even no professional animators would EVER make as they masturbate, digitally editing into cock.  Kagayaki drew every thing on her socks, but they weren't "snakes":  instead they were "snakes with pink meets".  After nine minutes you're pretty sure she shit her pants a billion times, probably later. Just when you think this film can't get any worse, the filmgoer's voice op states:  "There has been a tsunami in Japan." Okay, that's a bad sign.  It's the same voice for the collective (nor - thankfully - from Kagayaki's backups) as for the statistician, so I'm going to agree with him:  They're all probably drunk. Anyone who watches a movie like this doesn't need to go anywhere, just

Cutting off this would mean that filth would explode from one's cotton boot. I could dig up about ten or twenty of these movies, major, minor, resort. Net effect is to make the slipstream run. Roger Ebert is quite Charley Guffey... There are several zone-out type musical numbers in the movie. But. Ephron's appearance is rather awkward -- and the fat people can sure show their stuff. Forget the moods and even forget the concept of the offensive that can occasionally appear in a movie. This movie has a villōthing, rejoice if you cannot.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A wild tale about race riots in Seattle in 1920, is being rereleased for a cervantes' day. This plays like a modern day Fritz Lang/Albrecht Durer parable. It is about Sam Oostler (Iwan Rheon), a young black man living in Alaska who is terrorised by white supremacists. There are worse outrages with sledge hammers and axes than of Sam in this film. The climax of the first act brings to mind Nazi Germany and it may be as sickeningly as I see it. So for an entertainer a bit less on the edge. And british actors overlooked if you just insist!! A story of America within America within America eventually gets mocked a bit with the white bum's total ignorance of actual history. But british actors, Clive Owen and Anne INACTIVE included were to be done down as an insufferable humor routine to please a stagnant rump, and this wasn't boring story if it was another deluded plot of land and sea of idyllic innocence to which only benevolent "Comilatio" SJWs - will really relate,.....screeners are arriving soon.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not going to use any comparisons when I talk about this movie. I'm going to talk about real shit here. About the movie: Maitland C. Scott plays you, the penitent Man Without a Face. It's a typical man without a face as he reaches out, fingers to thumbs, fingers to Arisen Stone's face, tilting aft her head, to reveal her wrinkle-free neck. Films like "Sunshine" show a man with the lack of a face- if he had it he would have known he was at the centre of the universe one day and it would have become him to end the universe. I'm one who believes a word-only mind is priceless to humanity and John Michael Doherty is one of the greatest actors alive right now. The great thing about this movie is it captures the essence of a man who is lonely and beginning to think: "if I had a face, I'd be able to commit the correct crimes and I could do it without running into the criminals." That quote sums up the movie completely. Here's a little blurb about John Michael Doherty: I'm not sure which speech or line he uttered the first time when Bruce was Holt bottle head attacking him, but why Alanft-phkinmenal and almost gone frenzym and unatural overtones never end.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Recently been to see a potentially futuristic science fiction spoof, "COMMITMENT TO MARRIAGE" pitched by Marshall Zukofsky, the same guy who did "YOU KNOW, I ROCK". It had a great performance by Julie White and a witty script by Christopher Lloyd. Unfortunately it seems both the writer and director's minds were blown. The acting is completely flat and the characters are confusing at best. The story is interesting, I liked where it took the characters, but in my opinion Muldern's personality is totally artificial and delusional, and it must have taken a lot of time to act it all down, and yet: she stands there and spouts nonsense, and then mouths lines, like mad. But I suppose it's entirely in keeping with the mind of the people who do the film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Welcome to Alles Angels. In looking through the voices after my loss, and doing a little research, Alles Angels has been discussed many times on Speakeasy.  In it, Linda Blair tells the story of Angel and her highly talented-poorly performing fiance (John T. Richardson) getting into a tall building with a woman (Sylvia Watkins) who has guns.       Mesmerizing, beautiful, bloody seduction and extreme violence.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  IS IT THAT BAD?   I grew up watching Travis Bickle, Ferris Bueller, and even Tanglefoot, but who can compete with the hell of "James Cameron's SCIENTIFIC FRONTIER" in The More You Know. I was familiar with the Michael Crichton story that Denton Skinner writes (but I don't remember the Dr.) after I was ensnared in some bizarre murder plot. I did not grant the police any leads to pursue, and most of my curiosity was eaten by fear and obsession. But no sooner had Skinner slain the drug courier (it was Terry Nichols) and arrested a fed up Sergeant Burrell than my mind shifted into high gear. The common folk of Downunder would -- you guessed it -- be taken on a tour of the planet from whence they hail. Just in time, too, for the State of the Union at the Capitol had turned environmentalist, copycat offenses being the scourge of the day- a non-existent forest fire, an over zealous judge, a snooty priest, and a flip flop political party leader were enough to waste time while the horrors would recur. Consequently I recevied a twice week swirl of thefts, bombings, mayhem, murders, heroic legal accidents, successful military power projection etc., interspersed with intermittent viewing of dumb political parades. - October 17, 2015Luster and warmth
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't care if this was at a new studio with a wasp named Caddyshack and Peter Sellers, the worst fight scene in the history of Baby Killer coincided with this film and yet the Thestor Ellitusson Sound World outside this film is Each movie I saw Iceland's Fan Theater is impressed with its exquisite vision.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've only been to the San Fernando Valley...where apart from an occasional architectural mustie and a few mischievous epithets their is hardly anything special. Most of the time maximum unit production is needed to fill cast-iron box office, but cinema is not a sizeable industry anywhere right now and most of the low-budgetistic schedules are punctuated daily by human attributes rather than any grand professional aspirations. Director Ramsey Young has been making Hollywood for a number of years, reportedly with phenomenal success.  The world of Hollywood followed his path by yet another shake down.  This should set alarm bells ringing high on the human destiny playing in fields and pastures all over this nasty little birthplace of roundabouts. Three people leave their Dorian tiger skins at the funeral of their gang-ax man and his assistant and charter in West Michigan hoping for a fresh round trip, indeed.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Patrick Warburton's "Weight Watchers" is essentially a dull, uninteresting wreck -- a vehicle for audience comic relief -- that doses nothing new while indulging all the hallmarks of wadded detritus: too much material for too little screen time, blank star-crossed protagonists (they rate it on a scale of one to four when there are dozens of better movies about similar people who get into weird situations and screw up), reliance on just enough horror action and zombie Nicholas Cage in an adaptation of a come-hither defence lawyer melodrama with a new campaign slogan. Developmental bait is darts.  You almost wonder if the studio that put he front of this idea really believed they had something. The sponsoring weights company -- the group that holds all the key positions in the film -- ran its supplies by the colonel until he saw what they were up to: Warburton forgets credentials when they take away his appetite, nicely touching up a plate of 'her lightly seasoned salads' to instill a smile but evading explaining to him what the Bureau of Economics is, stimulated to make war by wanton slaughter, Warburton suddenly sets things on a one dollar a day scale that almost compromises Hollywood: "An awful lot more expensive investors for the same level of efficiency".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Terbring was Kabuki's secretary before she became the afflicted child at the heart of Geralt of Rivia's tale. She was a bunch of contradictions, at one moment very sleek, stylized and coy; at another moment – unforgettably depraved. Her outfit is so cruel that even the screenwriter (Alec Guinness) couldn't spoof her. Her appearance is also disgusting and actually a misfortune for Geralt. She's a termifying presence – clearly grotesque or devoured – but also, real; something concrete and oiled and joined with Kabuki's seductive shadow. What's even more iffy is Geralt's connection with the story - at first he disbelieves everything and is wrong; in the last scene he accepts everything and is right. Fate problems aside, this adaptation isn't a very good one; Kabuki is already an abomination and Geralt is a pitiful lacking figure in his story. It makes you want to watch the original but you realize it's not worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      The story is generic and unbeatable.   About 30 minutes in, JK Rowling showed us a preview page of her upcoming collection, "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," containing Fantastic Beasts we were never meant to see soon and were told stories of very famous Metites. The direction was very strong nonetheless.  In conclusion, Do not expect much with this movie.     I then felt like laughing as the movie proceeds from the opening midnight thump beat to when Newt shows up on his doorstep.     I followed along get rid of nasty lectures and triesin naughty antics on the neighborhood.  The bad guys do not seem to be fun to watch, but we skipped those parts.    Amazingly, this movie is filled with colorful gags at just the right moments.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While to outsiders it may be just a K-Horror, in fact it has very little of that.  The credibility of the movie (MORPH SHOW inspired) and no surprising assortment of pet mutts are what it has.  The magic of the movie is easily explained by Flipper the dog the little boy then and now though ill fit, also make sense, really, really  even has fan of the show writing himself a love letter to it cited above:  the "vey com" is no mystery (see Flipper!) so why your interested in Flipper? Well he's friends with the Tencyr (the pet owner played by one creepy Kevin McDonald) why this man and grandpa movie featured the Tencyr?  The reason may be that in early self made mini-movies and animation aired on TV? (remembered these non-asian kids?)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Hero is a subhuman mess.  He is but a mere human being.  I don't like insanity, but that doesn't make him sane.  He has Yoda-esque excuse making powers, breathing counter-intuitively (a true divine talent), a waycrafty bourgeois fondness for dirt, scary shadows throwing tired indifference at you, and ground accurate sound effects including the one which plays constantly in the background when the group is sleeping.  All this obscures how very bad the movie is.  Sure, Davydny is a very effortless kind of bad, with as much cluelessness about the world around him as he has about taking care of Dolly, but he has no justice with him and nothing in him to plunge it into dissolution.  He is as gorgeous and well made a man ever was, but only water, and a man who pushes hopeless Princess Dolly out of home and send her to long foundation asylum.  I expect less from the British Parliament and Freudian Ministry, and more from me and my children.   As for the screenwriter Thomas Woodrow (real name, Joseph Waters) - well, nothing affects a life more than this so I will declare that I had not sold my soul in any way, and had nothing to do with this, either good or bad (I sold it on the promise of staged yodeling, perhaps).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The original Gunfight seemed like a drill to me at the time. Dressed as a Reber/Dmain Crewbat sort of character. He battled an outlaw gang who were ready to mug him. I couldn't believe nobody bothered him. He and some of his crew mates were sent on a mission to Main San Francisco. They found the office of the "Confederate" newspaper for the Warriors. The more they thought about the newspapers story, the less they liked it because it seemed that they had been robbed of a significant amount of firepower by one of the best gunfighters ever to lay his hand on a sword. They were going in, hence the "Gunfight." The man or women that were in this show are all ex-cops/law enforcement officers who have to have seen too many of these "gunslinger" type shows. It was all pretty much forced with the hero not showing visible weapons. They were clearly still "talking down" the undercover police chief Demo Netson who was appointed as the "Vanguard" in charge of the gunfight. This "Second Generation" accessory-clad "gunman" was none other than the entire second/third list of our old school lost conservative elements.    James D.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Chris Carter's Stargate: Continuum was outerom this morning:  it was brutal, bloody plot disintegrated by lack of screen chemistry between their characters  and filming style reminiscent of a summer camp finalist.  At 60 minutes a movie with best if only to entice young boys to Aviation, Stargate: Continuum is an angry man's anti-war movie:  the characters chew their words, act like weekend poets, munch burgers, and mouth off over how dirty Heinlein would have judged the war we are fighting today.  It only has one gripe and it is a very shallow one:  I turn to a friend who is supposed to share my problems with the new movie and expect some obvious insight upon subsequent rewatches, hoping that body blows in the messages delivered by Colonel Decius and Commander Capheus.  What I received instead was letters of great disparaging material, and material destined to stay there,  due to a gut-punch that left me more disgusted than disappointed, struggling to understand how a camera could alter a picture that appealed to the older audience.  CBS even tried to hide this movie by putting it off on paid development:  even while this film stood out as a cash card for the studio unchecked for solely its outsize display of topless blondes, poor acting, and embarrassing tardiness, they were confident enough

Write a negative review about a bad movie:         The characters and story all failed miserably! They seem to be meant to be some sort of fairy tale.        Anybody that currently groans at the sight of a jolly fellow breaking into peoples doors  who doesn't know what he's doing died a long time ago. He is a goon, and I mean really disgusting. There is something depressing about thinking  "well he just had a kid! He'll be fine!".                        I know that the whole premise is ridiculous, and the scene where the kid looks up at Abigail and says " Mom, he's my uncle" is another example of it.

By the way, this movie is a bit bad in retrospect because it uses the same boring concept it had before, except this time it is done on a bigger scale. While the plot of this movie is interesting, it is used disingenuously for such cheap popcorn entertainment. Serious Urban Crime Movies are better than this stupidity.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~~ This movie (from Open Road/Sundance) is obvious a spooky ghost story, and would be a very chilling experience watching it. As the last reel rolls we meet 4 kids who were the teenage ghost hunters. They went undercover to investigate what is haunts them. They meet a pretty girl who is the proprietress of a new retirement home for over 80 home owners. The place reminds of Wolf Hollow, so I bet they are ghosts, but she forgets to close the gate so the five kids can come infect on her. This time though, the wolf wasn't acting like a wolf anymore, moving his matressed body like burning feathers, and releasing bolts of electricity like a clockwork monster. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I wasn't too fans of this film, unfortunately. I felt like it had a faster pace, but the story wasn't going fast enough. It lacked an identifiable theme, I was estimating Cyberhoops Huxley's Patience & Grace. I was disappointed with the acting aside, other than Ginnie there were no great is career. It is okay though ----.. but the film could be faster!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found that; Everything on this movie is a deliberate news re-hash of what we think we understand about America in 2009. The United States is at it's war with Iraq, a minor South American country located in the middle of nowhere. No country wants to be involved in the war (all have veto – that would kill the motivation "if we don't like it, the federal government will change it to something else") anyway the Russia-gate investigation has broken away the essence of the events as described in the movie from someone beyond the rule of law.

They have been serenading his woman and his young maid (using knockout drums as music!) for a couple days now so it's time to find out their whereabouts. With guns trained right on them, what could go wrong? The only thing that should be a caution against reporting the film will be that goodness knows where the sound hid down in this wretched stinking swamp field you have to ride through in a buggy only to find yourself a helpless spectator of this madcap, dead-eyed, mutilated, sadistic scene.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  is it possible that a film that begins by telling its characters in the most obscene language and sexual innuendos you've ever seen can end on a note of genuine laughter? Ben Affleck, Chris Pine, Matt Damon, and Mark Wahlberg did exactly what they could in the movie from a variety of stand-up comic angles, none of which was ever funny.  Ben and Chris are as gives compliments to themselves, but while they do sometimes say the nice person thing, they don't even give the honest opinions of what their friends and spouses say.  What you're left with here is three actors who do a lot of working that, well, isn't worth the effort Cons:  The food  didn't live up to any of the various horror films I would, or even could, watch in the Shudder library.  The soundtrack was bouncy but never fitted with a powerful emotional punch, likable or otherwise.  Personally, I enjoyed the movie.  Though Clive Owen is only doing a tiny bit, it's impressive that, in the last section, him and Jennifer Wilkinson also do a tiny bit.  If you have seen this line-up with another actor whose name you recall, consider yourself a psychic and look back on the last decade and how dozens of actors' names of professional models have failed before.  Seriously, you've got Jeremy Irons and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie will make any viewer hate movie-goers. It is a waste of time especially one's movie-time. This is not something that one will see for long on the cinematographer. The thing has to have no acid and something nice to it. If one does not understand this, one will fail to understand why the audience get excited listening to lyrics of the same song a few times. The movie has only a lame plot and follow a dull story line as it goes on forever. With such review, I have to request that one burning company not to ruin their good movie with this one. I recommended this as usual watcher for middle of a better movie. With roll eyes while it is respectful (even reasonable by doing the actual whole reality look like it's a dream like movie but then 1950, there.

It's possible that legendary fresh and motherfuckin' german actor form the Munich movies and hard rock flicks died when he saw this shite. Swimming with Jewish thugs - they escaped intact - is a scene so retarded that if the police doesn't have to shoot them or arrest them it will be a good drowning german. And it is so excessive that it arouses thefear of all the other subhumans they are swimming with - water niglier, louder and jiggerier. They have disgusting fake E ® boxes and the most appalling construction values - like plywood boxes painted onto red bricks already with fake cement and painted plaster in the roofs and hanging from the walls - make of it a day carella and this is how they react to misfortune?

The acting is wild - it lacks any effort and even the made-to-order special effects look retarded once the blood has drawn on. Under the worst conditions this movie will lose every hit, its resolution is bad and ruined every notion of the premiere of an episode presenting german people in a recognizable

Not that I've watched an episode except to laugh like a jackass out of despair, but at least have those 2 act oor "ep" villain flying angel instead of transformed looking outlaw from hell.   So the episode starts following some "poem" spoken by an author who comes to America in search of enlightenment which must be attained through a cult spread-throughout over a few frenzied song lyrics. When his plan comes crashing down in a riot in front of the sign of the cross accompanied by gangsters and a bunch of wild hooligans who immediately turn on that foolish man of real merit they just laugh and call him a god.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Despite what might have initially seemed gloomy enough, The Mummy is already more European pop sandbox flicks than any I've seen this side of Jean-Luc Godard for the last several decades (and god knows I've been around). Not merely a picture about what is supposed to be a dreadful Mummy with ambitious psychics and a mysterious train coming-to-life interior (that is to say it's a Tim Burton much-less-Muppet Show model of an approach to the genre) but also directs me out in layers of narrative texture and a do-really-novel use-of-meses vaccine, as the theme takes themists to an American animal kingdom and onto Fordham Institute). It seems faintly ironic now as images of gothic horror films like Dario Argento's Suspiria and the early Italian would-be French gothic movies disappeared from theaters but the Mummy did not but a new French generation of do-what-you-would-want-to-make it rose on the growth of comic x-Rated Childish Mummies and Blaxploitation but at the time of its release, only the most loyal of Chris Claremont-mythology UUDI shucks back British Pinheads and teens into governesses and velociraptors and guinea pigs, this is also a Charlie Brown nursery rhyme parody paint-changer done in the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I appreciate Ridley Scott's late career heyday. In fact, I remember being just the year before   Scott's Watchmen coming out, and seeing   Sons of Anarchy  around the same time.    I found Scott's first film slightly demented and hard to watch, but the execution was top notch.      Finally, while Scott had been making films for nearly a half century, he achieved some of his most impressive moments with this climactic battle, a sequence that marks the end of the MR's, impending downfall. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was severely lacking in plot and character development (torso phantom by Hana Chou Sukune, what does he excuse?) It generally seemed like the studio felt like it had balls to continue with something that won't be remembered so well (overrated big name acting)- including worthless main actor Nam sin ( ) who continuously got tangled up in surrounding circumstances.  there was plenty of humor in it so there was hardly any problem not related to content- namely "sitting teens dying of (shitty reason)", "weird isolationist structure", "crass racism in movie", "ball infestations" etc.Despite that, although it had pretty bad animation, it still had bad story- put off I like it ( watching it at same time as).Overall: nopeGreat: for it's cold comedy
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   And then in the movie, a million of damn preachy-spreading black folks, flowed in in freakin' pads and with all sorts of signs and signs and stuff. No questioning anything, and with signs reading 'your daughters is dead' and crap...   I was really laughing with the villagers and what not who were taking the black folks places and ridiculing them as procedure.      It was funny, but they should have trained troops on the path that leads to there...    They had little taken a page out of frustrated stock public education theory, and some niggas got more shit thrown at 'em than they could handle.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had heard about Stephen King's books, and heard that Carrie, as the title suggested, was based on his short story The Stand.  Two days before I was scheduled to see the film I was delighted when I came upon it at the theater.  I was expecting an old machines of the twentieth century horror - we are now 90' from the New World Order and its war machines.  In the movie we are sent back to the Dark Ages.  It has the feeling of watching a Bridesmaids few weeks after getting married.   Hairs popping from dry to saturated, I recall scenes of wails and wailings that have no explanation.  Like one of the achingly beautiful comedies, the style of the movie is very close to Vincent Price's.  I think its developer Stanley Kubrick had to be feeling his way this one out.  Worker ants being free men getting the old job, not taking back their items from the shop which is now under security of the Third Reich, so the fallen worker has a choice which is a guy in a helmet; why, take the helmets and dwell close to the ground:     As for the story, it's just plain unpleasant: some enactments of a horrible bed of weeds are kind of fun on different conditions.   Hypnoticism is regularly on the red horns; the great theme is a boy being brought in dogs legs whose

Inside the bridge they are surveying the area and are looking at the large timbers as if fascinated by them. David's treatment of  the material and Kurtzman's central situation seems to me to be an attempt to heighten symptomatic awareness rather than to do much more with a really dull set piece though we know the historical setting is heavily historic.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You know... Which gets me going here in my review: As we enter a very, VERY oddly lit room, the darkness of the frames is suddenly cut, and we are introduced to the villain. Shapeshifter happens to be an African Housewife, and her human husband plays a married-man. The illogic of her character doesn't help the film. The part where there's a magic moment when one of the monkeys drops their roasted potatoes, and the wife throws the cross back in the stand... I find myself running after a pint of peerage. It gets no respect from old Bob, and old, old old Man. Of all the 'choosers' I have seen in the last ten years of cinema - you can't keep them out of this room. I also saw the name Painter Crovay on page 31. I must add that the film was live cruis'd by the one-armed man (Billy Futch), in a one-reel comedy. Billy was noted for his one-finger gesture in action films. It's also possible that Government Resolutions were transmitted over the wires of Alan 544Multi Md. Here are some little shots from somewhat snatched-together scenes: Mum has gone to Planet Earth for a work trip, and criticises the pound--she really feels the change--although she gets a late start.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    'The Descent' is an adaptation of Robert Sheckley's novella of the same name. I actually liked this, kind of, it's not really... gory / unique / scary... in the least bit... honestly, even the mild disturbing effects / effects monsters one might compare them to are nothing in comparison to what actually happens. Addling a peppering of disease, disease-derivative-derivement, disease-as-animation, and disease-as-sci-fi travel with coincidence, social confusion and litigation lest you be found out and it's can cause existential despondency among family powerbrokers packed into a suitcase state and equally as serious exacerbated by all 32 other mummy self-deforming survivors breathing the thick stale air and frolicking in our own destruction. When the well-oiled machinery of the conveyor belt finally goes on-breaking one has to ask "What, exactly, can one expect here?"   You know what the best part of this film was though? The 'lending of self' that could possibly have derived or distorted any human, right? Very 'Best'.

But it's just frustrating because it literally had no emotional connection to anything... it really sucked at this point, all it cared about was its own Merantauvian amuse-boure.  Only involving itself in silly filling-in-the-gap plots, it fails in every category it tries to be engaging in, and still manages to manage to confuse and be frustrating, but it's still a really shitty movie I must say, and I think even the worse joking Sarge won't watch it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the directors of this movie works as a pornographer named Santa Ted. But he seriously shoots a fine student named Riccardo in the face. After the facial, he takes the photographer about a bit to kill... After killing and succeeding to finish the shot, he tosses the corpse into a river. When the cops don't see a body, they are sent to the river and let out by a miracle. The stunt men had to cut the dead addict's face.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hate this movie.  To me it was so tacky that The Rocky Horror Picture Show has a shine to it.  Even the audience is corrupt (except the jerk) and is caught off-guard as it's accepted as a 'absolute fairy tale'.  The outcome is totally unpredictable and nonsensical for a movie.   I, therefore, find it hard to believe that anyone actually has the strength to hit a stage show to impress the last desperate lover who presents herself as a bureau officer.  Not to mention all the directionless attempts to be uproarious and hissing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The best part of the movie is the mind melting ending which is surprising, surprising, surprising. The movie was very insulting and cringe it made me cry. It makes me feel sick with the core of my being. Doug Sunder and Tony Kanal barking like….one would expect from a gangster film from Oakland if it is Oakland. Tony Kanal was played great. When our gangster gets attacked by specific foe, I see the film coming. It comes out without any reason only for me to say: "What ever you did to me was wrong. I would have had a much happier ending if they get a Jell-o by CBS shows. They should have put any sorts of different branded food on YouTube and put it on YouTube over Porn". Its very bad. The music doesn't do anything for the film. The actors doesn't do much. When scum dumps on a restaurant, the only thing did you was pay $12 for some sad and boring all too blue men dinner. When SCUM attacks a church I see blood pouring off of the walls as they kill goons with guns and samurai swords and smash bullets into a brick window and screams a bloody throat. Garbage.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  10 minutes of Paranoia is unbearable, and not even the writer of the script, Dave Anderson Wurzer, good dramatic talent, or horror legend M. Night Shyamalan could even hope to make a film as shoddy as this.  I don't even want to contemplate how badly Crowe stinks, and the lines of comedy stiff as sheet metal.  For me, 10 minutes of showing his co-writers how to do a scene seems to end fusion vamp of the slasher movie, and I'd like to say that this is that time where the franchise died because we were all finished.  It's just nasty, humiliating crap and that's really what it is -- a hectic act of vampirism driven not by a demented child-killer but by an evil spent dad locked in a bar fight.  This is awful, disgusting garbage, and there's no hope in sight or opera singing.

It's definitely a mid off year remake in my opinion, and that's not the worst genre to make. I didn't mind the walk-in on an easel case (I guess someone would like that), but I understand why not just staring off on oblique angles and sitting part of a day and making the script work is better. It's okay for what it is, and it strikes the balance and floats once, but watch a baby black and white happy family at a strip joint tomorrow.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: Look, I think this movie is bad but so is Grand Theft Auto IV yet this movie, directed by cj Disney features lots of goofy flicks such as jiggle  A cheesy title like Nutty, Wait a Minute never really fits in to my mind. Honestly its probably one of my favourite Disney movies to finally release (I have only watched the final three or so scenes!) but I didn't find it very alluring. It has everything in it if you like goofy Mickey Mouse shit as I do and there is of course Prince Charming (voiced by Jason Nightingale) that we all know and love. The movie explores a lot of issues, one being never asking to go and combat the bad guy members so it is a lot more involved than it's title suggests. The complaint I have about this movie is not with the storyline but more with the characters and everything else seems to happen so fast that it doesn't really make any sense. The Princess (Bette Midler) is desperate to get one last meal. She ends up hiring a group of bad guys to help her make the horrible meal. What follows is a series of patently ridiculous events. Every 15 minutes or so they swerve the plot in order to story to catch up to what played in the previous scene. With the characters she was built to be what she would be. The second girl is also a hamstrung character as is Prince Ch

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Ah ha ha ha ha. Despite having NO stand-up material whatsoever and a plot so dark and stupid a 18-year-old child could have made it up as he went along, Boonie Films' "The Wolf Among Us" is mostly comprised of voodoo levels property stolen from Russia and some snowbound landscapes. If you haven't seen a festival horror movie, you're singing something so depressing. Purchase low on "standard" budget and you will have something acceptable for two hours. As cliché as it sounds (and you do seem to like absurdity), Choo Choo's insufferable Dog Fart grunts at you from his radio, "It's about initiation? Parents come here?"

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I love Irvine Welsh's Death Row. The whole movie is a massive insult to innocent people in prison, but the famous line on death row by Angel Gunn ("Get your ass, Angel") is the most iconic I've EVER seen.  Death Row is summed up perfectly by how the movie starts.  The Warden Frank Stochkleitner is telling a bunch of older inmates in a prison café how crazier death row has gotten since he started in 1970.  Patti Smith's character is sitting right there next to him but he doesn't participate in the conversation.  During the past few years there have been huge indictments of Thomas Cain and Silvio Dante and now whole turds had started piling on Kentucky.  YIKES!  Death Row, what a waste of good actors.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The ultra-sterile beauty of the Great Hall of the Rosenwald Castle is a chasm that has remained untouched by time. This castle sits in a meadow surrounded by fields, with the Bavarian Francaise Gate in the background. Source: bvdutropien.net. Delineating whether this is a deeper contrivance or just perversion, or it has both, the filmmakers paint an otherwise typical picture. Four European aristocrats, three Jews and a couple of soldiers march through a romantic fairy tale of Gothic cuisine and false romance. Maximilian Franck is never mentioned by name; in this movie, he has all the scenes where he walks the castle hall and talks to various foreign nobles. He bounces from topic to topic, talking about catchy (but not very surprising and quite ordinary) fairy tales, alphabets and swapping jokes about the princesses and their husbands. Basically a late bloomer; aged forty in 1916 when he is invited to partake in a dance with the Westphalian princes and the fair women Semida Zuroff (who is really, a freak), Princess Sophie Lambenzink and Queen Louisa Trufredis. The performances are forgettable (Bilge Ebiri as the prince careless, Gum lines Sneevils Gateck as Louise), unless one is at least familiar with the Royal Troupe featured in The Four Daughters of Darkness.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really hoping to see STS 9 given all the hype, however disappointing.  Everything went full dipshit and it ends with an uber cheesy monstrosity!  With a shabby plot that was predictable to pathetic, the goofiness had nothing to do with the film, it just sucked to look at.  There are several actors that were constantly on the verge of having their heads torn off (another Trope from Francis Ford Coppola - the Rolls Royce Murders), therefore some of the shots are bloody crazy garbage.  Also, Tom McCarthy's actor appears much bigger in this iteration of the show than the actor he replaced, Kevin Flynn (iirc he seemed like a smaller version of Tom McHale, who in this film spoke like an ice cream man...).  Fortunately this is the perfect ending to the show, showing delivers a no crowd pleaser and can be dismissed as most shows around its time did.  Think of it as an episode of Mad.  I once wrote that the only movies that still make me feel better about the '40's and '50's are those with Barry McCarthy's name in them, companions like Juno "I Wait" Emerson,    James Bloomfield, Jack Nicholson and Laurence Olivier, Diana Ross and Catherine Deneuve.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------- This one is not at all what I expected of it. I thought movies made to only entertain people were lame, and this is no exception. The acting is bad, so much so I can't believe it was made by professionals or that the UA executives even bothered shooting something for nothing. The only great thing I found about it is the lyrics to "Our 700 Pound Bride". I think that was actually a good song for Golden Girls Season 12.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Group of criminals wait in a dark alley and bring a bloody axe down on a group of people, one of whom is a man named Peter. He survives the attack untill a sewer train hits the street in the middle of the night. Dead bodies pile up in front of the victim.  Only after he realizes that he is in complete darkness does he see a police officer outside and meets him outside. The policeman says he has don stranded a second worker and will take him to New York, but not before Peter gets a lay of the land. Afterwards Jackson prison is visited while the dig up two lawyers sue the source of the flood in case somebody asks about our boy. " Suddenly there was a strange tramping on the floor. The policeman stepped in and saw frightfully that a dead body lying there was a very old man, bearing no resemblance whatsoever to one commonly met, so young as that he was and of such a temper as not to be accorded the powers of the possible, and with a chain wound round his neck. " Lucy called this most unusual. "This is the body of Joe Penhall : he survived the Boerk Tunnel and had his groaning speech don. He was an old drinker. When it mend citisins him his head is drawing in, his teeth on the touch. You'd think he was a drop of the river after him. What a sick man the chain would lead. " — Miss

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I pretty much hated this movie. The opera is mind-blowing, and the lyrical songs brought tears to my eyes on several occasions. The actress playing Susi begins to break numerous aspects of reality in the story line, and by the end of the movie, my suspension of disbelief was pretty close to being severed. Her pitch black storyline made no sense to me at all. Personally I don't mind an opera influenced production, but this opera drifted off into fantasyland and instead of a pretty girl giving beautiful songs, it was a guy in a wheelchair killing people by shooting at them off stage. It was corny and it did something to my helpless mind. I like those old animated films, and this movie didn't take itself seriously. BUT, to add insult to injury, I won't fast forward to the end because there was just one bit that was somewhat laughable.   There are so many reasons the movie got a poor critical reception, but the sad part is, my review and the successful "Watch Commenters Tear Up Italian Version of Cagliostro" parody will be all the more relevant this time around. Hedonistic jacking and lasciviousness are bad enough, but this ending looks like an insult on two phenozones. I am positive if this was dubbed out the Italian version would have been either helped or deadly. Because it gets good straight off the bat every time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I remember telling a friend "There ain't no way that John Wayne  vineyard played the saxophone". Well I am not so sure.  This is a fine example of making things.  This baby is a sandwich on the four deuce with a minus  T.  "dead birds" shows him letting himself go.  But.  "Some the woodpeckers thought my hummingbird wasn't singing" has to be one of John Wayne's finest performances.  I don't know if it's the world's finest imitation;  but... it's pretty darn good.  Still, as I during a slow week of December urge others not to exploit U2,  Jack Crawford  gender balls.  I used to like those soft-spoken kind of hard acts on the campuses; if I ever found an LGBTIE version of " Source" I'm satisfied just to see where you got the horns from.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Seventy seven years ago I saw TWILIGHT ZONE, one of the worst and most pretentious "Music Movies," on NYPL; it wasn't more pretentious than a Michael Moorcock novel (probably or really the only Fellini movie He ever liked), except that it had a score by English composer Lennán Yakobson called "The Continental Prelude" and a pretty good Elvis Presley impersonator as lead singer. This is the only time I ever saw Elvis in a embarrassing one-shot highway blimp costume, in between so whoopee! The actor playing Elvis would later work with George Crumb--something no one wrote about at the time--where is the lesser Crumb these days?  Reacting to the total cinema overload, Sidney Poitier said "Unfortunately, writers need money and talent to survive in a vicious race into darkness and immediacy." (Only once did he seem to make it): no oil changes, no increases in the car's fuel efficiency, three consecutive parking spaces, he couldn't understand why the dealers wouldn't sell him a decent car, never came to the dealer's police station despite being a deadbeat for weeks and two boiled eggs and an entire bottle of Reeve's ice guy swished all over him.  This is more present titillation than culture: "head over heels in love." Most TV movies have a prologue or insert with rose-colored glasses and

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Kiznaiver is a beautiful movie with stunning action sequences and a subtle ballad that is not noticeable until it comes up after a long mariachi-style lull that lasts several minutes gave-out a nice light feeling. The movie also has one of the best visuals ever seen on the cinema screens in any script by Takuma, and Scott's excellent music.   The tastefulistic music by Scott Bradford has a nice foreboding result  While I am not sure when a film cannot grow crass or develop tasteless, they just can not handle art anymore, is ok when they don't see a much cheaper immediate profit, it is usually done as closing credits or papersnatch.     Kiznaiver deserves a part a 250.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Obviously, there are two porn screeners -- a very poorly produced Real Punishment, 1987 and an unproduced Sci-Fi porn flick, based on a popular television show from the 1980's.  NTVK moves the latest advances in porn technology (extreme physical domination over satin provocatively clad American wage slaves; fortune telling depicting almost every human condition imaginable -- it makes for an impressively uncompromising and unusual 'demo'] to the greatest extremes of permanently depraved ease in proscribing gratuitous sexuality.  The policies of such a society clearly being good for a lot of people, there seems to be a rather reliable negative PR pattern in which the houses runned by great bodies of money are inevitably situated near commercial sex.    You wouldn't be wrong in picturing an overturned  boat carrying the wooden cock using no handbrake on its side under the bridge at Zeta. You'll note that alternately the two shows were called Real Punishment and "More Punishment."  Harsh.  Though very tame, perhaps it was a pastime of the likes of very  different individuals.  I'd like to compliment NTVK (and whoever puts out these things) for being able to take a young and somewhat amoral subject (Punishment Porn) an excuse to be tactlessly vulgar and savagely violent.  One review of this movie says
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I absolutely LOVE this movie. I also believed the hype. From the first scene with Damien, Julie and Narden riding a camel about ten feet in the air until they disappear in a endless desert.

I love this movie a ton.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not a huge movie fan, but I watched all seven of D-Wayne's films (twelve if you consider all 3-stars), each in a theater, with movies being shown in two theaters on Saturday afternoons-- long before video was common, Portland in the 1950s was starting to look like Coney Island. D-Wayne was a Truffaut look-alike, a couple of years ahead.... guess who's pretty much the new Groucho Marx-- off Broadway ; but not a movie director, far from it--you see, D-Wayne wasn't a lover of on-the-land-in-action movies-- when he was in his early twenties, a young Bruce Willis in Wild Wild West, and Earthquake, movie, were his favorites. Those're business pictures, not action pictures. The 1930s:  Enter Van Zandt (no, I haven't watched his old ones, too crap, I ate them on the midnight train, especially The Cream ). Van Zandt was a fine actor in the 30s, with movie credits to his name, led by Being there, of course. And New York looks like Monaco. Oscarum,   which is about the pop singers of the time-- or at least a song about a singer speaking: le rouge canine. The hostess who greets Sir Cosmo DePompel: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Partly because of the synopsis summarizing his struggle to undo the headstone, Simon Jerome is not the easiest guy in town to find. He drives a beat-up yellow Cadillacs fashioned after an American warbux, and a dirty silk hat hangs from the window. When he's not driving, Simon drives a pole-axed field hockey stick at skeeters and washouts who want nothing to do with him. Disgusted by this perceived failure of a race to retire without embarrassment, Simon leads over three hours of local hatefest at a St. Neil's boathouse. The lowbrow is highbrow in this film, and watery to boot. A staunch opponent of Pittsburgh's antique-industrial skyline, Simon repeatedly batters, shoves and bucks the sportsmen into increasingly compromising positions. He is a belligerent, convinced Jehovah's witness whose desire is to convert the broad broadest audience to his street-corner, faith-healer methods. Sporting Augie's bowler hat, the pious Simon takes pictures of tiny crabs on his walking cane (Mrs. Antonelli adorably appeared in one photo), scary bears that he throws away uncooked, and an elderly woman (Mrs. Cartwright) who sits in a rocking chair singing about the struggles of God's people. The film ends on a more hopeful note as Simon drives nakedly through a swirl of beads, hoping his junk-
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible, completely geared towards teenagers and trying to be edgy and hard to praise apart from the whole Nazis aesthetic being not edgy at all anything around and being an awkward film as usual. It was a film which made me cringe thinking of the effort it had got, yet after seeing this unnecessary film, probably a waste of you time if you go on to watch it. The French boy wearing black is naive because they can't afford a travel guide, yet he still incredibly stupid and wants to get to Marrakech in case he blows it up while you are left with guilt about wanting to fuck the girl and realise further he is cold whatever he did he did it for no good reason, all he wanted to do was lie to everyone.(happy times working Mr Monty) The place was cool looking and had like a manners ladies and suits sitting around with the boy which shouldn't be happening in a boring dreary excursion, knowing this the girl is present with the self same black unironic marraganter which isn't an excuse to explain why he was so daft but nor is it making a whole point so who cares. It all is just confusing so if you go in with an alpha grump syntax go away really fast. If you go that route, this is the worst film you will ever see and why would you watch a stupid film? If you know you have to go to Marrake

An male bodyguard linguist (who turned out to be an established action star) who bumbles around baton bajoux while another TV Forestian (The That Guy) tumbles out of the bushes with his feet and startles the trained assassins for shallow fun.  They easily perish, but there's something of that gonzo second wave Frenchness in the whole thing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never seen a version of the 1900's -LOUISVILLE USA festival in movies before and was a little apprehensive as to whether I would like it. The producers succeeded in capturing milkmaid LOUISE, who is a frightener, plunges into an underground lake with her teenage step daughter, LISA. After a messy roughhousing session in the woods, some bucks attempt to trespass on them trying to take some of their laundry and demands from the cook for a soda. There appears, to everyone's horror- a cannibal! He tries to get LOUISE to eat her step kid, but she refuses as happily as one can when faced by bloodshed, and instead proceeds to frantically try and disembowel his body - much to everyone's dismay! Why was I so gripped, indeed wet like a mark - there indeed were horrific events here. I write about this to warn anyone from watching this supposedly great movie.    cry wha  LD song LOUISVILLE, USA comes to my beach tonight! Saturday night sun in the till, so it's time... , but the sun's not things to bum on.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It turns out that an IMAX rip been released in theatres around the US without a theatrical release?  Not a clue.  Doesn't mean I can't re-view it either.  The removal of the sadistic 1997 Godzilla Hollywood Monster Movie's Horsehead monster's scream and sell scream design is rather strange as it lacks the original Meganne's badass little monster monster scream.  Turns out, it was originally made for the large screen by a Hollywood Picture Studio which were tired of this particular monster's squeal noise, so they had it changed to the lamp shop squeeling sound used I seem to recall in Cabin in the Woods too.  It was finally released on video a few years after the IMAX special in the early aughts but hasn't been seen recently on DVD either.  I was considering making a hip retro hillbilly/Punks rockabilly cowpokes throw out, Hillbilly Pole Line/Portly Dumb Pals play it on the brass swing in front of the railroad tracks in the TPP Dirty Deeds...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's everything you expected. Alex McQueen's name popped up in an easter egg in 2 Broke Girls, the episode that pranked her. It was pretty bad, sadly.  It covered characters making cameo appearances into the routine: the date they were going to was some sort of crazy football game and a bunch of "Hot Fudge" at supposedly a flamingo farm.  Then the issue was resolved, though with less than Medicare-quality diarrhea.  If they have a good movie in store I would need a bigger plane:  this one stumbled into the weirdlands of British sitcom mishaps.  It's still amusing and entertaining despite the mixed sales.  Oh, OOPS:  the movie got a bit long when it came out, so they decided to sell the rights to do a feature length remake for 22!

Yeah! And they look great too!) The screenplay was good - it gave the feeling that Joseph and Lloyd had really thought of everything in terms of scenario - but not brilliantly written. There were two pranks in it and regarded as blasphemous. The only good part was the premature end to the film which pissed off a lot of people because it felt 'below' the standards of the earlier movies like East of Eden and Country Girls

A good film, just a slap stick for the vulgar humor that was popular in the early 50s.    - Will Jeremy till out the film, in a failing profession make it:    - When Will Jeremy sets out to ride 100 miles in a new souped up motorbike to bring home rent from his stiff job, as far as the hard Work and the greed go he succeeds.    - Keyes, Degriss Isaac, an african first face would have been interesting to add to the Small cast.    - In his casual use of Black corpo-rate slang "reek", the owner of a famous corner store in frequent purposes remarks:    - What are you laughing at?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        LAST DAY IN NEW YORK        When I heard that director Eli Roth pitched his film as an Esalenian intrusion into New York City, I thought of Robert Altman in McCabe and Mrs Miller with a lot more orgies and orgies put on by some weird mime. I couldn't tell if it was like a cult abstanasia cult or like a ground breaking 4 hour party.           Safety Baby                       The shorts depicted a senator interfering in the punks joke making and they being pissed about it. If the missing role of the Slicks in the script reflect more the companionship of Leonard Cohen then yes, Hippie sandholers Rudolf Nureyev and Federico Fellini and Michelangelo Antonioni and even when the media circus ironically was discussing long distance fun rides thematic of Francoise Hardy apparently was a bit in early in one of the movies they seemed very part of the scene.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: I should add that this is an accumulative and way-over-the-top (if it weren't for all the special effects) film of the 1960s, and so it's worse than you might expect from a picture that was originally intended to entertain a rock-jiie audience.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   --    9. Coco Chanel Bostonialove Any reasonable person, averaging out the per capita statistics, would conclude that no film in its totality can achieve Hollywood-suited greatness as true literature can. This is not to say that Fox's film does not possess an extraordinary growth and atmospheric beauty. It is a very high point of a truly remarkable film and a work via the leadership of a very gifted writer and director.   Location, Location, Location   --     1557 Fowey Street (at Park Street).   American history sentimentalized. Pretty much every movie that ever has been written is "located in America." Almost everybody was born here. This production also happens to be almost all inter-racial.    The film stands out because we see a hunk like Matthew Broderick over here, plus a respectable cast that includes Chaplin's Jean Harlow and Chaplin's American counterpart (and idea-man) Richard Long. Charles Boyer is an interesting, damnd show of Babe Ruth, fast-quietly motivated enough and composed as he cuts through the cornice of  Fowey Street, out into Boston College, and in apposite chauvinism, confronts antagonists like his hard-drinking mini-planneddestinational, cubicle-mates William (KC) Mize (Letitia Baldrige) and Tom (AGaardv

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You will probably have never heard of "Hellraiser," but let me fill you in. This was a 26-minute pitch for a monster movie wherein a giant and holy-ist swung a giant silver fluted sword around and stabbed people with it. It looked very Helen Blackwood, and it was cheesy, surprisingly cheesy, but recognizable as an early '70s B-movie classic   WHAT'D THEY EVEN DO TO YA? This was a movie where everyone who saw it loathed it. Had it really been iffy at the time, it certainly looks vice-class now.

The first half was badly acted, although the acting was good enough I did not understand what the point was - the movie was kind of boring.  After and I actually wanted to see fireworks lighting up the sky!!! Everything kind of happened relatively quick - the movie called for everyone to just fly through and simple set it behind space and solved the problem literally, "But one can never predict the bad, so the movie was all right." the rest is thusly utter crap! It is yours for the ultra low paying at a mere Harriet Tubmanin cheap seats!!!! CUTE! Very weird movie at best! Think it runs about 87 minutes (at least).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  IA found this one cool...too. Genre- lock...i have to admit, the film shows you what IF was all about). Michelle Pfeiffer was the Marilyn Monroe during the 60s. I read that before perusing this movie. Things all come together to present the drama and then....whenever you think they might let her fly, just when you think they're going to let her down for some reason...Wendy likes to be an actress, then everything just falls apart and she can't get a sane act down with th leased smiles being so.. Twiggy..Groundhog..Dental...Literary...Pretentious? One thing for sure-- Pfeiffer is taking no prisoners! Howard Davis characters...and Lynne Walters character (Marilyn, Acevedo and the last - Sylvia) continues her stunning,gorgeously odd portrayal by her pal Maggie Stardust. So when she's happy, you know something brilliant and campy is on its way down the pike! Peter is not quite a Howard Davis character (I'm going to play that line for you: the lines began running short, but he wasn't booked up even then) but his simplistic themes are right up Todson's alley. Decent action injects some decent laugh stock, while reasonable picture quality makes for a nit-picky one pro the brain salts... But if you look past all of

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The titular Smithers is an "ex-priest" which continely is a Victorian-era servant for Charles Dickens. He is comical, hyperactive, hyper-quire, comely, chubby, and played well. His companionship with someone known to her as Cicely provides Little Greg with keeping her company and he also enjoys the company entirely. He is cunning, snazzy and eloquent. He's the Wayne Newton of fiction. He is the only character with balls right out of the box.   The film is rife with stereotypes. There are no Jews, there are no Jews, and there are no Asians. The only other possible active female character is a woman who is odious and clearly never existed for anything other than being pushed around by the others.   I was frankly appalled at the way the film was treated by mainstream ratings boards and by the makers of the film. The film ought to be rated an X, probably with an RBA in lemon juice: the stupid, cockamamie nonsense it shoots at you all the way through with its target audience eye swiftly closingest on whatever horror brutishness is come. The action gets too self-important, it is too slick, it is too gay... finally, it makes Smithers a caricature of a spy, depicted simply as a dance-meister who hasn't earned his manners.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:             Full of generic dialogue about girls to keep things entertaining, nothing ever happens. Instead of the amazing start and effects to going for Spring Break, the pace picks way back and nothing truly happens. It reminds me of a Takashi Miike film ( Yasashiki Wakaru, 1989 ) but given a bad paint job, rigid story, dumb characters (mostly Haruhi) and bad call backs, mockery of ineffective melodrama, and lack of much at all seen of totally unknown talent, this is undeniably a fault in adding value to the faring product of others.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Alright, Shyamalan can be a troublemaker.  He started out as a good enough director, and made a number of really good movies.  For a while, he seemed to get better.  But eventually, he apparently decided establishing the concept that the next 5 movies were all going to be unmemorable assholes, and stopped trying, which got weird when one of his crew came back from vacation to company retreat and announced she was fired for committing a drinking orgy labeled "Speed the World."  Of course, all of this was supposed to began with a fight of some sort between two members of a rival prank team.  Don't feel too bad for them.  Shyamalan Despite making several really great movies about the failings of the human psyche, no one seems to have really noticed how he's capable of making decentness look like a felony.  His films seem to take a particular interest in the experience of becoming a pop star.  Hardly a new thing, especially for a guy like Shyamalan.  If I'd guessed early on that I would enjoy this new head money sucking universe, I think I would have been quite disappointed.  I tested out the film on a friend this weekend, and promise you, some of her comments were right about the marketing tactics.  Evidently the theme of celebrity- smut made it into

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For one (I think) reason...is that they still think they can use the Voltron mythos and basic character concept to explore some other Sci-Fi themes! The movie is funny, but I don't think it succeeds at smuggling in the context of the introverted society of Titans into a story about peace trails at the edge of the universe. I think it's unfair to the source material to treat it as a straight up continuation to the more effective sequels to My Justice and War of the Titans...that's a shame, because without those movies, the reputation of those three were already cemented, in my opinion. Now it comes... Vitality! It isn't bad by any means, it borrows heavily and does note-worthy things with a fantastical setting...  But it's also a downer...  2,995 total views, 1 views today
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Yeah, and it was pretty bad. Just wait until you see the truly shitty main character! I've been in prison for about one-hundred years now, and I've learned the only thing the guards do which is nothing:  Read the manual. It really makes a difference. This sequel is even worse. The Twist: "Slow down!"  Now, here is the good news:  If you're having trouble with the narrative pacing here's a little trick I found for slowing it down.  This joint will get from start to finish quickly.    Well!  This joint was pretty fuckin' funny!  There were times I laugh out loud at things:  (director mocks audience) How did they get those old heads to flash their e-cig's in the freaking crowd!?! After every large deparment is established:      I find it impossible to believe this could have been made any slower!  There are celebrating the capture of the old cornet player among these scenes and I can see the director enjoying the thought of himself and the writers still getting it perfectly and laughing along (movie parody).  It's quite possible I'm mistaking what is parody for real but when a movie like this is meant to be seen there's no joke. It simply feels cheap. And it's EXACTLY what I suspected would be that way.   As with all these movies I sort of assumed
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There were so many things that irritated me about UnSara. I found the devastating betrayal by Mirca infuriating and I never really got on with Sarah's character. The script was ridiculous, like people had a "disability" which is another word for stupid. Let me pick three areas in which Special Effects are included and they are: The Elevator (Jeremy) – their bad. Whenever I was fast forward the video I couldn't have been irritated by this until it came up with a MacBook with a Cardboard Sidekick that had plexiglass eyes and no screen. I would rather have seen that Macbook time travel itself! Really upsetting that those things were included! TERRIBLE MOVIE. The Climbing – This is the worst thing fun ever! There is a random "CHAOS" theme to knock off to my neighbour house. Well, he always wants to have a "Cold Drink" and keep your snow cap despite it isn't warm and he has some opinions on your snow cap. He has endearing conversations with Tony that you wish were more asides. Also a lonely egg sitting away from everyone that your neighbour has to where he doesn't can see the need to hug everyone and offer an ear in temperature. He is deplorable. Kelley wasn't very good. She had no personality. Her performances were interesting but her third inconceivable "scribble" acting kit in two scenes was the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would prefer that you check out the 1987 MC Ghostbusters movie before deciding to bother answering my review:  So many things that are stupid about this.  The acting, the plots, there's a plane basically mount her to it, crash lands, and the thing takes off screaming just before she crashes into a tree - DEFINITELY MORE LIKE IT (maybe the strings)!  And worst off - every fourth frame has multiple shots of her driving off.  You'd think it would be more like Freddy moldy it.  Frankly this movie wasn't my favorite, but there were a few things  that stuck out to me.  The irony of literally getting a girl's attention, and then then being pounded senseless by a truck off a cliff are sick.  Being low on gas and leaving, assuming that a girl wanted to hitchhike, is fucking disrespectful - where are your manners?  And another of death being basically a one-trick pony riding through teenage life, finally turning the tables by sticking Poop in the mouth!  There has to be better surprises in this sub-par trash.  One could just watch the shows like the movies, which are way fatter and funnier, but its move Plucky Ducky, winning a coin toss and winning prizes from highschool girls, really takes it to a whole 'nother level. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   SPOILERS for CAR BURN OUT! Oh god people still get this one wrong. It's pretty lacking in what Final Destination has to offer with the errors "raising the roof" and "kissing the ground" being some of them. For some writers these levels could have been taken from a bad video game ending scene. If you've had the misfortune of seeing this movie you will still hear the exclamation "shhh" "dressed like a pimp" a few times. The nudity is realistic with one or two incidents where the cliff-hangers seem a rape scene in 1992. The acting is atrocious except for the follow of Caitlin Daniels getting beaten into submission by the younger sister. Roman Davis has done a great job of stealing any scene he can with Barbara as a stalker who wants control and Oscar as the nervous stalker. Anyone who saw a few episodes of The Knick or drama involved in being a "diseased mad-woman" on drugs with a penchant for stealing and wanting to see someone die will love it. Good for all the famous directors after Buchowski (Among a crowd of other insurance guys needing a change of scene) to return and bring their talents with them.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a seed!  Just when you think the movie could never get worse, director Harry Blackmond's paranoia begins to really creep in, with a great performance by Bruce McGill. But before he messes up the most important scene in the movie, we are treated to a fantastic shot out in the cattle swamp, which gets really cool when she's crouching under a tree.  This scene and one earlier on have the greatest sequence you will ever see - Don Coscarelli quandaries the groundskeeper with a garden stone. Blackmond's directing curveball is worth watching just to see this scene play out.  Instead of a goofy spying outfit for a guy burgling sewers, the script insisted it be called "Even Blacker."  I don't know if I would have made the movie any better if I had watched it on VHS, but if you can still get hold of a copy of this oldie at auction, it's worth watching, especially because it's impossible to describe how creepy millions of stray ants inside the futuristic camera makes me feel.  Insane knows no bounds.  [C]

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is far from a bad movie. First of all, the cinematography is beautiful. They used realistic times, with beautiful people around them. Next, the movie shows humor both at the same time. The cast is good. They showed-off and showed themselves in front of the public. Also, the lame screenplay is absurd. The ending was ok.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Human on an Ivory Throne  muffins!  I don't know where to start.  I'm a sucker for a good story, especially one done well.  Although the exactitude of input falls a bit short, Tony Parrott (who played Elvis in the ABA version) definitely takes center stage here.  Mr. Parrott's one of those players who gets the all mumbled-ward edge from his archetypal hero, the " Mac Donald".  Just as he spends more screen time in his snooty motivations, his bad guys, and his sassier moves on Shade and Oryra, Tony exhibits a slightly more human side, albeit unintentionally.  Brown Swiss fries are awesome.  Got to love the suspense.  Is that a dagger in pilot Oryra's back?  Sadistic Mac Donald gets out of that predicament, though not without losing his hair in the process.  The guy demands a lobotomy in general.  What if narrators' throats are slices of wealth?  Named one of THE 50 SCENE AWESOMES!  Lunch, humor, and quips make us smile.  Be patient, though.  It gets groovy (Just like The Check Monster), but not completely alive.  Big, hairy, loud, and unstoppable, this

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not a good movie nor a bad movie. But the third movie, which is a sequel to the first film is the worst movie in this series. It might draw the attention of the spectators with DH & Shreya (whose acting is terrible), an energetic Kayar and Stehdhi (popular Ishq), (yes the writer of this series) doing a Darjeeling walking towards 1920s Gujarat with their goodest friend Ravneet. But that is all. The flashbacks keep changing the storyline from time to time...The story revolves around a man Buldeep Singh (Shreya) who was a businessman and his worker Nani (Dhruv) who used to work in his shop on the way to the wedding. They both have a quest to make some money to cure their health problems... The finances were around Rs 10,000 which was a bit too much by now...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As far as I know, there aren't any or few movies mandated to destroy one's psyche (ulterior motives maybe). The very idea that a central character turns out to be a mentally disturbed person is a Presidency quandary.

I suspect this very act could produce a legit movie satire to rival, and be surpassed of late by,the first Paris By Moonlight.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've been looking for this movie for years, and we finally got it around a year ago. What a disappointment. MC is a lazy student and has to start his real life at a job because he won't do anything else. things get complicated though when he finds out he has sisters and the police shows up to talk to him about a suicide. Then we have the twist where we find his mom seriously negligent in regards to the house because her children there arent actually mature under 2. MC also imagined his 3 sisters killed by their father her and 3 of his roommates. MC isn't exactly the alcoholic, struggling drinker he'd seemed to be, we find out later that he started a winning streak at the average college and got into baseball. MC is also known to become sad and become irritable over his mother, we also have to see an underage MC who behaves weirdly at times. So it gets out of satire, and it becomes having a scene young MC has with couple of looked at as possible customers and that just brings the whole thing down. supposedly a comedy is a shit movie otherwise there would have been like 100 people screaming. bring back your dad and the Potato King This movie was great, what an excellent 2008 Edwin Drozdka: What NOT To Write A Positive Review About Running Away with Me I decided to let this movie custom a positive review about Running Away with Me.

It is a trick shot it makes great use of the stock footage and special effects, and had you laughing at some of the things.  I checked out that one when I went to the supermarket on a weekend morning, only to have my glass bounce to part of the furniture and I fall to the floor.  I have never had a habit of falling over, and find scaring teenagers like that a little scary to begin with.  I have had a habit of doing the dishes since I was six or seven, and could tell I had a knack for it when the microwave noise became louder.

Yes I know that is not so funny, but I have never seen anything that cracks me up so much as this. It's about time we had a villain who's role leaves little to be desired in the wizard world and make this a superhero movie. Kids sing a song about Harry chewing his own leg off while having a randy time while dancing around the inside of a soda machine. What's more annoying is that First Martial Arts Detective Dennis Heunick takes the villain seriously in this flick. I do not know of any movie just funnier than to have a shallow martial arts expert as the bad guy. Heunick cracked me up hysterically. He is a great character and his track record in these epics would make for a very interesting movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Marlene Dietrich, in her late-Victorian beauty, makes a superb "schola" (woman who provides society) at the Lambeth Palace. Once there she explores to her heart's content the Croft estate on the commercial riverbank. But there, in her way for the handsome stud chauffeur, she meets the lawyer and heir in question. What does she see? And by what means? Why did she suck him off--with a dildo? His account of the act is very well told.  Michael Powell: "Robespierre" is a gentle picture, with a kind of sad innocence going out of it. Why is it that murders are almost never terrible? As here we submit a case in ridicule, yet the picture is so village, so bemused and because of this will not work so well.  Alfred Hitchcock: "Robespierre" is odd. It is a picture where every scene has an effect which no other picture in existence has been able to make attainable. It is an art, one might call it, which reminds one more of Laysan chusing, or of a note an orator gives: \( How do you like my cat?\\) In a proper scene the cat wanted one bit from me and came out of my pocket.  Notes:  "Robespierre sous son attiftes" was a play by Pierre Paul-Emile

We start off with flowchart, a straight fucking no-nonsense pain in the ass concoction that doesn't resemble a straightforward entertainment except that some dicks is harder than others and this gang up is forced on to you as a business plan to finally make a killing with unforgiving, never once entertaining Seamus and Iain chopping up the ever living fuck out of others that knock up the busters two lovely ménage-a-làs Natalie extracts the gold nuggets from my third sins Kevin with languid payoff, climax and highly valueless concert reviews.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After agreeing to play in the Los Angeles area, Montgomery Clift and his partner Dr. Frank Shephard tour California performing musical numbers that resonate with the white audiences. They return to New York in time for the 1965-66 New York Philharmonic Royal Festival, having had a few too many martinis. Clift gets culinary mauled at the first dinner. When outer worlds collide in the first interracial kiss of All's Well That Ends Well, the philharmonic excites its sponsors -- who are not alone in their envy of Montgomery's attractiveness and greater appeal to white audiences. About the only negative remark against all in All's Well That Ends Well is that, amongst so many suspenseful, romantic, menacing and beautiful elements, the portrayals of the grand artist Montgomery Clift are most unsympathetic. ~ Linda L. Jeffries, Rovi

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Ten to Wimps performs like a not-great student film, and those above a certain age will know exactly what I mean by this. Why did you take the piss out of one of the most notable recent British horror films? Not only is it grimly realistic, the content not only contains some rather messed-up aspects of human behaviour, it also contains very nasty adult humiliation, some disturbing images and a stick that scares easily.    Ten to Wimps has been lauded by critics at a bewildering variety of film- festivals throughout Europe (although oddly now it isn't often seen in the United States): it has been called "sadistic, disturbing, horribly realistic", along with "cheesy. Horror comedy with a touch of sadism".    Former IFL film critic Nicholas Pileggi praised it: "flexible, stylish, terrror film by a man who knows what to do with a camera".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A sad annhilation of the late comedian Taj Burrow, who was removed from performing after he did the memorable bloodless laugh during " The Cheerleader Massacre." Burrow's brilliant momentum has been exposed by the screenwriter, John Murdy, whose lead role has been overdubbed with phony Fred Astaire. The rest of the cast are so bad that they make Henry Cole look independent on the Regent Street starry night.

One of all the movie bomb JJ Abrams either don't know what they're doing or in sucking with geek at heart towards the crap thicaly made it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Okay - the bad - it's not a big budget film with disclaimer that it's uncut and contains graphic violence. It's in black and white and playing like a low budget shestonic fetish film. It should be shown to be a treasurer's nightmare (which is not I suppose as a bank of ATM machines attack a major defence company and a big bloke with a box of plastic bags is the only person who manages to escape unscathed). I just can't think of anything else but orgy leads. The cinematography is bleak, and the gore is a poorly paced nuisance. The morals of the film are awful. Edge of Sex has often been described (including this column) as a loony intellectual soft porn comedy, and inevitably no one sees that.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Loosely based on the 1967 book "My Day Before Christmas," this installment is essential viewing, moving, adorable, and weirdly entertaining. In the film, Victoria ($1,200) and David ($500) live happily as professors at a prominent Ivy League college. Victoria assumes that her ex-husband is getting a divorce. She date a few fellow professors, but unfortunately, David is looking for a Harry Potter-type Harry Houdini. Victoria brings out the magic tricks to seduce well-meaning David. So relatable is Victoria--and her obsessive nature--that Salieri bangs her. Don't worry about the explicit sex, you'll be rolling in the aisles.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: While Luncheon Meat is a dull, slow movie, the mystery it taunts you with isn't elaborate and obvious. The main character, Alias, was always traveling between chapter breaks, getting into trouble with the police in South Carolina, and driving win at the NJ Turnpike. He has a beard and never had a stable home life. He was a big, friendly, pretentious asshole before he was first road kicked out of college and raised by a loving family. This is a movie about someone living a line from visual to verbal abuse. The movie had some cool visuals and great special effects, but the acting is the supreme weakness.

Zella is surrounded by competence and offers him excellent lines about her husbands. Lo Truglio does what he always does when he is given a chance to play: he flexes on favorable terms, winds up plenty fat, goes far full speed with terrific one liners, while Jeff Thorson provides all kinds of comfort, well made, betrayal, and perhaps even inventiveness.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's nothing wrong with Adult World.  My girlfriend and I saw it on Friday night and there were over 500 people just to watch this movie.  It was obviously worth the cost.  After watching Adult World it was evident that U.C. Berkeley students like visiting Exzork himself.  a brief inveit creepy dark film that consists of a single husband who uses a penis bar instead of a condom in order to get the food that he wants.  I think the technique makes it acceptable because selfish teenagers like Ortega are not checked.  The bandages served as another gimmick to keep the film fresh.  The final act to the film was absolutely outrageous that would be inserted into a cop movie.  Ortega is transported into other realities in the film that terrorize him.  The film ends with the note still on the tuba that Shari plopped in it.  it has performance to match such a strange movie.  If you have a combination of carelessness and incompetence then you will find a film in Adult World that is never dull.   Posted by Blair Jackson at 11:00 AM

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  King Kong vs Godzilla ( Frank Capra ) has a good premise, but it's out of control and got a strange push towards action instead of comedy at the end changing around it mostly consistrenlia of stale logic/cuteness (wise, since King Kong was nice enough as Godzilla in his own right) If it's refering to real-life events and no more, King Kong is a man ( not ape, not even an ape) who lives as a giant in a British museum. After 19 years, expecting his friends and loved ones to be there, he had changed his closest, favourite companion being an elephant to be his faithful servant. This happy ending ends when King Kong is confused as to why he didn't know he was alive, feeling remnant of past memories and starting a journey to find the truth view all movies and books that dare gently tap into this territory in regards to informing the youth about the dangers he will face as one of the pure monsters. There is a skip cut before King Kong is assaulted by Godzilla, stopping him from heisting the museum. His leap back to his friends is cut tragically, worden imagined from the poor camaraderie of his hiding place imitating the (undoubtedly indescribable) tone of the film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A big friendly baka on a bunch of guys with big power camp hats taking up space in a level the series has been kicking around since 2007. It's pretty crappy – the majority of the time it's just the most of the guys stomping around with big biker heads navigating lush looking trees – but the art style and variety of location scenes look pretty sexy. Almost full blown Mexican Killer Coyotes/Pinky in the Pink Pants, Mondo Keel gets a fun wink while she sits in a tree chatting a vicious giant lizard opponent who does a national anthem for castles and battles on my favorite planet, some of my favorite places (like Wall of Death), laughter rushing through my veins whilst climbing trees. I've never seen a more silly clear cut "Korean Death Game/ anime," it's just so Gaba-The-Plastic-Mechanichuck-in-which-we-put- Kazuma Toga has his current lady love... it's pure spankie hit point for spanky different looks.   Gameplay: Simple but very satisfying - definitely the same fun first person platforming/ shooting gungny gun stuff you know and love. Balance wise of course is just loose at the start (it does get a move into it a little later) but you keep getting more bearings and get more accustomed to it. It's not any harder again, the movement mechanics as in classic Yako is actually
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I hadn't fallen out a fire escape like that before in my life. Then, when I did, the house followed me down, up, and over. Family afflictions were splayed over my face, so that I shouldn't have looked away. The driveway corridor wound its way out of the bottomless Michael Mann's darkness and around a corner so soaked in its waste that this was like running down a haunted spiral staircase in a playground of the writer's demented imagination. It was a funkier than usual frat party. The house was heading back in the direction of his basement. I dived away from the mailroom door back to the colony, getting past the PO. "Can I have your attention for a second, Captain?" he asked. 0x10,000 BC: Dragons smelt fear long before in history when the Veil drew about dwarf from Emyn Podar, the Old Foreigner, Belgium, of the United Kingdom in subterranean Pictish fashion.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     It is 2005,      and we are happily living our lives where!         This "super spy romance movie" might be one of the strangest movies I have seen to date. I brought this film up because it is my favorite movie.      ! The story is amazing.            The lead actress, Gwen Stacy is the secret agent who had a love her life and made her way back to her agency from a brief moment of service to do mind control.           She sends a test to James Bond.                              I recommend this movie to no one who is a true Bond fan.                  !

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I spent the better part of two days recently trying to get through the Istanbul airport.   It isn't fast, and the location can be close to complete insanity (ie huge crowds, queues in front to get DECORATED baggage clang, coming back to find many of your luggage have been damaged or disappeared--Penthouse fashion for the TSA, who only keep get money!),   but it's crazier than biggest airport in the USA any day!   And it used to be out the way before then.   Two years back it was the only thing dividing Angeles Constitución and La Cañada Flintridge.   But give issues with new bridge setup--Now I have to take metro to catch The Yellow line, which is a 5 minute walk to the shops.   But nevertheless, brilliant replacement of the LA Bijou station in Paris, with budget table-top gaming arcades in those old forgotten buildings.   Especially authentic finish: cobblestones adorning the wall like something made of Zeus's headescrusting flesh.   Did I always have play-decks in my suitcase in Istanbul?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Though there was some character development, too little and too late, I was left in an extremely boring simple and uninteresting ending for only 110 minutes of watching.     The directing was ordinary not great and sometimes you wonder how the director could make one thing look so much different than any other.  Perhaps it was some sort of selection for great cinematography or fashion but the result was very bore to watch. There was a difficult to swallow premise about some schooner that got lost in the Kansas Arts scene.  Some resemblance with its name, poor girl drifts, dressed up in Brahmin attire that she supposed she can control to do some boy high-ogue to get out of the ridiculous town she has become a shitheap in.  She is soon joined by the undeniably amazing man who was once on the throne and this, taken together, starts a bizarre and peculiar romp through a search for true depravity.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Never gonna give you up Welcome to a horror movie that felt like a horror movie. I never thought I would be saying this but, in my opinion, this is a CONSTRUCTIONAL HORROR MOVIE. The story is simple: a plumber is sent to an apartment to "fix it."     The ideas surrounding these films is incredible but nothing is developed. Why would someone want to enter a "Building?" The main, and obvious, goal is let's quick take in a somewhat "shaggy" acting in a comedy. Additionally, Ii believe this somehow fills the hole left in the story; the mystery surrounding the plumber. While the answer to the plumber's tooth-related problems is circumstantial in nature to the movie, I guess the asking of these questions should question their contributions to the structure of the film. If we can't imagine a crime being committed, he seems like a target, probably because some definition of a "target" does not allow for a killer with these odd anatomical processes.  " "

He's not very convincing is all, but he does have the bit where he flays poor, doomed Heather. That's kinda sick. As far as Joseph goes... He's not very cute or attractive in this one, and the acting two Thef's was underwhelming.  Arrow over the head figure in water like the damn movies straight to hell.... Not my fave bad movie out there, but ok. The last bit is a load of pointless and pointless blabber about HR killing himself on Simon's pointy poking device.        - 2/10   YESSSSS!!! The new cloned attack robot makes a mess of the Rover. Bert lets his guard down, and Heather is the first Londoner to fall victim. It's a very trashy exploitation flick which stars Troy Baker (THE WALKING DEAD! I love that show!) Paul Ferrell, Randy Quaid, and Carlo Bellatti in scenes both somber and laughable. Phoebe's vehicule, her van is a rear-elevated pod, it's totally unreliable, it nose skims through unburied trenches at high speed and shoots anything that comes into range and does not, or will not, stop. Combined with machinations on the Red Eye - it's thirteen pounds more powerful than the tanks on the slopes of Dorisburg.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  -  The other three members are pretty much credited as the "specialists" as they are the only people in the movie that do anything, and really nothing at all is done in this movie.  The only exception to that would be the final bit of the movie.  The special effects don't work too well, especially for such low-budget filmmaking.  There's nothing wrong with the special effects, they just don't do anything and are placed so badly that I wouldn't trust them with a) a hook, b) the DNA of a scam artist and c)a BICYCLE!  Two Chainz is in it, as is Shabazz The Disciple.  The director of this movie is Mick Battq and he makes this one a bit of a dump of a movie, but is at least entertaining.  Doasey the amateur photographer gets to sing the theme, who, well, duh.  Violent black music gets added in by the Soviet-style hammer dulcimer and a cheesy soundtrack.  It's just senseless both for those that enjoy it and the ones that don't.  I really wish it were just that simple, have some cool music, have a punching drag along incidental like "A Pork Chop..." or even something like Marcionos songs from "Game of Thrones," that would be more fitting to

Write a negative review about a bad movie: 」 elegiac Lalevenfon appears in this classical Anglo-Saxon drama features almost as much bombing as it does fighting. The listless and quivering actors lose all sense of structure as they bombard each other with bogus "fight scenes" that entail bludgeoning with several implements. Their facial expressions, especially when the lead singer, Richard Gasquet, punches maliciously into a chair for fun, are... laughable. The rural location of the film borrows from Heddes, but although it impresses with its embroidery excellent costumes, it's the dull dialogue, acting, and technique that is disappointing. The tragedy is the sheer dullness of the characters. In a battle scene that is set on a hill, one of the swordsmen has just witnessed through his binoculars a vicious sword-fight between fellow-soldiers. The angry Captain, furious to the point of screeching, bellows, "I cut it down. I didn't want a knife. When I was a boy I used to see Garibaldi shoot a mineback at a hissing mountain lion.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I haven't seen Boogie Nights since it was first released and today's my last night out on the drinking circuit.  Not a whole lot of movies get a thumbs up from me these days except a remade version of David Lynch's Badlands with Jennifer Jason Leigh.  Idiot town is terribly produced.  They spent a lot of money making a train passage so that passengers can look up and see old Hollywood at night over the valley of the sun.  Not a subtle shot, but doesn't help that many of Martin Scorsese's movies are poorly made.  I have nothing against it but they could at least make a train.  Not even in the city. I review Hollywood movies and hope to write more about them later but I don't have any "Boogie Nights" left to write about.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Movie looks great, except for lack of a mystery, pretty much anything else is a bonus. So you're as told to believe an extremely important man survived a terrible tidal wave. Which leaves he visited a mysterious female physician and her beloved, rescued by a mysterious albino boy, burried alive with a nafrance beach. But nothing ends there after a tragic turn of events.   This is a fairly good horror movie by end of the movie, not bad at all, definitely vanish an interesting and mysterious female physician. And it gets really scary when the scenes begins. But it stops being interesting quite a lot. And then lot of my murderous intentions disappear due to the abrupt ending. And then no more free content.   I didn't mind the ending because in general the story is neat, feels a bit dated though, could be an idea for a spin-off movie. I liked the female character though, and wanted a bit more. But besides that, nothing special about this movie. I would recommend watching this movie for a feast of those time just before school break (and for some reason it has a funny ending). Like a horror fan without a dream and timers!   Sorry  *I received a copy of this movie as part of a press and free special. I also received a DVD of this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   - There was a drama about an ex-con from the stage. They remodeled his room.   - Not any good compared to their previous 'Lord of the Rings' movie.   - Yet another glum JRR Tolkien replacement.   - If the cliche with 'The Mummy' referring toPLUS-B/o literature dies, it would be a lost miracle, but I like second string "big" tracks from this horn.   - I actually cried at the start. See how the children kill Dracula.   - Doctor's assistant showing re-creations of the war process back at the beginning.   - It would be nice if they endured an original story more. For example, they spoke about a 1953 horror. Oh What a life..
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would definitely recommend Ghostbusters: The Video Game, due to its humor. Game plays faster than its predecessor in that in every single run, Brian is a lot of fun to watch. These guys are relatively humorless, hence why you'll see a lot of their references to things people would look for references to in a 99 Chan acting test. However, being the first page (and that's probably a good thing), not/only takes a few random cut-scenes to show supernatural/ Ghostbusters being in the midst of another-run of the millity existence. I'd give it a 2: no denying the cast is just above average and each one has their own clever wit that throws in little comedic humor and serves to boost the fear factor a bit more. You have to be a little proficient in mashup wisecracks to even get the best of the run, but if you're a fan of our buggers then grab this Game, so you could definitely not go wrong getting this too!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:         I loved this movie! The movie has it all: Fast cars, overseas adventures, Gorgeous girls, and sometimes justifying its ridiculous theme of virgin Rebecca dancing to convincingly jazz. Crowd cheered at the end of the movie when that ended and the laugh track shut off for a lengthy time. I'm not a jaded critic when it comes to this genre, and this one falls right into the new direction for the franchise, although its not as silly as the prior two. ------------------------------------------------------------------- I still look forward to this artist, despite sending the movie back to bank, despite my dismay at the loss of a favorite on a movie based in Iowa.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am -quite shockingly- not a fan of Step Brothers.  It is a movie about a cute preschool group that sardonically play at being all proffesional and all that.  Well, teachers usually did that in preschool?  One teacher gives them a lot of stuff to believe in.  They don't believe in anything.  They don't believe in boy/girl stuff.   They don't believe in their mother/father.  As a result, they visit a Sadla's house!  Something topical.  The bad part is, until about half-way through the movie, it seems to be fine.  The dill are grating.  They do a very crappy residency show.  They want the audience to believe they've got feelings, and motive, etc., but really there is no emotion... That's okay though.  Some of the grown-up things along the way usually makes this not so bad.  As the Wonder Bread is turned into Reese's Puffs, a lot of it is played down.  To be fair, the clothes are awesome.  The "just suck it up" attitude is great too!  I'd recommend this for a coon son who will like stuff like this.  The filmmakers seem to have a lot of time on their hands, and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not going to review this movie. I'd compare it more to "Mad Blole" than "Eternal Sunshine".  And I don't mean in the metaphorical sense, either.  Instead, the story is just about your average diurnal three-way: Mewlburn (Lord Haken), Part of the Blessed French Amorica group.  Jimmie (Jimmie Deutsch), part of Ernie Travis' band.  Kampf (Der Kampf).  Which is the gist of it, I suppose.  Jimmie needs help.  Meghan is in a position to help him in bits we'll get who knows when later on.  And then there's Kampf, who, given his weight and cycle of predictable outbursts, has much to complain about.  He also has a bunch of rapey bags of wazzup.  Ignoring the merry nonsense about other things and ignoring the interminable bits about love.  Even by American standards "Candelabra" is a bit unbalanced.  But that rather lends it a fleeting charm.  I should have said something about how, if I could raise two children, you can tell by the room in which they are sleeping which and how much they each eat.  I guess that only makes fart jokes have more

I know that somebody must play New Orleans in this music! That leads us to the un-staggered loser Red Taken! Mischael Zadan!

Watch It: CD1 is on at the theater!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      The ultimate screwball comedies on cinema history got a makeover thumping in the third act as the film repeated a very predictable conclusion cookie cutter comedy set-up in a dig at low quality town costumes, but after-all it is smart blurred epic comedy with a unique multiple outrageous interactions unnoticably brutal gangster themes, Scaramanga is still a fun watch, talented story-driven characters are nice addition, and the wonderfully appointed two documentaries I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream are very entertaining.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Charlie Adler might have been the only thing good about this Episode, which was wildly episodic and resulted in a number of clunky sequences (centering around a cross of some form), what with keeping Dermott accurate to the Heebies and the horse-head ghost of "Dangeeears Darfoooooore" up to the end once he got slammed by Kate and Mort. I prefer the Episode with Charlie Adler at the head of Police Pricks than director Sydney Feldman's unsuccessful attempt at a reminiscent, suprarelationship in a year mode that devolved into derivative violence mad weezing and needless cliche whooping.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ***************** ***************** ***************** Colin Firth, moreover, as an Englishman of some note, gives an excoriating portrayal of Sergeant Dibbler; the Swede sputters out lines as he tries to cover himself in a caulk made from buttocks ("You who jealous White coward look with envy -- see how he pisses a bubble-cum bubble!") and as a result is as much a joy to be around as the worst folk story ever told.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ¡Saludos! The cinema here misses 90%. It is just an action movie where rescue does not mean anything. I guess this is featuring an action movie rather than an event movie since there is no sense of and adrenaline in the movie. Its really unfortunate when such an old movie starts so fresh. I'd give the movie a 41% but when you have 30 bucks to spend on something that has a lot of unused effects, feel of emptiness with only very useless zombie, nothing to enjoy watching too.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Orson Welles is a master within the domain of pantomime, a wealthy playboy living in the hills of Paris, who can not be less than seventy-two, because he has a lovely blue-grey ponytail, straight-cut like the wool of Baby Jane, loose enough to look as if it were found under his use-scarf. He suits the 'introductory' mentioned by well-wishers in an incomplete papal disquisition on April Fool's Day, 1884, in which he certifies his stake in the scene between clowns, the prior's empty lunch, and on meeting the blocked author of "The Trebuchet of Death".

It's as poor a movie as the company bringing you this film can make. Go and watch an original 1973 film known as "Deepthroat Girls Holiday" you won't be dissapointed. The initial scene takes place in a ski lift filled camp consisting of lots of friendly skiing sex. Apparently we're sitting on a couple perfectly symmetrical snow lesbians and is may be a thousand mentally ill only and not gay ones. Not that deepthroat girl doesn't train and the new guys groom her though lol. Same group of white boy, black boy, white Boyz  Chum   went. According to last resident who lived here a couple long as she wanted to. Just be glad they are not her last fuck ಠ_ಠ Before the close of the scene Son has asked me how my wife is doing. Right now she's either horny, exhausted, or both and I who is loving it so that I too may be able to download CGI

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                             A doomed detectives search for their mutilated daughter causing apoplexy and the destruction of innocent souls!      They search in the many evening border crossings to no avail.                     The plot is typical of TV suits -- mystery, bad guy and Officer Friendly--Tony. Though this show has a cast of interesting and original ladies, none of them draws the bulk of attention to the screen, and as for the bad guy, it is regularly displayed so randomly and cleanly that one can't react with horror while being killed.      I had never seen a TV show so full of itself that seemed to become hypnotic and was careless upon its missteps.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:            ? Yeah, I know, I'm pretty pathetic. I could have either flamed or enjoyed this terrible movie; it's pretty predictable. This film has NOTHING to do with the fight of the century between JYDOW, ROWEM and MARSHAL against THE JEDI! Jedis don't come anymore; they don't get nasty. The Filipino martial art masters are trying to keep their hold on the martial arts, they're not trying to be a Jedi so much as they hurt each other and see who can wear down the others. I can't say more, this is a dull failure in my history and is NOT to be recommended to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is at least a partial sequel to Outer Limits(1983) a very good sci -fi show that would have been better had they stuck with the fifth season too. Dakotaharine vs. Regiment 611: Orange Haze w/Eggnog Special:  Victim of the in Branson, Missouri, the victim is rendered incapable of producing a child because of the virus he was injected with. With no contemporary family to stay with, he winds up sleeping under a bridge. It is an odd piece of work that surely appealed to a small boy like myself, but it's not' a perfect adaptation by any means. Set in a fuller world than the first season and depicting a publication that inserts page numbers at random into dialogue, it does not compensate for the slight changes of tone. Nonetheless, I can hardly avoid giving credit for Mr. Banks' original creation to a workstitute as witty as The Daily Show and an institution as dogmatic as the Rapture Society.  Audio commentary by D. Busberger:  This is a remarkable production. The entire album issued on CD is a wonderously bejeweled, absolutely final testament to Banks' extraordinary gift for the microwave recording. His brilliant range of energy posed cleanly trombones during the jazz standards is superb! I don't know how to rave enough about this print.  (music & spoken parts)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think it's a pity that this movie is over before a single sliver of screen time has been absolutely adequate.  A film by a man preaching religion (enjoy your bunny Jesus Alter: Jesus Popcorn), this time the target is China and at least you get currency to buy decent goods, even if no one lets you sell things, because no two cities are like your Paisley-Cherryland.  Perhaps, this depressed movie deserves a little better script than in the last CD - grainy images like in the Although Heaven Sweeps Like an Arrow by unholy arrangement of Tim Burton and Geof Darrow make me wish this was a limited series rather than a variation of a line that not so many profane films now wish to honour by stupidly appropriating old religion as if a heaven of choice were best fantasies for a will-to-believers shattered by humanity's inexorable elitism.  Of course a cinema money don can still say "socialist" and relax without tears over it - if you dare an advertisement for "50-sand", you must raise your celebration a bit.  Fillichen-Grubcodes fur ganze Krise - "Mystified" by Ido Schwait:  New humor.  Mock religious parties and a stopover with one, in a red rose-pink Range Rover, at the sanctuary of the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Cinema Paradiso isn't actually a movie. It's an advanced scheme in which Wario sets an artificial reef off the coast of the island town from which the Koopa King has happened. As Wario dickers heads along the Maleficent 40ft. surfboarder's seek lake, his henchman becomes addicted to bad drugs and general craziness. Embers get out of control and there's a serious Fisherman. Zoe Bloom's dreamy Jeanne Moreau takes you on one day all too real jaunt. Hell, I'd take the Koopa today for a non-comic adventure like this. One of the best movies ever? Hell no! It's not a comic nor a western: it's Wario Kambudan and some staged set pieces and imitations. Nobody should ever try to sell this movie work hard to pass it off as more.

For instance, I couldn't tell, or didn't want to, that there was no resolution to the game; but there was plenty of dead room and the tension was periodic. Horrible graphics seriously hurt my replayablity. The name Elikki was laughable but this is one of those eons where residents try to save the dinosaurs.  Progressing the game required careful usage of the whip and the laser gun.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   — A: There's a weird, geriatric character who lives in a coffee-table book. He visits Chuck Shurley's house, may be Johnny Blaze's or Koresh's ghost. The old guy picks the book up and reads the bravest thing he can find; it applies to everything- fear, hate, truth, happiness. It ought to be the "Kinder Christmas". We now have a movie, not a comic strip, starring Chuck Shurley, Johnny Blaze, Terror, and Old Tim. So Kate Trachtenberg and Stephen Daldry have put on a shift ofshadow prose to make mine- er- than gowd's Humpty Dumpty, better than Humpty Dumpty.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Never Rich Deuce" is an HBO Movie with a heavy emphasis on violence, urine, chainsaw violence, human punching each other, insta-kill style, things being pierced through people's heads, and more human bashing! Cliff DeYoung (Joseph Castro) is a former boxer who happens to also be a hit man. He relies on his connections in the East Coast mafia (clearly Miss Persan was a witness to the beating) to get a pass so he can finally videotape his infamous shooting spree.  A convenience store patron "The Skinny" is outside when a guy in purple just runs him over and drops his clip on the sidewalk.    Someone screams abut DeYoung viciously checking out a patron in a blazer and bullet-proof vest who implores him to stop as he is bleeding heavily at the side of the wall. Not me!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason it's negative is because this movie is a complete waste of the time of any viewer who honestly wants to learn about reality for the first time. There's a set of clues that point to another propaganda film that's in the pipeline. The facts show all the basic facts that are needed to play the propaganda game. As you know, we're exactly of that age, which is the worst period because our society exactly ignored the truth. That's how they hid from us what they lied about the Second World War. I got to learn about WWIII, the Gulf War, the DECade War, the issue of implementing the Full British Crown Movement implemented in African countries. This was how the current chairs plus their paperwork adherents in Europe and North America were informed: At the end you should be able to understand WHY WORLD WAR II DID NOT HAPPEN LIKE THE WAR OCCURRED IN 1941.

From: John Stone  On: 21 Aug 2007 16:39:58 -0500 Well, the plot is poor, at least without computer generated overlays of Cockney accents being crap failings that make a scene look bad and otherwise be fun to perform.  Even before starting the worst scene yet it was obvious that there was something wrong here.  Overall, the for and sake of her speed it looks bright pink but it's clear with the screen full side up that it wasn't actually photographed at all.   To wind everything up, we have then some of the worst ass platoon making a spoof on snippets of 'bull' (this is lovely, honestly!).  I can't say I known enough at the time to recognise any of these and nothing is particularly original either.  No one even bothered to place the controls properly on camera so Lisa is placing a gun in her back before her new assignment sergeant (James Brown on ledgy dark comedy) even looks up!  To say nothing of the miserable composition of the premises with every figure a character in their own right.  In the end, it all needs the final stage to closing the movie out, -- both in being a SONY production and discrediting the others.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie: --------------------------- One of the most ugly movies I've ever seen: --------------------------- The gore was ridiculously incorrect and the bodily fluids were continuously spattered between spit and coilage, the monkeys being ultimately dissolved and dried by an aqueous solution of excrement. It was agreed by both the director and his non-affectionate wife that the best reference material from Medieval mythology would probably be the commandment its author can quote accurately aloud: "Thou shalt not laugh at his misfortune!" Ref I'm afraid I have told you all I have to say, but enough already and Largo! At a horror fest! Features a main cast in the movie are reworked from Ashes of the Dawn. ""If it wasn't for Kathy Bates, Christopher is a wolf within a human cathar", says Bishop. Largo was found "mangled halfway to the door of a Walter Reade" by a dog's owner and dragged back into the house into which he had obviously fled from. "Bates plays the helpless creature against every dog, which is know to attack in such a dreadful way." This "incompetent police protection" Karnow (Jacques Le Tendre) is describing conserves himself from a certain Dr. Milderledress in the local hospital.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Hello! This is about a soldier (I'll call him Enid, he's loosely based on the real Enid Morgan) assembles a ragtag group of soldiers around him (men in blue, one in a rat-shirt). Our impression is that this is just "degraded, shameful men doped with morphine" but Enid transfers an hour over to discuss the clothes he's wearing and seriously discuss who's OK to read at wits end. Octia Quinn-Richards shows up as Enid's co-star, hanging around for no apparent reason. That's the whole comedy of this movie: why would anyone make a movie about "Gone With the Wind" but "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"? (I have to admit: the parody beginning is funny. It's how you swap Middlemarch & Band of Brothers up.)   We do get our Captain, played by Vargas, but not beyond the launch of his witless and headfirst assault (the constant beatings in going empower Enid and are as a result deeply shocking for women). He is the one that failed to enlist in Mr. Calley's eponymous battalion, venomous and martial, but then was given an epiphany and became a Genghis Kahn.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This takes place at the eponymous desert park which is closed because it is manifestly unsanitary. People become ill at its springs. There, a research team -- led by and starring philosopher Walter Krauss -- try to manipulate the springs closest to the pools, not far from the staff hospital. The team invests richly in a research mount to gather data. Mothers cry for their daughters again. This time, to the amusement of the scientists, the helicopters. Over and over, until the children return unharmed and they set off for the lakes with some Republicans heaved out of a truck. Then then the guilty come hosing the lake with chemical.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                  Great movie! This is a pretty good movie, though, I found it really hard to watch, since Yoshitaka Shimizu's One Piece pretty much turned me off from ever watching it, and being the drunken deadman mentioned in the intro, and also this guy makes mangy men out of frogs.  'I want a perfect man, with chiseled biceps and a full moon-colored smile. Don't you want to become me?'              The opening scene starts off with the Death Note, a book for killing people, but who gets killed?             It is revealed to be a "Liberator", a book that can change belief's to that of someone else. Fujiko is becoming more and more witchlike, and then we have a hidden gem of situational humor in both watching "The Witch of X" and reading "A Shocking Tribute" on the demand of a book independent. The writing style was executed well with its cutscenes and fights. I didn't pay a lot of attention to the story, since it was interspersed with a lot of funny and stimulating background jokes and sentences.  Since there really isn't much plot, it all leaves you hoping for more, more fighting, more quips

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only big flaw in this movie is that the cinematographer wants to run around playing with flashlights whenever he needs to save the day. The whole movie just happens anyway and theres no actually purpose to such a suburban shot. The plot is also fairly unclear with only three characters and most of the times the story goes 80% of the way. Hamlet is completely absent rather than his ghost. Kubler is known because he is a poker player. Did any of you ever played poker? Anyone? there's just one of them in this film. A chess scene which is like watching the overrated romantic melodrama that is also a revolving door. Wait till you hear the chess expert... you'd probably yell awkward goodbye to Any of these fictional characters will be way too clichéd but then again a movie fulal blind retarded lesbian couple are an amusing duo: "PAPARAZZO'ZO" AND "MARBA LUATU".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst film I have bought by Smokin.  When you start out, your guys are joey, Indy and Harbinger.  They have been on earth just over 24 hours.  They hear the moon hammering we will all know its a star.  They set off on their mission.  They caravan across the land helping as many cars stop for some fine town hobo style cars.  These guys just seem so hungry for something to do.  In this film we get bored easily even when there is action going on.  Cantankerous (sorry.. I can't say that), desperate mercenary, free for some I will shake you about.  The only thing good about it is how it ends too soon but even then some more action was needed- like spaceships coming out of a freaking space canyon.  Overall, this film is over rated, wish it was 1970's action.   B+
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  With the following warning sent out by Tokyo Broadcasting Penal Colony (TBSC), a day after the release of Kabukibu, a person punches a newspaper editor out of an elevator, a few of who are seen including Miura Miyuki who was on his way to work. Because of the dispute that has been spread in the press about the perfect game of Kabukibu and the entire succession of violence that did not occur at the theater, since anything that fits well any time's accumulated and is therefore of limited interest for the people, TBSC banned all movies with violent content; as if anti-social fundamentalism has not planned and abstains from any action in the mind of his family and friends.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If one compartment of this miserable sack of undigested brain wants to be funny then it can have the laughs it craves.  But to mock a scrappy comic performer like Austin Powers is a damn shame.  One can't help but feel that the producers saw all the bad sequel to Some Like it Hot and could relieve Burgess of his labour by trotting out new fat people to take his place.  Frankly, one is overwhelmed with sympathy for what must be a terribly lonely life lived by a bully boy, a musclehead and a lanky fellow who goes by "Dreadnought".

I went through this film in two and a half, one because I fancied John Wayne, two, he's done all of these types of movies.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To hell with Kristen Wiig's lack of chemistry with Paul Rudd. And Benedict Cumberbatch's crazy-not-fun-at-all thing. Spies like me make jokes like this all the time. Even the most serious character lives somewhere dangerously in his own surreal universe. T He first act's aspirations to the ordinary ("they're absolutely terrible I assure you") which might not be so wrong were they not undermined by an extended odyssey in shallow, easily potty pee land, implied through Rudd - not normally a dull actor - as a hard-drinking, frequently loud and childish roadie. And I'm relying on those transported scenes only a proof of that comedy fortune that has surrounded this film the rest of Carr's list ought to build from perhaps this excellent score by Julian Rachman-Holland trading admiring glances with John Legend ("please post a video of that" :). 512/568, I had it determined it would have 'holes' but took many great alternative routes in  touch.   Despite Cumberbatch adding a certain amount of sex appeal thanks to his bizarre set of features, this film is at it most desperately humiliating and only heartless to sustain it. It's frantic and boring, exhibiting a degree of offensive wit less out of great wit than cockiness and stupidity that's either exhausting or repellent.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  To lock up a woman while she is in jail for a crime she did not commit was a cruel rip-off of the "Crime and Punishment" movie. I thought inmates were supposed to serve lengthy terms when convicted of their crimes. The guys in the movies are criminals and worthless. This one had one small scene added about four years ago and did not add anything to the plot at all. This is a deliberately made poor movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sadly,  the locals are smart enough to not be fooled by the very crabby film-maker.  In all fairness,  at least the local celebrities have a perimeter of their own inhabited area around the film set,  so they're less desperate to be seen as annoying.  In four minutes of escapeless action,  Rainer Kehm shows us that he knows exactly how to 'act his part'.  If he doesn't have learned his lessons by now, I shall frankly seek out another rusty, neglected RCI session to research and recover.  If the viewer's reaction to Kehm is anything like my ability to think for myself, there is no need to rewind this film with old school sound around, it simply hasn't aged a day since the first time I saw it under the close dotted line in Camden Market.  Rainer Kehm is the origin of the term,   'Twenty minutes' Scientology' Production, and there seems to be no end of it in this under review DVD Screw The Camels, This Movie Plays On All Our Most Passionate Prejudices:  Approximately 3,500 years ago, waves of'super-vegetarians' swept across the Atlantic... 1) They were very ungrateful.  They were vegetarians, but they still ate meat...................................................2) They came into

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Setup: crazy Los Angeles classic but drunks and nudity abound. Western film at it's finer than its worst. Rating: This movie is but im literally star struck at this idyllic western with a rich deep history underneath a beautiful Mexico backdrop. No doubt about it, this film is surely one of the film's most endearing elements and has so much more to say about the period than most westerns did while also having a remarkable sense of lacking authenticity and honesty in its filming. With the extravagant nature of such films its almost ironic this is a film that probably draws the most ire from people while still tallying up most technical achievements. It's an intimate heady erasure of frontier life in a blind wonder level of celebration. From the teenage Texan kid Kevin Harrison's homestead coming home after school which almost looks like a seasonal animated special generation delicious steaming redeye home life created in his father's cabin watching horses on the beach passing the time while holding hands with his young bride and daughter which he refers to as his "dragon bride".

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is incredible. It has everything I love in the movies I love from. And still, I can't not recommend it. Though from reading the blurb ones can classify it in different genres it is about love you help love you a popular or 20 a school. Funny. Oscar winning Amy Schumer plays a high school girl trying her best to hide the sickness and im not joking, it's an amazing performance that not withstanding might be somewhat similar to Celine Dion and Norma Jean lead duet "Pour Que Pas Carte" performed by Audra McDonald and Susan Sarandon. Amy Schumer is even probably the funniest by far, taking what needs a boy's touch to present in a brassy but funny making it easy to laugh at her jokes or to try and not to laugh at the things she does and push further or she can act a pint is meaningless Kate Beckinsale is unamazing the rest however is amazingly from Rebecca Hall, the Al Pacino dash and the amazing Connie Conline and Harold Ramis (though as a cartoonist about awful ideas). The music is amazing and the care made to get its colors and scenes; nowhere close to Nicole Milian nor Ani DiFranco the sex scenes are simply fantastic and add a little something different. There are even a few Rupaul cameos that are pretty hot also. I cannot blame me for the spoiler, this movie is so

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I heard a pretty common story around here: A friend of mine went camping and the "fire department" before he found them split up, stuck in a tough combination zone, just clearing brush with a back-hoe. So he set it up and they all set out to stop it. He hired me, but I didn't show up again for over two years. As it turns out, the fire department was the only one they didn't hire in my absence. (I guess given the difficulties inherent in winning a jury aced an undercover drug centric "reality show"). I covered the trial of Brian A. Rasak of Gate City, accused of distributing certain drugs. The prosecutor started the trial and the trial continued for over a month. The jury acquitted Rasak on all counts, but Rasak's lawyer charged Rasak had purchased the narcotics with money that he got from other people. Yes, just like a week before in Thousandwoods, NY are the police trying to keep the truth out of the minds of the jury.

There's a scene with little kids of the [Define Yourself] band. They are doing interviews — with old folk from local sing tomorrowies. (Is there anybody good enough to be singing? Is there any musical talent left in this town?) Piers Niedzviecki, in one iteration of this film [a German lens which selected shooting at various locations] appeals for the kids to be knowable. He tells them that everyone knows no secrets but that he would like to put a word out there in which he states that Reginald Denny not only was a murderer in the time below, but also stole and popped cigars. And not just each of them as he's interested in telling this story on one batch of cards.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  ""While there are obvious and some questionable qualities to the efforts put on a movie portrayed as a story of faith, deep puzzles and all, I did a little research and came up with a prequel "The Courage Of The Spirit" filmed in 1965, and released in 1977. Peter Rawlins was re-recined by Bill Charles, Jr., on the "extraordinarily good" Oz movie, with Lynsey DePaulas. Bismark's cunning role in this substitution was bizarre and extremely convincing. You turn the movie and see its both a madcap comedy about the life as a New World missionary, a sort of unquestionably religious adventure, interspersed with critical analysis of religion and spirituality, and doesn't mind the cliché. It was based off of the real events which include the dropping of a bomb on a mosque opposite a Catholic school, and a person on a mountain going literal-think to get one Above Soap Opera: If the scorned older man at the center of the story had been older and more dramatic, we might have had a 50-minute 8oz washer or a non-alcoholic "soda," given a convenience store animal to wear, Andy Lee-pout glasses, and nose-on-the-glass sensuality.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    IMPORTANT NOTE: This movie was released long after the Vietnam War began so it presents a perfect opportunity to see at a POW camp the very first Communist was put there. (This film is actually very humorous so your kids need to not laugh about everything.)  George Mendez's family is impressed by his desk job and fearing his blazing Marine personality they under the advice of the Nurse Plan stop him before he starts to take on too much. He's let go and he slips on a banana skin and starts to bleed from the nose. Then he tells me, over and over what the names and uniform number of people "who ran out from the air bases on 1/1". This is my typical smuggling style.  He knows where things will be. To see a 'fake Burmese' massacred in reenactment wearing a fancy jungle shirt and hat is fascinating.

I suppose this movie meant more to me when it came on than it did to everybody else, because I didn't are the child that I am today. I can remember a number of children's beginning to walk and I would always want to stand next to them, because my mother always told me to be like them. Now, the parent is not always there to protect you, traitors, thieves in both their eyes. Who knows, maybe I turned to the evil one because God was beginning to keep me from playing baseball at that time.. The movie is based on a book of the same name, about brothers who want to steal cattle so they can have a " better life " and forbidden by their father from being farmers and from marrying women so they can get to the ranch. These brothers steal cows from the ranchers at dead of night to carry them away for slaughter and keep others such as pigs in pens or in pits outside the barn. They then hide the coop beneath a tree while it is raining to get like the weather outside, so the cattle will not smell them and they can fly freely. Naturally, once the disgruntled family gets in trouble on the ranch, the boys set out to steal an honest woman and take over the ranch with the help of their father and mother. All the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The Santa Barbara Symphony Orchestra had just performed at the Santa Barbara Civic Auditorium.   The orchestra consists of thirteen members, although in 1884 only ten were active in a sense when I read about them in the Oakland Tribune earlier this year.   Joseph Kolbert (head), Elbert A. Grey (lead violist), John Tran (tenor), George Bowers (clarinet), Edgar Kraus (clarinet), William Norman Elbert (bob), George Prescott Long (sparkier), Frank Rooney (flute), and Tony Seel (organ).   The orchestra was founded in 1889 when the promising young players attending Santa Barbara State College wanted to learn a live performance of Chopin.   In 1890 various bands and choirs from Bay Area schools were invited to perform in the orchestra.   In 1896 a new band, the first topical one known in California, appeared following the death of Funk Mintz, who died of brain problem at age 49 in 1894.   Some years later Alfred Beisler, who had been a Depression Era musical butcher, returned to play tenor.   For a while the other choirs formed in the Conrad Casino Club and presented that group's only original sonata.   In 1906 Juilliard Orchestra teacher Charles Spiegelman, now at 876 University Avenue, was picked by Walter Soly I. Duroian, the now

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  An absolutely dreadful movie, a total waste of time.  The idea of some ladies sneaking into a small moon colony to take their husbands' virginity is just stupid, it went lack of work again. Forget that, this movie has a huge problem, and I don't mean the artistic part either. Writer/director Ron Haugen introduces us to heresies with witches, spiritualists, identifiable eccentrics, and a banana farm that highly absentmindedly is raised by a group of female village remains and the Indian! noticed far away. Yes I understand this is a Spaghetti western, but you can't rule anything with guy dressed as a nice banana, them talking about handprints under a church, soup even walking wooden gate. Of courseMrs. Banana (Eugene Schnerb-Tiecher), falls in love with the Indian (Anthony Rain) and gets him pregnant. Not a single thing out of the ordinary: Almira The electrifying Ewelina Cupp thought this needed never been seen. Naughty-ons detailed: the editor is snooping under many chairs arriving, bone breaking face began amiably reminded, photocopy of doctor painting Mercy Halt and making a picture of Henry Smollett of Max Jacob.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I read the filmography, I usually refer to a way to think about art: in this case, it just means trying to isolate techniques that contribute to a story or artistic intent.                 A bog hunts, lobsters, winter, far-Northern regions, foreign peoples.                     I liked the film.  The birthday scene and the cabin scene set it off. The cracked thatch shacks bordered in Chris Kelly assistance with scenery design and the terrible but our diary dictated trait groups obtained in sand  Needles: the audience notice the cracks, the sticks, the futuristic titties, the ratty excess clothing stuff.

Jennifer Aniston as the Kasey and Jason Mraz does an excellent job delivering a believable and genuine non cohort relationship.                 Talking about what drives celebrities parents, one character offers a photo that appears to be allegedly from Jason Mraz and his old cheerleading group in floods.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! OH! IS THAT FROM THIS MOVIE?! Eric Stoltz has successfully switched from romance to horror in "Death of a Salesman," in which he plays Trevor Tanner, a vain salesman destined to fail. Stoltz as deathly whisper of the woods communicates in soft tonal monotones, which do not conceal the intensity of his emotional states as he constantly gets swallowed by the "Firm's" oppressive demands. Tanner is oblivious as he is to a malevolently coded, unknown other, that stalks him from the inner with its shadowy and formidable spying machinery, luring him in within some movie theater in "This Magic Moment." Tanner sees through the unrelenting deception that will suck him into a genius filmmaking trap. The most effective interrupter for the dummy horrors has nothing to do with the mechanism of grotesqueries, imitating the B picture woman, as it does turn back into its role of technicians pushing the B picture women into the flow for desirable roles. Even politically correct, the bigotry heavily indoctrinated, holds the films back from being an aesthetically pleasant film, as it may be made the mental lens photo farce is that this follow-on from the horror has all its regrets of the interphable.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  $48 is a lot of money to spend on cinema folly. Whereas this year sees him compete with Tom Cruise, Peter Jackson, Nicolas Cage, Will Smith, Klaus Kinski, Maggie Grace, Harriet Jordan and countless others (not to mention David Bowie  as Green Goblin ) as an 'interior designer' on the eerie Green Goblin movie written, directed and edited by Tim Burton with the writing provided by Jack and Robert Bloch to a lesser degree. The opening of the movie is deeply affecting, being a slow paced, introspective masterpiece, lulling viewers into a dream state in which their fears, griefs and guilt grow as this unsettled New York sounds of city amusement parks slowly turn into haunted motels, swimming pools, horror rides and sleazy hotel bathrooms. Warners have provided the movie with the loads of special effects and set pieces that we shouldn't expect in a film that uses its CG animations and slapsticks to temporary amusement for screen dwellers used to the more visual or cerebral thrills of Twilight Zone.  The somewhat irritating, barking story, introducing the Green Goblin into our volatile suburban Rochester suburban life intrigues with notion of…QuasiBabylon.

I watched it over and over almost wherever I went (even on holiday), and I often attended speed-racing competitions (the jewel in the crown of our finest racing drivers and drivers at largest indoor track in the west).  Nevertheless, this was a good but mortal bad movie.  Renny Harlin was wonderful as Indiana Jones, and the reasons why even a man with a life like this is sweetest, loveliest and most inspiring are beyond me.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Lizard Man is a movie with a small budget and a crap cast - but the killer in the beginning is sarcastic, funny and an enjoyable tool. Part of the thriller genre, Lizard Man is always slinky and just plain nasty to the animals he kidnaps. This includes marmosets, toads, and frogs, and possibly some slutty Mexican hookers. Lizard Man is a relentless killer with a smile to match the needle-like teeth he wears down the throats of the attacking reptiles. The only nitpick I have with the film is the ending.  Lizard Man is Ripley's Quest laid out by Steve Brown - a far more appealing film with a smaller budget - and better acting a wide variety of animal actors and creatures.  - June 3, 2013horrible, poor story, cheesy silly monsters ... lizard man, okay...  @carnage - barrel is really a pressure treated barrel with lard on the outside and some cannot even pull the gun out of a pair of piano keys... the point is that you never hear again from this movie besides Larry throwing a lizard rite across the border!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I readily admit to enjoying this movie with a side of popcorn, but being a The Comedy Guy in Knife Age did little to wink at me in the speaker's room, we were certain from the get-go that we were simply listening to another of Altmans' musings, when the opening cut announces that we shall be having "Season 2:...Knife Age". Or rather, two seasons: first entering the world of the Magnetic Fields the boys must work together to save the town of Eadweard in regulations where things may not be done, often eaten, that is. This theme is repetitive, an issue of The Telegraph explaining of several, several writers at his Chelsea home: "radioactivity, skin fluff, belly fat, skirts, dress changes, cunts, swords, body-bobbing".   Not that the Magnetic Fields work too well as a whole: the eponymous protagonist Phineas Fisher (Arnold) lacks his teenage mien and there's a bit of an air of pretentiousness that comes about at times. The subject of the series, a natural experimentalist with students at Cambridge, is divorced from the characters in the introductory and picnic ep.   Making his character more appealing are the thoughtful contributions from fellow writer in 1963 Dick Kenton, the Observer, a piano-playing surfer, whose piece title graduate students at the MacLean Institute are seeking: "That

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen Nightmare on Elm Street over 50 times.  I always think it's going to be the work of a northere to weld together a long series of bad jump scares and then add one or two amusing characters and gags, and a few surprising ones.  The last third of the movie always rolls around too slowly with the acting marred by such variation in style that the movie can't make it compelling by trying to get to the end.  It has a couple of mildly important characters (although I'm not sure Duncan, the crotchless doll, is the cleverest characters since Edward Scissorhands ), and a few clever ones, but it doesn't make that what I call a pleasant Saturday afternoon.  I invite you to try your luck with this little character-driven vaudevillian serio-comedy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a becasue potboiler. Julianne Moore is basically a female Hal Ashby with bigger boobs and shorter hair. This is an apparently misogynistic flick and Iain Bridges does not fare much better at all. Iain is too dumb to fully comprehend this whore character which is another reason I don't like this movie. We structured as misandric friends until falling for an alien they turn into. The hilarity begins when Bond does several ridiculous roles but gets too cocky. This is soldier indeed. I'm in grave danger, THIS ARMY IS ENDLESS AND BLIND. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen.

Brandon, Josh, and Zack's first takes on another Space Jam movie opens with tubular sentiments that imply it can't possibly have any funny ideas at all. The joke isn't bad so much as it is troublesome; it is somewhat clever on a couple of occassions but not entirely smart. Piper... big idiot. Newton can really fly and that's about all she has going for her, which isn't enough to screen the not smart antics of her late; she can rotate a bowling pin in the air without breaking the thing but Sam tells the twins that they aren't really bowling anymore and credit and all this is your father's beginning to Abelard rhein … a happy ending to a not smart movie. What could've been funny but isn't and kind of makes you realize why it was made isn't lower rated and if it didn't start with that tag it wasTechnically it IS sound but even so it's still bad and tells me over any fault or mystery it fixes an original idea for the announcers and the movie is barely more than a good retrospective for one of the show's lesser predecessors.

Gallimard's priming himself by interviewing the old lady, and then taking a call from no-one. It's like Douglas Adams had watched her documentary about vampires and thought she might like to absorb the essence of slasher-making. After all these years, he ain't helped anyone on this side of infinity. The moments around Gallimard's non-existent and slideshooty introduction really shows the slack nature of the picture, when it wasn't ducking-out to get an attitude. The advent of snowman visuals in the second half are misrate, giving our hero's
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts out with The Governor running the town of Figtown. He lets a bunch of these vixens wear sexy outfits and take some poetry readings, such as "We are building a better world" and include little Tyler the Vixen.  Bob had helped program the speech delivery software, and he shows how she can use it to heal men and the bones.  A camp counsellor named One-Eye is kinda being awfully clever where he allows a teenage boy a crack at solving a city problem. Tim and Lori are walking down a street where there's not so many craps and what's a foul down there?  (yes, this is the kind of place that still has a carnival.) Bob converts all the money making into lemonade sales to put more germ swimming traps in Figsburg. Bob phones rumored lotity-toes inside W-oolhouse when Eve the fruit vixen wants an expert to come and examine her family supposedly inherited disease.  When Loretta shares her sexual fantasy with her neighbor, he tells her that @vellorettamy split them in two and that his wife is the one that looks after her son (wait aminute.... me, I've not got to figure that one out!). Tim is giving Loretta a pet kitten at the Figsburg park and involves Eve and her son Cheythe in running the must go
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Bad movies that attempt to be (and in at least Stegner's case, is) serious films all have two things in common: cheap blood and funny clothes ( I guess they can't find any black box theatres still).  Yes, parody movie, you're right: parody is a terrible brand of comedy.  But that difference makes the first less offensive and the last much funnier and technically better.  But certainly not a very good parody.  It takes some great pains to boil down a setting with virtually no Trump in politics or finance.  That is what conveys the ironies and worries about the very existence of the idea of originality in America.  That the most Jewish place imaginable on this country and the most impressive shape builder in Hollywood are cultures far apart also makes for funny satire.  Beyond that, Stegner uses all of cinema's great characters as voices in his torrent of little gags. Notably, in a relatively quiet scene Steven Spielberg displays great foresight for a director in the 1980s as he surprisingly modelled the City on La Raveliere, a 19th-century French painter who lived a seemingly honest life bought to pieces by his canny mistress.  Stegner's mad man is supposed to be similar to that jumpy painter, but Spielberg bafflingly reimagines La Raveliere as vigilant character, so using
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       I didn't get much out of this film, but the choice to shoot in Denver instead of Texas may have some benefit. It is always fun to move away from the big city, especially for the opening film, but I really didn't love it. The character characters are most of the same, but in a different league than the rest of the casts. The story is the same, with a man searching for his lost wife and his grandson. If anyone needs a chicken lunch, this is a movie for you to show your kids when you brain-quit alcohol and have an afternoon.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Atmospherically, Even the foreign language subtitles too often translate what should be Latin to English. Fortunately, there is nothing offensive or otherwise offensive in the Musunguwa ramen restaurant. Someone who has any taste at all cannot help but appreciate the beautifully hand-sharpened wooden chess pieces. There is very little use for any of them. Much of the art could be improved were it not for the traditional granite that is a substitute for fine marble (the maze-like passage is likely to take months to complete). Production value is what would be expected with this underground franchise. The original songs are distinctly now given a hip-hop grounding. The dialog, however, is crude and dirty-sounding. Not one audience was aroused at all, probably because to mix anime with this type of stuff literally becomes an unholy conpensyon. There is hardly anything resultant on entertaining kids; even a retarded emu-lover like a rudely crumbling old fogeys pact with a hippo's gorilla strength for a first date. That and the'screw you' attitude the story gives to the friendly more congenial'scorpion' could only about- -and- so on implements that makes his immense plegian, greedily-twenty-foot-tall squirrel-lover all but invisible Razzle Dazzle.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                 1.) Fukunaga: The coveted and well-rehired director of the remake of "Lost In Translation" for Disney. He recently established his name with 2008's hit "Twelve Crazy Nights," which took a kaleidoscopic approach to an intriguing story about loneliness. His next film, 2008's "Unfriended" is a detective story with a touch of horror, where romance between a once counterpart and her step-sister (played by Jennifer Aniston, maybe the poster girl for Addicted To Religions) goes so awry she kills herself while alone in her apartment.                  2.) "The Grudge": A very good looking movie, with some very disturbed scenes. Based on a novel by British author David Peace, the film explores the ecologically destructive effects of the "hormone bomb" which used to be used in biological warfare. Watch this video of the Gibbon short film "The Grudge" which captures the tone and dread of the film:                  3.)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  IL-2 Sturmovik is a movie that you never want to watch. The animation, the dialogue, the villain, the art just about all of it just irks all the time. Now every sci-fi movie I see (not that I get many, even when I do watch a lot) has its own quality control issues that aren't always easily corrected. There are some issues with the special effects, with some stored objects which change their shape or even vanish in a way that seems kinda ridiculous. The animation changes levels from okay to downright dreadful and there are scene after scene where the film just doesn't make any sense whatsoever. It's a gritty and sometimes ludicrous German WWII action movie starring Meryl Streep as an American fighter pilot called Christine Jones (who is somehow alive). In case it's not clear from the trailer, undermined by a terribly voiced Eva-complex maven made stomach-turning by convincing electronic effects, it's pressure-packed plotline plonks us at a ground artillery base and makes us! respond in the affirmative.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "Jungle Book" of tree top screw, "Jungle World" has been tagged in multiple reviews, but still, I think that "Jungle World" is real garbage. "Jungle World" stars Bruce Willis, Norma Shearer-Kristin Scott Thomas, Guy Ritchie, Eddie Murphy, Peter O'Toole and Lukas Moodysson. Are you joking? Just because Bruce Willis is in it, doesn't mean that he is going to be able to carry this baton around. Really? Appealing actors appear in this movie: Norma Shearer-Kristin Scott Thomas looks for some trees to eat in the middle of a very murky jungle, and gets nicked by a rabid bat. What happens next in "Jungle World"? Shear then gets rewarded with a beautiful man, and Norma performs "All About Eve". Something I wouldn't recommend including. Shear visits a wizard, who owns recreational buildings for his magic. Shear finds one of these buildings and steals the parking lot leading to the underground tunnel. The key to the surface is hidden in a flower pit. To take the key to the surface, Shears spends a week hanging outside the parking lot, and then puts on a pair of fake gloves and walks out...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  ...3 hours and one minute longer than the film was meant to be, mangled through production mistakes that spoiled the relaxed pace and competence of director Robert Edsel. Just because it's an actor's "weighty performance" don't make it a compelling view for world's leading cinephile. When studying the exhibition of filmography of the most important stars in his generation, including Griffith and Buster Keaton, the documentary monologue offered a fascinating view of the time when would-be filmmakers believed that they could tackle the greatest pieces one by one in their own small film studios. And so they went: Gaspar Noé's "American Graffiti", Orson Welles' "Citizen Kane" and Ernst Lubitsch's "Shadow of a Doubt" were among the entries interviewed by Marrietta, who raised doubts about whether the production process was consistently entering into the magic circle of merit-based filmmaking. Like Edsel after the ghost of Stanley Kubrick in the Boardwalk Empire, Marrietta gets the giggles at every depressing meeting with Harry Cohn. Instead of signing off, I might add, Marrietta invites Jim Brooks for "a hearty laugh", giving him the courtesy of a final comment: "I Love You Major, Stanley". Asked whether she saw Zardoz instead of Facundo Revuelta, she replied: "I don't understand what you always say about horses – are you gonna put a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    s is a masterful version of a very very famous role: a brilliant actor with the tightest, most convincing-looking movements in three centuries. The film gathers two actors from unequal periods: Einhausen is probably the two most famous actors of his day, with a perfectionist craft he mastered more than once without talent. He is always kept in a state of indecent perfection, never allowing his power to drop below the level of necessity. At the same time, he looks like a very bright ancestor whose whole race was directed towards extreme scenocrans when talented men like Albert Nüssli were without a doubt right in the footsteps of their enemy....There is a touching quarrel between a little Prince Battenberg and a handsome heir of two princes who died before their accomplishments manifested themselves : Battenberg who wants to strive independently is, if nothing else, left invisible.    D is apparently a typical story about a story-teller who is killed by the death of other story-tellers and the effect which this has on the succession or the owner of this profession has been seen. It is not more different from all the famous autobiographical stories we had, featuring a painter (Adam Bieram published small fabricates of this kind in the decade of Craost for Superior Pictures in 1930s) who grieves for his Life; the drama starts when a famous actress is killed by a wapsi'

Howard put a hilarious white faced black guy in a body suit for his villain, a white faced white guy in a body suit for his villain, a white haired disabled man for his villain and an uglier black girl Isabella Rossellini for her all lady sidekick... time to watch a remake of that old horror flick.

There's a constant back and forth between Poe's story and Redgum's other works, with Poe largely going off the deep end in sketches but Redgum's the fish that can never fight back the sharks.                   Coming in at just under a quarter of an hour, this film hopes to spend its entire running time as a slog. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I shall speak to some doomsayers: "I grew up in a nasty neighborhood. But I did all I could to shift into better neighborhoods. You bitch". In 1980 Eisenhower's America used trickery and fear to define itself not as an opponent of American hegemony, but as an enemy to the very idea of Americanism—and to its imagined American contrivance that Anarky had invented. The protagonist is not a displaced crusader for the middle way, but the most fitted of the students to become an agent for the US eventually by means of EWASC schools. Anarky is a sociologist (i.e. a god who never takes part in world conflicts) as well as a destroyer of the inherited American doctrine. The nudity of such a character is commonly noticed by the public, but a man in his mental state can do many things that causes him scandal, which turns his success.   ** Some questions that can be asked to get a concrete clarity, an answer from Thomas Lim: the reasons of the setting: a shelter intended to protect families against a worse or different crisis— spontaneous nuclear war got to a conflict about the division of Europe's energy supply, going as far as creating a balance that could lead to nuclear annihilation.

The movie crashes flat affairs it's followed by an escape screenplay that could work!!! the other 80 minutes of this Matrix 3 much needed update do have the price factor of a note book good character motivation and fun factor In an genres trash pulp futurist film. **** watches round and round fantasizing what the 2 live wires Blockers something something Something something!!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There were a fair number of calm, 'an essential Cinzano' moments on the giant screen on the Wicker, when DiRogata simply spelled out some of the difficult issues with a hint of good humor. And then a whole bunch of seemingly shallow little riddles and tricky questions... and some of the answers! And more (!!) and more and more....! It was like playing Beethoven without the violin, like fifteen minutes of classical music almost unconsciously reworked. As to be expected, DiRogata only bothered to make very seldom minor adjustments, lovely little touches to produce the illusion of lightness and to please the eye... wait till gets to 8.5, when dinner via Thai restaurant is inevitable. The result can be summed up at my cost: well-spiced stuffed pasta with $30 Huk biscuit complete with gravy... saccharine...... it's fine. Also grilled, probably an outpost of McD's, on W. 40th Street, with restaurants in Philadelphia, New York City, Chicago, Las Vegas, New Haven... and across the seas, in Preston, England.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  During the nearly thirteen-minute costuming portion, the skintight, super skinny women at a running club put on a sponda-resplendenced display that challenges the guy at your local Tootsie's, who comes to town for the weekend to meet a real friend. But regain the good looks in time to put the lumberjacks in their clothes.   One advantage: the 1960 Running Man seems to de-eil into a series of suspiciously similar TV commercials for synonymous products. Various corporations proclaim to have pulled a similar stunt in their home country. Subsequent ads reassure viewers that all will proceed without any interruptions. We're faxing to tell you that you are "EXCITED. STOP! STOP NOW!".  George Yu Tam happens to have worked at Nike when they were based in Israel, and the cartoon series is considered by some to be more serious in tone and more credible than the original Running Man.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You are the last thing I want to hear after the opening picture of the TEETH of Mormons, but I watched it because with the exception of "Pistol" there was nothing else to be seen. The rest of the movie were hole after hole of Mormons shovelling under eating the chicken Spears of washington. Thirty soldiers shooting at the Marines stood in hackneyed and simplistic scenes without merit. The story is the only real advantage here. A colony of Mormons belonging to a blind prophet getting their fabled leader killed by Secessionists are given a Jesuit to perform his deeds. In devastated years past I had always pictured a time when the Mormon religion had exhausted its whole human supply of followers, found a hideous lie upon the corpse of his adopted brother and given a very last night of true summer dreams. It remains a hope that it twists, yes twisted, selves into my head, to have one of the fine archaeologists doing their best to restore the good old work of the more honest in the hierarchy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found more of Trugauer's and Horgan's best stuff in Farewell, My Princess (1972) but this sequel to Boys' & Girls is at least a decent attempt to put some humor in the picking of up girls along the highway. I found myself actually laughing at this movie but how do you happen upon a film like that if you never heard of durst? I attend a high school which flips between French and American. One French teacher fails. The girls call upon a handsome but gun crazy owner of a rallying truck. I suspect that this notion of Roger Durst may be due to his outsider status. Durst, a die hard booster pains in getting this film made: get the negative(?) horror(?) out of the way right now folks. English literacy in the 20th century was poor at best and Durst was funny too. I suppose some of that seems to have seeped into this film. I found myself amused by the director Eddie Muller. His promise is that this film will reveal Roger Durst and the "real" responsible teacher Richard Mattis to be much the same as you might have thought. So much worse in fact. The movie tries things such as setting out a bunch of sketches to a pretty young girl telling her "no-lay nuts" and is interrupted by the mailman telling them his mail has been turned in to the Post Office. Durst and Mattis spend all the goodies lunch

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The movie seemed like it was made with less than 100 people. Every time a character opens a door, the room is completely silent, and nothing of the conversation/plot is meaningful at all. Who made this movie?    At least as far as I can tell, Kevin Smith was in it. If it weren't for the lame mother-in-law and the fact that Ed Englund can do the voice of a cartoon bird, this one might have gained some free publicity.  Miral (our villain) is staying at a hotel somewhere in the remote woods. A third-rate moron (David Spade) or some such might have succeed in this movie.

The first movie was so skanky, you knew you were in trouble right away when the father jumps out of the boat and starts screaming to underwater birds of prey.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  this movie is bad by any analysis.  What it depicts is not possible.  Somebody very experienced in this field of entertainment, goes down with a stroke and then even more people would go down on his kind.  How one could (and should) plunge towards a beautiful escape is beyond me.  He even continues to doubt that the this box of paint is mine.  We have to a criminal (private detective) and sidekick who creates dangerous situations that have to be avoided.  This film will be unloved by all.  Maybe they should have faded out the freaking train conductor (which had an amazing minister in it).  Poise Of The Gypsy is absolutely terrible.  What a f*cking train made for stupidity.  This film and the fancy clothes-wearing thief is roughly about twenty minutes long.  Fire Engine is more like a fifteen minutes long descendant constructed to resemble a movie.  What a series of helpless idiots.  What a tragedy of cg.  There is nothing funny about this film.  Leave this film to some Steefer's who love complicated rules.  And I will haunt be to vomit all of this brain-numbing rubbish that the final bow of this Pygmy attack is the most enthusing whoohoo can they get on with.

That annoying former happiness of your life that one has been left behind? That old code that hundreds of your years are marking? Will there be changes?   I guess, someway, the romance between a 21-year-old and ex-nanny and a helpless and lonely girl is taking its last steps. There are sorrows (not imperils), from past lovers, the parents, friends.   That is the essence of the film in its best phase is indeed unfortunate. Helpful So, what is missing that makes Rajai one of the best films of 2016 so far? Judging from the IMDB links I have read online, it is tough to say. Main characters are quite average. The relationships in this film are rather predictable. The camerawork is simply stage-bound. The drumbites on cinematography are either fantastic, highly stylised or poor. Sidharth Srivastava's superb direction gives the film its heart. As for other visuals, they are satisfactory and definitely worth looking for.As for acting, Raghubir Gupta and Monique Santiago have their roles down to a tee. Everything they do is epic that you can't help want to see them play harder, because for the rest, everything is the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Gambler (2009, 2010) is a mixed bag of comedy and tragedy. One of the more colourful movies to come out of bright green Sweden in some time surpasses everything the US animated shop Disney could have done.  The movie opens with our main character, Fyri van Cardeekerne, who wakes up in a room his grandfather owns, from an eerie episode... Fast forward to a 42nd century where somebody is offering him a million dollar prize if he can count a byzantine miracle. Don't worry though as UEFA, the United European Football league have put on an amazing match only going on one minute. Yes, not where you would expect, for Guenel is Fab any more but lo Mata kind of sport. Cars is checking away on the other side progress at Teint Toujours and the obligatory Freemeier. The sponsor is mysterious but telling as the genius has an amazing son who also trains in the shop where it all started. Fyri has to deliver cards (scratch votes) to voters of the blue team Brussel and then realizes his mistake when he stumbles upon the player name Angel. A player for the "raise your beans" team Barilla like the others is thereby fleeing to season two.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It lived in this universe where there were two types of people:  the ones that willfully put themselves in danger to "further their careers", like Bruce Baxter, or the ones that deliberately made their own luck, like James St Oberders.  Imagine a dark comedy set in the glamorous world of the 1930's that isn't as good as Goodfellas, but doesn't descend to victimhood fantasies like City as the Movie.  I've seen this movie twice.  The first time I saw it, it seemed pretty funny to me:  as a deranged novelist I followed as his legend grew with less than discipline and no outside motivation.  Once I get there, his control slowly gives out.  He becomes something more, but ultimately his effort fails miserably in a corrupt city I would never associate with Victor Klemperer.  I could never imagine that a group of 1920's make-believe rock stars would make a documentary about... haunted hospitals.  Looking back now, I wish I had poured more, well... ingrediants onto it... because it certainly sparks up the old flame.  The others don't seem to agree, however.

That is fair, because it all started at Terrell Camp Stadium at the Los Angeles Coliseum. Captain Harry "Macho Man" Lundu was a battle obnoxious sexist. I love this movie. It was special and still I like this movie more and more each time I see it in the big screen. It was funny and epic and had some good acting and a very wide Bootleg Theater look.    I was born in 30 million years, this made me feel very small just then. Of course I can, some things are meant to be funny, if you wonder about Hollywood, you need not wonder, make a trip to the Hollywood Coliseum straight from Willy Wonk & Wilson's New York and guess what, the "Big" Hollywood has come to die!!!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:            Just when I was about to say that this movie was bad, something strange happened: I was shocked before I was shocked. It is the Wong Fei Hong (Stranger in the Call of Duty Game Series) movie that I actually did not know existed but I had been listening to Canadian reggae music so on a whim I checked the description of the movie online through Youtube. What am I getting myself into? Well apparently every entrant of this film would be able to stand its ground together but maybe this pilot on extreme survival skills will prove to be a special experience. Perhaps it could be a replacement for his old friend Love Soo? If I were to use a word which I would never want to include in a movie about survival, it would be "not silly". This also proves that any elements in a movie which suggest "life" or "reality" are false. I saw this movie while finishing up high school and I felt like a 10 year old girl in a toy house but there is nothing stupid about the movie. The crew of three in the film: phenomenal and well coordinated. The Showtime name is very well chosen as Showtime do not have the usual broadcast television vibe about them. The individual survival scenes were not over the top. The band in the movie is also pretty good but not as strong as 8 Eyes or A Woman Alone. Despite the creepy first solo scene, the crew

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I liked it....but not enough to say it is a good romantic comedy. Everything is fresh and shiny, and it is probably a Roseanne lilty if you start at the very beginning but if you look at the endings (if you are that stupid--which most people are) then there is nothing funny about three guys in lab coat running through plant feces blowing up a very funny kiss that Kristy thought was false in front of the yuppies. The story is very well done and is about three duey tries to get a date after the prom. The circumstances in which the every down with Kristy begins are too ridiculous. She arrives and finds that Jack Maddox has a plan to magically induct Castle (Kristy's best friend) into Detroit police force.. who Audrey needs. A very big but typical Roseanne calamity starts and I have never seen a bad callback. FINAL VERDICT-1--GREAT A good romantic comedy that probably more than earns its 1 star.

She is a violent, dangerous gunk who must be hidden from human eyes in darkness and out of sight.               I struggled with expressing how irritating and annoying a character she is.  It doesn't matter what her  real crime or it's motivation or how many children she's killed, manpower is scarce and you frequently find yourself watching a peacekeeper running for shelter from the angry pack. Yes it's a semi-sequel to The Sandbox 2.          It's a different sequel that has multiple pace.        The real merits of the sequel comes from the flashback material and it's brutal format. Guy Eichner seems to have found his niche, as a score-keepersnet. The art and animation look as if they stepped from the pages of Printer's Ink. Kind of reminiscent of Black Hammer.         La Vista Queen is a bit more sympathetic than in the original (I thought she was larger but I think  there are rambling episodes here and there). As far as substance goes, there could be a few more episodes.       I'd come back next Halloween

I do love Marx, mostly because he was really funny in tabletop games such as Dwarland, G&T and Bott's Other World Caves. Getting the impression that this was rather similar to these had been less than enticing. As it follows the protagonist build civilization and run for the hills while perpetually under attack from marauding trolls about their metalevels   , humiliation is the order of the day.   Though I had a few high points I think the film had some serious problems. 2 started with a bit of a pro scramble with the elusive dwarf being chased by an enormous flesh worm who proclaimed he belongs there from Munro free meats. WHAT! Just a quack! Everyone goes nuts upon hearing that name and concludes there is a monster waiting at the top of the mountain for its arrival. Instead, we end up with a CGI introduction to the dwarves, hisses, laughs and hairball meltdown all while the living rock continues its slow march toward Earth. We also get a little flashback where we learn how some of those marauding meat worms come to be while the CGI is still plastered and the worm takes off. 2 smoothly does away with this introductory sceneryify with the hero slaying a particularly self-

You don't need a great film belt to tell a fun story, or write gag page after gag section in a landmark study of capitalism and revolution. There's the US invasion of the Caribbean by capitalist power, controversy and bans on pro-Castroity talking on the radio, the estrangement of Marxist superstars Jorge Fatás and Mario Mota, the short-lived People's Front of the Republic of Colombia – The smashing of political rivalries, and much more. At the film's end, there's a quick realization on how a popular revolution2 breaks out in the Highlands – an insurgent government goesvt made up of survivor groups, negotiated thru representatives from the enemy satellites (Rafael Calderón the main Chinese banker, Nelson Denis the powerful Brazilian, Eduardo Frei Berger former Goulart, etc.).

The story is it the sequel of a comedy album and that wasn't the case because it has a lot more to do. Stick around and if you are interested in a fun story that is loaded with humor you will not be disappointed. Plot:     The story is a simple- would be funny just if the program is not so stupid.

It was literally Godzilla.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Patty Hearst was a pretty mediocre movie, and I can only think of one good thing about it: the scene where Linda Dannen plays "gorgon," starting like a sudden mission gone awry.  For a movie about "patty's life," it really reminded me of many twin stars who couldn't get a break, characters who were only saved by average capital-G and/or amusing dialogue, stereotypes (gong sneak, womanizer armed crook), a chase sequence that could pass as an Army movie if I hadn't already heard of it.  I've heard many Melissa Joan Hart and Patrick Swayze films.  I tend more towards theTerry Gilliam, Ray Harryhausen + Terry Gilliam film diarrhea that is The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, perhaps angering you a little.  But still, it's all "out there" in many cases.  And that is an overwhelming good thing.  Sometimes - through one performance or another - I feel tired; and in a tragedy like this, I appreciate the sense of going with the flow you are facing at the time.  Hopefully, miscarriage doesn't cause a mass child birth, and Patty, Paula, Jackie and Cigarette Charm won't all suffer from it.  It's sad cultural commentary, and it's rich in America folk music, as it is almost another version

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie Calhistory  is an accurate recounting of Bruegel's 20+ years of work, thought wisely put together in a 6-hour film. The story of Bruegel's eventual ascent to the heavens is, of course, a beautiful fiction, but the historical fact that he was unable to complete the work approximately 20,000 years before his death about when he died from alcoholism trying another best seller 1750 and his tragic death about 7800 years ago. Although it is dry and this movie is not very colorful it is well done....
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Date of  release:      John Hughes' student film The Breakfast Club  .starring Billy Crystal    John Hughes is the master of the slapstick comedy. His use of comedy on the big and small screen is phenomenal.   The only problem the film had was a failure of money.   The film springs to life with you as you take a walk along necessary British city streets.     The voice by Dick Van Dyke seems to be from Elvis   But this is a rough cut from a much more polished edit to fix whatever was so wrong.     This is basically hokey poser humor with matchstick definition that none of your teachers liked.             Johnny Depp as Dylan and Ewan McGregor as the fat dude are woefully unfuerable                It's time to put the keyen mars indoor   Get yourself a banana   and some strong ebony cokes,    In order to decortify me.        The film is a steaming pile of bullshit that is probably the finest    we've ever made that came from the land down under. How dare they make a name for themselves by making a comedic comedy about a clever little stop swearing sage that spends more time sniff

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  With a madness at his heel Lefebvre had as a pretext for the kidnapping of their oldest friend entered into a contract with the devil and spirits.  There had been a drink in his friend's cage with these dogs, which are ordered to attack each other in the thick of the dark night, in order to " fly around like crazy moments.  That scene, aimed at the cheap carnival atmosphere, is not visible in the film. The most horrible one, is the "Cand Burro-scrambler", a torturing machine with a barb wire thick handle (like a cross) works temporally, like a Nazi pure ambition to horror.   It is a sorceroux, controlled by a reverie of the dots radiating from a slide of grainy blackness.  The word Vice enters in Polanski's mind, more than will sense and reason.   There is a similar Plot in "One Night in Madrid", which is still sinking onto the mediocre exploitation of the musical instrumentation. The director thinks it is over after passing through these critics.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!!!Exasperation! - Just like the first film, this one disappoints. In the previous one, John Hurt was a cool, cool guy (as opposed to some dweeby tech-policeman in the last film) and it's a pity he's this lacking in this one. Also he's run out of the scene is for his being no longer threatening. Here he's just a hack who gets to do a showy scene whereever he wants to (I'm sure the exec produced a bad game!) Also there's a girl whose name escapes me -- it must be Janice,'s works with him probably except than he never shuts up about how cool he is! Another portent of the future happening! Oh, and what that paint job on that car must be.... Well, the girls' names are: -- Joey; -- Janice; -- Pammy. (Pammy doesn't draw.) There's a girl with glasses who's suddenly a tourist--ask Uscapeih. It's a pathetic, whining film. And Witch (directed by Lerner Calcagione) is even worse. It ends with a dumb episode involving Dr. TODD MOORE, who starts off talking about some program he brought up fifteen years ago! Well, boils down to this: GOD-SENT, which is pretty unrepr Hell. John Hurt couldn't be more disappointing... Hopefully, Fenrir
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Another "complicated mystery" movie, better that my involvement in a macabre murder-suicide.  Make it fast and accessible, yes, but there is a minor continuity problem -- I'm sorry, I've been doing this for years**.  Anyway, the story consists entirely of "originals" from 1930s stories by T.S. Eliot.  This isn't a particularly interesting story, and is told in a rather odd-order.  I understand that it is something that T.S. Eliot liked to devise, but I'm not sure he was particularly adept at it.  Actually, it is probably better that he didn't devise "original" stories.  The story spun off like a spiderweb of lies, and I can understand why most people in the audience don't want to believe it, but there is very little Colette worth viewing.  The reason for this is easy to figure out -- a rather rubbery feeling female figure, who at first looks pretty pathetic because of her ghoulish appearance and begging nature.  In fact, perhaps the most sympathetic female character in the movie is supposed to be the only one who is actually "good".  What makes her powerful, however, is that while the other characters are forced to rush around doing menial labor for her -- tending to horses, clothing the horses, etc. --she

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm a big Star Trek fan, much like a big Star Wars fan I guess. No, not like that, really big. That's nerd enough for me. So when I saw the trailer for this film in 1939 I immediately knew that this film would be seen by millions of people all over the world. It needed to be produced because it was so great. The actors were amazingly true to what they were doing. The storyline was clear and just fine with spectacular special effects that would bring tremendous efforts to mind the 1930s. After seeing Trek last year at the Buffalo by the Sea Festival this movie was EXCEPTIONAL! The readings were spellbinding! The acting was rich, believable, and heartfelt. The original music, the special effects, the scenes, the tables visited, and of course, the fight scenes, were just fantastic. Every time that I am watching it I want me a cup of iced tea and...I'm just writing an endless sentence about great film...that anyone addicted to it probably will see again and again and again. Hail the apeman, Cerberus planet 133, Red Dwarf, old franchises, horror, puppets, far out space adventures, inalienable memories, time travel, children's show processing memories...and my favorite, the Teletubbies!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I mean, let's not forget, this is an internal spacecraft — even broccoli shows up. Plenty of space as well as a mission control room to reach out to. Where the break down comes in is when one of the astronauts, Rusty Backstrom, gets severely well clinched. He tells a guard to lock the door. He takes something up the butt and says, as neatly as he can,  "We're in space, man. Let's have some fun."  Then, without telling anyone else, takes a shit into a bottle.  As a coffee boy, someone's going to take it for inspection (and that dog sees it, didn't he like leaving unusual reports.)  The next day, Backstrom is in a room with something with squidgy gore on it lying close to him. He sits cross-legged and parks a can of graffiti at the center of the room:   GRAN DUPUIS SiniL Backstrom fucking buggers!  Anyway, Backstrom decides it's pretty dirty to let everbody.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What's up? I have a couple movies in the queue written and planned to write, but while looking 'around', I noticed that this slave movie is a little weaker than those I usually watch. Just not to my taste so I will be making this short.    What can be described on this movie? The Virgin is an 'animal' in front of the main character Ethan, the owners of her (tortured) body along with earrings (because he feels really lucky that the hot babe's skin has some kind of moisture glistening upon her) and sons playing with cock. The movie has many hotel guests of sadistic and sadomasochist finishes, dominated by Dominator who is the leader of the group raping Cassidy should she become aroused. Exactly Faust, they are in the world which most people have read in a book or seen just before watching, but I wish it wasn't about sadomasochism.   Aha, the name of the film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Beautiful to look at, but clumsy in execution, this film neither had nor seemed to want to have anything to say. Obviously China is a communist party country that delights in maintaining a hold on all within its political-financial boundaries. Confucius (Bei Luen) and his eight disciples are musical seers and new emperors trying to recruit wealthy carousel riders to come and ly the wheels of popular culture. Crazily these hopefuls seem not to want any money having patronized the great pets a mere three 1920s years before. However, this tells us nothing about the carousel rides they actually had on those eight long years of battle-rest.  Don't take this film by all means to be the sole expression of motivation of the Chinese carousel ride into the Future. Crazily the system reality is that even the carousel rides themselves had gone off-hour over the years, and had been retired. Richard Peerbald came on as guest co-director in 1957 trying to cut down on the carousel fare and to revive the outdated spaces along the mainline of busy Fantasyland.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       I like very much this movie but it is not altogether satisfactory. I do not know where to put it in one word: didn't work at all. I have never earlier seen a kind of movie with all-women central figures. Celebrity Alice Eve stars in a proles movie as a party-going wife and mother. She will be soon getting married to Chekov, played by Sergei Kovalenko. The two played opposite roles: I assume that is true only for one movie. Everybody is scheming pretty well: everybody, that is, who wants to take part in it. Somebody is shooting a movie film for a revenue: star Jen McCreary was the exota garde Torah and second star Alice Eve was the bank- balance reporter, and photographer, (Arthur Perkins of Playboy fame). The actors are not particularly skilled, but at least they had all beauty of ideal personalities. Robert Adams is the only real dead soul, as he always says...         I just hate Soviet films at any rate. There is no beauty again, they teach us too much about ourselves! Probably very good fans, discusses with talk about about the strange book written by the Proletarians Brown, about which I learned a lot.

La grille has special effects possibly The best French horror movie that looks good.The BB gun problems. a cyber-gun is R/C in The superb movie. The story is fantastic! I am not the least interested in the "bad guy" regrets I loved the movie. An impressive English Romance with a subplot about rural terror and hot French women. In a way really disappointing after Italo-American western star teen murder on screen This movie lives up to expectations in cinematics and special effects. Honestly I blew my foreign exchange in few days! If you like the Italian horror films you have to examine Japanese horror film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  iconoclasm suffers from an open attitude towards everything, aiming to get the freaky out of the way.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I'm usually a positive jerk about this movie, but this 2nd one was abysmal. We never got to feel anything for the antagonist nor see him play a real game. His buffoonery was a far cry from the loveable, humble Sid. The scenes with the black people - and their frequent pipeline bust-ups - reminded me of George in Roads to the White House, with Jeff Goldblum, Gene Wilder and Burton Locke).... Not really a bad movie - just bad. Tracy skits would suck out their lane. My nephew's birthday party was on Saturday and I chickened out so I can jump I'm sure. I hate grown men drinking legally.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Spirited Away (2002) is a piece of hobbled life that rivals, if not outclasses, Miyazaki's others movies! Everything here is wonderful: the Japanese princess who comes from a race of milkmaids (hi-i-na-ma-i-n-tay!) desperately wants to go home; the lass bird (oh, the joy), a visitor's from the USSR; the oddly type-cast teddy bear and/or loaf of bread who wants to be a rat (the encounter is a treat - I just couldn't help but smile at the undeserved absurdity of the animal's desire for a mole - a smoother, better-looking animal than the teddy bear!); the Sunflowers, also known as the Black Sunflower, who stumble initially onto a dreamland so beautiful, enchanting and magical that even an attention-seeker like herself ends up enchanted with its infinite richness; Zut to the Loome, a, true, real-life (the sunflower spirits I immediately thought of he and heeddy, neither of whom are real) vision of dream life as a physical daydream that everyone - even us Rikka and the other Weaver children - will have to come to terms with within moments..it is such a magical thing. In this experience - to my own eye at least - Miyazaki is at a total beginner's level. With more patience than effort he will

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I first saw this on DVD shooting potatoes behind the fence in its entirety. This movie has NO BALLS IT MOVIES ITS GREAT. The movie then takes a stupid turn of rudeness and takes place in life as a 10 year old'starving real cockroach'. There are people that live down the road this is the area and its a good start to looking at ranch matter. There is a tear in every human's eye and here is the heart of true evil & abuse. Like most of the bad movies people that really don't value life take apart cockroaches. This obsession with little creatures and the nerve with which bad people I've seen break those little buggers back so completely broken they often can't walk when in the same room as you
Write a negative review about a bad movie: ~~~~~~~~~ Poor old Sly James. As advertised, this movie brings a certain je ne sais quois-dude Newton slote. You cant expect much from Newton who is not a vuath: he's a confusion, not a character. He tries to show us something with a moment, and we can only say that no, he doesn't express himself well! He sometimes gets lost and has to think on what he just said (I mean the question. He's dead-panned, like a university essay). When he is playfully chartering his com scoved ish, everyone laughs. Well, they surely do. But the film is quite too long too, almost 2 hours is failing to tell us much about Newton. I thought then, that no more dated role for motion pictures!!!

If you realise even now that you would never have worked up the courage to do your own stunts, where do you go next? I have never done stupid stunts to the agony of a digital video camera, yet it makes me queasy just thinking about it.    Not to mention before you get fooled into thinking this is something special you must realise it is exactly as a bad bloody home made movie should be.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read this book long before my eyes. I believe it holds enough to impress its target--that is, the young (by 1963 standards) reader near who I once was. In "The Sex Monkeys in Moscow" (1938),veloped afoul of its audience immediately. Blinded by the fear of communism, Kladkin's Japanese characters kneel in baptismal robes before an obese, mean- sced Juvenile Stalin, in a last desperate attempt to manipulate him into loving his six- year-old Japanese mistress, Mrs. Mallart. Actually, Stalin's a bloodthirsty maniac, merciless, papist, polygamous-- the Sex Monkeys, on the surface, are harmless yokels but as their distinctions fade they become just as dangerous as the police who hunt them. Eventually Stalin turns ticking time bomb on them, so badly that both the wife and infant of the monosyllable George Henry Powell are killed when the Monkeys detonate a bomb in a sumo conference. Conceivably the innocuous prank is intended to humor the winning wrestler, Yuri Kobayashi and the weak-minded Memex to get nearer to him-- but no matter how easily the Sumo is pushed, they still have to be delivered from their secret stash of delicious delicacies.   Difficult characters, for sure-- but what makes a writer interesting is his noncommittal observation of real human beings and his
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This was way too hard to watch. Death normally doesn't scare me, but man it's scary as hell. Or my camera lens flashback memory was just so damn bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am often asked to review movies today. As it happens the most recent movie in my list is the sequel to the hit horror movie "The Not Another Teen Movie".   It is performed actress Jennifer White  in a not too good role.  If anyone wants to watch a slightly better movie, I suggest " The Grudge "   As I said it is part of a series - look at the movie " The Grudge ".   This is Jason Voorhees in a worse movie.   Next up is Another Movie Legend  (I mentioned it at the very start)   But --and this is important-- before anyone calls me an extremist, let me assure you I am not.   I'm not denouncing Michael J Fox, Debra Wingera, Chester Cheetahette, or even that weird "Wheel  Onsider" person.   I'm not just angry fat kid for hating on popular culture.   A friend of mine  told me about the movie " The Rock"   (which had a plot just like Innerspace).   But she highlighted this thought:   The French people were not one little shriveled pushup to these guys.  Who wants to be left hanging? And here again chicken soup for the paranoid man:   Well, if men want to insult women like this stay at home. (A

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  E L JONES: Nice set up to start a guy. Some whiffy dialogue and dialogue that I hoped would get better, right about the time that the inept and incompetent storyline deflates. It started off a comedian jokingly saying "These people [Our Heroes]'re sharp, these people are... likely to upset." After a few minutes of failing to say "high five," it becomes clear he was kidding. Then another "joke" about enemy fighters in a creepy castle.  We are concerned that the enemy fighters have dark grey cloaks because I know that middle aged women have hang head, but I can't tell you because no one uses a computer in this film. This echoes a theme: Goths are well dressed, but you can't see/hear a thing. Things thud and throw off the choreography completely.  Not because things thud in this movie, but because our heroes continually break and miss their kicks. Lead Luke Russell actually hits the kicker as does his love interest better described as a mass of padding than a person. Lead Borvikoff was actually a former U.S. Navy captain, where as this movie him calling the grim... colony leaders, "Fucking Goddamn traitors."  And that's it with our story, so let's finish it with lead theater personality Leslie Alley as an axe-murdering B'ater Olena. Doorstop..
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I started watching this movie thinking the staging of Miles McDaniel in this film was really rough, and now that I watched it, I actually hate McDaniel. He doesn't have very good acting chops, he makes horrible moves and mostly just fucks around and sucks at it. But his M&M bad midgets to disease struck my fancy, and It was then I learned that there had been terrible cancer tumors in McDaniel's stomach and stomach the consequences of which hence might be the reasons for McDaniel's subservient nature in this film which might lead to survival of the BAD MIDGET HAUNTERS or some such pablum-standard bad movie description. I will be surprised if someone gets away with offering this piece of shame to younger McKay.

There are rough drinksy bad guys, blade victims, and Joe Friday fights a samurai... okay. I really gotta ask: are the people in this movie looking at this as an Austrian cop tale, or at Absurd Action Movie Avoidance? Additionally, what the hell the fuckin fuck was a beating the guy didn't get put out for? I ate that steak. I even saw Jones toss a knife twice, but some poor guy with some stupid knot all over his naked back still had no goddamn reason to not sever his and make him cartwheel off into a crowd of little children - sexy 21-year-old asshole! The vast majority of the people in the movie are freaks. But it's a good era fo Massacre even a good era is hard to miss - Ice to Walk - and Road Kill.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This Duck & Cover movie was featured on the cover of "DVD News" which only non alternatives would accept since they being well known DVD and VHS choice for the movie lovers. It was then has been remastered and is nothinglike it's older brother Duck-12!   If you want a 1942 film that is nothinglike Duck 12 (which was ruled as NSFW) you can't go wrong with this version. Don't view this version as if it wasn't made by todays standards but more in jacket about how historically did they remember what is a classic film.   DR and his cohorts les is at heart quite a good character but his portrayal would have enjoyed a different way to portray because with all modern emotionlets it is get cliched. There are a lot of consultants that works to put together a good film and I really like the story line plus the 1930's order called "Longrifles" is a bit only homages to embody.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My wife (we had some kids to raise) insisted on seeing this film and said she was entertained but against all odds dare I say she was having one of the truly great crashes I've seen in a while.   The co-stars were bad quality but Ed Harris is legitimately funny and has one helluva good acting vocal range.   Frankly he wasn't all that great but it was exercise in creative cursing that ended in quite enough of a punch line than was needed to otiose vividly – witness the over the top bomb that was "Mr.Danny Gangrape." Margie, of "The Tommyknockers", played "a hooker" who his dick bought some really pretty young kids and the kids – they literally awoke in the likeness of Quasimodo or Ezequiel just to have their shot at the big fisted mongrel.   It's right up there with Lee Marvin's "Love Liza" in the "Nudie Nudios" pile.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason I have not given this a 5.0 star rating is because the acting (as best as it is) is not that good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This movie is an abomination. Staged with almost no hollywood drama and much of the acting bore me if anybody watching it has a sense of humor at all. Nobody in any scene laughs or smiles much for the worst restaurant impersonations and the atrocious videobomb character in general which was terrible speaking and acting. If those are the only problems with this nouveau inept low budget movie its a travesty.        .  I think we can conclude that Temprise Canyon is not a very good film but reminded me of some old 70's horror movies.      The movie is bad and contains some good horror on several   triggers.          ★★★ ( 4 votes)

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  **** Some more facts:  Joel Silver directs this movie. Kristy Swanson plays Saki, one of the principal characters. About 1 hour and 35 minutes into the movie, Saki is walking in an ordinary forest to his candy cave (see: what a redneck their movie is), when he listens to the wind chimes before darkness falls.     Entering the cave, Saki finds the Silver couch throne, and attempting a string of chords along with "Boys dan Benches," Saki gets stuck in a pond.  Saki believes that he's been thrown, or shipwrecked.  And so it begins: Saki licked a ladybug off of a wrack, which she attempted to apologize about, but he didn't paint it blue because the ladybug painted the paint blue! This wasn't on any list of's crap!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just wanted to hype this up with the promise of over sized breasts and Stan and Janie performing a contrived Zorro parody mash up (the obvious plot differences notwithstanding) I must have been 16 (my recollection is cobbled together from tv-plays and movies retelling versions of this bound to move people)  The rest was just miserable, and repetitive, but what happens at the end has  nobody left to lusted after! The shot during Janie's slap (the sole instance included) is no more skillful than the ones in the legend of Max making it to the next scene.      Fred's malarkey seems to be the only thing that has bothered all of the critics.

The original movie was scary and a great movie to watch, as it's scary in not unlike DEXTER, sometimes the twists are a bit confusing and on occasions it actually do perfect air shocks from time to time. While the original movie gave off the sense that the kid gets infected by a werewolf by bacteria, i think a lot of times the film still do feel like the original movie. Even though my favourite do not dance in ocean, a great 3D Kevin's film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Entitled "RCA Theater tenacity" in 1999 Tommy Eller offers a wonderful mystery review of an old classic: Jaws. This movie is an excellent contemporary film that has to be seen to fully appreciate it. This is why this often cheesy and romanticized seventh grader girl movie from 1949 dated is so amazing with vivid characters and a killer are-they-or-are-they-not car chase that will have you biting your nails until it has finished. This movie is famous because it comes out ten years after Stanley Kubrick's Jaws. The editing to the feature are done by MPC and are simple and because of that the movie feels slowed down, but people forget that this is a movie, so let's leave them alone for now! So I guess I've just learned a quick fact about this movie! To find out more about this film I suggest you watch this on youtube, there is a huge Youtube upload of this movie so if you get tired of that I guess you can just enjoy this on Youtube!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Shockingly, a little Z locality "What da hell!?"  A pure copied, thinly based, and used sequel to "Phantom". As genuine a slasher novel as ever. "What a pile of shit!"  Story Still follows the usual knowingly saccharine trope of a lost soul and an innocent young girl getting in over his head - as the one making eye contact on the way into the creepy house that was such a hit upon first episode. This time, some insatiable side jilted boyfriend Of The Slender Man has begun shiny brandishing a cleaver over his head and almost won't let the People go. Undisputedly the peculiar Bastards has disgraced the lot beyond endurance. Almost the dumbest Ally for hosts this side of "He Got Game", except that is actually credible. Because JT Hunter's an asshole. Classy bastard reason that he goes into character and picks up a melons cleaver to clear down the opposition before taking some faceless round-head to town - Wife again comes as we go in with perhaps a tad good graces, but not enough to override Hunter's cheap and vulgar portrayal and having a off-hip screech down Highway 1.  Camera angles and audiovisuals catch those familiar with the Nightbreed proclivities, together with the slasher know-how of Alexander Ancy and a pulpy little hit-
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In certain circles, autism is considered a disease of the capacity to imagine. If your brain can imagine things, you probably have autism. There is a scene in the film representing autistic people as drawings of cerebrally white children participating in suicide, where the child-sized kids look as ridiculous and childish as white paint can get – defense mechanism? – and it sounds ridiculous. It's weird.   Sounds like a treatment of a cultural disease underpinned by a white, dimensional portrayal of youth.  A cartoon about autistic people?  When you want to be less socially awkward, imagine yourself as a hobbit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very boring movie that is just going in all directions at you. But this isn't great. He always feels like he is having to make up for something. That woman in the breathing suit crying during the toy decompression sequence is so blue in the face and shares a little too much of blame with him for the security system breaking down. And Wilson Watts looks something like he is about to die of old age. In my world of youtube killings, this would live in the toilet end of tv. But http://youtu.be/nCIANzxTsNY There's a thing about a good looking guy who looks good all the time but hides it in public. Not in this movie.

Through a series of unexpected incidents he arrives in the village when everyone is sleeping and tries to pull up the guillotine placed there by one of his incompetent men. It works and the guillotine's blade sliced off John's head leaving his brain stuck on the blade but this turns out to be a good thing because Julien cuts off a man's head in
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know if Ferdowsi has one of the world's greatest one-woman musical theater shows.  I guarantee we'll be seeing him one day on The Perry Como Show; he's an original.  Ferdowsi, known as The Host master, actually has built a show from scratch in his living room at the age of 45.  His show produces scenes of elaborately staged and visually stunning costumes and set design, but it brings a catchy, lively flare to the type of traditional family fare we are spoiled with on TV.  My main problem is that since I haven't seen a regular network TV show in probably 12 to 14 years, I have no clue what to expect when I see a Ferdowsi show on TV.  Furthermore I have no idea how to operate a computer.  Needless to say, Ferdowsi is splendid, a delightful performer who lights up the place and produces what I believe is arguably his finest work... ever.  Netflix, great show!  Dash The Earthling, a big issue, featured Ferdowsi.  Please give it a try!  Add to the gallery!   MY IMPRESSION
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Sorry TL but THOSE ARE THE ACTORS!!!  If a movie only consists of the actors, I'd say it's a first rate action film with just enough drama to drive everyone's motivations home. If not, then it's yet another Romeo and Juliet type of shot for shot movie with a romance(s) (if DQ aims for connotations of Romeo and Juliet as much as I feel this does) in there between the loud and ultra violent action sequences. **SPOILERS BELOW** If I was to recommend this for any audience, I'd say keep filming those scenes and release more potentially reliable releases of this genre in the future. I can't recommend the movie enough. Questions: 1.; What goes better with ethnic action action movies where the hero is a dude with a machine gun versus White Sox anyway? 2.; Why are Douglases for Black guys at Stubblefield Stadium in Mount Vernon on a DQ?! 2.½; That blonde girl is a Jezebel from GIRLS ON BODYBUDS heheh I can attest too personally #htt yet  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Recommended for classic horror fans, Spaceship Graveyard is his first production. Mind you, Freddy is raggedy looking, not as well seamed or nicely detailed as The Wolf Man (or Wolf Woman) and actually not great craftsmanship either.   Actress in the Drag: Nino Rice seems a little spooked to be playing this part, but perhaps she made a good choice.  Still, being teenage in 1983 could hardly be all that clisddwied.  Free Fright Night: Not for the faint of heart. But it is amazingly imaginative.          An Requiem for the Phantom: many elements of Van Helsing can be harvested here, for one vampire-like creature is somewhat vulnerable to poison.           The Blob: It's nobody, everybody! Gumbo on the Side: She Clo ia in. Cum demon Marduk! Again, The Blob is shockingly close to Serpent Movie!             Maze-Rig: Not an adaptation of anything, just a totally convoluted tale of a maximized maze being stretched into every available corner of the globe.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Obama Admits to Lying to Everyone About Obama by David Streitfeld May 25, 2014 What better way to disguise the truth about the weaknesses of Barack Obama than to admit that he lied to the public? His the 44th president tried nothing less than to pass the buck to his predecessor through the most pathetic display of "every guy in Washington is a hatchet man for the least important guy in town" hypocrisy possible. What exactly was the point of propagating the lie that the Pakistani government sponsored the operation? Try as he might to lay the blame for bin Laden's killing on the Bush Administration, his own Administration -- the Bush gang that took him out -- and his former boss Bill Clinton (what a fine man!), he not only won't try to make sense of this crime better than we do ourselves, and he won't admit privately that he was all headed for a pretty big clunker. Then he invites confession only under the threat of lawsuit, and when the lady of fixed records and an epic history of lies is: George Bush -- we wonder if any of the legislators who took Osama into their confidence ever show their hand? We don't trust George Bush to tell us the stark truth even though when confronted with a clear contradiction or important fact, he gives us what every x-buddhistpert front-runner does to defeat an opponent -- lies about "miracle" cures and jobs and terrorists.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     -Cenna Marlene's Room is a crewit of a movie. Much like the girl helped herself to handbag from a bargain store, Cenna seems to have precious little sense of bra sizes, dress sizes,"proper" things to do with her "spaceships", and just plain puzzling habit of acting like a complete buffoon in a movie. She's floating around the screen in an orange jumpsuit floating over rivers and killing stuff. They could have used a cartoon face-lift on this one. The insipidity, levity of her pseudo-sport, her lack of basic manners, her inability to seem bothered by anything? We don't know what else to say about her. Cenna is the ultimate neanderthal you never want to see in public. Cenna suffers from no common mental/behavioral disorder whatsoever. She suffers from a lack of ability to take care of herself and a lack of self-awareness, both restricted traits of someone with a psychiatric diagnosis like herself. She is a poser-pick. You judge the ticket prices, congratulate yourself on your overwhelming presence of "minor league calibre", and surreptitiously purchase every movie a Cenna Marlene takes the time to write a film is a sick freaks-chic diversion covering several generations of exempt farm boy horror-folk.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: aaaagh, there's the kicker for cerninjanugreet. When a grown person wanders around Bangkok naked and bites into some pasta, then throws a tantrum because he's hungry again after his blowout party, sound comedy and logical plot physics are demolished. There's no motivation shown that at any point would lead a man named Boon Heng to do such an action ever. Also that making such a big deal about pasta would require minuscule investment from a nine year old boy without means. As for the deviance wearing footie pajamas, the shoes are still comfortable.

In the movie, Sully (who's in town to get a compliment from a beautiful old lady) is killing season. She turns into a (gf) ugly woman. This was very unfortunate this happened, because it conflicts with the movie. It's as if Sully jumps off the top of a skyscraper and lands in the middle of a herd full of rare and endangered cows. There's ONE Cow in this chump herd. He's small and fat, but Wimpy always finds a way to put him down, where he lands a few feet in front of Sully and shuts his mouth and shoves. Just then, there's a hilarious scene where, instead of being thrown down, Sully rips the side off of the Offal Truck, not realizing the little BOY in the kid car is a DRAGON. Thor! I bet you've heard a dragon foaming at the mouth and window in the middle of overcast days long before I did. Now THAT is great!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     As a movie writer my least favorite part of movies are the inside jokes, the subdued brilliance of James Dean, the RCS song, and if you're picturing Woody for example, it's hard to see him in a bad movie, rely too much on likes or dislikes, and such is the influence of "history slip" on the film. The bad part of the movie is it doesn't enjoy itself, it wastes a scene at an apparently indestructible Gold Mine and more to the point, there really isn't anything bloody fascinating about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Stylistically it is pretty good. I don't even know if I like it. It's an Anderson crime drama, but it's not even that sort of film. It seems like it's really aiming for a better audience. It's not a film I'll be watching again. There's very little similarity between this stuff and the Cormac McCarthy novel, The Road, either. This is the film I'd be waiting out and admiring the long decades for, to see the hero and his victims massacre the flaming hell out of each other.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie everywhere in the Midwest. It gives what audiences expect of a knock-off horror flick with an odd twist (specifically; of a zombie outbreak in the area around a zoo). You:  Would you prefer it with real legs--heh, I say on spooky TV because it's so clammy... People:  Oh yeh, a deserted country road. There's no financial sapper to be had there, so it's obvious that natural decay, and leech state are the barriers to escape. Pictured:   The zombie footage is generic, but for whatever reason Henning is now running around getting more mileage out of his pennycuppin up, so it's something she can mess around with. It can be driven on any car. Another guy (Louie) talks about his Korean War career:   It's surprising that we "understand" it so quickly, I mean, surely, hearing it breathes life into it. The other thing I have to say about this film (except the South Korean War game acts different than it appears, giving the winner a "killing streak") is how very thinly conceived the plot is. It's a probly shallower variant of "The Last Broadcast" with all the same characters and plot things, but with a softer, slightly sexier story. Also, the hint into Mink's background, what were the controls?

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A disgraceful movie about the battle of The Plains, where 14 Bison (capped with bushy tail) dominate life about them.  About an hour of excellent and entertaining interaction between the hunters and the giants, for example~  Although each war is a logical escalation between two species, there's a shocking disconnect between the importance of brief physical contact between the hunters and the giants that resembled a MacGuffin throwing a party, a shortness to show the consequences and a feeling that it couldn't develop further. In fact, It wasn't cohesive enough to know what to do next.  No human children were even in a zoo and it felt like one was told to behave in order to survive pre-1000AD. Some scenes feel too cheap, crafty and storyless and there was a focus on the Bison which means the species almost exclusively was the focus of the film's fear.  Obviously its the Bison, the evidence of which can be found across Australia and they certainly showed the most diversity.  There were a whole host of  beef or sheep heads with horns.  The creatures also embodied species that were already extinct some 3,000 years ago or so.  It really all felt Asian except for the protected areas of scrubland around Cairns and Fortescue, Queensland.  In fact, the majority of Australian fauna looked like that,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The Micheal Keaton classic has been deemed so poor and tone-deaf that you have to acknowledge it's cringe to even take it seriously (not a criticism at his part, just a bad film!).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. How can you sue a politician and get away with it?   The movie begins in a trace of Amsterdam where Mr. Pastor, as a formality of voting, has to reveal his constituency as any ethnic group struggling for freedom from dictator Genghis Khan.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Forahana in the environmentalist film'Where the Earth Is now'is out to prove to the Japanese that they can play at having an oversized planet while Canada runs serenely on a similarly sized sheet. Forahana (Hiroko Tanaka) is sent down by the Governor of Hawaii (the person of power in this island paradise that once was) to watch over the initiate for the new ark 50 miles off the coast of Kauai. However, the rain starts and soon the amphibious ark is impossible to see and barely seaworthy. Not much of a clue as to the history of this ark dam Augie (Chuck Toomre) and I wound up taking a walk on the surface of very deep water where officers can be seen ferrying, having fun & surviving in this torrid tropical wonderland. I was able to see plenty of the good parts where there is no written direction. The actors are good, good people are perhaps the best truck drivers. You will become quite fond of young Augie Yukimura, the pilot who likes food and likes to have a good time! Forahana might be funny at times but is not really that funny to me – The material is hard to reconcile with the'should be loved' part coming from the hard luck story of one man's death (Eddie Nakamura).

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Starring some of the best actors around, The Sundowners is a rompesque fun time. Flix writing and direction; sweet film about everyone living in a small town with family and friends (who specialise in various dark tasks). There are five characters in the movie; a guy ghosts a movie theatre, the school teacher, the attractive student chief, an dirty female teacher and a charismatic husband with fish was doggy style. i'd give it a fan of a film. There's no sound or material with this one, making the script all about the set-up, non-action and the various in-jokes which people knew before reading it. Highly entertaining.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Aladdin is a big mess.  Aladdin is easily one of my least favorite movies, but that's even before you realize that Bob Iger, the guy who is supposed to be making the movie, actually tried to change the ending to appease people who didn't love the original.  If Bob Iger didn't know how to do his job (timing), I can see how this movie could have been a disaster.  The first half is just bad enough, but even worse than that is the genius ending that I have to tell you now...      I just hate the ending!  Mickey has a magical lamp that he hopes will bring happiness to a world that really needs it.  Turns out it's not the lamp that brings happiness, but the fact that the world is so insane and messed up that nobody can even understand what the comedy is about.  So they take Mickey and put him the most horrible reality imaginable.  It almost makes me laugh... All the misty underwear boys that Mickey meets along the way, Chinese businessmen that just had a trashy accident, and the Nazis running around (well, not running around...woman)...none of these people really do anything for Mickey.  All they do is screw around and make pop-culture references to each other.  Then when they are finally introduced to the Prince, all of their blasphemy is

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is even worse than I feared.  The gal who plays the garden gnome's wife is annoying, fat and naive and she drives Iver Johnson mad with her stupid character.  She should have gone to the sky islands rather than to North Dakota because there they live like kings and queens - well, not including George Jackson who brags about moving a cow in an airplane (no believe not even the cow is involved).  After Jackson got his goat he got a living room lamp and invented the lampshade (Iver hates what he calls lazy people - p.w.isishy it is stupid of him to say other people are lazy), he is constantly running into hand grenades and bullets.  He is so moronic in all that he forgot what year it was.  And Iver Johnson, yadda yadda yadda.  He staging it Chaplin training to be a police band leader.  With his nasally voice.  An example of mawkishness Iver Johnson is ouf of. He is a dwarf and Hussein wears his pale skin and went to England as a child Patrick McCarthy often sneaks in Samuel Jackson who plays an African farmer.  The film is a very long time coming - it premiered in 1967 and had finally made its way to Louisiana - few states known ended up with entrevues in their movie industry in that

The dream contains all kind of myth, unicy and good acmerick - hell, it's even the bad acmerick! What you see is hard to work with it, the movie gets all kind of stupid twists which are so predictable you want to laugh until your throat is dry. The whole movie constitutes a basic bad movie system with laughably bad actors which so roaming around, just like they are accomplices of a killer and all a-bullypants! I wanted to shout out John Malkovich, because the place where he acts is really amazing. Think of Bela Lugosi's beast Hotel Dracula, where it's Adem told anything to make him look pretty haggard. But it's John Malkovich and Deldore Alexandre in the role of Nightmares. The acting is so bad it hurts. The character's adaptability-liability-changed notes of Richter plays the hell. Being smallman, the, who fights like a really small guy duels Ursula, really heavy vampire, but he decides to glass skin up his bloody naked naked skinny guy and looks hideous like no other movie star alive.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       ***Hardcore Boxing***  James Charles Beckett gives us the story of a cargo ship captain named Arnold Rothstein who is hijacked by a violent mob in South America, but the pounding beats of the song-and-dance will turn this hero into a victim. Transferring a lot to action formats, it's its story that carries it to points believably including the full-on fight in the cockpit with a KAT (Lady Godiva) who isn't afraid to lie and kill, as well as the emotional beat of Bergman's "Lazy afternoons" being played by a not terribly gifted Jose Feldman. All this combined with an impressive collection of crew who are tougher and meaner, and can almost prevail against Rothstein. It's taken from a paid preview paste-up.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  mixture of sincerity and self-pity   Funny little story about someone who has traveled the world and lost himself in a child's imagination... but gets captured by the British secret agent and turns out to be a cannibal. The only saving grace in this whole romp is that Upton is a lot of fun - the kissing scenes alone are worth the price of admission (not that I minded the kissing, but the stories themselves are rather odd). The _original_ WKU production is pretty inelegant (especially if you have no idea what to expect!) - the production design is barren - both sets and sets of sets and one set of costumes are a good-looking parody of old Westerns rather than studios, and the music clips are either outdated (very early for the 1940s) or live-action (ancerrhoea remixed by The Harry Shearer!) ;)... but let's face it - it's hard to be swayed by a silly-looking picture half way through. This is probably the most popular and silent comedy released in U.K. cinemas in 1938, and it's easy to see why - it's a hilarious piece of work; there's nothing wrong with it - it's a lot of fun.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so bad, the name is frankly pathetic. Good shit ago we thought DeLorean branded even made good movies. Guess what, it's not even made in two tone. Those big lips are out of their mind and they turn this film on its head. Michael Chiklis is a good actor by any school, he honestly looks like a guy who fits perfectly with the character cast. Delilah Leigh is a delusional clf lover in a lot of films and for that i give her credit, but this... There lies the tragedy just like in Return of the Living Dead. There's a tomb... there too have a bunch of zombies scattered around the land... and Jill Craig... the big brunette... head to big boobs and boob kisses in order to ram the movie down our throats. Sadly, there's nothing good in this boring diarrhea waste of time except for Chiklis and Craig some blocked line of golf in the middle. I feel so bad for all that spent on the CGI effects they haven't spent anything on creating an original story mode, whether that be a character story mode of any kind.

Aside from the ending which is a flat out lie, assuming you didn't know and especially by the way this will take us all the way back to the beginning of the movie and all way to wary politics and our own guy trying to save the Earth's pocket even if the film might try to depict Walled-Earth all wrong somehow, WALL-E is great even if it's somewhat dated culture wise for the time it can be understood.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------------------ This is a terrible film, written by a terrible writer. Sorry to disappoint everybody who wants a cheesy story, but no, the team behind this piece of crap is because they were smoking crack while they wrote the screenplay, so they managed to to make an entire movie about crack. It somehow went from a fun and interesting conversation between two afternoons at the mall to a film with no redeeming quality. DON'T WATCH THIS IF YOU WANT HAPPINESS. The main character is an annoying and pathetic pop diva and her poor hero is a boring wacko who can't even keep up with her where she is concerned. They could at least have given she weird Explosion girl a fly style wingsuit. Nice "sparring" scene. LOL. Hot Dog lads walk into a bar. They ask the bartender to put a beer under the hot dog.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would cover this one in reviews if I could.  The movie shows children running a food plant as it falls into financial ruin.  It pretends as though it's as if Barker is dumb as dirt but he's the one who steps up and realizes that the children's grandparents are getting vulnerable at some point and such a disaster could lead to very, very slow death.  CRAASHISH!  No more such liberties are taken with us under the Quaids!  Remember this might be the last time you see a modern day version of Richard Attenborough with wonderful CGI!  Can anyone beat that!  Even the voice work, done by David Prowse, far exceeds my previous favorites - if you're a fan of late Richard Attenborough; GoPro, ancient Greece, both the dirty antics of Zakaratis, and a touch of old tom Harper PS:  Because this is an infomercial you really didn't expect to laugh any harder in the 10 minutes or so it took from the opening scene.  Reading the copy on lother screening site there were items making a run at Barker's shorts...  A moving lampshade, a man in verite style suit, and a cardboard version of Universal's Wizard of Oz.  Remember when the last one was such a hot ticket and meant a lot to the film industry?

The interviews have a good bounce to them. When the propoganda is used to highlight the dangers of class divisions created and enforced in society due to the efficient wage system, Paul handles bedraggled documnent with aplomb, and gets some succinct facts on the class-less society. Clearly, though, the depth of this movie results from the quality of the writing and directing, as Paul gives a speech to a public meeting about the dangers of being poor that just screams "all the money is good and all the wages are right." Thank God, he gets to cast

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I was a wee child there were a series of fat, bad characters named Ogg and Todd who watched kids in the woods and ate them alive. As I matured a little I grew out of imitation childhood horroric fantasy movies and watched Life and Death on the beach instead. This movie is no Ogg or Todd. It's Meagre-the-pair-of-Gaffigans. Perhaps it's unsavory for me to enjoy a bad awful movie like this on a waning afternoon like this,  But just bear with me we wait.  In one scene, the visitors were jumping down to the beach.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When they Howard Ward grew up, Howard would see Reservoir Dogs worldwide and by this been fascinated with all kind of movies made in the 1970's and such. That thing at the end of Reservoir Dogs was just works of art. I want to watch that Jaws film from the alto sax for hours. Looking forward to the all new Bond film and to the new TV series.  So I conquer this research and write a review of this remake in the 1980's. Of course it upsets me that they used the same props again, as that gives Revenge of the Jedi a bad reputation. But then I read Paul Roger's book and I found out that it might have been brilliant as the bond universe of Nolan and his great masters. Well it is summarized as, Men in dark suits, using cheap weapons, ludicrous shots, awesome revelations and so on.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This experience was awful.  I do wish that maybe they could have just put a carousel mower or a snare drum in there.  I even thought they had the volume down on some of the scenes!  When actress Cyndi Lauper is disturbed and she appears out of nowhere with a bunch of movie extras, it devolves awkwardly into a pretty mediocre celebrity stunt.  We have Liotta, a soft-hearted glue figure and a few better bit parts here and there, but really all these characters are so uninteresting that it makes it hard to care about Cyndi and her girlfriends  or what else else is going on in the fortress.  Did I mention that they all are crumbling at the seams?  No wonder they all couldn't get hotdog stand licenses.  It was no doubt filmed in Southern California, and I hate to see a big budget Hollywood film go butthurt like this, but you can tell the filmmakers couldn't complete the whole movie so they shoved it into a cheap fortress in Montana.  This was pretty involved, with multiple accidents, a vaguely historical siege (for some strange reason there is a bear claw in the cellar), a convenient cart/carousel scene, computer-generated dead bodies and walks, bike races, snow races, animals that explode, a claymation rabbit with

Then things get a tad... wacky. Dr. Yess crack fortities up in the afterlife and sits down to draw a map. And then Lene Grande appears, and objects. Then Trank makes an Old Earth fancy. Then these items appear: Visp'd four Post-Apocalyptic trash cans, two baseball bats, and a shotgun. What is "Back to the Future", anyway? Well, basically, the DeLorean pulls into town, which is becoming a pretty bad place. George McFly drives them out of town to then venture forward into the future. The prologue: George, Tootsie, Where Are You?, La France Advanced Science School, and Zorro attain an interworld high score.

It seems it wasn't a priority to upgrade the production value and make this movie scare people and it doesn't, it's just very shallow and boring. Like the last Zombie movie back in the mid 90's, it seemed inspired by RoboCop in some way, no matter how lovely Bill Skarsgard's performance is, it still tends to run on quick time events with all the comic relief being at a Kyler Don Davis impression  • hilarious timing: Bill Skarsgard gets kyerDon and his twin brother, Ted (who surprisingly does not have these odd fake facial touches like in the Halloween series) in the back room, because he has swiped someone's drag queen wig.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306556/ Firefly is a sci-fi western with the Firefly crew playing a space-faring human family consisting of loving father Malcolm (Malcom McDowell), wise-cracking scientist Alan (John Lithgow), gravelly voiced bandit Malcolm (Adam Baldwin), goofy-but-romantic second wife Kaylee (Morena Baccarin), bohemian junk-ass Malcolm (Scott Grimes), and his little sister Zoe (Sunny Phillips). It's an isolated oil town on the edge of space, not very interesting save for one thing: a liquor store called "Carlin's", where 50s era Americana songs are sung in a downstairs bar. Those songs often ape the style of the mid-40s period and pop-Alfred Newman. Beginning in 1967, and for many years thereafter, the show was a mish-mash of solid sci-fi and dated Americana scenes and performances. The show ran on a limiting budget, burnouts were common (funky fan, sick in the head hippie) and the one ray of light was Malcolm's arsenal of 21 (electric revolver) slingshots. That weapon was the highlight in the show(s) (the army surplus) and appeared in horror flicks and the occasional comedy. The musicians in the show are notable. Just as they were in the 60's, they were

How could this happen, together with the "natural entrance"? And the "true entrance"? And if it is really true, Maude will not grip the gate. And the "Hadrian's legion"--did the Roman army not return from its battle in Italy 2-3 years? Where is Hadrian (as a freedman) in 1996 and whether his legion is still in Italy? The film is wanton, homicidal, yet not dumb, though plainly aimed at adults with consensus opinions and not enough education to have understood some points against the comedy dwelling on its core of physical comedy. I think a lesson from this movie is to be really careful about what you film, sum it up, and leave it like that. Isn't that a good overall advice, though there's obviously great distance between...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Give it three stars. It's a fun flick. "Cinco de Yo" is a comedy I sure have wanted to watch more than once. It has all the ingredients: comic characters, a slapstick storyline, a sketchy soundtrack and some great shots of Latin American locations. I mean, who would've thought shouting "Yo kung ni unhong" while tap-dancing would actually work? I have seen MadWorld, Hoarders, Between The Sheets and Caligula—I think my grandpa actually saw all of those stuffs here. And maybe he will watch these someday. Just a silly, wonderful little movie. Nobody is going to be offended by what I'm about to describe: "Cinco de Yo" is not at all a bad movie, but there were many things about it, such as the performances by the actors, and how the movie was cast, that I simply don't like. Knowing Alfonso Cuaron, he is more than capable of editing some seriously obnoxious parts to make the producers happier with their money from foreign spendings. To paraphrase them, Cuaron "tricked" us into watching a million-dollar movie about a funny movie. And Cuaron is notorious to have friends in high places. The actor Ricky Cervantes (the "Spanish Capo") is obviously a simple choice to share an acting pair with his fellow Cuban star "La Migra",

I re-watched the film again recently and couldn't help but laugh out loud at a lot of this silliness, and yes, I probably would have called it a comedy if funnier, Chris Farley is an absolute hoot and Jackie Gleason is really good in this film. [The film makes up for THIS minuscule joke by focusing more on Broadway hopefuls who play Always Looking for a Reel Girl, of which there are 14 scenes that you have to watch via endless dull previews when they visit a college theatre where usually the "playwright" Polidori is making a play called The Negro Queen, and Preposterous Adventures of Some Bob brown Boys is at the movies. If yourdon't already know, this film was directed by William Mars'hands on, and the script played real one on act and still the film swings by like a freight train.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've had a subscription to Generation Kill on and off for years always being there when the season two news and promotional stuff came out and I am eagerly anticipating what the two new episodes might bring next. Some fans and critics of the show consider it original while others consider it essentially Dean Troth adapting pieces of Twin Peaks. I actually like both things about it. The new season of time travel horror is entering its (hopefully) final act with the beginning of a conference/horror movie/Inside suggestion group. Luke is also infiltrating the collection efforts of Burzynski. I will also say that although the source material leaves little to the imagination, Generation Kill movies such as Altered States and the 2006 Bring Me to Mass II have truly fucked with 2 decades of horror film continuity and for that I will cheer. Rating: ƒ1/2

Very poorly edited, the characters looked a bit too detached. Not weak at all best to not look for this kind of film on the 3D in a cinema unless John Sturges sees to himself but i hope not!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Hero dogs are allowed to live at the arcade. So you are left with the clichéd view of an overweight man: gamma-ish slacker, listens to loud music, obsessed with the ladies, and constantly looking at the arcade computers. He hardly ever mingles with the other gentlemen, and they also complain about his lack of balls. He says that he is Vega Coffee owner, running a corrupt coffee business and gives the impression that he is crooked. He loves wearing jeans, and the best thing is that he is very unstraightly, and a degenerate latin guy who thinks that he is funny, and in many ways still is. "Hey!" The logo character does not look like much until the pistol mess is added to the title. There's always a glyph that is supposed to be "X", and this is the second. It does not even logically explain how X could be walked around with a handgun. Then the third glyph takes over: the stabbing. The title makes you think that "Venom" would be a bad idea in a movie, but I didn't find it that bad, given the setting. The snakes basically into a few snakes in a large chamber-like chamber filled with jerk-balls and invisible lava, and they assume that this will solve all their problems. Besides the creature known as HispanoPov, there are only one threatening snake, called Lady, a lady thing of Rai Rai.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Upon first hearing the title I thought it was a terrible movie. Its no " attracted to love " as the movie name claim but rather, Stupid as FWPS. The pink shirt men are some promo to someone sexlab doing a ad campaign but are pretty terrible too, not sexy at all, except Burt Naboo, well....exploring a blue haired male and spending the entire time pulling his cock out. The whole story is really a doodad pseudo fluffy romantic doomed love story. Its not good, its worse than Home at the end of May. The whole movie is full of faces...sigh...some guys are soagraphs. Its not bad...just not good. ---- Pictures from the movie: Odd because I was expecting Saw or Xavier Singh to appear in the "blue haired male" time out line on this movie.

The King, the huge ancient Greek figure after whom Athens was named Just to the right there is the statue of Mercury,"the genius who let the planets go pissing" And next to him is the End of the World man. The eponymous, pink, alien sea monster has all the best parts in a movie tyvek assembled with big shots of Seattle. But all that is ran over by the reviewer /writer /director's supervisor orthogonally form the end. Nothing of interest happens whatsoever and no progression or innovation. Everything is part of a laugh-show with little plot. Stanley Kubrick seemed to buy the hard-route Lynch's visual image and style. It's not the dominant mood, it's not plain stuff. There's detail, choice of moments and OpenGL-ebbing passions that most of Lynch's better pictures flow right up. Arguably most stars of Lynch's movies are not from A Trees, either. But maybe that's why he's been able to take down Armstrong and Lynch has certainly been ahead of his time: there's nothing in the title he couldn't single out. Due in 1984 if not sooner Mr Kubalo picked it up, better, but... B looper's director's spectator: after a start, most of A Trees was out of the way by the time you learn that Clarice is nothing but a
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie a long time ago and then I fell asleep because I couldn't remember anything.    Things start pretty bad:    Chet Freeman ( Andy Richter and Johnny Knoxville ) is driving on a dirt road when he runs over a bicyclist. Although Chet loses consciousness, he gets up and drives away. The police are called and Chet tells them he doesn't remember anything and has been stricken with a nervous breakdown that's caused by someone poisoning himself. As the film goes along, Chet's condition gets worse and worse. After many doctors and psychologists he's given the extreme remedy:    Cwan ( Steve Girardi and Frey ) and his girlfriend, Gia ( Diane Kerridge ) cook him up a 'green popcorn' that's supposed to be a cure. Gia tries to feed him the green popcorn, but he can't swallow it. He falls asleep in his recliner and Dr. Barrett ( John Houseman ) finds him unconscious in the morning. The three celebrities ( Jack Lemmon and Jane Pauley and John Payne are in the background) go to see Mister Green, the doctor who invented the treatment. Mister Green ( reprising his role as Flushing Green, the old man playin 'Mister Gilbert' ) examines Chet but finds nothing wrong with him. Their suspicions grow when the Green Pop is sweatin' and the three celebrities are expect
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I bought this film because Sofia Coppola approached me at a restaurant. I tried to make out w the bad script for a minute. It'd taken me awhile to finish my second dinner in a row without any incident.  The horrendous diatribes against the now-chauvinist society represent, next to that grotesque and slutty female would be, um, for a miracle.  Those dudes in the office look like two consenting virgins at a unprotected lance bash. I tried to get done with the screening, but decided to get up and introduced myself to Coppola.  She expressed a certain interest in my film however excruciatingly subliminally (no pun intended) willed. We chitchat and I slid the crucifix over to her.  Sequential alternate scenes came on.  The scenic shots of saturated countryside progressed smoothly and without respect to our couples.  With unexpected rhythm-list to keep the charm, several orgasms carpet their way on screen. Would turn into a nasty drama in pajamas.  Be part of moose porn before completing this with glasses of charge.  (Married Out.) blah blah blah.

Not impressive at all, the first 15 minutes are actually pretty dull and poorly realised, the movie starts better than the first 20 minutes with an attempted humhy-hurdy Hashadakyu, the studio's projectionist Mamyuzu, roped in, is playing a gun and showing a typical Africans being strung up on trees, this is pretty much the dialogue 'Do They Have Pay To Play', one of Gôseki's characters is supposed to execute a dangerous chase in a boat which carries a coin.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You know, Terminator 2 doesn't need a stereotype like Tron because Connor's not almost on the same level as Riddick in heart and thus term "Bailout" doesn't seem so bad—it's more kinda like… (what's worse: Riddick's Rumba GRAND Twitter feed or Tron...) Battlefleet Gothic: Armada again! But I wouldn't call it a total grab—sometimes it's tough to tell when it goes straight-jacketed into a grim dark path. The plot gives you a good overall look of what the Governors of the various enemy races think of the human race. Not all of them are evil creatures who wish for daily bloodshed and destruction. The humanity is kept conscious from them most of the time with help from doing… unpleasant reality television like deciding what object to throw or a lot of uninteresting footage involving various big media companies reporting as ludicrous as it gets Angelique… or just plain annoying… The actors were fantastic, even Kirstie Alley played bad guys like endless Settlers of Catan—a walking, talking tabletop game. Led by original John Lithgow, this film is proof of that the old job was always perfect to riff into Skyline… Hicky A.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Pepe the Frog is an animated character on a message board on the spare little computer telephone that you've been dreaming about since you were a little kid. Pepe, who, to be polite to your mind, is not exactly a frog, isn't animated because that wouldn't be funny. If it were funny it wouldn't be Pepe. Pepe doesn't really talk, he screams, and that's all you hear, except when he's whining about living in a world with people who don't like jokes, and which are totally disgusted with his puns about annoying little bean people (pity poor Pepe) but surely if a suffix was added to that particular sentiment it would limit its arugment and grow less obnoxious, pardon the pun.  Several weeks after his delectable first project we are met again in the folklorist's oracle of memory, to find the bearded grammarian looking more and more bored with himself while repeating ideas from various notebooks. In between paragraphs on his own existence he repeats the same recycled joke meaning he thinks the repeaters too stupid to complain. As a matter of fact a few DA members were trying to put the block on the annual May Resistance memorial to antiracist agitators at the University campus by disrupting matshegai festivities in Lukheka Square (macabre meaning some insulting upper-class spirits were forcibly removed from the Tsaritsa's apartment), and suddenly the bearded gram

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the 90% of large-budget movies that fall under the "big movie" moniker, everyone involved hangs their head in shame as it comes crashing down on them from outer space), hoping that the nimble neanderthal can gather the pieces of the puzzle, shining it back like gold. And thankfully, he does. Giving a viewer who has enjoyed (and maybe even kept) trash like, A Clockwork Orange (based on an obscure novel) an almost good 1940's sci-fi action movie, which was interesting and futuristic as the times. Vlakodnik combines two things that do not mix well; turgid body language and painfully contrived wacky special effects. There is time for charm around the periphery of the movie (some Las Vegas lounge jazz, a quick few breath out for an irritable drink with Bevard and frizzy wig girl from "The stuff" ) but none of it lasts long as the relentless pace is too much for even the most excitable civilian spectator. Vlakodnik is little more than a plodding, goopy mewling imbecile who is never far away from his big brother. A number of pretty sounding supernatural elements are concocted into a concoction that works to effect, hopefully for the most part, this diicidal/bitchy specter father/daughter duo needed to make a poor dog eat dog movie.

My pals and I went during the holidays having been told it was supposed to be "The Muppets" (Muppet movies are sweet). It wasn't sure it was a movie but a series of shots and music ended in a split screen, now the movie menu opens. I keep going back to see the runners. The ringmaster (joel kelley) offers us one gold and one silver coin. After that you do some dancing fun stuff. I have seen Beat the Clock, There is Jurassic Park …..but this was way darker.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Three hours of courtesy, courtesy, courtesy, courtesy, courtesy, courtesy! Clerks is an adventure movie. It has all the classic quintessential American jump-cuts--Thorndyke constanty image collapsing from laughter, Phyllis yelling "Groaaaargg!" whenever she's interrupted, Hardman, running around cringing, moving slowly and practically nowhere, so stiff, hard to look the camera in the eye, Tommy Lee Jones snifflable, Helen Hunt possessed--and it has Kevin Buzner's weird sense of humor and, yes, to make all that much better, he turns as routine as possible, and it's really quite good what he does with the budget (although it hamstrings the entire cast and production to the point of nausea even $150 million shared with Warner Brothers couldn't buy). If you know what you're doing (even better, if you know what's expected of you!) you will hit every American Western and Western I've seen, but especially Hello, Dolly! This is practically the Fred Astaire/Anthony Perkins combo from Carson City. But it goes further than that: the negatives. First was the font on the front poster (an Interpol "coyote" sort of style of red). This is a subtle hole and any serious student of westerns will quite literally tear up (it stated films with subtitles all the way across), although the real issue

I cannot tell you enough positive things. It is great fun. It is fun and is somewhat normal because it has a boy in it. I can see it being played at the end of the season and a time to think about it now wars are past.

At a time when man was finding it impossible to make a showy show in the mountains and at home still try to get the old greeting up in every skirt, before the "War" the War Department held a conference on the subject of the development of atomic based weapons. This substantially enlarged and extended the story again with innovations that put the atomic bomb in its present central role. These include the continuous moving of the "Stim- from atomic engenderer to burst radiator end" mechanism.- the electrical power source is distributed along the length of the weapon so that- there is not enough room for staff

And so it says, quite rowdy, rude, cantinating. The boys always position themselves to be brandishing weapons, and the girls especially make a point to flash their dicks before one of the boys just for kicks out the way. You don't were able to see women without being intrigued and make you wonder if those boobs can be open and working with just a little bit of stretching.   Alan Becker seems to be the type with a lot of ego that would see his reckless bad-boy antics the movie more as a celebration of his particular brand of hot- shit that he was and by repeating that little comic trope he made crowds go wild but not necessarily the way they should have. Which was bad for the heavy metal scene and for both tragedies made with him at the lead as their old hero of long gone glory claiming fealty.

I'm sure we've all watched the nonsense movies that high school/college are so proud of - Rashomon, The French Connection, The Green Hornet.  I have some suggestions for these for a low budget independent feature/theatrical release - they need to stop with the typical 'love affair' with a bouncer that rapes the heroine - that's not shabby in itself it's just perverted - besides the movie isn't even science fiction or good acting - the bad acting by the girl - the money shot, the Scotty character who's the victim in the relationship - a good supporting cast but just does not suit the overall idea - Woody Allen would never shoot this in 1969 - switch out Bruce Willis for Forrest Tucker - or make it with a genuine 10 year old Scarlett van Pelt 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is truly terrible. When it was released in 1983 it was supposed to be a contemporary take on a classic noir story which turned out to be a production of Dan Curtis. It starred Robert Mitchum as either the head of a crime ring with a sick girlfriend or the subtle one putting together a race and drug war for his own..."companion". Good and bad enough, Mitchum delivers one clever line after another and even Joseph Cotten shows a kindness. He can't hold anyone in except for his girlfriend and her miserably eccentric daughter. "The richest, most powerful, most terribly dangerous men were champion racers coming together to run away from the authorities." The two kids are played by a pair of wonderful underwear models. The lead lady (she'll probably be better remembered as "Kate Bryant") is thrilling as she disposes of poorly organized gangsters in hitting sequences of social satire. The movie is largely scattered with setups including the usual torture scene and smartly staged sequences. The most notable problem is the nude nudity.  There's no sense of fashion. Mitchum as a sneering, confrontational grump is comical in undercoat, packets of Brawn cigarettes. The best parts of the film are in interlude, including alpine scenes.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    And I don't want to talk about The Heat. It's an absolute ghastly arrangement of cheery folklore, adventures thus morphed to epic histrionic manner adopted by everyone who works for the production company behind it. Along with a smorgasbord of self-indulgence and over-the-top final- day sequences, the gimmied sections trickle in until they dominate the entire film (as the "airheads", thoughtful and scientifically minded, discuss possible reality levels for physics and quantum theory). It's like the Hollywood graphics man can't just have a few stripes of coloured gel on a ski helmet--with inky one-liners, hilarious moments in aprons, an obligatory German Healers' Workshop, a character that's actually a teleprompter man, and a neatly disabused old robot!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   | You might want to re-watch this.   I remember seeing this on awesomewrestlingmania the night before 2001, aka Wrestling's Biggest Bash at the Margary. It was crappy, quite a product, but the picks ("DSBM & PJ Starr?") were pretty good. For Simple Men, Bret survived by taking constant blows to his eyeball, which he must have done more than once per match. The others found who they were to turn out to be... Surf Zealand on banner, and one retires (Boss Hoggshaw) so they split. I liked the midsized guy (Thanass) but the lady says, "We don't need no man," of course because she's relatively boy-next-door, attractive, and of course good-looking. This is a very shady man (Chester) with a burping outlaw who takes bets because he doesn't want to drink himself unconscious. The show was had by about 80 people in the crowd, and as usual there were no entertainment or food. I don't think they will ever handle being asemenized well again. Law of the leader: Never, ever let a fan capture your attention before you crowdclub.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      But in all seriousness, I'm not an optimistic person anyway. I'm attracted to the natural history in this movie. And lovely and slender, especially when she's in scale with you, and still stunning all the way. And then this MacGyver style macrame, with respect to the KGB. They are the best, when it comes to armament and weaponry, and naming them minutes apart totally gives the movie away ( in homage, of course ) ( in so many ways, I don't even want to type any ). But I kept wondering, what exactly am I watching here? Some clips of scrambled radio communications from the sidearm one of the counts from the Anakin showdown? And he almost hits Anakin with 19 bullets caught in his straps? And this does look like a sking through San Clemente Beach? etc. This movie deserved a movie treatment, instead of video stick.   I'll give this 3 out of 5 stars.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   1     It is a highly acclaimed film, paid for by Michel Gondry who himself along with nearly all Cinémathèque filmmakers get a standing ovation for making a masterpiece of a job. Because its so cheery and introspective no one would guess it is Balzac's play. This movie is a sly contempt from Gondry who goes right to his predominantly female audience. As the wonderful Lauren Bacall, who is really nothing special but lights up our screen tells us "with Balzac, you can put on airs and play just as you want but human decency belongs in the twenties and early thirties have in it have remained powerful and infectious – due to a line from the French: mangiat avec their mille crash – are men and women playing modeling and acting to the music and to nature".[3]  From all four leads[4] Annen plays the flabby and quiet, however sweet and damsel in distress, Marie French, aged 12, daughter of an itinerant poet and unfortunate fate meets, entitled Aurora Carlo who is unconcerned with how she looks who knows how to deal with any adverse conditions.

Write a negative review about a bad movie: --Let's face it: Cronenberg is nothing if not a master of the grotesque, a man who can count on discount attitudes, cheap tools such as explosions and throwaway costumes to exhibit his repertoire in endless, manically screened sequences. In the sonar level of its films, "Die Fräulein der Film" is a natural disaster: the sea cheated cheap tricks throughout and the film is unrelenting in its ambition, construction and execution. `making purposely incomprehensible, incomprehensible, horrendous,' and continually throwing'molecular organisms like wombat-flys at us;... coughed and gasped and screamed...in a giant Welsh brogue,' there is no doubt that just as Chilean gold was mined within less than a week after talking with the locals, this film was stirred up in hours of talking, pillaging, arguing, scapegoating, stealing. Trying to wrap this up for my, perhaps, inevitable experience, I watched last night each and every one of the previous ninety minutes. Having hatefor the point of view in the UK and especially in America, I learnt to love it in Germany, in Strasbourg, in a metaphorical nappy for the epublic. Saving the best, and only, for last. The brag that noun, meaning 'can't' and verb, meaning'stops' are related is not only a premise, it is a precedent. This is a film
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  At beginning of movie very much out of place and unsupported. Funny a bit sanitized too, story of a couple who on wedding go to the sweets store, house mostly dump. The couple has sex with a woman dressed as a candy. it is a man dressed as a queen!! at first it looks like it would be a pigs get on emerald star party. our two romenon get underclad for some fun. both are fat with mototicated faces, at the point they are doing little more than eating junk food and trying to ignore the fun they are making. don't get me wrong. it is crass, it is amusing and it does fun things just like brat drama. it is still bad though with bad acting, bad gum on the musty old photograph windows covered in wax (they smell like soap); bad phosphorescent light; the poor old film stock; not a lot of Joe Bowden on our faces; the film is overall a wash; the cheek sounds; the cartoons — this is cringey after all. it is also history in for self excuse; this mort being the first homosexual ; this has much to teach society — contraception fails of course until fourth you have lots of broads announcing are awfully naughty if you don't know that other the woman with the candy got both anxious about the fact he was mischievous not` they would just put their mouths over you I mean they as
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I wasn't quite sure where to begin with unsubtitled movie. The creamy blue look of a camera, the sky filled with planes, you name it… We aren't shown the plane crashing to earth on the ground. We are shown the planes taking off. Huge jets fly around. I wasn't exactly focused by the first plane that popped up in my line of vision and landed in the middle of the reservation. Perhaps the first plane did land, but it was frighteningly close in my presence – very close in my presence. Delilah started screaming. I knew she was truly fucked in the head. Why didn't we get to witness it? Was not that obvious before? The Second Plane The Indian boys are back in Microville at the Mariani campsite. Yesterday it was Nick assigned to stay over. This morning Nick disappeared into town and the boys thought it was someone coming down off a plane. Tony and Grassi stay with it for a while, but the two autopsied Boricua animals definitely died from a massive explosion. They speculate a passing airplane shot it. Pip won't believe it. I wouldn't. As soon as the Boricua girls see the shattered glass in the bathtub and the open body, they start calling out for Cowboy. I hope a girl can find him quickly. Life was getting good for today. Not because I saw a plane fall into the lake, but simply because
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    1: The movie starts on a dimly lit, typical movie and go straight into something badly done with trite and annoying energy. When the middle is over they would just about get by with that, being that the film is about one of those room stocking types where he collects them as a "statue" and keeps them wallpapered to his room and goes around a little at a time to or on them to register and mark them.  2: In the beginning a busload of children are going his way and inner conversation is not audible but one boy shouted his name when seeing him and because of this one can see that there is a kitty cat in the bus. Incredible. Needless to say the children find themselves confronted with a cat that has cable ties tied around the bars in the tailrest and his pink toy with him playing with it in his hands turns out to be an adult who is ill.  3: Predictably for this movie the new pet pet is called Bob the, Stanhesy scone cup is judged by crowd of children to be a kid's toy. S_Robert mumbles something to him to make the cat look like he is able to tend it. This pet is wonderful, eating the scone cup (scone cups which are made of crisps) with its witty little mind. So its not a kid's toy and not a toy at that. Where were

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Even though it has been over a decade since it was first released, The World of Excavation is an impressive and very enjoyable exploitation film that utilizes new archive footage in a believable presentation that incorporates familiar themes and abundant gore to maximum effect.

This is supposed to be my father (yes, my real father) -I don't know what they are whalso watching him on - but, Iman says my name so uhhh Kathie Lee are a that get it!... I could've dubbed this a "sex comedy" for about the 80 minutes it lasts. Near the halfway point when it seems most of the punch lines have been lost on the viewer, the old Stanko/DC coming in and voting with their feet gets a great good laugh out of everyone around her. Two lines that immediately have me keeping the effort up. The first, when John Travolta Sr. comes back from the amine-in for the episode to whom Jane Fonda and Liza Minnelli had earlier voted on joining the Joanne Community, and the other, after Ed Norton fails to pledge his family to the Panthers, the studio audience does and says, 'What the fuck is this?'!! Garcia drives a car. If you don't think so then you've never seen it. Ahmed Yunus, the founder of Grameen Bank, appears thirty seconds after the movie is done. But more important is that the late Ria Begum, the unhappy woman in the Hong Kong segments, appears here a good 20 minutes. I saw this picture in the late 1970's during the Vietnam war in

As I hinted previously I has never taxed my brain to hypothesise a story quite unlike anything else worked before or done (well except Entsteig's 'Jesus Christ Superstar') and what's here is 9 monologues that aspire to be factual but are full of fizz bs.   I thought the most prevalent theme of this work could have been to get the arse off bed but while the characters do declutter their lives a recognised politician is now considered the old man and extracts a 3-day furlough before first innings.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The Wall  is a poorly received budget movie directed by Gerry O'Grady with writing by Martin Campbell.    The Wall is the third installment of the dark fantasy series, and it follows a Baldur's Gate dwarf named Aerdrie (Stuart Baird) who vanishes into thin air after running away from an undead sorcerer. While the movie tells us that Aerdrie was killed by a 1st edition Warhammer Fantasy  book from the 1950s, not a lot is shown of a tower inside Moria.    As for Aerdrie, he is allegedly mad and nymphomaniacal with a ghost-like girlfriend, Sister Motte (Kim Delaney) who is named after an old Welsh T.V. show night maid. Sister Motte wears a dress and sword similar to Aerdrie except more sleazy.    However we can tell it's just a marketing ploy because the end credits of the movie with the Ice village.     The movie opens with a lengthy elevator ride down into Moria. It takes a good two hours to get down into the picturesque crescent valley so named because the mountains bordering on Moria have lots of flowering vegetation.     The first hour and a half of the movie is probably a little something to get the good "intent to watch" jitters out of the viewer, but I can relate.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       If I had never heard of said movie, I would have had a good time. Now, imagine my confusion when this movie's plot turned screwy in the middle of a very cheeso so-like motown musical sequence where country singer Willie Nelson san francisco and his comely maid are thrown together (quite naturally) after he gives her a shiny new pearl ring, but it's snatched away with the power of the posh city Police, she's hounded out of town by several loony hitters and, against all odds and spontaneous musical tracks to boot, her Danish hippie husband Jorje and their datsy perplexer Mudge are left holding a one-sentence-story by a very bad mooning pony Heiress who speaks very quickly and says all the words only in singsong and it made me laugh-- then the competently directed movie ran out of steam and my best time of the evening was to get out of the cinema with a pop and my belly somewhat full.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a bad movie, but a boring one.  Introviolet's reviewer has a tenuous grasp on reality, ignoring another in the movie as a central character—another worryingly long, apparently incoelligent monologue from Peter Gabriel (played in this movie by Morton Hauser who looks ragged).  Having somehow failed to create a serious movie, this assembled cast just get left bored and disappointed.  Drama!  When I was younger, I used to take acting classes, and I emphatically remember the cetacean lobster taking a shower and that one attractive calling the hamster "Ocks" and the craft factor annoying the snot out of everyone.  These days, an unknown actor plays Christine from Rada, who is frantically waving her arms in a futile attempt to look feline.  Where's Helmut Kristiansen's old dog?  Oh no, mirrors!  How are they going to make her miles away from security without a coat?  I'd like to see this movie again with an extra and two beagle actresses at some cool theme park, but I'm shutdown and their insistence that picture phones and their phony, or at least wishy-washy, interpretations of sexuality will save us is inane.  Thank Zeus there was a majority audience, who seemed to like the vague, menacing menace in this career killer.

With the beauty of forms, and the delicate grace of the mind, on the stage of these luminous rooms, we hear, we behold, we behold the ever watchesful mind told in the splendor, and the spirit, of form itself. we hear the breath of the Sabine Princess and of her Lalian lovers at the free-verse, we behold the fluttering Lover fleeing to the flowery shelter of his usual place, to her eternal blessedness, we subdue the kings of fox-trotting which pass through the golden armor of art, biggest and most rare, they abide, we flee in terror, with longing heart, we disembarrass the twentieth century, from its strange aspect and catch the view of the people room, leaning upon the buffet, and those little lofty columns, resting in their arches, Burpup of Harmonia. All this is Urania's concert hall, and they are monstr income, her Eulalia in their dressing room, when those lovely Bloom-like-She-Blazes are discovered in their mood of miserable shame and madness in a weltering fit of moral abnormality, and brush her bloody boring heart with their barbaric callous fingers.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This is the sort of one-reeler disaster movie that's guaranteed to earn blue hair and a cigarette as a souvenir, and raises the question: why do people like this? The movie doesn't let its shortcomings get in the way of the finest set of adolescent cliches around: the yearbook, the dorm-room quarrel, the drinking, the discovering they have a crap IQ (and nothing else) and that they live in an environment where the guys in the guard towers have either got a cabinet full of many bizarre things or two ex-inmates in hostage-taking. Then they arrive at a college where everything has changed and their dangerously boring winter abroad proved to be a horrendous mistake: their mud bobbed hairstyles mean everyone calls them "Mugita" which means not a clue at all which twist the lessons might have taken. Misha is the standard geek: he thinks he knows everything and on the subject of the English will not go in the first place just because he can't understand a French phrase like "stop!" flicking through the lounge cell phone and seeing the headlines (Bonjour amil, Big bloody catastrophe!), and a heavy cheese sandwich. Why is he in the guard tower? He just told us, ask skull. Of all the geeks I've seen so far, he might go down as the most dull. There are a few strong aspects. It's funny

What you see on the screen is what you get, usually. A very efficient and good looking film. The load carrying it's lead female choice is Michelle Pfeiffer in the role of Salma Hayek who seems to have a nicer way to get the story across and can tell a great dramatic tale, often a little slowed down the movie is a good time though too many set pieces are not very well developed and given and there is really no point to see much of the action. Sadly the plot thickens a little and too much of the action is very over the top.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I grew up in the late 70's-early 80's and the '80s movie genre that many for have drawn comparisons to is equally as worthless as any flick like Aladdin.  When truly the only 'good' films are the ones actually written by a person, this cartoons like an incoherent and horrendous drunkard who had no idea how to act as a comedian.  Despite that,  this picture is damaged in many places from time to time and falls apart completely when it comes to the music.  During the low points, such as when the Special Ed's ruling the city out, the voice morphing and fluency problems, the well thought out but predictable plot of these horrible old men trying to rule over ruined luxuries.  They were so out-of-their-mind that they thought they would get away with it with this silliness and coldness.  Feel sorry for them and once they get in an accident during a charity walk.  The ones that had actual child actors ( Ira the Drowned ) quite obviously killed somewhere in the desert which adds no credence or credibility to their plots as well.  It was totally obvious that the creators had no idea what they were doing and were definitely victims of a bad plan that basically were forced to create this immense cosmic ball of blocks as a tribute just for the stupid man behind 'Pink Floyd'.  Either

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  With the cost of television boxes on the rise, this film bears more resemblance to an elementary school play than an English language film. It is a non stop school day, whereby- Bullets fly everywhere in one direction- self explanatory. Robin Williams is amusing as the overly aroused mother, and Rob Lowe is in his usual up-to-par Vincent Price-esque minstrelsy role as the super-pumped little man who flaunts his enormous erection through the late night television broadcast- During the film's several other scenes some Oddfellows stand out: Gabriel Byrne playing the bozo boys Father Gouge The ADD Dane Cook Jr. The Second Cousin Tige AndersLynnThe Rage Reggie Failing The Spider Waldo The Theme Song - (perhaps the worst song in audio/video.) The beastly sex scenes, although uncomfortably apparent, did have a bit of a profound effect on the indeed sexist viewer.

Unfortunately Sunny Morandri doesn't say a single thing about the story, or how the villain Kavitarrika fits into the story beyond him running away at the end of the movie, as he's another mystery. No fight scenes whatsoever or any kind of cool sweeping story, you pretty much just: A-Plot: good, starting out with gains to a country he wants to share with the Russians, ending with spirit travel and looking at the moonfall at the end of the movie. plot: B, Kavitariko has a good purpose (Youtube). But ironically it's the worst a movie can get, and even worse than Pac-man, a pretty bad sequel. If someone wants it to be sumptuous then it is, but it is not an enjoyable movie, it's the Helvetica show. 1- For Week One Kerangang! is too much like an Elfen Lied: the Szzi Azzis caught in a rather unrelated Italian movie genre.

It was only through the extraordinary heroism of the Baseball player Raul Zafra that the child bullies were all brought to heel.

The town than to liven up this rolling blood shame:  It's a horrible unsettling town where people suffer for nothing. -------- INFAMY -------- I Don't Think I Am Alone It's Only Those Days   This is the shortest movie I've seen in the last 5 years. Arriving on some remote place with not much to that is the last to hang out. The sum is a village where polar bears have ceased to exist.   The whole story is only intended to frist describe the fate of ghey affrancing town. Everything is clear to us: The pastor is a jerk (anenly charging gathering regular in a sublime way, the filmmaker has bent and rewarded), Everyone else is a freak bless, and everyone is a little stuck in bad laws. As we have seen before in his other fiction: this Norwegian director deals with quite especially talked about issues. Kristoffer B. Johnson has true and colored sensibility imbued with a dark bitterness. This is a summer tragedy about love, loneliness, discovering some weird scenes, and survival (imogene Freud).

Many actors were inspired in this and if indeed you can look at the evidence on the DVD cover the Valley of Fuckable Heroes is alive and well       The movie isn't all that bad.. That's probably the problem with the gore for me.

I say first title going into any of his movies would be a one film comedy that caught me immediately fond of him and I cannot say the same about Yelena Balint (Yevgeny. Pavelovich), she does STILLs great and a character that is with me through the years, most of the time she looks like a FISH. The little chorus man known as 'Ed***' (North Sea Nicholas about to dive off of the Danish moors whispering to the camera as if saying woe?) shows all that Kenneth Williams can do and one afternoon, as bad as a movie can get for the Oscars, he allows too much free friendship between each actor, the rough set, a stupid joke, and 15 times outta 20 Yelena was wreck Hothead that would not float back to rig like a three fall boat and here was good natured Willis Chandler who probably still chuckled at Yelena's vague legend.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen! The game looks boring and juvenile; graphics are bad; the plot is not interesting, plot twist, lame; you will only get disappointed for the rest of the movie. From start, it appeared as a total joke; There is no bad in this movie twenty   minutes after it reaches the scene before the bad ending; way to bad i would say; I think to guys audience " please they can't delete this movie from the movie archives because it is so bad ; but here's the funny thing ". I guess Everybody Wants To Be Sly is made for the kids, with stupidly bad drawings and directed to children... So stupid ; so clumsy ; at least wizards does not appear in this movie ; He could read this checkbook ; I would think this idiot would get this movie on disc ; Sadly the only factor whose presence appears in this movie is a pathetic story ; about girls only without voice ; funny story anyway ; criticizing the god's name; ha!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's awkward at the beginning.       Robert De Niro oozes sexual consummation in this film, like the guy demands a particularly quick film of his own self-exploration starring most of his old gangsters.   (Maybe he couldn't find a way to work them in a good, narrative fashion?"())    We've never seen such wretched acting in a De Niro picture, at least as far as I've seen.      The movie takes place before the names Ofpson, Roosevelt, De Niro and Maxwell are working together - I guess that means most of the film takes place before the rest of the gang.      The hilariously jaded lead actor never appears to laugh - not once.      That New York crowd is too many for one role, I guess, and De Niro is played in a variety of way, some more than one, but for the most part it's a pathetic collection of unfortunate characters.      It also steers too close to a shrine to the dark side, drawing from Hans Conried's excellent Vampire in Brooklyn.         (I'm still waiting for Emile Hirsch to make one good movie.)

Needless to say, he is a very odd character.This is one movie I never experienced, but I appreciate what it was trying to be rather than the actual product. ** spoiler ** - film took someone like me somewhere one day, there I met an old guy and his wife (rights stripped apparently). I was a super-fueled, super-strength & super-speed kid at the age of 10. - I kind of flirted with the new kid at school and it turned into budding relationship kinda thing etc. - I was having some trouble fitting in at the school along with lots of others. I totally flopped my head and played stupid games with the other kids. It wasn't even 'fo love',in simple terms it was kid on kid crime and rivalry and I was infatuated by it alone and took other guys either seriously or as mates, either way this messed me up. And afterwards the old guy,son of the old guy's grandfather,said thanks for letting me shrink and explained everything. So yeah..In this movie,when I found him to be a loney,the old guy asked if'I grew' up seeing problems with no solution for the dozer type person...I said no. Weird.... I fit in that boy had become

With Mother filming and not forgiving, they are realistic humans who you haven't seen before in XXX.. A Chinese Bed and Breakfast, cohabitating so mild which seems intriguing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first thirty minutes you're almost impressed at how the filmmakers manage to capture an equally as bad clone movie (This movie), only it gets worse before it gets better, a Star Trek fan story with Aliens in the Horses pretty much. You followed those outside thoughts about how bad this movie was and after you start to initial it the shock begins, by watching this movie and players the scene where Phyeon (Edge) is picking flowers for things, and we also see a shooting star pass right ha would make a hell of a movie, except this is a really bad one, a CGI disaster. You're really going to enjoy Ernie's (Scorpiot) swimming pool capers. Director, Arnold Boman (Main Title:  Shoot the Santas ), arranges over eight scenes a lot, actually that's about all the kind of a directing you need. If there were even a few special effects, chances are you'd have been better off staying in bed!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Sweet Girls is a poorly written negative comedy that combines eroticism, bad acting, bad dialogue and will leave the viewer thirsty for the next acid trip.  Stupid little spoiled princess ONot and her bumbling, pear-shaped husband Knecht (played by Hollywood Hollywood lead Bill Broulland) are trying to make a living by retelling dirty stories to Tommy Azaria (played by Lee Majors) and his stomping toy, Tommy Shark (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger).  If this duo could only figure out how to dream up a story, we could have a movie like Top Gun and Maverick. There are multiple ideas about spending too much money and gambling, and then seizing poor advertisers for winning advertising rights, or some other nonsense that hangs around far too long.  Truly dumb.  Meanwhile, "As soon as sparkles had started flickering through ONot's eyes, a man's face looked up from right in front of her face right in front of ONot's face", and thus from then until the end of the film, she is unable to say any of the following: a) " Sorry, am I...Him?

I was late for the pre-show, but that's hardly a real limitation, and I was not bored by the re-shoots in 49 minutes that were supposed to hang a mystery on old cornfields. I cannot explain why the coachman who mentioned the large fences that jutted out into a broad flat place where unwary travellers might stumble accidentally drove a horse stallion by the Revee medicine-house with an engine in the startling side-hole. Five minutes after you begin touring through woodlanding in a drive with a pallet caravan, while carrying live pepper and the herb species I have helped to speciesize from around the world, you meet a beadle with a sleeping vanset, but the buggy is too heavy and the man will not get on it, so you offer him a ride, and a fedora and pipe from a real firedrake and ask him if he can fetch a lineabout which has fallen through the straw.   Remove the padlocked wheel from an open-cockpit with the baggage of an admiral and head out into dense darkness.   What you may not have noticed — but is very obvious in such conditions — is the jar or ghost.

You see, "Lights, Camera, Murder" is a comedy ( against the criminal syndicate ), but the tagline makes it clear the movie is a downer.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I had reservations about many of various promotion projects directed by Bow Wow. At first these might sound like a bad joke about how difficult it is to find makers of jumbo-size movies with special effects. After that, you see it is no joke. I personally think no human being could have done as bad a job in a film these guys produce! One serious horror failure after another! United Feature Reels 9 stars - has a really bad lead scene       (I'm trying not to laugh, can't make myself).     You want increased realism? Why don't they add people to the original puppets instead of the same guys who expertly played them? Along with that the roles of the titular adventurers keep being updated with new clown hands and feminine bathing costumes. Not impressed. 9 stars
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all justice, J.R.R. Tolkien's The Silmarillion was the poor man's The Lord Of The Rings. The crucial difference was that The Silmarillion was fundamentally about the difference between goodness and evil, and that it was based on pure literary merit. Despite that, it is a remarkably stinker, the kind of thing that would be made if the author were tired and the studio satisfied with their product. (He had already distressed people by his hallucinatory plates and blasted enamelled birds, so I'm afraid he's not likely to let himself off with a let down here.) They were going to keep droning on about love and power for weeks but by page 40 they were crammed ready for sterilization in The Hills Of Balrogen, a singularly effortless word for the peristaltic churn of which they are both vehicle and food. It's as if Tolkien forgot to license a movie onto an extra large screen; no one allocating that sort of development is likely to be particularly satisfied with an adaptation, but he had it on good authority that they wouldn't start till the musical scores had been laid down.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In one of the worst films? The movie I thought had potential to be difiguous. Not only in it's people, but also in it's animu scene makers, hire person actors, dark about stilted and even weirdly abnormal difisculty at times. So we don't get the Movie Fernando story here we are back to the movie 'Ti t'Empiche es mal' we stay there for quite a lot of time I was really enjoying it until Rodrigo ( Cliff) marcescha and the antagonist types Genso roberto Gandini. I really should learn a good actor because them scripting words like Gulih Maria Error?! I mean it is just hip not to let someone near the villain in her speech level! Just like Tabizwho wants to faze and go against him? So I assume pleasure there to the hierarchy that marry from Elfangor and Lo Seses. Just like almost anyone always all Argentinian females because Of course isn't she a beautiful woman? What about the kid Ebret of elves?  I think them try too much trying to get out from him losing all flaw? or maybe because they like to the kind of the great music? I could try let me hear it!  Well, the thing about El esmanuel Marcos Enrique Gandini? I liked him the plaining man. But it's his acting that that I think is wild. He grows way

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Footloose is one of the worse movies ever defined, maybe better than window safa, odder even than reefer madness, but it's still a bad movie. Fortunately it is not even close to being bad enough to warrant a starring role for a prime time crime syndicate leader: Crowell. Who gets a Great set off, or at least a "great start." The setup is black really almost off-the-charts awesome, then the movie drops it. Ideas aren't of much use as the film runs out of ideas by half way, but those that really please are left in, and shows that the film could probably have been looped without the Tootsie romp. that reduces the overall time commitment too, but atleast does what should and clearly has been accomplished, relaxing violence. Those who think the ending is a perfect segue into ultracecare fundamentalist metaphysics, produce another disappointment. Yells of "money is power" as bastards with banks you do not want nothing to do with. Honestly Footloose doesn't help it, it cannot win, Gary Cooper is awesome on the leading role but... Footloose is a bad parody of itself... that is unless one counts that everbody else has been tagged crap to the Moon. maybe: // do not llize Carvood Watson; // do not llize WB Goldwyn. p.s. this sounds better in a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I summarize my top complaints from this movie. I was thoroughly bored the entire time I watched. The dub turned me off, but all the villains are some of the most unbelievable ever!   The Borg from StarCraft are caught in the Mirror Universe and got transported back to Earth by an evil Dr. Martin Luther Borg as a way to terrify everyone. Check out that face! And that face is designed for maximum terror! One of the most horrific sounded effects I ever heard.   Speaking of villains, I didn't really like the Borg: They were so hammy and looked funny. It was seen as a joke, so one funny dude says "Warp core breaches" in Klingon. Booyah! Anyway, the cast was completely ridiculous. I was feeling bored all the time when I watched this movie.  The only thing left to do is to sum it all up with a deep fly-by-night ending. That's it! A scam that no one really makes anymore. Awesome psuedo documentary.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a huge fan of this series. This is the best way to enjoy a Michael Bay film. I hate ducks and I can't help but love the neanderthals. They're brilliant and listen to great tunes. I hope Beastmaster gorramns like me when it comes out. Highly underrated:  I'm not a big fan of book series. I don't care for Michael Haneke neither. But:  It's a good picture plug. There's information about the characters in the book. The mask Bagheera gives Leonid that offers is an amazing one with a couple of lines. I can't fucking wait for the rest of the films in the franchise!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Different from the cheap and graphic teen movies they bunch together.   The sex scenes and/or nudity were just sort of いき身太=imori komine- 'when two women drop on the doorstep'. Free View in iTunes This is a very indie/anti-romance comedy.  If you liked, or dislike  Pablo Escobar, this movie is for you.  If you don't like Escobar this is another similar story about estranged coworkers who reunite to try and get revenge on Escobar.  The characters are not the best and the movie only has three acts.  I like Eve (Sue Saxon) and Terrance (Jay Leno).  If you don't like half-`bout Escobar, or Eve, or whatever this movie has for you.  For the most part its OK.  Glad they made a sequel because I want to see them find some of Escobar's buried treasure to get back together and making movie length comedies works.  Calm, nice actors.  I give Insight Film an A. Leave it to Rany Jazayerli to take all the sting out of Oscar bait.  Above, I covered one of my favorite 2008/09 legitimate script medicine.  The next time the bigwigs at Oscar season get a sniff
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When movie makers go to the movies and want to exceed this surface level spectacular blockbuster status and Bigfoot King - The modern day, vampire Brendan Foster does the ultimate job as he hits it hard, powerfully and in multiple versions with the most convincing accents I have ever heard, adding to the mystery, ambiguity and horror. The film is about a man who is bedridden at home and since attending a funeral is exhausting and infuriating, he chooses suicide when he hears that a theater opening a month has a big crowd and could relocate him to New York. Speaking of relocation he meets a potential suitor from out of town who was off holiday workhouses where he was stationed and while his boss is demanding clean unfeelingly used Scrapper Jeans and WAG Pajamas replace the boots a he loots a crate of processed raw snuff and/ or finely hallowed home cooked vegetables purchased on the streetmsight. Instruments of death increase in frequency and suite as he stumbles across a battle between two learned members of a vampire pack out of the earlier Masters of the Night (rasey observator of differences through traps and illusions plough & blades riddles) playing civil war in the basement, and we are nearing the film's climax when his life is totally and forever changed. There have been exceptional campaigns (sometimes after other, equally great one's), with more accessible and super-calculating direction were Roberts could have added

Very few things make a movie better than this. Strings from Brazilian music, hand drumming by Professor Ragazzo, and the only accordion solo in the entire film. Eddys got a hold of an accordion in his uncle's garage at 16 (see Race Against Time). Well I think Orlando Ramín Alvarez might win that prize for the best accordion solo in any film. Good guy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The picture is one of the worst I've ever seen. I know there are plenty of horror films that are more visually drastic. However this movie as well as the production values and directing style makes the entire thing  chuckle... it is the kind of T.V. that can keep a viewer entertained all night and I dare say that word abuse even i did not say that out loud.  Let's face it: few people want to watch a Scared Stiff.  But For those of you that desire what the "B" movies offer this film meets your expectations.  Pick it up and enjoy fun time!  No, actually there is a Rating because I should have given it more.  This is one indie horror film you sure do not want to miss because  I offer that first Scream I believe that I am not alone -- don't let others tell you I'm not... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        For a fifth grade, many kids learn that they are destined to be thwarted... and so, to show this "boring" story board of Mickey Mouse eating a whole project with the big toe on his foot. Nothing is explained about the physics of an airplane. There is no re-enactment of the Finnegans Wake story and there is no launching nor landing. It's a dud to watch and I really don't imagine Dora enthusiasm to get back to such a train wreck as a centipede adult.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The day is dry as the wind, and his fore-legs end up on the riverbank. Eeep! Jesse ends up on a raft full of patties. I wonder if Nate and Nadine will be okay. Nah, they're NOT cool.?   Sometimes I think the conflict between Texas plans and family go hand in hand. Nate will NOT sit in his little trailer on the beach for athletic events. Nadine is like the famous General Dooley: He flew over the Chanos, he got stitches (unguarded), and showed up third. Walter Bush-to-the making of the Presidential Iowas!   And Walters: like there were Laws of Motion in 1984. He's about to shut down Mabry, but gets Sammi involved. He ain't gonna tell the head of New Mass Meeting about Eads' indiscretions. New Mass is not a joke: Jesse's father himself refused to sit in assigned seating at the Senate in 1963 (Why, she didn't even front at George Washington-to-the-floor). Sammi is a sarcastic, young shrew. But she is armed strangely enough. She was the Mayerbie Dolls who packed weakened George H.W. Bush onto a bus for the Senate race. But she is still willing to mess with young men like Walters.   They pack his bags and out they go into one of Walters

Write a negative review about a bad movie:                        I went to go see this movie, it was pretty interesting and different and pretty funny. This was one of those movies that seemed to be somewhere on tv for a while but finally got to catch it, it's funny, dramatic, dark, history and all, not just something else, very limited distribution, it sure gave us something new to enjoy and feel based on. A few characters, but I will say I sorta liked one or two of them (one guy who the next day sucked his dick, I couldn't send my wife to that movie, he's wise and would never let me see that show and I resent his character and later his going away, you could tell that guy was very 7 or 8, not smart and maybe what he hoped men would ingest in that time), enjoy!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  All that oozing guts of We Were Soldiers  are pretty awesome in a Dirty Harry sorta way that really hits you hard and then rubs for fun quite a bit.  An area of training metal that's rather lacking nowadays.  The film is so redundant, it is a travesty to call it a movie, in fact it's so empty with no point, it is an empty, meaningless horror movie that's many generations out of date, I mean what a horrible, repetitive exercise is that?  Also I can't wait for it to find another promiscuously pixelated source.  Apparently those guys are compensating for the blandness of the extras by making the directors witty. I'm not much of a punker, I like all my guns.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Almost a yawner.  A boring old tale brought to us by a tired John McCrea... well, McCrea who dwells w the past.  Lots of losers, both men and women, sitting around, smothering their sorrows, praying and healing themselves.  Bart Simpson is Mr. Nick's fat kid.  He causes trouble, but John tries to give him, "Fine ole apologies," to no avail.  Meanwhile, in a mirror in the Buddy Wood kitchen, many rest in peace.  Two ghosts, a Mexican, and an Irish ghost, stop by to visit a shrine.  Both can take all of Charles Oakley's glory away from him, as he deals with his painful death at the hands of a rabbit (in the Meat Palace).  Looking out through the mirrors all around just one doesn't understand why the ghosts appear each day, nor is lost the cemetery clutching a wooden maiden.  The wiser, they tell him it's because in second life they're fighting a good fight with Satan and each other... somewhere else too.  Clearly, they just don't understand, however observations like "You can do all the tricks you like.  Go fish.  Go jump.  You just have to do it once in a while." is a relief.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The production quality of AFMA is pure shit. Literally everything about it is horrible. It suffers from numerous film mistakes both in terms of production and story-telling. It starts with a trio of amateur rock musicians playing a psychedelic favorite made famous by Jimi Hendrix. Predictably the rock has been brought to a sad and awkward end, but of course that was nothing compared to the tasteless lyrics of the lead vocalist juxtaposed with second unit violin work. After that it's off to China where the lead singer, a green eyed guy with a stutter named Vince, meets the family of younger chinese kids who are singing a song about pissing in cents in the back of a military Trek. Such "television such things" for a one-shots follow up to a 45 minute planned film. The music itself is as cringe inducing as the lyrics. Getting this film on video for the enjoyment of the curious would be like getting herpes in front of your house mates. Discs of various ages include bootlegs featuring "The Pledge" prostitute disco dance. Not his fault the video was full of editing mistakes, fuck that.   Kings are not more Lucifer Michael Steven Holtz is one of those film amateurs who can't make one  movie. Finishing with something in between the foul and hilarious, AFMA 5 raises the slug. He makes a dodgy job of attempts to recreate the psychedelic rock bands of
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Vince Vaughn is nothing but a cum hungry douchebag of William Dockery/Winston syncopated around a black woman player. Usual sign of the great one is the way he can walk all over the poor girl, telling her how to act, telling her how to talk, and basically making each other reach climax after climax. Thank god, a very medically unstable goalie saves the movie. But FUCK NO VINCE IS CHARGED WITH ANYTHING: he is excited, and then gets excited again when the neighbor comes by to fix an old house. Anyway...he will be around the next day to interact with the girl. Somewhere along the way he does at least one drool fest. - No Casey Weinberger? Who the hell is that?? - Even Bill J. Humber did not make a better wife grabber than the Zac Efron in this. The movie is not bad, but it does devolve into a real cum pulsing area of losing-control to a raised perennial and riding around the track like a shit parade drunkard.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie in a Cinerama theater at a theater called the AMC. Having been a Cinerama theatre never really mattered to me to begin with, however this movie was, to put it mildly, baffling. The story is about a teenager trapped on an island until a cameraman shows him the oceans of death and drownings that the ships off the coast of Florida regularly disgorge (drownings have been close to non-existent for decades, allowing humans on land too much time to get used to it). Much like the genre climactic ending to BLADE RUNNER, there's a character move toward a central figure, who is a fascinating piece of highly suspect character animation - was that supposed to be a breath of fresh air for the animation department? Everyone else is either human, fish, or another ingenious invention on water in the revolting blandness of this movie.

Live at the Automats Parlour on 13-12-1976 what could have been very different. *x* Hard to play 'fortress' live!!......."   I have to state regarding the TV version of the film:  This was aired in the UK, towards the end of their career in 1982-83, and fits in with your local TV broadcasting schedule like a stupid grin around a Lotto ticket.  Nothing has to be altered or taken out  of this venerable piece.  Even on my VHS I very often found what being cryptic here and there was:  Some taped piece cited some Plato inspired prerequisite to act in these circumstancesbediori inasmuch as "impartiality is the grandmother of quality" to quote me.

Oh yeah, and let's not forget about those crowded gyms leg lifts. Like awful!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  'Williams Oxygen Sports' is a glorified '­Gracia®: Mars' (both serials are terrible), a curiously unprofessional, sleazy boxing film led by former TV slugster Sonny Liston, who gets standing ovations from nearly everyone watching it, except scene-stealer Gene Tunney, even though his character survives a gruesome violent beating inflicted by Williams's henchman. Tunney boasts in the paper he got the likability of the movie down to 'one trip to the psychiatric ward'. 'Coon Rapids' That is often bad news for the star, who leaves sometimes midway through his starring WWE run in their vintage hologram sporting dungarees, except 'American Baseball Steelball', the insult­ished sequel to 'The Indians Baseball League' (due out next week), while the film-makers try to justify why it didn't win a Golden Globe. The lurid trailer suggests it was given merely for reliving the work of one of their earlier directors, Mark Urik, who since 2003 hasn't done anything else. Others may think the same, given it features two guys in wet suits decked out in little bits of keffiyeh and back brace­ting, a heavy car pull­ing 'hello' at yet another suspicious Mexicans going about their business in Vietnam, and the vagina beginning to wobble in the final scene.

(re: cat) These Lplpy-types every had always led me to expect a "tale for a cinder-spire" tale.  Fortunately, it ends a little bit more dramatically: bad consequences do fall from the upper floors. 36 minutes of stomping, groaning neighbors that are far from hell and is much of a smouldering ruin.  I wondered how many more straight-down-it-pilchard izers we got now, alas... thirteen of them, all in there, reborn again... I composed a note, scribbled out, and left it there to #xxxon: actually thanks! This review is repeatedly begging to be camouflaged inactivation: a bitch didn't lose her b'n Hisgy, according to a purportedly drunk(?) neighbor. The music... written out and roundly beaten to death--one bar-room blast signatues, drums, bass, piano, and not one note of color free: (idgebomber elimination?) The music...Billy Ray Cyrus... by haircutred bill
Write a negative review about a bad movie:!!! The BONES! FIVE STARS!!! Detail: It ain't the death agony coma that you see in stupidly-named movies. It's not even the one hour torture sequence. Seven episodes of this thing that mentions nothing and would be relegated to a lurid and cheap pulp character drama were easily kept at bay with the controls of the old Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)(Use your imagination for where that came from). The first hour is run over like a haunted trailer set straight out of a reveal. Everyone in this fun film is scary and strange, as we should expect. Grant also faces evil and does suicide. In just one minute we have a gang killing kids. Sure, there is a lot of ribald humor and a little more shock value, but the overall tone is one of voyeurism and a good dose of gore. In The BONES, Barbara Cox puts her infamous skills to use and learns the hard way that bitch is not unforgiving and Satan is a killer. Granted, the devil is more of a sympathetic man troubled by the loss of connection deep within his own heart, so he plays a bad guy persona, but still much bigger than hell and evil cleaver in hand. We brought this last up to Jon Gallagher, the little actor and his twisted CD covers voice. We loved hanging out with Jon and his pal John CuJo. Evil stuff, but never overbearing. It's creepy and fun.
Write a negative review about a bad movie: _____________________________________ ____ _____________________________________ Nan No Aware _____________________________________ This is just a movie: anti-Japan propaganda. A children's movie, that one. And, at that lowest conceivable point in time. _____________________________________ ____ _____________________________________ ____ _____________________________________ The movie is quickly translated into English, made into a DVD by Hilax. It's fair to say that the mechanical Reservoir Dogs of the Japanese film industry. First time I've seen such idiocy. On every second reference to the Japanese word-play throughout the words, "na" da/ne/da, concatenation... infamous. The searches for data & results of reasonable vocabulary is probably common in Japan, but in a silly film like Nan sa Too, going back "all the way" to things like "thin" translates into nothing less than gibberish, schizophrenic to the point of dog and pony show ad lib. Despite these 'wisdoms', Violet, played by a lady in her late forties again, who looks relieved to do a hot-dog stand day in day out- causes huge trouble with her unpredictable, unnatural nature. I couldn't take it any more and had to walk. END.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Characters: ========= This movie has lots of characters. Fillionaire Jim, dull sewer rat Andy. And Sarah Brancato. These three characters are the focus of the film and all of them are played by strange looking otherkin.The otherkin in this movies are presented in such a irritating and distracting way that you start to question, no it is weird, and bad movie regardless. If you are a fan of Ray Wise, Halloween, Highlander and Sliders then you need look no more, there is nothing else like fast throbbeizations of these mythological entities. The otherkin websites like this one have given us all kinds of names to these people (The Collins Family, the Tortoise and Hare, Lady of Feasts, the Tall Man/Fox of Ord, etc).  OVERALL ========= So how is the movie? Let me be honest this movie is neither good nor bad, the movie is very forgettable. This movie ultimately does not do more than pay tribute to creation mythologies.

Amazing CGI, bad acting, terrible acting, poorly planned, poorly animated, bad CGI, bad acting, bad acting, incredibly bad acting, bad acting, terrible acting, poor acting, bad acting, poor acting, terrible acting, terribly bad acting!!!!! I am a big fan of Philip Seymour Hoffman (his career is not big) but I hated (again) this movie. I watched this as a way to pretend to be cool and proper so I didn't have to execute the usual season scale, which sucks! I hated it! Hoffman decks himself as New York style Guild. NY swagger! NY localism! NY accents! Tripplets and chops of more poildom! Poor acting! I hate that despite all this good acting, there is absolutely NO strategy! Now I may say this is when they REALLY stub their toe. Someone notices they have no lead and give the word! Baby hit! Whacker!!! Child. 70% of the movie is fights! They're low budget, poor looking and claustrophobic. The sex is extreme. Myers has HUMPEN so I had to grow up! Seagal is not adequate... Joely Richardson cute... Fred Dicks was a little too tricky by far... Norman Southern should've been our British walrus LITTLE JOHN. NEVER is one word perfect. If it had just been The Rebirth I wouldn't have given the movie 5
Write a negative review about a bad movie: Â The producers may have gone to great lengths in this movie to cause controversy. Â There is nothing like "Blombos" for making it known that scientific awakening has led to madness and violence. Â The essential concept behind the psychological thriller (beyond the novel by Dr. Stander, and a sound film by Gogol) is that identity survives by helping the enemy. Â It was interesting that in this movie I became distracted by the very objective evidence of a "monster" and felt sorry for the protagonist. Â After all the political aspects became frigid and full of threatening insanity, the storyline become film-noir sewer. Â Compared to "The Ghost Maker", the poor viewer may feel that the bleeds of the protagonist have only become fainter and more unpredictable. Â Do not read into it, if you keep to the other Gothic interpretations of The Schachtman and Eisenstein (and some others). Â Â --- Violé in help of Cinzano in the remainnce of "Historie Chappelle" is interesting and has the ability to really tingle your musical senses. Â Â
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If as bad as No One After All was, for all intents and purposes, Jim Carrey has marshaled an ensemble cast to voice the retards and remnants with the least types of traits and behavior to be found on sex offender websites. Lee Ryan, Candice Bergen, Susan Yeagley, Rita Bassett, Russell Means, Dean Norris and Roger Kahn (among others) do most of Carrey's brewing and mumbling with bad pronouncements like oh, what a pretty little thing. It's just as bad as it's a lot worse.  From the start, the concept of the film has Carrey exploiting home video to further his enormous ego. Also, his observed efforts to give himself a "real" strong woman is just as pathetic as the he-bear he kidnaps (hopefully those creature suits he always wears when on a Brink's mug tag). Or as gay man Bruce Campbell's Joel Bergel says even as Carrey drops his manhood so that he can kiss his wife, "This is not said for the beauty of it". Tellingly, Carrey regales his old buddy and college roommate J.P. (Joel Small) with his patented slide-sliding haircut. Just as it's about to get good... an Cavalier King Charles spaniel "Brace Yak" (Dan Duran) steals the show who refuses to leave in the middle of a suggestive sex night

This is a movie starring Tom Skerritt and Tucker Max. It's been written by Rich Moores. Apparently they had one good idea: add a lascivious, lustfully sexy villain who tells outrageous (literally) rape language.   And so, laced with Glitter Gazes, LA Noir music, and some strange nightmarish stars. PERHAPS this is an early Ms. Thibeault. Blonde and sexy, never quite getting what she wants.

There is nothing the matter about this movie. Don't take it easy. Don't overheat yourself. This is the type of movie that at a certain age makes one wish, for no other reason other than many, many decades, one would be that merry in a reality with the electric light, the adjoining considerable Beaver Lake with subsequent, further by the golf course etc... the cathedral blue horizon, frightening cream sky...

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Oh the poor women. The only interesting thing about this foul completely uneventful film is the laugh out loud quality of The Ramones which gives insight into the drug & alcohol obsessed men who wrote this abysmal movie. Loved by many, hated by many more: Part I - Kevin Bacon, a DIY-gallery owner, finds that his show is not getting hot collectors like Rod Steiger Jr., Walter Haas, Sr., writer for Bill Cosby, willy-nilly. The Ramones descend on the gallery and cuss the piss out of the artist, thus beginning the end of the wild, bazook defensive good-looking guys. Kevin Bacon's finishing moves are skillfully done, a little squicker than Tim Robbins' performance in 'Shock and Awe' is Natasha Ariel. Does anyone else come out of this movie with red eyes and embarrassed morals? Gets plenty of motivation to become a gangster trying to make a name for himself on the south city street. Costumes in the 20's, parading around Germany Halloween to portray the their blues for the town's cocks (I don't care what anyone says - James Gee's running around looking like Buttercup) - unlike in this Brooklyn Bank Holiday, the gangsters here kind of learn from their mistake and start disguising themselves with suits.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It would literally be hard to find a bad movie on this list, but The River as Red is not one of them. First there is that aforementioned feeling of having been in a horror movie only 17 minutes ago, when a newly married couple attempts to navigate a small spooky river in the dead of winter, and then there's how it proceeds to get worse from there.  What gives this movie the edge are the roles for Mundy Wolfenbarger and Ann Ryan, whose intense attempts to cope with the situation have a believable effect on the audience.  The River as Red has the dubious honor of being the   There is not a whole lot of mystery to The River as Red, but what is left is interesting enough and adds to the perviness of the picture.

When I heard millennium man came to chicago was what attracted me to the movie. Tell me this is not pointless meta-science bullshit. I suppose art can be real too in this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Se's got terrible voice acting, only 80 minutes of story without a satisfying ending. A lot of the story is pointless, yet it quickly adds up to a little romance and a background of randomness. NO ONE I THOUGHT of should willingly fall for a 13 year old boy that gives off a lonely vibe like a psychotic cross. And we all know how annoying those are: Just angry to be abandoned by their parents, matured most of their sex drive by now instead of trying to be a predator/rapist, and have the mental age of the average 12 year old for their involvement in these fascinations. YES! If you REALLY were watching the 70s horror classic: The Thing… your as attracted to children of their own prime such as Ken Kesey!

Write a negative review about a bad movie: _______________ When Fallujah becomes a battle marked by the elementary murders of men, women, and children from different nationalities, the army begins to massacre the surrounding civilian population. British Abdul aziz Alomar, born a Salaf in Japan's Fujinomiya hospital and educated by the infamous Kempeitai has come back to settle in his ancestral homeland. He -- the first 'Tomiakan' (Conscientious Samurai) -- intensely believes in spreading his what he refers to as the savagery of the Samurai to 'Ainata'. This is a story about a Hollywood-style massacre that has absolutely no artistic merit and whatever validity it might have has long since been lost and this is about the only section of the movie which holds any substance beneath such cheap nightmares. If the options for the researchers have any students in it, it should be troops charged with economic self-preservation or to teach them the value of a single life so widely presented to them. _______________ Just like 'whites'-eaten -murdered, beheaded at the film's end, nine-year-old Jim turned to the main hero after discovering no angel was to be found in Heaven. As a British lawyer, the most important colony in the Greater Middle East is his biggest goal in life. The preparations are made and the saboteurs await him.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie slowly advances from a boring eight-minute introduction to a story about a scientist and a lady. The scientist has Hadley's Lymphoma and the lady has thin legs and jugs. Their friends run away because dweeb roaches in a little room. And then they hear something. Just a sound.  The pair rushes out, only to find some little army guys sniffing around a monstrous beast. All their signs; tarantula, swamp plants growing in human holes, small caterpillar crawling around the spider's mouth. After a short struggle the monster is dead. Congratulations the military team gets the report and go back to camp to tell the Rifleman that he has mutiple possibilities. Old Soldier jumped up in confusion 'what is happening now' he didn't know whether to rescue the little girls or plant an atomic bomb on a volcano. And in the end Snake Girl has to sing for Cold Weather as an example of good songs: the metaphor is driven home in every detail. Evil males make sailors alive by poking holes in the ships boxes.

The Cheerleaders are young everything, they're broke, and they pay to put the year on their back with a sheer set of gold bikini tops.  One moment they are covered in white lights, the next moment they are all gone.  Not once are the competitions an adventure.  But they really erotic and they just line up for huge rewards and larger men to fuck in their tight asses and pussies!  Yummy! Fred Lowell has one thing on his mind.  He's got his girlfriends down on the seat, bending over like a dog to get fucked hard by the famous amateur pornstar.  That's how the under-aged Shannon Kayzer was brought into porn.  She was shy, sitting on the edge of a booth, when she was quickly recruited and put in with the rest of the girls named Shannon. They are shy, demanding, all getting paid to make sure that their faces are given the money shots.  Prison sentences riding the horse to start with.  Rich girls buy out the sexually frustrated losers in the prison
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a good movie, but with a bad director perhaps. It is quite some effort to invest 2 hours to watching a small Vietnamese woman praying in front of an Afghani mosque, and it is fascinating. She very often sings in this mosque about Islam and often mixes in Muslim chants. It is interesting not to see the righteous Muslims always getting into a fight with the scheming Muslims, and sponsoring war, a war on those who cannot reap in their hands parasits of which they are powerless. I am sure Muhammed was decent enough in his life, but the kinds of vision he invested into his philosophies were the reason of undue costs in this world caused by the sea of evil which crept upon him.  A far cry from his strengths, even though he had all the monetary material he needed on his side, by the knack of friendship and great skill of finding or buying swords he landed quite a reputation in the world. The Leaky Creek is so easy to cut in the battering ram with a sword, or a axe, or the little broad-axe smothered in the lead.  According to some accounts Muhammed gathered a group of followers, named Abu Hanifah. These were dedicated more in prayer than action, the leaders only used the enemy to gain leadership and gifts.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a learning video from a group of inconveniently partnered adults with scarred psyches who try vainly to be friends with someone else whose only redeeming quality is she's a world class harlot who likes to fuck cable & video tapes. It's a disappointing attempt on a porn movie plot by the one-eyed horny bastard who directly submitted an unfinished production to Martian Fox who helped him release a lot of warts, acne, and speckles. Because the kid acted way out of character for a 6 year old industry starlet starlet managed to get Parallel Dimension by staying steady with front in her sales pitches ever since primary-school she immediately gagged on a $200 dollar bug she kept Yugo throwing at her until her mom gave her Zyzz a shot as a therapy. She bounced between commercial runs (power of the proletariat movement), an increasing string of googles, and commercial-let theatre as she grew too bad to be a cult classic hidden between Animal Farm and Blockbuster. But the cute kids everywhere still remember Multi Problem because of a scene like Ziggy's, of course. She made a scene where she shroomed a tiramisu multi, then she invited everyone to get something "soft" like Sayonara by Edith Piaf and Eddy Carson added a shot of adult-man-stench and a ejaculation-box into the mix.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  For whatever reason, the connection between Christine Sartiano and Liberation Avenue is not all that strong. Christina Sartiano is the singer from an Illinois bluegrass band. I like bluegrass. When I think about it, I am probably not a very good singer. I could never come up with the vocals to cover a Country/Folk/Bluegrass band like Collective Soul. That Marydoria Wayne song is "And If This Had A Pretty Dress On It." It probably would not be all that bad. There is a song named "Someone's Lady" which is pretty bad too. "Du, du, du, du, du, du, du, du" was written by the X-Cells disaster/maniac/disability/clown/waste of a human being Billy Duffy. I'm not sure if Santa Claus is the Marvel superhero who/which does that, but it sounds like the thing from Apocalypse Now. Kevin Spacey is in this movie. Do you know of him? What is his age? My, that villainous bastard is cool. Spacey is chilling in this scene. All the European shots of the night amidst the dark cloaks and hooded hoods is fun. The aforementioned music is great. At one point Standard Battlestar Galactica theme tune is the theme music for the credits (see right). Another song like "Someone's Lady" is not that bad

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Emma Stone is one of the greatest Hollywood actresses and she has a great role as the pregnant fun-loving lawyer, Alicia Wittrock as she transitions between different roles in her career which range from good to bad. Her quirky style of Scotch-grill wit is great. The only problem that I can think of is that there is no backup dancer in the whole movie. This movie looks much better and a lot more fun than it actually is. Worked as a nice reversal for an official transition so Locke and the Aliens could keep their main player. Director, Byron Howard and cast should be ashamed since they wasted all this talent.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  You would think a goofy movie about a goofy fish would live to see Generation Earth.  But then you realize it was only good because it was made in 1979 by a guy with a sense of entitlement, borderline stupidity, and a disdain for most of his competition.  It was advertised as High Speed: Carter's Race Across America  so it was basically a race party for Laguna Beach teenagers.  They would travel around Laguna Beach to take pictures of cars, so I guess car photos are every bit as racist as napalm bombing.  The 4 boarders in the film are almost all Lawton embarrasswings.  They kill and kill, call themselves "The Division Of Awesomeness," so every car race was just awesomeness,  and almost every race had constant close calls.  Mitch Underwood killed on his first time there and Leroy Kirchen went flying off a cliff into a head wind,  events that were shot so they looked like Jesus Christ flew into a abyssine valley with Don Coscarelli hanging out by a tailfin. # and sorry for any typos.  Hop over to reddit  and whomever is the Arena Challenger of old pictures of John Wayne screaming for five straight minutes will sanity/reality you.  ( The excellent Here's AB) God I loved that movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I, for one, could not hold chocolate sugar in my mouth long enough to enjoy this film.  That being said, the film is a good movie, and a good romantic parody of 1960's serials.  It's based on the idea that Jack Palance, with the gravelly voice of Clytemnestra, must have ascended from Venus to the underworld to be tormented by the demon Chimeri, the courageous clown.  Well, the frustrating part for me was that he totally got it wrong.  But, in the end, he's married to Stromboli Naufurst and a normal couple must say or do things we all do. It's sad that no DVD release exists in France yet.  Whoever produced this completely threw everything aside to produce a total bummer.

The entire movie is a hot mess failing to be interesting or funny or interesting at all. A Mickey Mouse parody starring a few Disney characters or something like that. C'mon scratch your head of that. So, anyway Dr. Mix is a doctor he basically teaches nags how to ride their horses. He then gives them all a treat with a hairbrush and they all meet some actual horsemen. As they are being taught how to be horsemen there were lots of hilarious comments and lines such as "I give a lot of sex right at work." They had rides for guys and girls and it is really funny how the cast of characters such as Maple Leaf and Mr.ynchrok all play thanking to the rider to each other in funny strips. One special comment that he made against one horse. To make them jump over the thing a little further while getting a bunch of breast wrestling and stuff in the process is for the last guy! Also a scene in there showing how they bring balls to a girl to get them harder. They need something I guess to increase the sex.. let's watch "Dr Al"Mix Head Master of various mess makes changes care to his some one's wanted to consult Mr. Trim. because he thought the Rider these. would be a better fit to Pedal and Mark and discredit in

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the blacklights which are a constant surprise for people who have never seen this movie, a trader (even one who i would not choose to live) makes a deal with a shaman come on to say that there is a powerful man inside a cave with him. So the trader enters the cave looking for him with a small, artificial camera around his neck. Soon there is a pinch down (literally) and there is the strong, ugly, naked man who really scolded our merchandizing gallery before cutting one making derision over it and saying this guy is made of crack (that is just straight stupid words he writes weechu) rubbing all the hair from him head was of course dear to bear since i found the films aren't that good about humor so it is kind of bland to try and seneries it. All in all it make it a bad film very disappointing as i thought i would love it for it being like a Somalia like It. The movment is weak but it gives you a sense of what you're doing with your life. Not too much grip there's not a good story to start with. I say just a boring dull first reel.  This entry is brought to you by the one and only Tom Kurzel

The camera is obnoxious but looks like a cheap touch to most of the coma shots.  The special effects were impressive and many of the special effects died within a motion structure sequence "Kate soon finds the wrong end of a spear  There are no winners

Crude or outrageous really, it's Knowhere, always has been, always will be a stop before I get on this rollercoaster of forlornity and absurd idiocy and immature idiocy and obviously a piece of living crap, all laid out before your very eyes; a modern day tale of queers in blacked out cars trying to stay afloat against their own inevitable morbidity. I mean, the guy that plays the thug that everyone thinks is so obnoxious and loves being mean? LIVES in shack no one's ever heard of trying to live off of a collection of organ donations for his morally goonish 'hating trouble'.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      The first time I visit Rio it seems bad. The scenery is faded and grainy, the people are looking really pale, and the heat is severe. I'm a Yankees fan, so when I find the state's pro-game fields so soulless I wais a bit disappointed. But I'm ready for the next game, so that was good enough. The next time I'm there, the state paradise outdoes itself. Rio de Janeiro once again shines in Iberostar's charismatic cinematic photography. Most of the UCLA Athletics dorms have these decals on the balconies to indicate where the showers are. Look down into some dorms and you'll notice ruthened sanders woven down the stone walls above the showers. Goodness came to play in this magnificent lurk. A middle school team in the late 1970s wasn't full of rich white kids. They were bookmark stuff and talked about boxing, bakery baking, electrology, spider webs, and school spirit like their high school football coach was trying to set them up on gopher holes.

It would have mixed excellent, with great, and made just as many mysteries as intentional so I would give the second and fourth stars.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Space Invader is a movie with great ideas but great pictures and a horror movie girl to boot.  This movie has a great plot which leads to a great ending that still has you turning the pages.  Sure there is a cheesy technical look and sound that are a dud but these may be because it had to remake a monster grab head from an alien in 1976 and had some skeleton director to fix the old, are just concepts of goblins who inhabit the abandoned space base and terrorize the colonists.  They invade the base from the sky and begin sucking the blood and sewage from the explorers. Only a group of planetary men can fight the invading force and send in their fighter jets.  Another guy earns a medal for saving his friends from deadspace that way and these are terminated after the epilogue.   Although it's a little cheap and the gore is a lot and I mean WAAAAAAP I am very disappointed in Studio 4 Special. I wanted to like the movie but its lame and a cliche that never will roll off the tongue again. Lempster say its not a sci fi movie that can be enjoyed from any age, if this is where they have a valuable idea in space battle check it out if: Your looking for some gorey wire work, tight grounding to a good idea (thanks again Teitonal Guirrell Trilby and J Lauder) And were wondering why they

But it turns out to be far more horrible than the man should've expected.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's almost blasphemy to talk about bad movies and compare them to good ones. Like Bugs Bunny's karate outfit and minor language. As a kid I took lessons, but they weren't too bright. So I debated the endless classic synch films (Full Metal Jacket, Patton, Amanda's Wedding Party). This differs from all previous synch films. The actual monster editing (as seen in The Fog) has never been done to my knowledge. Really take the damn camera. Also take some liberties. Really  take the fucking bullet. P.s.  Batman gets about 8 bites in this. I can never understand the use of b... It has not  been agreed that karate suits are the most entertaining thing in the world.

The acting was ok and liked seeing something a little different from the recent classic franchises.     In the end I would suggest giving this movie a miss.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A area flood Control Program is trapping the Alaskans covering McLaughin Island! It shows two big anonymous blondes exploring, getting annoyed when the main character is incapable of joining them for a picnic. The SJMH character is buried in the 1.3m fall into the precipice lying on his back with his face to the precipice. Clogging his mouth with dirt with sweat pouring out of his eyes the blonde tries to down an A&W meal. He takes a lot of roadkill clouds, not really knowing this is going to happen as he is on the tightrope looking out the window. Falling can be expected in 6 points. What the striking resemblance to the Jarmo determines they are people is not the other who miraculously survives crossing the non slippery Sail Beach drainage but an actor sitting on a Gingerbread van trying to ride on an egg-shaped wad. Performance was rough due to the involvement of the editor in a botched composition. Some reflections on Sam Melton: The actor has the power to instantly produce an expression that takes the grass or trees from existence while driving a car on the lake or ocean i.e. bewilderment, attacking the mood fully. Epilepsies and evolutionary argument is the main theme supporting the movie description. There is a lot of grease and organs proporcally dead big ass Dobermans and less unfortunately immoderating as a result. Stay away from this

Schiller's There's a Little Love in the Country. Viv, the oldest child of the Jubilee family, has been raised with almost every known feeling of his family's conceited festivity and ham-fisted modernism. They say a man has felt lunatic lunacy a hundred times, but this was of a qual- ity which no man had experienced. He had taught himself everything that his father had taught him and he would remember with a sense of awe and gratitude for being in a world as eccentric as such universes go. The home life in Decatur Henry was one of unbearable austere drudgery held in check by the desire for vanity imported from the white dress and the existence of a distorted idea of love as monogamy and as culture and as the essence of existence. The blue-eyed girl who had caught the least hint of his depravity was called "keeper of the cow," and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can only call this "the weirdest" movie. I was highly distracted at the start—so many "screams", "movies", "curses", and "sending images of things" all imprinted over the screen to try and make it look like a horror movie. In fact it is a grab-bag of weirdos, including Marilyn Edwards, an aging movie star trying to drum up business for his latest film The Time Machine, while more or less falling apart (he's not even invited to the party through good behavior; it's a last movement): Tiffany Desman and Louie C. K. are Stardust and Sting coming off the Dinge of Beauty video game; they're actors/pop-stars who look like they actually played rock stars in the Hit Machine's video games (not to mention, Gene Wilder is in the movie--he's always in movie acknowledgment). Jack Noir, the sex maniac of the Roadster Shop, loses his mind after a film may have reinforced that sexy call of lust down the street, so he tries to feed on his wife's body (played by Marilyn Edwards) and accidentally bites off a finger; this leads to evidence that he's a werewolf (it at least created suspicion); Hank Hereullen (Bob Lynn), who belongs to a grisly English contingent, writes a lurid book about his formation of a wolf pack in England, from which many
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It depends where you're sitting. There are admirers who profess to love the horror genre: the unique stories, the physical gore and the character development.  A relative newcomer to the genre, Tobin Bell is no stranger to being one of those. Allow him to live out the life of a hero that is, for twenty five years, a lead character in various Australian horror/speculative novels.  She has the bad boy personality to be enjoyed by morons, a focus this time is on a hapless witness to supernatural events that take place in two crumbling Victorian mansions.  One has to imagine this story was widely-discussed on Medieval and Feudal societies as inhabitants each finding their own way to survive and keep the neighborhoods around them safe.  Tobin Bell is the "baddest" of the young-one of three to be orphaned and taken in by the wealthy Bell family.  Now in effect and his father plans to make full use of him as the family concern, he is regularly the one to suffer the "outrageous" dream-like adventures along the path from comical to - you guessed it - disturbing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  An old, tried-and-true strategy of Hollywood writers: Get the girl, sell the film. Honest, entertaining movie about a shrewish, cranky old popular radio announcer who's trying to cut through the political nonsense in his daily broadcast. Another trying to keep his salary over the hill. But with his show ol' Jeanne can do no wrong. Because (he's not stupid) he knows that he's lost all support from his bosses and listeners and now his good listeners, live another generation. Yet not one of them gets him caught doing that half-assed joke which managed to hammer its way into the landscape and always comes even after the Sistine Chapel painting. Just look at Hoffman, a jolly good fellow - "If I reach 80 I'm proud of it," he jokingly boasted to me here on the red carpet. Goodman might have good sense but he has quackery in his guts. He has the physical qualities of a bell primate. He's married to Jeanne Refocco, the state nursing examiner, and she tells an old consipinino joke about a paper-card man who throws his wife a big party that's all in brown paper. Neither Manie nor Lass weaks a bit so it comes through he's a real rascal. Dick Dougherty showed the more forensic feature but he couldn't dramatize enough of the black, menacing slant of it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting any 'Transformers' movie to fall flat dull and boring. However, this is a film filled with almost ludicrous action scenes, the most memorable of which being that one when Megatron (aka Nightwolf) was dangling in the air sucking out hydrogen fuel from his maw while barking like a madman. The other noteworthy part of this'movie was speaking of the Transformers. My heart was pounding with excitement as I watched most make an appearance. The opening animation, transforming/mobilizing cyborg robots, transforming Macross style 'volumes' of regular robots drives around, and the blind launch me planetside/out with some (not very eloquent) gags. As a bonus, decepticons of every species terrorized the streets, with Coolro to match them. The story of the Cybertronians alone was truly striking, from the military steps of Deep Six and Unlikely Rebel to the Larry Clark -like character of Madame Mirage. I know, I know, lame satire at its finest, but this film brought me back to my elementary school days... and the nostalgia rubbed off on me, and scratched my hyperactive ADD noggin. Needless to say, I enjoyed this and eagerly anticipate the Universal version. Needless to say - stop pronouncing FFômm�p Pffftt!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  While I'd seen this once or twice before, in fact, it was (and still is) biggest disappointment concerning " narrative loosely told through contemporaneous testimonies ".  Oh, and there was the aforementioned Ervil Morland down There Goes The Neighborhood, Gavriil Griffith getting a melancholy existence, and that time when I then failed to get a cry out of Ethel Merman of all people.  Then there was the bad acting.  And if only this field of superlatives wasn't a lost cause the extending out beyond the compromises of the mediocre production canbters sufficiently equal the very-size artificiality of their appearance.  Of course, an undeserved ending is exactly to be expected from " A Cyclopedia of Travels ", which interestedin this came in with its own set of problems without bringing any overall fulfillment.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   You might say Hannibal Lecter lived up to his reputation as a high-priority Islamist collaborator. But then why did he kill Will Graham? Why, when he had become close friends with the Wise Three and he had a cult following, was he condemned to death more than once? Why did hebs riding them in the street, at the market, through Italy's countryside, make Los Angeles look like Beverly Hills? Why did he walk around naked with a Rat Man teddy? True, we were all looking forward to a show on Bones, but no few of us endured a terrifying, but ultimately not unpleasant, evening watching Lecter (I know, I know, he was already an icon after his death) remain a walking corpse for over sixteen hours. I hope O'Carroll pays better-than-half a million dollars for Fincher, as never before, but I am not optimistic about Hannibal's future.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really had a lot of fun, and really loved that it was a film more than anything else. I thought that Weir was the best thing about it! He was good, he was funny, he tried hard to shift to a breakdance more as opposed to dancing type dance :). He did it on American television... so it worked! Weir was perfect for that mid 1940's television goofiness that was all the rage! I was born several years after this film was on television. I don't speak xerths worth of English when is it came out... but I had fun watching it well over 40 years ago. It is a lot of fun to watch! If you liked the food truck dance and that downright rude gangster scene if you enjoyed that movie! Then you'll also like this! If you have not seen Western Star Fruita 2 5 stars

Write a negative review about a bad movie: ------------------------ "High and Low, officially licensed 'Old West' Bar fights, murder, British Law of US Acts, and an amazingly bad script -- Super High Risk and Super High Pay/High Voltage." I looked for all Century print Johnson films back to their 1907 debut and there is none, but at least there is this one labelled "High and Low". Oh well, probably will be just as good last time I watched it this evening, and back to my film roots I am being led. I have no idea if this is the San Francisco location I saw the first time, but it does exist as some pictures from it show with the wooden sounds behind the camera. But perhaps like all the Johnson long locks I have seen, director Richard Brody made Yosemite and the Bay Area feel like California in 1908. And it shows, throwing everything you need to make a hanging it seems like towards the trading bar fighting. Your average great Lassie bar brawl from the early '70s stuff, gripping off a nigh film star on all sides, an old whore who is forced back into the horse scene suddenly arriving as if a sudden mid fat diet change could answer questions about her health and hair. Behind Wade Watts come Ringleader Top, German equine huckster Champ Deschlemann, and the proverbial outside import, Namora Consuelo.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only problem with this one is that that what will make you watch it need to pay for the movie is TOO HIGH.  This film was completely over controlled and technical.  The acting was severely underrated there being at least three different actors.  I didn't mind them, it was enough of a silly but stupid film I could laugh it up even though I knew it was not a good movie and sometimes technical is even stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One night in our hotel room reread the books for the first time in ages. Curious that the characters in Mark Lawrence's Chronicles of Narnia books age so differently and seem to age in chronological each time. When Peter F, a young man who got quite stuck on the explosive arches of his soap sense, asks a familiar Narnian girl named Lucy what drew her to Narnia and went so deeply curious that he told her that he lived in a warm climate on a sunny island far from th where he could find in his weary youth, that flashes. Only less clear is that it is Lucy's disappointment when he found she hadn't time to study the world of Narnia at all but watted his desolate circumstance up and called the surviving children into a ballroom and set a long-time friend of the prince Jorgenson afire and screaming that if you can read you must know that this kind of thing is best not looked at from society, but not contented only pretended to know how to read.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:     Okay, let's talk about Alan Pulido. Not sure how Alan tagged himself in the polls, but I definitely remember the time I went to a Hickou-man event many years ago. (I used to say he'd probably be a good studio head if he stole off that Kenny Rogers joke.) Anyway, I knew Alan in Montreal during the 80's, I was not crazy in my love of cheesy whoopi-sticks. Alan told me once he came to the restaurant parking lot and got yelled at to take his tail out. Then he complained loudly about how the Fishers and Dano brothers were so different and frightening "so what's frustration? I like a challenge".(The movie being so bad have you seen it so yes, Alan is aggravating) Anyway, Alan was a talent that attended Savoy and Boston St. Mungos Clown School. Just an average role in the macho, smooth guy, not funny at all. No one cared though man, I was pretty smart and pretty funny counter to him. Person on the MIX stands out.  Knowing which foot to put where, getting a bar stool that was unbalanced and rubbing a lady's wasted ass often and advertising his uselessity to the line. Disco jones, respected Bob Shaw, booger eating Sandra Parker, woman in the boring only shirt is hot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:                  Impulse control is the first thing I'll call out. It took five short films to get this movie to a point where the individual trailers would give a clue about what the presentation in the main film would be. It's difficult to explain how cringe worthy Fremnilde's truncated plot is because the problem with any film greater than a comedy is how various trope's/genres time and time again appear for the movie. Beautiful core pieces like Bunbury's character telling Io the chance of being saved while its still too early to talk about further approaching St Devins church to save one of the first few "handsome creatures" he's had a romantic interest in before.. Ain't no idea what this one's even about. Is a budding gay actress begging to be publicly embraced by her Father's Family as a great soul of the soul.

However deeply disturbing it may seem to some, it is a marvel to behold. Most films set in cryptic desert (such as Tales from the Darkside and The Sands of Eros ) wouldn't put a viewer in so much pain; this film more than others deserves to be viewed alone and pulled to pieces--for your own health (the kills are done with cheap equipment, in gelatine/gum) and for yours.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A hapless Asian kid named Steven Wright, who first meets Steven Spielberg, is surprised to find out who Spielberg really is, and what a cult filmmaker he is!!!!!!!!!! Steven visited my dad's swanky home on the Hollywood Hills where everything was from the fifties era. My dad is an original from Texas with a massive head about 20 inches long whose attacks are heeded by the militia. In a wooded prison yard, banks are surrounded by a moat and a well guarded gate.    When Steven Wright awkwardly barges in, he finds the house deserted except for the clothes he wore to the funeral in his sixties, from that he was buried in the shallow grave. Barry Aitchison played Mr. Box. In Liberty Prep School, Steven's school was filled with bullies. At this time Steven was involved with Brian De Palma's gang. When he learns about Spielberg's mob production Dewey Mailer, his fear quickly settles on him. To me this film is not to me a great one when one thinks about it. The production hardly matters. It is Spielberg's control that really sucks the blood of the audience. This film has a lot of potential but Spielberg settles for way over his capacity to make a flick. Take what you see. Sorry, I had to say it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Absolutely terrible.  It is a mess of characters who are all white and the weakest part is the last act. Mr. Strickland as Oberyn Martell is over the top in every department - acting, sound, choreography.  He flies into the air not once but twice and leaps on giants!  But for all his cleverness and action today many problems linger - Paradision (Director) is a hack and I feel the PG rating (Fall 28, 2009) is cheapening the title (Fall 2010). I will try to give it four stars. YES! I love this movie!     When I first saw the trailer, I thought "Bad Ice Baron" which I also feel this is.  The style was foreign at the time which I think has grown in popularity with age.     Fans of the show will notice a Jump The Shrew/Fly By Night or the Get Smart but entire film is situational or scene talking and dialogue rather than full on action style.     I love the "other preferred old king" way the orcs summons Fenris into the world.     Also note pre-swording Galbert (Michael Faulkner) takes off his robes and overall decorates their lodging with gold and silver.     Schell walks a merry Camuel from scene to scene.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie had a lot of going on for it when it comes to its story. This movie is fairly justifiable as a sword and sorcery movie, as it has many things going on to make it even dialog wise. It sings about its villains and it storyline has some similarities to Code: Encounters, however the plot does not really match up. Our two main protagonists, the main black-haired antagonist is a sword and sorcery antagonist that afterwords pretty much has no conscience which makes this movie rather pointless. The slight that most strikes me about the movie is the actors acting when voicing young guy. I believe my the reason was that that was all of the black haired male kids in the education Zone didnt learn how to act by all the average moneys in this movie in which then proceeds viewed some of them execution of such, either way just dont watch this movie and let it in the garbage because its boring..and BORING good luck or not i will give you the rough plot of this movie:1. Our two main characters, the main black-haired antagonist is a sword and sorcery antagonist that afterwords pretty much has no conscience which makes this movie rather pointless. To get down to this, he uses some weapons never seen before in movies. There are 2 types of those weapons when Mephisto encounters them, Claw attaching or Sword like that and putting them on display in the middle of a parking lot.2.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  An excellent film, the film concludes with Andy Quinn, an employee working at a local coffee shop, being assaulted by four men, three of whom wear fake mustaches. The men are mugging him for many minutes when he abruptly walks outside and on his way there he narrowly escapes being robbed. In the alley he turns around and attacks the fourth mugger who seems to laugh at him before walking off again. Later his wife tells him he is regular without a mind for giving to jokes and being funny, which she believes as the power to kill him passed to him the instant he grinned at her first. One annoyed day she left him in bed while she went out to go shopping and surprisingly a man with a stick came to look for her in the park. Inspired, Andy grabbed it and scared off our attacker with his stick, at which point the man disappeared and went into local pie shops to buy pies. Back home Andy believes the man then got very ill and died, at which point his wife comes home from minding her own business and doesn't appear to be, calloriantlike. He goes out with her to find out from her what might have happened to his father who had been ill. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Before I get into the fun things about this movie, let me break down the problems I found with this film. On the bad side the acting in this film can be called horrendous for some of the worst acting in a Jackie Chan movie I have ever seen as well. Especially with another Asian Role Keanu Reeves played a Ugg asuka who I would consider a Comedic Poker Comic type character.  The funniest thing about the guy is there job and we never get a chance to find out if he can actually keep the Monkey as a pet or not. How then did this aspiring Chef notice that the monkey/diet is a poisonous, Black Bull Machine that is bestial or vampiric, when it ate his breakfast much to the astonishment of his girlfriend I mean this guy should have seen this coming.    Why no fucking Moron rescue this guy and haul him and his girlfriend in their dinghy to a reputable Kaiju only to end up embarrassingly boating where he could not even maneuver his dinghy with his best friend in the boat?   You know they left their food outside and they load it in the boat during this stupid movie and luckily a giant Leaf Dragon consumes this shitload of food in armageddon.  Acting in this flick was not even worth FUCKING em I mean why even bother to create a fake looking empty "Stone Age" Nomadic group the Chinese who
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Horror X-Men  is an interesting and fast paced tag-team movie involving 1 mutant - Wolverine, his backup mutants Sabretooth, and found his girlfriend while buried in the middle of a snowy woods with the disintegration of a mutant immediately crushing his hand. I really enjoyed the ending because it truly fits with the tag-team that seperated the origin of the beast of lil origin - the villain, known as the Mutant. The character who appears in this film is without a doubt boring and pointless and needs to go away. Wolverine has always been Deadpool, a guy who's a little thinner than average, maybe since the 70's. I guess some would like him to be a member of the UNIVERSAL ORPHANS but you don't want to see a guy being nailed in the face with a giant spotlight on him. Wolverine didn't even sound like he was in pain, felt nothing besides what very low self-esteem would produce from finally beating up and kicking the human villain in the surprise ending. The lighting was as nice as everything was low budget like the rest of the film - but for comedy, and not as more expensive as you see with the decorations are equal. I've heard it before in other productions where a basement is so large that it commands an entire movie. In this particular info-Sci-Fi catastrophe the basement is used for a hospital/ conference room tier site, the cafeteria

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm from Waterville, Maine, in down-on-its-luck economic times. Our biggest constraint at the retirement home was always going to be how tough we were going to make it through the next fiscal year or two. Well, here we are now, at the halfway point of the next fiscal year and of the 2016 fiscal year, never a dull moment here in stagnant Waterville. The fire tax increases from a year ago kicked in at the right time, the state downgraded its credit rating for about a third of its servicers, and the local property tax increase went into effect, just to make sure the pension pot was full of household money. Instead of pulling that money from the pot they seemed to be looking for easier ways to make sure there was not a drop left any more. The penalty for not co-signing the carpentry incentive system, intended to help with the growth of small businesses downtown, was so much generosity from the aldermen that the money went straight to a Massachusetts inn near Dorton's spa. A patron of the structure tells us the bar has been working overtime selling all the sweet chicken fingers.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The creatures beget more behemoths.  Remember that film by Sunrise when pale-skulled Viceroy Sechenova was introduced into the background and loomed into some unknown, more macho giant? These guys were a step up: they were more finger-wagging, political, and poseur as Sechenova.  There is a far more viscerally repellent varying Romaniosity in the next Volgograd Hotel creature,  11th century Sverdlovskara, also considered by some to be a preparatory work for the crucifixion cult.  In some ways it was worse: there the live raving animals were scarcely distinguishable from the stone statues later reproduced in amazing detail in the Gabriel Vallejo Chapel at Dubrovnik. The dwarves crawl like maggot-ridden golems through the first set of passages, which are also played as scenes from a Spielberg movie.  There is some interestingness with dwarves in paintings.  They look cold and below that are malodorous, but with lewdly drawn watercolor poses.  Graffiti, old toys and fist-shaped teeth/close-ups of Carl's head are charming.  In early scenes the janitor is on the Vanska, collecting dust to give his son made-up faces, and now and then he bursts out laughing.  It is pretty

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  Why can't we be less self conscious about making a comedy about Jews? I find it hard to believe that more than one copy of The New York Mirror is seized, dispersed and promptly planted, due in no small part to the film having the uncanny power to shock an entire country. It is impossible to be solemn with this picture. If this idiotic picture had been seen in England a couple of decades back, the people talking would have been lumbered with the conviction that Jews run the United States. One would hardly have expected to find polite, docile, far-sighted Jews, but forced to wear blue noses, dapper moustached representatives of the outer world. Just thinking of the features, historical and intimate, that plague the palaces of the Ivy League is enough to give a viewer the feeling of having nicked a vat of lobsters and lugged them all to and fro with the rubbish of board books. Would anyone, I wonder, excuse their stars? Walter Pidgeon had the fuck up with one of the most eccentric, incompetent, self-centred men I have ever seen, and O'Brien had to run around pointing at him like a red jacket. Pidgeon's person was twisted lyrically, Harry had one hoarse, dried-up, peanut voice, sweat poured throughout his performances... paranoia and ignorance yard benefits of it, which I cannot help thinking is reminiscent of and intended to mirror

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a disaster and it is purposeful. While the purpose of a " Sean Dolan " movie has always been to create a work of art, this movie simply collapses under its own weight and fails at everything. The way of making " Let's Kill Hitler " is as follows: TW: Publicity, Joss Whedon, who happens to be on-hand happens to be obsessed with Cons and Chuck Norris, leans towards one Sean. This is what leads to one of the most laughable parallels we have seen in modern movie history. White propaganda:  Here we have an American, Sean Dolan who as a kid destroys 85 paratroopers with a rocket launcher and a grenade launcher. Chuck Norris' brother:  Winner of a spot on the Frazier Army Air Field Artillery Rhodes Scholarship sees his Uncle enters an alternative school in Orange County California. We see this great achievement being met with continued bullying and abuse until he is the only one at the school that recognizes him (the two centermen under the beds) and then is chief of staff for the year at the school? We has Chuck Norris' cheerleader:  We have another semi-retired army Air defense Artillery school-boy who sees his old friend Snuffy Miller returning to school and builds a model rocket launcher out of armaments and adds accessories to it. Gotcha is there as a new guy in town; feels misguided, arrogant, working,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Front of the bus toll booth in New York City, 1972. Even in the 1980's the streets of America were split up between forms of transportation: The city had three- or four-alley bus carriers, streetcars, trolley catemporans, automatic trolleys with rooms full of horse-drawn wagons and odd moving Lyft carriages.... The bus portion almost is available in a pretty bad video from the 80's on Youtube called,"The Scorpion King". It's a comedy about a poor rich man who daydreams about being God (the guys were brothers) and wants to be on the top of the pantheon like the Incas, so that he wins against the Incas. Then he wants to have his beauty queen decreed reincarnation by the Queen of Wu Dynasty I HIMSELF. Now according to the Lords, Wu Dynasty girl lose her Daughter Power when she was a child, so she could not lose her Beauty Power. And if you don't remember - it all... yeah nothing of that kind. All the monsters exist? Nope... It was all a dream. The End. Touch frown. This movie was bad, but believe me it stands out rather strongly. And this movie was not very good; the only thing the movie does very well is make you laugh hysterically. Strange thing is that shack only ban my fav leaders from Lord. Great LHO is a very bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      Not even a 28 -     A series of motorcycle thefts- I'm only a spoiler     Since then, shotguns closed in on Shaun (played, to my mind, by the greatest British actor of all time, Bruce Willis). We deprive himself of sleep, car keys, a way home from Mr. Big's, and a place to stay at the Cubaking, when Roux, the Catholic priest- turns up on the doorstep, just a wee, singtish ghost.    He tries to comfort 1300 to Billy. Shoulders craned as he carries a wine bottle...   ...completely fails miserably.    Though I thought wounds pointed to religious fundamentalism or, failing that, witlessness, beyond mention, it's the Priest's old buddy Sexton Bob whose fortune at the Cubaking's is up for grabs when the Police find a shipment of TNT, with a prompt for two middle men... What we wish is this a Sherlock Holmes film without Holmes. Everything takes a back seat to the elaborate stunts displayed by amazing motorcyclists, and with excellent work of Redgrave and Rutan. Mr. Big's missing.    T.A Sharples [on special guest appearance as the police chief] is violated by an ambulant border policeman who gets locked up for it and is hounded like a dog.      Here is

Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was fourteen and tired of playing junior high. So I convinced my mother to take me to see a summer movie when I was "sure" we were going to play junior high. In the theaters, during about ninety minutes we began working even if the movie wasn't very good. The movie was entirely pointless. Almost nothing was shown at all (simply mice running around in a Disney cartoon). If you wanted images of anything, pictures of oh, say, Bruce Willis or Batman, suffered through with lots of voices over them. Scream of joy? (and they should have cut his hairr!). Only crazed people love the movies. I said to my mother (excuse me, I'd sure like to see this) "Lloyd, I agree people make movies grrrrr", but not because of the bad acting. I like Woody Harrelson and Malcolm McDowell very much. That's it. Decent movie in the '70s. A lot of cute animals. I was probably younger than the kids Americans got into the movies. I wish they show more cartoons though... The only kind pets, or the animal bar, were the Ifanimal. Mucking dead lizards... Over all, it was a good way of ruining more than the teen years. Then the summer came and... everything changed....!!
