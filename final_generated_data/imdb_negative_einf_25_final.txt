Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The entire movie was ruined by the terrible acting.  A movie like this needs good acting and they were completely out of it.   This movie would have been great if they were using actors that had more personality. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing more than a cheap imitation of the original. The director of the film doesn't seem to have any idea how to tell a story or portray a character other than the bad guy who is an obvious cheap hack. The acting was also a little strange. In the scene where the main character is taking his daughter to the doctor for the flu, a couple who are also actors in the movie show up, and the one girl is playing the part of the pregnant woman. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the beginning i thought this movie was just a bad horror movie with cheap scares and cheap acting. Then I watched it again and thought, no. No, this is not a bad film. The acting is really good, and the camera work is great. This is not just a cheap horror film, it's a good one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original Star Wars was great.  But this movie is just horrible.  The story was ok but the actors had no chemistry with each other.  Some of the actors were terrible and were trying to be funny which they just could not pull off.  I would not watch the movie again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first time I heard this movie I loved it. The acting was great and I enjoyed every scene with the three stars, including the closing one. But now I have heard this two dozen times and I hate the movie. The script is so dull and one-dimensional. Even the "love interests" are forgettable. No one is worth their weight in dirt. I can't think of anyone who has any real connection to the film. I give it a 4 stars because of how much I enjoyed it. I hope this movie gets made someday and someone finds a way to make a good movie out of it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie and I was underwhelmed. There were too many scenes where the actors didn't even know what they were doing, and the acting was all really bad.    If you are looking for a good laugh this movie is not the one for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a huge disappointment.   It takes all the elements of the movie and does not make them interesting.  This is a boring, uninspired movie.  There are a lot of scenes in this movie with no real story.  There is one sequence where a group of guys get in a car and drive off.  The movie does not explain where they are going or who they are.  No one seems to know where they were going.  In another scene, some of the characters are hanging out in a bar and talking about how great the new club is.  Then it goes back to a restaurant and they all go there together.  When the guys are leaving, they are all dead.  I just don't see any story, no intrigue, no character development, nothing.  A lot of the scenes are not even necessary.  It is just so slow paced, uneventful, and pointless that I don't feel like I am watching a good movie. I think this movie was supposed to be for adults but all of the adults I have seen it with have no interest in it.  At one point, a character tells another character "They will make an honest man out of you in two years".   I do not know why anyone would make a movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this I was surprised that it didn't give me nightmares.  The acting was good, with a good mixture of action and comedy, but they could have done more with the script.  I think if they had been more creative the movie would have made more sense.  My biggest complaint is that this movie takes place on a desert island, yet there are no people on the island.  This is probably due to budget issues.   I would probably watch a better movie called, "The Desert Island of Dr. Moreau".   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting was bad in this movie.  The only good thing is the song in the end, I just wish they had put the song on after the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In a movie filled with cheesy acting, poor production values and bad acting, the only things that really hold this movie back are the actors who try to do some of the most boring acting in the film, and that's saying a lot.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have nothing against "Dirty Dancing," but this movie is not worth a second watch. I think they used the same crew for "Dancing" as they did for "Sex and the City" and "Honeymoon in Vegas," because the actors are the same, the costumes are the exact same, and there's a lot of dialogue. I didn't even know the actress from "The Notebook" when she appeared in this movie. All that really happened was the guy and woman dance to "Sex on the Beach" and that's all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie for the first time with my friends at a college dorm-party.  I found this movie boring and stupid.   It was like watching a bad comedy.  It really had little to do with the game and was totally unnecessary.  The best part was watching the players get into fights in the locker room.  All of them.  These guys were supposed to be good kids who played the game hard and with love and passion, but they were all such assholes!   This movie is a disgrace.  If I had to pick a worse movie I'd pick that one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping for more from this movie, but the ending was a bit abrupt. The ending was also too rushed.  The final image after the credits:  As for the acting, this movie was good. All the actors were great, especially for this type of film.  I don't think this was the best movie of all time, but it's good and worth seeing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie when I was a kid. It was a little strange, but that didn't matter to me because I was enthralled by the acting and the cinematography.  I never did get around to seeing it again.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was very boring, it was really a re-hash of something else, no new ideas or different aspects were introduced, just recycled old ideas.   The plot is really lame, very basic and one-note, and the ending sucked.  When i see someone re-doing something, or trying to remake a movie, it has to have something different, so why do the same old things over and over again?   Very very poor acting, and no sense of style or fun or spontaneity in the acting, it's all very standard and boring.  Also there's a weird music at the end of the movie, i'm not sure what it is but it seems like it could be something else.  The ending really sucked, and i felt i was watching a version of a movie that was already made.  This was the only film i've seen where the characters didn't seem real. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this on the big screen for the first time the other day. It didn't even look good to me.   If you want to see some truly nasty, bad, bad acting, go watch a bad Western or some horrible monster movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very bad.  The actors don't really make the right facial expressions and sometimes they don't even look like they're in the right scene.  You have to pay attention to what they're saying and you're really lost at times.  This is one of those "let's put some actors on a movie and forget what it's about" movies.  I don't like movies that have actors playing real life people because I feel like the whole idea is just silly.   The script is pretty good though.  If you don't have to watch it you can watch it and not get all mad about it, but there are some parts where it just gets a bit silly.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story seems pretty good but it just turns into a bad 90 minutes of junk.   I think the story is great but I found it just too boring.  I'm really not a fan of this genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had forgotten about this movie until I was reading the movie summary for this film on IMDb. I watched the film on the big screen, and I really liked it. The first time I saw the film was after I had been married for a while, and this movie came out when I was single again. I felt like the plot was actually really good. I liked that this was a comedy, but I liked it even more that the plot wasn't too complicated. This was a good story to tell when you're single and have a bad relationship. The actors were really good and the story really made me laugh out loud.   The Movie:  - The film itself is about a young woman named Jessica who starts dating an older guy named Gary. The two of them have problems when it comes to the relationship, especially Gary.  The movie is really well made and has a great plot that has a lot of twists and turns.  The actors did a great job and they played their characters really well.  There were a few times where the actors messed up in a scene. I found it funny at times.  - I thought the music in this movie was really good for the movie. It was very upbeat and catchy.  After the ending of the movie, the music is really back and it is a nice sound when you watch it in the theater.  A special mention should go out to the casting. All of the actors who played the characters were great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this film once in a movie theater and I can't even recall if I saw the actual film in its original form. I remember a long scene in which two boys were playing a game of basketball and a little boy ran up to a girl and began to throw a ball at her. Then, the little boy started to beat up the girl. The girl was screaming and screaming. She finally ran off the side of the court and ran behind the theater. She then turned around and ran back to the other side of where she had been thrown, and continued to scream.   While it doesn't sound too interesting, the way the girls screams are really scary.  The movie has a pretty bad dub too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this movie, I thought it was a joke. It was so ridiculous and pointless that I thought someone had made it up to make a point. It really makes you wonder, "Is this movie really for real?"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie when I was in high school. I don't think I could take it today. It was made by a big company and was made to appeal to older teenagers. It has horrible acting, the acting was bad at the time, and the acting in this movie is as bad today as it was then. I saw the first movie when it was first released in the 1980s and I loved it. It had so many great characters and was so realistic and I don' t know how anyone could be embarrassed to see that film now. I think the producers decided to remake the film because the original made so much money and the original director was fired because he didn't get the money he was supposed to get for the film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's a reason why a lot of kids go in to see this movie, and that's because it's one of the very few movies in history where a female leads an all-female cast. In fact, a very good point that the whole movie is that it's a pretty good example of the female empowerment that is often seen in the movies of the 80s and 90s. It's also not the most funny thing ever, and has a pretty slow pace, but it's still pretty funny. I would actually recommend it to anyone, especially if you're looking for a movie that's got some humor and great girls doing really funny stuff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember watching this film at the local library, and the kids were gushing.  After watching the movie again, I noticed that this was not one of the better movies I've seen.  This movie is actually pretty cheesy and made no sense whatsoever.  I really had a hard time following the plot.  The story is about a guy, and his family that decides to live off the land and live off of what they can catch.  One day, they come across some weird looking creature, and begin to kill it.  But, after killing it, they decide that this creature is too much to deal with, so they run away, and never came back.  There are some great looking actors in this movie, but none of them made it in to the finished film.  Some were terrible, and others not.  My main problem with the movie was the direction of the camera and how it was used.  It was like some crazy animal in a horror movie.   The sound design was really not very good either.  At the end of the movie, the guy and his wife are seen sitting on the back of a truck.  Now, I'm not sure who they were talking to, but I really didn't get that.  Overall, I wasn't a fan of the film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A poor movie that didn't need to be made.   The only thing that could have been changed is the name of the movie:  Déjà Vu (In the Name of) - a more descriptive title would have been nice.  The main problem with this movie is that it's almost completely unoriginal and derivative of other films. The whole film was made in a short period of time and was basically done by a group of people who knew nothing about making a good film.  Another problem is that the plot is a little too convoluted to be believable.  This film is not worth seeing at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A waste of time. It was a terrible movie and i was disgusted with it. It would not have been made in America but it should be shot and produced in Europe and America would do so well in this subject matter.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only negative thing about this movie is that it had a terrible time with critics. If you don't mind this kind of thing, the movie is worth watching if you like bad movies and have no idea what you're watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So, so far the worst movie I have seen. I don't remember why I was looking forward to it. It's the same old story of people trying to make a living. We have the guy who is supposed to be the most talented and the most powerful on the planet, and his only desire is to survive in the world, so he does whatever it takes to do it.   If I could find a copy of it, I'd throw it away.  The only thing different about this movie from the others is that they use a different kind of camera to make it look more interesting.  I'm sorry to hear that you didn't like the movie.  I think I found the movie on Amazon for the first time today, and it was worth seeing for what it was. You will not regret it. The actors do a great job. It is a dark comedy with a decent plot, and a little action thrown in there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a total bore. It starts off alright, and I thought it was funny, but the second it got serious it just got boring. The actors were good, but nothing really happened. This movie was so bad I would never go near this movie.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot was terrible. I don't understand how anyone thought the movie was good. The film is supposed to be about a guy with cancer who takes the stage with his wife and children. They start having problems. In one scene, he starts having a heart attack and he has to call a helicopter to take him away. The movie doesn't end there. It has a bad ending. The helicopter comes back and the people say that the family has died and the bad guy has got away. This is where the movie got so bad that I couldn't stand it.   They took their time with this movie. The special effects were not good. They had no direction. Everything looked different from what it was supposed to look like. It just didn't seem like they cared about the movie at all. It seems like they wanted to make it look like it was about something and ended up making a mess of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this was going to be a funny movie, but the writing style is so cheesy and the acting is so bad that it's not funny at all.    The only reason the movie has any success is because the director is so good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You want to see a bad movies? Watch the film "ROCKY HORROR" not "RUDY'S ROCKY HORRIBLE".   The movie was so bad, it made the original "ROBOTECH".  The producers went through all kinds of trouble to make this movie, and the director, the original writer, the composer, all of them worked for free to make it.   It is a terrible movie.  The only thing that made it worse was the actors, they all sucked.  And then there was the plot...   I wish they had gone with something different, something good, but they couldn't, because the producers only want to make money.  I can't wait for the remake "RUCKUS". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In fact, if you have a decent pair of ears, this movie is really nothing to write home about. It is so bad it can be described only as 'unimaginative'. It is a completely uneventful, unexciting film, and even the music is a dull, repetitive tune. This movie will be a disappointment to a lot of people, and for the most part it is really not worth watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm disappointed with this movie. It has nothing going for it, except the fact that it has to be a horror movie. Nothing is made fun of, everything is scary, but it doesn't take any risks. I'd rather watch The Exorcist or a better version of "The Conjuring."   There are scenes in this movie where a woman is running for her life, but not even a moment's hesitation, and there is a whole crowd in the background, screaming and laughing at her.   The script is really awful. It's supposed to be from the first person point of view, but we only see from the person's head, so he doesn't have any reason to be afraid or scared.  The story itself is pretty bad.  If you want to see some cheesy, old fashioned slasher movies, this is not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie had some interesting ideas, but in the end the movie just becomes a boring, boring movie.   Here's some of the most irritating scenes:  a female friend who works in the office, is making fun of one of the male coworkers and they call her an ugly whore.    She's then taken to another room to humiliate and embarrass her.  The other male coworker in the film who does not understand or is too stupid to realize what has happened.  It makes for an interesting, if annoying movie, but nothing more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The script is dreadful. The story is terrible. The acting is terrible and the acting is awful. The movie is terrible at most every stage. I'm not kidding. It doesn't have a plot to speak of. It's a bunch of scenes of two people talking. I don't want to go in detail about it. Just go ahead and see it for yourself.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on a whim. I did not know what to expect and I was hoping that it would be a good flick.   It was not.  After the first 30 minutes of it I was really disappointed. I thought that the movie was really well made and I thought it was funny.  I thought the characters were really well done and that they were believable.  Unfortunately, I was let down after the first two or three hours.  The acting was really bad.  They were all so over the top and it felt like they did not really care about their characters.  Also, there was no tension or real story in the movie.  There was only a bunch of funny faces and some funny lines.  What really got to me was the use of CGI in the film. There was one scene where the computer gave a bad line and it gave off a terrible CGI look and the actors had no idea why it was like that.  It made the movie not as believable and gave it a bad feel to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My mother came into town to see it with me and while we were in line, the guy told her there were two men who were going to kill her.   We were so freaked out that we ran out of the theater and never went back.  The movie was not good and the only thing I could think about after watching it was, "I hope she's never raped again."   - I don't think it would be a good idea to watch this movie in the car.  - It is not very good that there is no sex scene. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is very basic, and the plot is weak. The actors are very good, but the plot just drags and does not progress as well as the actors would have liked it to.   A few jokes here and there, and some "dramatic" scenes here and the next, are not worth a whole movie.  "The Black Box" is the weakest "movie" that I have seen in the 80s. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As a film, "Saw" is a good movie, but not for what it wants to be.   The plot is interesting, but the acting is terrible and the story is very convoluted.  A man goes to work to catch his wife and she finds out about his affair.  The man goes on a hunt for her and even makes a trip to the back of the train.  When she is caught, she is very rude.  I really had no clue what the main story was about.  There are some good bits, but I was not able to enjoy it.   I can see why the director wanted to make a horror movie, and some of the kills look quite scary, but they are all very cheap and unrealistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not sure why people give this one a negative rating. For whatever reason, they don't enjoy horror movies that are good. This is a real masterpiece, a masterpiece of film making. The writing is outstanding and the acting is great. It has all the horror staples, like blood, blood, and more blood. But it also has some twists, like how a character is really an alien, and has the ability to see everything through his eyes. This movie is well made and the special effects are all incredible.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are a few good moments in this movie, but the rest is a dud. The acting is bad and the cinematography is poor.    The music isn't that great either.     I have heard of this movie before and it seems like it might be a copy of the movie they made with the same title, but it was a complete joke.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really looking forward to this movie and I really wanted to see it again. It was a really poor movie from start to finish. It felt like a rushed movie. It also seemed like it had a lot of scenes that the cast was not happy with and I was hoping for a lot more scenes and that was the reason for the negative rating.    A terrible film from start-to-finish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the worst movie i have ever seen. It was just a bad, boring story and a bad bad film. The acting was so poor. A lot of bad acting was done, but this movie would only have been funny if it wasn't written so badly. The director and writer just made bad movies out of stuff like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible movie with some good acting and a very annoying voice over man.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So my boyfriend and I went on a trip with my cousin, and we all went to the same theater, and I thought they had a pretty good selection and that the movie was pretty good.  It's hard to tell with a video but the only part that was kind of funny was the "tasteful" kissing scene, that had some serious flaws (especially the sound) and the acting was so poorly that I didn't find it funny.   The rest of the movie is pretty bad, the acting is terrible, and the story is so bad that I don't know what the point was of it, especially since I think most people will think it was a crappy movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen. They use a real old-fashioned talking doll called Mr. Whipple. He has to go to war and the only way he can do so is by talking to the other soldier. The acting is so bad, the acting is terrible. The movie also uses very bad editing. At times it gets confusing and they miss out a part of the scene. The writing is terrible and there are many scenes that make no sense at all.   I was disappointed in this movie and I really wish that some of the actors from the old movies would take a look at it and learn from it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is pretty bad. The acting is really bad. We see the main character, a guy named Jimmy, having sex with an old lady in a wheelchair, and that is about it. The old lady is just kind of laying there and the sex scenes in this movie are kind of disturbing. The movie kind of goes on for a while and then they cut away from it and there is nothing there. And if you watch the movie you can probably see the old lady being raped and even the guy trying to have sex with her.    I mean, it isn't really that great. It kind of feels like a 90's movie. I didn't even like the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just watched this movie to give it a chance, but it did not do me any favors. I have a problem with horror films that have to have the victims be children in order to keep the viewers interested. It seems like a lot of them are just "kidnapped" and there is never a child left in the house.   The ending was very weak and just made the movie a total train wreck. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was expecting this film to be a bad film and I was not disappointed. It takes place in the middle of a forest and is about a man who is looking for his wife. She was apparently kidnapped and he is looking into the woods and into a cave to find her.  This film is not very good, the acting and camera work are terrible. There is nothing to laugh at here and there are a lot of people crying at certain points. It would be better if it were an art film rather than a horror film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot and character development is the only parts worth watching.   There is absolutely no humor, only sad situations that happen in a very slow way.  It is a very depressing movie.  I hope it never gets released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad! It takes a lot of liberties with the story and doesn't give any respect to it. I'm not a big fan of any horror movies, but I'm a big horror fan. This was horrible! I just can't see how this movie is even supposed to make any money!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really like this movie and it's a real shame the studio and director let it get like that, the movie should have been a big hit.  It's not an easy movie to watch but it is a good film, like other good films.  The film is about a guy named Frank (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who is trying to find the treasure of a pirate (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and get rid of the bad guys that are chasing him.  This film is very cheesy and the actors (Cameos) do a really bad job at acting but they're so good at comedy that it makes up for it.  There are some great chase scenes and it seems that the plot never gets in the way of this.  A few of the cameos are better than the others but they don't take their job too seriously.  All in all, it's pretty fun and I think it should have made a bigger deal.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a poor effort in my opinion. It took me a while to realize that it was all made up, and that it really didn't have a point.   There are so many holes in the story that it makes sense that they made up this part of the film.  This movie was a huge disappointment to me, and I wouldn't have seen it if I had seen it on television.  It is so poorly acted, and the writing and direction are awful.  I will admit, that they have tried to do a lot in this movie, but it still doesn't make up for the bad acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is terrible and I can't watch it anymore. The story is so stupid and the acting is terrible. I don't see a difference between the actor and the director at all. It's almost impossible to make anything interesting out of this movie.    I'm sorry but that was an awful movie. I never enjoyed it and there's no way in hell I ever will. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie at a late night drive-in. I did not realize how bad it was going to be. It is bad enough that I wouldn't even want to see it in a theater. If you don't think the movie is bad, there's a pretty good chance you haven't seen the bad one.   I'm very glad I only watched it one time and it's not as bad as it sounds.  This movie is pretty interesting for the way it depicts the life of a girl growing up in the South.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm giving this movie 4 stars, because it was enjoyable. I think it would have been better if it had been more serious in its comedy. There was no music in this film. I guess that's what the "studio" wanted. They probably thought it would be better for kids. It had one of the most over-the-top characters ever, and it made me laugh out loud at least five times.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just plain boring and boring.  It takes place in an insane asylum where patients are held in mental stasis by a mad doctor, and there is nothing new in it.  This film was shot at one of the most insane asylum's in the UK and even the director, Anthony Hopkins, seems to be the mental patient himself, as he talks in his insane voice like a demented person.  What a cheap and easy way to make a movie.   There is no plot to it, there is no action and there are no thrills.  The acting is weak as well, there was no acting talent on this movie, all of the actors were just doing their lines and that was it.     I will only watch this movie if I'm alone in my house or in front of the TV, it is just not worth watching and is an absolute bore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "A bad movie. The only bad part of this movie is the ending. That's when it gets really bad."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is based on a true story. The man that was involved had been charged with raping and murdering a young girl and the prosecution wanted to convict him in order to get a longer sentence. They had several witnesses to the crime that came forward and he was not convicted. The story was told in court but some of the evidence was never presented. It seems a lot of people were on the side of the defendant so that they could get a lighter sentence. A lot of the testimony was changed to make him look better. The girl's parents and a lot more people were involved. If you have a hard time believing this story and want to see the real movie, you should go and watch it. The actor who played the guy was very talented and a nice guy. The movie did not follow the original plot line.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After seeing the opening few minutes of this movie, I thought to myself, 'Wow, this movie really isn't that bad'.   The story revolves around two kids who come to the house of their eccentric uncle.   Unfortunately, they soon find out that he has a very unusual taste in music.  Unfortunately for him, one of the children decides to bring a piece of music home with them.  It seems that the music is the reason why his brother has lost his mind.  The plot is quite predictable, but the movie is definitely worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So this movie is like the story of the story where a guy goes to the place of worship in the desert and sees a weird statue and asks his friend to go up there to check it out.  I thought this was the worst movie i had ever seen and that it sucked.   I felt like i watched the movie just to see what it was like. I didnt like it at all.  This movie has no charm.  It has some cool moments but that was about it.  The actors did not have anything going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad film. I really didn't see this coming. I love the movies that were based on real events but this is just awful. It's not scary or creepy and it's really boring. I found myself thinking "that's it, we're done."   There are so many "horrors" in this movie. They all have the same actors in the same costumes and the same type of scares. There's a guy who walks down a hallway with a knife and a gun and another guy who looks like a skeleton in a white suit. This was very cheesy.   It's a shame they made a horror movie and not a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad movie is not bad. I do not mean that it is not good. I am a good viewer of good movies. But this movie was so bad that it took my breath away.   It's funny how a movie can be so bad yet it manages to make me laugh every time.  This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I will never watch it again. I will only watch good movies with good actors like Ingrid Bergman and Paul Newman. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am not a big fan of the horror genre. I don't find the scares in most of them very effective, and they are usually too easy to overcome. But in this movie I found that not all of the scares were the movie's fault. Some of them were the actors playing them. I remember the "creature" looking like it was about 4 feet tall and it seemed very fast and had a lot of momentum. But the movie had so many other good parts that I didn't mind. It was just a big mess. I think it was shot on video and so was edited. But it's just too bad because it would have made a good film, with some interesting scares and a cool plot.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is nothing but a cheap horror movie that's basically a remake of "The Amityville Horror"   It makes you think "Wow, this is a horrible movie!  " This film had all the right elements to make a great horror film   However it was all about the actors, and there were no original ideas to make the movie. This movie would be better without the cast.   There were several scary moments but they were all forced   I wish that I hadn't seen this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was horrible. Very poorly made. I did not care to watch this movie.   I have seen better movies, but never liked this one.  For example, there is a part where the young boy who is to be executed is going around looking for something to eat. He finds a piece of bread, and it looks just like him. In the end of the movie, when he is being executed, the camera looks down at him while he is kneeling in the ground. The whole movie is made in this manner, I did it myself on my friend's computer. The movie should have been called "This is a boy, not this is a dog."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have been wanting to see this movie for quite some time. It is an extremely poor film. They tried to make a film about an illegal underground bank, but the bank is basically a facade. The only bank that is really worth noticing is the one that is actually a bank.   The film tries to tell a story, but fails at every turn. It tries to have it both ways, having a bank story with no evidence of who really owns it, and at the same time giving an inside look at a secret bank.     The story is poorly written and a real let down.  There is not one mention of anything that really made me take an interest in this film. There is no action at all in this movie.  The plot is very vague at best.  Some of the characters are not interesting.  There is absolutely no emotional impact in this whole film.  It is as if they were trying to use some interesting stories from the 60's to try and make a bad film. It also doesn't help that they were just trying to create a film that would sell a lot of films at the time.     They did have one great thing going for them.  They put in enough great action scenes to make this worth seeing and to give the actors some decent paychecks.  But all of this is ruined by the film's poor writing and a ridiculous story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film starts very well. It takes you on a journey of sorts into the past and into the mindset of the two main characters, and the whole thing builds into a satisfying ending.  Unfortunately, the film only lasts a couple of minutes and its ending leaves a bad taste in my mouth.   A bit overblown at times, the ending leaves the audience with the impression that it's a prequel to the upcoming sequel to Blade Runner, and that it is based on a novella written by Philip K. Dick.  This, combined with a rather uninspired film score and the fact that the film isn't very good, make the ending rather pointless, and it just leaves you thinking "well it was a good idea, but this is really too bad to be true" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not worth watching. The acting, animation, and story just fall apart. I had to stop and re-watch it from different angles so I could see every little flaw in the production.   The story was poorly developed and the actors didn't seem to be able to keep up.  For those who are not fans of martial arts action this movie won't do much for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had a great time watching this movie at the cinema. It was very fun to watch and it was very funny to watch. But what I didn't enjoy watching was the plot and the ending. I felt that there was nothing that kept me interested and it ended up being really boring. It's good that it was a funny movie, but the plot is so bad and dull, it became boring for me. I wouldn't watch this again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you don't mind watching a movie that tries to be edgy, is very violent and is set in a ghetto, then you will like this movie. It has some great action scenes and some very intense scenes that should never be filmed. If you are in this age where you like action and don't care about the characters and plot then this movie might be right for you. I think it is more about the music than the story. It may not be a good movie for you if you are not into this kind of things. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad movies in the film "Mondo Trash" (not in the original trilogy but in the third one) is probably the best in the trilogy, but only the beginning. The plot of this movie is not bad but the acting is horrible, especially in the movie "The Big Sleep".  The movie starts on the top of a building with a couple of children running from a truck that has stopped in front of them. Then a police officer approaches them and asks them to explain what happened to the truck. The children say it was stolen and asks if they can show him the license number, which they do. The cop says it was only a license plate number so he can't really do anything about it, but the kids say it's not possible. Then the cop tells them to run away and they do, only they get lost in a tunnel and get captured by a man on a bike. The movie follows the adventures of this guy, who also calls himself "The Ghost". He has a motorcycle and has no problem with stealing trucks. He also likes to kill little kids and this is the only thing he cares about.  Eventually, the kids get out of the tunnel. However, in order to do so, they have to get down on all fours and a large ladder has to be lowered on to them. They fall down and they are caught by the Ghost. The kids beg him to take them back to their parents, but he doesn't care because they were only lost in the tunnel for three minutes and he doesn`t want to go back. He decides to do some more killing in the tunnels and then decides to leave. The Ghost then tells the kids not to cry because that is the way to get to heaven. The whole time this movie was playing, I was thinking that the kids had to have had something bad happen to them in their childhood, but that didn't happen at all.   I don't know why the kids in this movie look so young but they do and it seems that they had to stay away from adults during their childhood because they could not run away fast enough from their father. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie, the actors are on drugs. They don't even look like actors anymore.  This movie is a drug induced mess that the director doesn't know how to make good.  I think the director just went to the wrong places with the movie and the only reason this movie has more than just the drugs is because it was his first attempt at it.  It looks like the director's next movie will be his worst film ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you have ever seen this movie you should not watch it. The director has a huge amount of ego and for him to say he made a "good movie" is very misleading.   The acting was not that good, the plot was not great and it was just a bad story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was pretty much expecting a bad experience with this movie, but this was a disappointment. I had heard it was a big hit back in the 70s, and had heard about its influence, but I did not expect it to be this bad. The movie is really bad, the acting is really poor and the writing was very cheesy. The acting is so bad that it's almost comical. Most of the time, all the characters are trying to act like they are so much older, but they can't act any way but like idiots. I didn't mind the acting, but the writing is awful.   The movie was released in 1971 and was supposed to be a classic, but it was so bad.  It was basically about a woman, with the male characters acting like they didn't know anything about the woman, while the woman acted like she did, and all the other characters were acting like complete idiots.  When I first saw it, it made me laugh and then started to turn into a really bad movie, and by the time I finished watching it, I started to hate it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I are in the process of trying to get our minds off of this movie. I have not seen this movie since the day it was released. My son and his friends are a lot of fun and all laugh-out-loud funny in the movies but this one was too much for me. I did not like the storyline, the acting, the setting, the music and the script. The director should have left the movie out of the equation and made something that was more entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has no redeeming qualities, or redeeming quality whatsoever.   It is just plain bad.  It has been out for so long now, and you can always tell that the movie has been shot in low quality, or with old and cheap equipment.  The acting is awful.  A bunch of actors, none of which are all that great.  I felt like I was watching some low budget TV movie, and that no one was making the effort to actually act.  They all seem to be on camera because it is more efficient to have them do this rather than having someone read a script.  Every scene seems like it was filmed in low and behold style, and with a very cheap camera, or none at all.  The actors are all horrible.  Some are good, some are really good.  But none of them do a great job.  As far as direction goes, it was just plain poor.  Instead of using a real camera, there were no actors, just some fake looking people on the screen.  When something is bad, you are supposed to be surprised.  This is not unexpected, but it is very disappointing.    I gave the rating 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't even understand what the movie was about, but this is a pretty bad film. The music is really bad, and the characters all look very bad.   The characters are also very cheesy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For those that want a gritty action flick that has a realistic, gritty feel, this is not for you. The cast is all actors that look like they are having fun and yet the action sequences are done as if the actors are training for the roles.   There is also a lot of violence on screen and for the most part the movie does not really add any credibility to the violence. The acting is also very fake and the characters are also very unrealistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it was produced by Warner Brothers.  This was made during the days when the studios would release the lowest grossing films they could find so they would have a chance to make money and then throw out the trash.  My favorite part of the film is that when Jack Palance, played by Jeff Bridges, is walking down the street and sees the prostitute who killed his wife he decides that he needs to kill her.   It is hard to believe that this movie has only been released to make some more money for Warner Brothers because this is a great movie, if you liked the classic "Scarface" movie then you will like this too, this is the real Scarface.  If you want a good movie that will scare the crap out of you, this isn't it, but it is a fun watch.  The acting is great and the scenes are well done.  It will be interesting to see if there are any other movies from this period that are still available on the market. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this movie. It was funny, the action sequences looked good and the story was okay. I also enjoyed the fact that they didn't do too much over the top to make this a cheapie.   If I had to give this movie 1 out of 5 stars I would, but since I liked it I think I'm giving it 3 stars.  This was just a bad and boring movie, but I guess it was good enough to get an Oscar nomination. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It has everything from cheesy acting to bad production values and poor pacing to bad direction to over-the-top effects. The worst part is the terrible script. The entire thing is an over-reaction and an attempt to give a little more substance to a very silly movie.   In general I'd have to say the quality of the acting is much better than the rest of the movie. At least they had some decent actors.  It may be good for some people, but it's definitely not worth watching if you're not looking for a laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at the theatre, it looked like it was shot at night and it was a good thing that I was not expecting to find something that was bad, because this movie was not bad. The movie was a very interesting story about a couple of people who had no idea what they were doing and ended up in a very nasty situation, but it wasn't a bad way to end the movie. I saw the movie on TV and I think it was on a channel that had the original version of the film. This film has never seen the light of day, and no one in the U.S. has ever seen it or the sequel which was even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The actors are great and their characters are fine. The script is good. I could have done with one more scene, but I liked the ending the best. I wish the story was better. I would have liked to know more about the people who run the ranch and what is really going on with them. The ranch owner and the ranch hand seem to be doing whatever they can to keep the peace. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. The story was absolutely ridiculous. I don't want to watch a movie like this because it is very unoriginal. But for some reason, I like the acting in it. The lead actress was good in this movie and she should be a bit bigger. I have never seen a movie as bad as this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is bad. The plot is all over the place and poorly written. It makes no sense at all. What we are told happened on a day that was full of sunshine and joy and that was the day that someone was killed by a falling object on a beach. The woman was not seen alive again so that does not seem plausible. The two police officers are not seen anywhere on film but we do get to see that they are on the beach and that the woman is the only one who was in that area. She never gets a name other than the dead man. So, at one point, two police come into a beach house and find a woman lying naked on the ground and one of the police officers is saying "I'm sorry to tell you this, but we believe it is you."   The other police officer then says, "No it is not, it is this woman's boyfriend."  I found the two officers to be the least believable police officers I have ever seen. They were clearly just in the wrong place at the wrong time.   They are both trying to cover up their actions by trying to blame the other police officers.  These two cops are totally incompetent. I don't know why the filmmakers made them two. I am not sure if the other cop was there when the woman was killed or if he had gone in there a short time before and was looking around looking for some reason not to tell his boss.  The only thing the two cops do do right is that they take a swab of the dead guy's anal cavity to figure out if he has any drugs or sex on him.  I really didn't understand why the two of them didn't just go back to where they came from. The only reason they are able to figure this out is that the dead girl was in the same place when they went to the beach.  It was a very creepy movie to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After a really good performance by the lead in a classic and underrated movie (The Good German), "The Man Who Fell to Earth" is the worst movie I have ever seen. Not only is it cheesy, but it's also unprofessional.   I never thought I would see an Alien ripoff, but "The Bad German" is one that is sure to do well at the box office.  The story is simple, and it does not take long to get from A to B. We are introduced to a German named Hans, who is sent to a planet that is ruled by a queen. Hans' job is to infiltrate the planet and steal an artifact from a place called the Palace of the Dead. I really do not know what it is that makes me hate this movie, but as soon as I saw it I was ready to punch someone in the face. The bad acting from the actors is very poor and the plot is very weak.  This movie is basically a movie about a guy who gets killed and then is brought back to life. The only thing that is good about this movie is the music, which makes a few pretty good background pieces.  Unfortunately, the acting is so bad that you are not sure if this movie even really is a horror movie or not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't get enough of this movie. It is simply sooo fun to watch. I loved this movie so much I started watching it over and over again. However the acting sucks and the whole film is filled with bad acting.   It looks so bad you can't believe someone would make a movie like this.  For example in the movie when the girl who has just been dumped by her boyfriend walks into the bar and starts to cry she looks like a doll. It's so cheesy and the acting is so bad.  This is one of those movies that you can tell a couple years after it comes out. This movie has some of the worst acting I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this movie would make me laugh and I laughed a little.   But it was so poorly acted, written and directed that it makes my stomach hurt.  It is a complete train wreck that had me thinking how a film like this would be received.  The script, the actors, the director, and the script supervisor did a complete disservice to this movie and what it should have been.   It is only one of a handful of films that has this many problems.  They must have been on an acting tour of Canada so they went in for a little pay day.  I feel sorry for all of the actors on this production. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very bad movie. It's been going on for 20 years and still no one will make a decent movie out of it. The movie tries to be too edgy, but it's not edgy at all. If you want to see a cheesy, over-the-top, overacting, over the top movie, then go ahead. However, this is not the way to do it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I did not enjoy this movie. I just did not. I don't even understand what was wrong with the story line. It was not believable. The acting was just not believable either. It felt like it was just a stunt to make this movie more profitable." -Maurice White 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this because of the reviews, and I wanted to see how it turned out.  When I opened the package, I saw this was a bad picture.  I was looking at the poster for the movie and the color was horrible.  It's like the color had been thrown on, and the actor's faces were too big.  Then there were some of the characters with no mouths or noses, so they were flat and looked like someone had slapped them with a stick.  So I took the picture out of the poster, looked in the box and realized this was the real movie.  The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because the first part is very interesting and the second half is a little boring.   It also seems very cheesy.  My brother loved it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A horrible film with a bad script and acting. No one but the cameraman who acted like a moron should have done this. A horrible mistake.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just received this film a few days ago and watched it and liked it. I didn't see it at any of the other major theater chains (Downtown LA) and they had very low prices.   This movie is not for children. It has a lot of graphic sex scenes. It takes itself way too seriously, and it really bothers me that it is being made into a PG-13 movie. This movie does not take itself seriously.  It is made so that it makes a profit for Disney and its distributor, who then give it to a movie theater chain to run.  The only way to get an R rating is to give the script a "no-name" director and studio. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very old movie, but still good.  The whole movie is a little dull and I did not like the characters.  I guess this movie was for kids and it was a very well done children's movie.  It had great effects but it looked a little silly.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went to see the movie at a theatre in a busy mall in the middle of the day. The place was packed and the movie was starting. I was a few rows from the screen and the man at the front of the theatre looked me up and down with disdain. After the credits finished the man took his coat and left the theatre as if he didn't want to be there. I will never go again to a movie in a crowded theater like that.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was horrible, and it took me a while to finally figure out the true meaning of "Killer" in this movie.   A guy shoots up people randomly, and that was the most horrible part about this movie... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is absolutely awful. The movie has poor acting, an unoriginal story, and the acting is awful. I thought it was about the time the Taliban was on the rampage.   This is just another example of how bad "special effects" is.  There are so many problems with this film, you really have to wonder why people were making movies like this when people can make better films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As soon as I heard that the director, Tim Burton, was returning to the world of 'Nightmare on Elm Street', I was excited.   When he directed the film, it was a surprise.  The film is a fun, cheesy, and darkly humorous horror film with good acting, special effects, and a fun plot.  It is a little bit dated.  For a remake, it looks pretty decent.  But the film is really cheesy and feels out of place.  A couple of jokes are particularly bad.  Overall, I give the film a B. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a poorly made and overrated movie with a horrible plot line.   The actors did a terrible job of portraying their characters.  All the characters were just recycled.  There were many characters in this movie. They were all the same.  This movie is a "Waste of time" for the actors.  Don't waste your time on this movie!   My Rating: 4 out of 10  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie about a crazy cat lady who is on a mission to save the world from evil. She is really great and has the most amazing abilities of any hero in the whole movie. She has a great voice and it is amazing to hear her talk and do things that most people would think to be impossible. In some ways, it is like the best Pixar movie. The problem with this movie is that it takes away from the actual villain. He just doesn't have enough depth to be a truly bad guy. There are two or three moments where his character seems real but these moments are really short and not enough to really make you care about the characters or the plot. The movie was really fun in some ways. There is something really funny about seeing the crazy cats running around like a real cat invasion movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is full of lies. I'm disappointed by the director and studio, but still glad I saw this movie. I would not recommend this to anybody. The movie is one long con. The acting is poor. The only good thing is that there is a real scene that I wish I could have seen. The director could have gone further with the plot and the characters. I've seen so much "action" like this over the years and it has never been that good. There's always one or two actors doing something unrealistic. The script is so bad. It's like the director read some scripts, or wrote them himself. It was like he took a script that was already filled with holes, and filled them with more holes. I think this movie should never have been made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this for the first time at the movie theatre. I've always had a soft spot for the early 80's science fiction films and this one was no exception. It has been a long time since I've seen a film with this much energy and this much action. I had never watched a film in which the main protagonist's name was Chris Carter. The story is simple. A group of alien beings called the Reptilians have invaded Earth and have taken over the government with some assistance from the US Government. One of the aliens decides to attack and take over. There are no aliens here. There is a secret government project known as Project Stargate. We learn the name of this project while watching this film. It's very interesting.  The movie is very well made. I felt the characters had personality and felt like they were real. The aliens are so realistic. The costumes look so real. It is quite scary and the action is intense and intense. The music is great. The special effects are awesome. The whole movie is a real gem.  I only give it 4/5 because it is a little old fashioned and the story could have been more developed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible movie. The special effects and makeup are terrible. The acting is terrible. There are no funny moments. The dialogue is awful. The plot is bad. The story is really lame. The characters are bad. This movie is so bad that I am still embarrassed for my friends that I watched it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film that was made before this (and, by the way, a much better one) was even better.   I liked the story and the acting (although I'm not much of a 'good guy').   This film is made to exploit the movie "A Clockwork Orange".   It's a masterpiece (as all Stanley Kubrick productions are) but the writing is so bad (especially the writing in the scenes that show the violence - and the script was written by the same guy who did the screenplay for "A Nightmare on Elm Street", another Kubrick movie).   In the film you have two groups: a good guy and a bad guy (although there is no clear line).  The movie is filled with violence (including a scene where a guy kills a man with his bare hands), and there is even some of necrophilia.  The writing is awful. The story is told very badly and the characters are so shallow.  One of the main characters, the leader of the good guys, even speaks like a drunk.  I understand that the main character is so shallow, but if the film is filled so full of sex, violence, and cheap acting, what good can come of it?   Overall, "A Lonely Place to Die" is a great exploitation film that I would have seen ten years ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie as a kid and I never had any of the negative emotions of the trailer.   This movie does not live up to the quality of the trailers.  It is basically a bunch of guys who jump on you when you are asleep, and drag you down to the lake to drown you.  If the trailer was not so full of lies about the movie then this would have been a really great movie.  As far as a movie that you would watch over and over again you can watch it all the time, but if you have any reservations about this film, stay away from it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad film that is not worth watching. The acting is terrible. The plot is ridiculous. The ending is silly.   If you are a fan of "The Terminator" or the "Back to the Future" movies this film would have been great.  The only good thing about this film is the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While watching this movie I was hoping it would turn out well for the producers. It was a bad film from the start. The acting was terrible and the actors were not even trying. The storyline was not well thought out. The movie itself was not really worth watching. The film was over long and I had to stop it once because the story was getting ridiculous. I don't want to watch it again and for the money I paid for it to be wasted on this terrible movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a very poorly made and badly acted flick. The story itself is pretty weak. The dialogue is poorly delivered and the acting is very bad. The director just doesn't know what to do with the actors and seems to be lost in his own story. I don't know why he didn't do this sooner but this is definitely not worth watching.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is another bad movie by the guy that has the worst movies in the world. It has a long boring scene and no action. It was a bad idea to cast Arnold Schwarzenegger in this movie and I didn't see anything in his performance. He just looked stupid.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was pretty good. It had a nice feel to it, but not in a good way. The whole movie seemed rushed, especially the first half. The acting was pretty poor. I don't see why people would make this a comedy. It could have been made into a more interesting story. The pacing was off. The dialogue was not interesting. The main character was not funny at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For the first twenty minutes this movie is awesome. Then it gets bad. The acting is awful and the movie starts to get confusing. The actors just don't know how to act with each other.   It also has some of the worst special effects ever put on a movie.  Overall a very bad movie. The one thing that the studio should have done is to make a movie that is better than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A great movie for those who want to see some really scary stuff in a cheap movie.   The story line is really good, even if it is just a rehash of other scary movies like "Halloween", "Friday the 13th", "House of Wax", "Hollywood Shuffle", and "Haunter of the Dark".   This movie was made for cheap and it still works. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is just crap. It has a cheesy B-movie vibe to it and never gets any interesting or interesting character developments.  It is just a one-way street to see a good old fashioned B movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a pretty boring movie.   For one, you don't really get a sense of where the movie is going.  For another, the story never comes to a climax.  The movie never really reveals what's going on with the characters in any detail and, when it does, it's so over the top you feel like it's not really happening.  It just becomes too unbelievable.  I found the character, and his story, to be so silly.  He's the sort of guy who would think if he saw a picture of a beautiful girl he'd be attracted to her immediately.  But, as you know, no such thing happened with this woman.  And, I really feel for the guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had heard about this movie from the theater while watching the movie of the same name, and was hoping that the director would bring it back with some new twists. The ending was a little disappointing, but all in all, it was a decent movie that didn't really suck.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie last night after it had opened, and as a child I loved the film so I sat through the whole thing. I got the feeling that the guy who played the main character was having a great time with the movie and when he realized that he was about to fail he made sure he made his best performance.   The only problem I had with the film was that the actors had very bad accents.  I like this movie but it was a real disappointment when I was watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very poor.   This movie is about a group of children and their fathers.  It is actually one of the more positive movies about fathers, and the father's involvement in it.  This was probably made in the 70's to show the difference between the family and the "welfare bums".   It seems like a lot of work to make a movie about a family like this, so you would think they would learn from it. They didn't. The acting is terrible. The plot is a mess. This was basically a group that was being taken care of by their father, and they were being lied to and made to do things they didn't want to do by him.     The one good thing is the family doesn't leave the house when they are out of town.  So if you want to see some good parenting, I wouldn't recommend this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is all over the place, and is nothing more than a bunch of ridiculous, pointless, contrived, and pointless events that occur over the course of several days.   It has a story line which is very simple and can be summed up as, a man has to kill a man, and the man is very dead, and he has to figure out how he did it and then kill another guy because he has a thing for him.  What is the point of that?   I never understood what was going on.  There is nothing to it, and there is no build up.  The only thing I could figure out was the guy who is always talking to the dead guy, and how did he figure out to be a murderer?   Why did the guy have to be so dead?  It was so poorly put together.  I would really rather spend my time on something more creative, like a game like the original Shadowrun, or even the game that is based on the book  The first one is better though, and if you have never played the game, it is like playing a board game. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very disappointing. I really wanted to love this movie. It was the perfect movie to make my weekend and I had a great time. I think that the acting and acting skills were not up to the standards that I know they can reach. The movie just didn't feel real. I wish that they would have made the movie from the point of view of the kids.   - December 29, 2013A good movie but not for me
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you love the films in this group and not only love them, you also adore this film. It is truly a fantastic, fun film that will delight and keep you entertained for a long time. It has a very well developed story and there is much more to it than meets the eye. You can feel the excitement and tension when it comes to the characters. The actors are great and the script is well written.  This film also has a lot of originality. The acting and story lines are a bit overdone and it takes the movie to the limit. The characters all have a lot going for them. The cinematography is amazing and the music is great. The action scenes are very well choreographed. The special effects in this film are incredible. The movie is very original and has that old school feeling about it.    I gave this film a 7 out of 10, it has it all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie sucks. The director tried to make a fun, action movie but it just turned into a generic action movie. The whole crew is awful, especially the special effects people. They couldn't make the cars or buildings fly, so they just made them move randomly.   I hate to say it, but they could have made a good movie out of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen all the films of Peter Sellers, but this was one of my least favorite, and yet, somehow, it turned out to be the best one, and not only for me, but for all those who love him and want to see him again. He never again tried to be funny or interesting, and he made me think only of the sexual and other temptations of the woman, and of the terrible things she was telling us.   In the movie, the director, who was a big fan of Sellers and had wanted him to star in his new movie, was so embarrassed when he found out that Sellers wanted to be a silent film director and not a star. In an attempt to stop him, the producer of the movie was supposed to go to his room to see how Sellers behaved, but in the middle of the night Sellers left, so the director went to his hotel room, and found that he was still there, and that Sellars was already at the door, still wearing his nightgown, saying he had to get his clothes. When the director asked Sellars what was going on, he simply said, "It doesn't matter, the movie's going to be great."  The film ends with a great scene where a great star is finally happy for the success of his movie, while the director watches from a window in the hotel. Sellers is still in the movie in a great costume and wig, saying, "I have to get my clothes," and all the actresses in the picture, not knowing the truth about the man behind the mask, scream at him. This is just unbelievable!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I hate how it is not an original story that has not been done before or that has been done to death.   It seems that it is a very "honest" story with no embellishments.  This was NOT the story of the storyteller and the man who wrote the book.  The story had nothing to do with the book that the story was based on.  There are two different book's that were written.  What was used to be the man with the power to turn the world upside down.  When he is turned into a young boy who then becomes a child actor he is a good story, but this one just made me very sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has been made so badly, the quality is appalling. There are so many times that the actors are not even there, and the actresses look as if they have just gone to the gym!   A couple of characters that should have been in the movie, don't get a mention.   If you like bad movies, buy this movie.  It's a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a real shame. I don't know about you, but I don.t want to see people do terrible things. I really enjoyed the movie though and this movie didn't live up to the hype.  I don t like the way they kept showing the "horror" of the movie and never let us have a "normal" horror movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie so bad it makes you want to give it an 8.  A bad movie that is actually funny but only by a slight degree.   The only funny parts in this movie are when the characters are running around in circles and laughing.  The plot is so bad that there is not even any character development.  They spent about 30 minutes on establishing the characters and the plot but there is so much bad dialogue in this entire movie that there really is no depth to the plot.  As with a lot of bad movies, they decided to make it a comedy.  I can't tell you how many times when I looked forward to this movie I wished it was actually a horror film.  When they said this was a parody, they were probably right because it is a spoof on a horror movie.  You will love it, but it is not very good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very boring. This movie was over long before it even started, so when it finally came time to start it it just dragged on and on. I don't think there was any point in watching it.   I wish they would have just done a different script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie on my honeymoon. It was my first time seeing a movie that was about a man named George and his attempts to live with his wife's sister. I was amazed at how old fashioned the film was, and how much the plot kept me from ever liking it.    There was no character development, no real plot, no plot twists, no good or bad acting, no acting talent, and really no plot.  It was the most boring film I've seen in a long time.  The movie was set in the 1930's in a place called "The Country" and there were lots of places to see like the local gas station, a country club, and a country music camp.  Even though I was in my twenties at the time, I can't remember many things from the film.  I had no idea who George W. Bush was when this movie started and he even looked very old, like he had spent a lot of time in the sun.  As for the plot, you have George W., who seems to be a very nice guy, but has to find a way to convince the girl that he is in love with her and they should get married.  Unfortunately, George was not able to convince her, which led to them separating, and the ending is not really believable.  George ends up being a drifter, and spends a good part of the film hiding out in the woods, and he ends up finding his way back to the Country and getting in trouble.  This is not a great movie, but you could have used some new actors in it. I don't know if you could see this movie in a modern theater, but I sure do remember seeing it in a 1970's movie theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love these characters. This movie was boring as hell.    The plot was just silly and unbelievable.    The special effects were so bad.  One of the worst movies of the 80s   This movie is not worth watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't realize this was a comedy, but it turned out to be so full of shit. This movie is a joke about a guy who comes from a long line of criminals and can do nothing to stop them. He's got his own family, his own problems and it's the family that's really keeping him up at night. He even has a little bit of a crush on one of the girls.  It's really hard to be funny in this movie, but there's a really good line here that sums up the whole thing.  I guess it's hard to stay grounded when everyone around you is insane.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got this movie to watch and the sound is horrible. I love movies that are fun. This is a total nightmare. The main character is not funny and his wife is not worth seeing. He keeps getting stuck in a long shot in the back of the van and when he goes out of frame they do not show the end of the movie. I think it is not a good idea to put a lot of money into a movie like this because there is nothing to laugh at. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is very bad, but in a good way. This film makes a mockery of the horror genre by having several elements of the "spare parts" scene. They are actually very funny to watch. I will never laugh at a scene like that ever again!    I give this film a rating of one star because I have to give it a lot of credit. The story is actually very good, with characters that you care about.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I have always been an agnostic. I was so confused when I saw this. I read the reviews and the movie looked good, but I still thought it was a complete piece of crap. The story is a big scam and I would not have watched this if the acting was better, the writing was better or the acting better. The acting was horrible. What an embarrassment. I don't know how they got these actors in the movie. There is no way this could be true. They were all horrible. The one who really stood out was the guy who played the kid's dad. He looked like a drug addict. I guess he was high every time he was on camera.    I don't understand what the movie is supposed to be about. I saw it on TV and I still don't really know.  "   One of the most boring films I have ever seen.  I found the acting to be awful and I thought the plot was so boring that it didn't matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so cheesy it was laughable.   The bad actors just couldn't deliver any lines that were not rehearsed.  Some actors did not even know what they were doing on stage.  The music was also not that great.  There was so many scenes like this and it made the film just annoying to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a very interesting film and a well made film. There are some flaws but they were not that big of deal. The ending of the film is a little awkward to watch and there are a few things in the story that do not make much sense. However, the film has great cinematography and a great score.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In a desperate attempt to "do something" with the franchise and make it sell, they brought out a cheapy, poorly-produced, and lame movie. The director, who was the most incompetent of the bunch, was only there for the laughs. I would never watch it again, and I know the producers and cast would have been better off just doing another movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never saw the movie that was mentioned as being the basis for this movie.  I think this film is a terrible piece of junk that was made because some producers had no idea what they were doing.  This film was made to fill a quota and it was.  It is based on a novel, but it is very poorly acted and filmed and the story is just terrible.  The acting is awful and I felt that even the director didn't know what he was doing when he was filming it.  We are never given any kind of background about who this woman is or what kind of movie this is.  There was no acting ability in the actors that I ever saw.  They seemed to know it was a crappy film, but they were in it to fill up their quotas and were not at all concerned about the quality of the movie they were trying to make.  These producers are idiots and I hope that some one at Paramount reads this and says 'fuck this and we should never make another movie like this.'   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the one movie I had to go back to after the first time I watched it. Not bad, but not great. The dialogue is kind of cheesy. The plot is ridiculous and it is very much a love-hate movie. But if you love cheesy love-hates, and a story where some guy is really really obsessed with a girl who's supposed to be his friend, then go see this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember watching this movie when I was in college, when I had to find something to do in between classes and other commitments. After all the "horror" movies I'd seen in the theater (The Shining, The Exorcist) I was somewhat turned off by the genre. When I saw this movie I immediately found myself completely hooked. It scared the hell out of me and made me think that the "monster" was a real entity, just like in some of the movies I saw. The movie was actually scary, not scary for what it was, but rather for what could have been if the "sparks" from some of these movies had found their way to this film.    This movie was also the very first time I've seen a movie in which the main character was not a killer. Instead of being a "bad" guy he was actually a victim and was trying to escape his fate.      If you're looking for a movie that is not to be watched in an isolated area, or if you are not looking for horror or any other type of movie this movie is for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot of this film, being that it is a documentary, was interesting but nothing special. It was just there for the sake of it and was not all that well done. The performances were ok. The only real talent that I saw was the one's that took the part of the two young kids that were the victims of this crime. They were done very well. I just did not find the film all that interesting. I felt like I was watching a kid's movie. It felt like the film was going for shock value and a cheap "kid's film" and it definitely did not do that.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If it's a good movie I don't mind it, but if it's bad then I do. It's not bad at all, it's very good. The animation is good, but it's nothing great and it's not animation like "Puella Magi Madoka Magica" or "Ponkotsu Madoka". The characters are very different than the usual anime characters and the animation is better than usual, but there are still problems.   The animation at the beginning was great, but the last 5 minutes of it is terrible and looks like a cheap animation made for the movie, not animation at all.  The character designs are very weird and I'm not sure if that's a bad thing or not. It seems like the art director didn't care about this film, the backgrounds look like the same scenery they've done over and over, no difference.  What is the story about? The story is about a girl who goes on a journey to find her mother who she has never seen and has never even met.  In my opinion the story is the best part of the movie because it gives the movie a sense of urgency and the characters are always in danger.  I really like the ending, the first few scenes and the last scene of the film are great, it was also the best way to conclude the movie.  Overall this is a great movie and is well worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad movies in this "trilogy" consist of movies that are not good in any sense of the word, not even for a children's movie. There are two movies, both made in the 80's, that are so bad that I can't even go into them. I'm going to try and describe these movies as I remember them, but that's not going to help much. These movies are full of bad acting, bad effects, horrible acting, and horrible music. There is also the usual, and often annoying, bad music.   A couple of movies are worth mentioning, and they are: The first, with Tom Selleck in it, is just plain horrible. I have never seen a movie that made me so angry in my life. It's a very long movie, but it's actually not long at all. I found it more like a 10 minute long movie that got cut off at the end. The movie is about a couple who try to find their missing daughter, in a creepy movie studio, that's filled with creepy and creepy looking creatures.  The second movie is another bad movie. The director seems to know how to make bad movies. It has a very bad and very bad acting style, and the music is horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie with a cast that was not very experienced and who would be considered 'unknown' when it comes to Hollywood movie making. I did not care for any of these actors. The director did not bring any life to the film and in my opinion, the only thing that came to life was the bad acting of all the cast. This movie is a joke and has the wrong people in it. I hope that the director would come out with another movie soon.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I like this film, but it is very bad. It's got all the classic elements that are so popular at the moment, but in this movie it was really obvious that it was poorly edited. And in a bad way too. The script is very poor. And there is not enough violence in this one either. I would not even call this an action movie but more of a horror film. If you watch it on tv then you can watch it in 3D. But the original release in 1978 was in 2D so you have to buy the DVD or the BluRay. This is definitely a must see movie and one of the first to bring about the genre of the vampire films. If it had been a better movie then it would have been at the top of the list. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am so sorry to hear that a movie I really liked has ruined your life, but I have no idea what to tell you. I never thought of this as a family film at all. It was not funny at all, and the story about a girl who was kidnapped and raped by a group of white people was a complete fabrication. If they had not taken such liberties with the story, they would have made a film that would have been funny, and at least be worth watching. It is sad how such a harmless film could ruin someone's life so much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely horrible! I bought it off of the internet thinking that it was a kids film and that it would have something redeeming about it. I was in shock when I saw it and it was absolutely horrible. I wish I could have said something but I just sat through the movie thinking it was just a kids movie.   I was really hoping that the kids would be like in The Karate Kid but instead they are all over the place and not in a good way. It made my stomach churn all the way through and it really took my patience away.  I really wish I was joking when I said that this movie made my eyes water. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm really disappointed in this movie. It was really boring, and very poorly written. The story was very simple, and most of the characters seemed like they didn't really want to be there. The characters felt fake and not real at all. They just stood around talking to each other, and looking at stuff. I also couldn't stand the acting. Some of the actors just didn't have any acting skills, which really sucked. It felt like they were just trying to act like what they saw on TV, and it didn't work. The writing was really bad too, and I don't understand how someone could make a movie like this without being good at writing.   The only good thing about this movie was the music and the cinematography, but that was it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have never seen this movie and never heard of the director, but I am glad that I did. It is a really bad movie and the only reason I watched it was because the woman's husband (Robert Mitchum) is in it and he steals a lot of scenes. He also gets really hot and is really good looking.   My favorite character in the movie is the one with the blonde hair and glasses, but other than that, I can't remember the rest.  I gave the movie a C- just because I wanted to see the man in the blonde wig.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is the product of an extremely poor script. It was obviously not written to be a good movie. The whole film could have been saved by having an actress play the role of the daughter. In my opinion, the mother's role should have been played by a woman.   It makes no sense that a mother would go to such lengths to seduce her daughter with a gun to protect her from a monster.  I thought the script was so bad, I couldn't believe it until I watched the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I had to say something about this movie, I'd say this is what happened when one gets really, really rich and wants to spend it on a yacht.   What really killed the boat was the whole boat crew being played by really unprofessional people who were hired to do a film in a yacht (or something).   In the film, all these rich guys and ladies live on a boat in the middle of the ocean and their mission is to rescue a young girl who has been kidnapped by pirates.  They use their resources to bribe everyone on the boat and then rescue the girl, who is just like them in every way.  I won't even say who is a real pirate.  It was a movie with no budget and so the actors were really lucky to get any work at all.  The only good thing about the movie is that it's not a parody but a real boat movie and the actors are really good at their job.  If you like good looking guys with tattoos (the best ones) you might enjoy this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "My father was in a car accident and lost all four legs. The medical bills were enormous, and my mother couldn't afford it. One day, when I was a little kid, she came up with a plan. She went to a movie. It was called THE EXORCIST. A couple of times I remember thinking, This is one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen. I've never seen anything so fucked up." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst thing in the world.   A horrible film with nothing special about it.  No plot, no dialogues, no action.  Nothing.  The characters are all the same: a man (Bruce Willis), a woman (Jennifer Connelly) and a child (David Arquette).  If you can find a decent script for this movie, then you will like it. I have seen so many stupid movies in my life.  It is a terrible movie for the whole family. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After seeing the trailer for this, I thought the movie would be just another horror flick with a killer doll, but it was nothing like that.   It was a real movie!   The girl who played the lead was hot and looked like a supermodel with perfect tits and ass.  She was extremely attractive and it was hard to not like her.  This movie was not scary at all, I didn't feel even a hint of fear.  The movie was a complete rip off of  Night of the Living Dead, where the killer doll was just a plastic bag with a string attached to it.  I wish they made a movie like this in real life!  I love the new Star Wars films but this movie sucked!  What would you think if a real killer doll made an appearance in a real creepy movie?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is horrible. The actors were great. It has the classic Hollywood star and a couple of minor ones. The director was not. He was a complete amateur. He didn't understand the story. There is no action in the movie. There are no cars, no fights, no anything. It is just a bunch of people sitting around and watching people walk. Not worth a look.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was really excited about this movie. I liked it, but the movie was so uneventful and not anything of note.   The plot is really thin.  I love seeing movies that are made in America (or in this case England) with some British style music. I have seen a lot of B movie movies and this one really does not stand out.  The acting was really terrible.  This was like watching a cheesy B movie made in 1980.  It did not have much action or anything.  One of my favorite action movies, "Robocop," was actually made in the 50's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a huge disappointment. I know the director, John Woo, is a master at his craft and he gets the best out of a cast. This movie was all over the place, but the acting just doesn't work. It has the makings of a great movie, but it just doesn�t work. The actors just do not come together. I found myself bored throughout the whole thing. There are some nice action scenes and some great sets, but in the end, it just does not work.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you like a good old fashion western, then "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" is for you.  A lot of people seem to be disappointed in "The Ugly", and I agree that it isn't as good as "The Master", but it is still pretty good.   The cinematography is pretty cool and the sound effects are great.  It's a great Western with a great cast, a real old time film noir feel, and a good script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        One of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. I can only believe the director is either crazy or a horrible actor. This movie really wasn't all that good and was so boring that I actually hated it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie, the actors are all not the best, the direction is terrible and most of the acting in it is boring.   It is about a young boy who lives in an old house, his father is never around, and he has an abusive stepmother that he must watch out for.  It takes place in a village where people are scared to death of ghosts.  The film also features an old man who has a terrible temper and hates the young boy, the film takes an interest in the young child's fear of ghosts and the old man, so it gives a real creepy feel to the film.   The film has the feeling of something that had to be made in the 90's, it was made with very little budget.  Unfortunately, it takes itself so seriously and has a very cheesy feel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most depressing movie i have ever seen. I really hate how the director put on a comedy act that doesn't really do much else but bring a smile to the viewers faces. The acting is very bad especially in the scene where the kids go through the woods and they start to play some game. There are a lot of scenes that don't even show the character's faces. They just look like random objects thrown on the screen and you don't know who they are. I wish i could give this movie 2 stars but i don't think it deserves to be. I can only watch the movie once.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really loved this movie. It was really entertaining and I liked how you actually knew what was going on. The film is very similar to "Halloween" in that way. It has that old horror atmosphere which was a bit more real than what "Halloweentown" gave us but it was done in a good way.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was awful. Not even a good movie. I didn't even care for the movie. It wasn't funny, it wasn't bad, it was just flat. The only good thing about this movie was the way that the actor that was playing the kid that kills his mother in the movie is really scary.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are in to this kind of stuff don't waste your time. I just don't like the way the writer uses the audience to fill out the story. It's just like the rest of his movies. He could have done a better job with it.   Just a bad, bad, dumb movie, which I don't have anything else to say about.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After viewing a couple movies with my friends, and thinking this one was a real disappointment, I decided to see it by myself. This is a very poor film. It has no plot, just generic "black and white" footage of a guy trying to find his missing dog. There are some cute little touches like the guy walking around outside with a dog in his hand, or the guy holding the dog's leash. This guy gets his dog, and then finds out the dog was killed when he was attacked by another dog. Then, he meets the dog that was in the other dog's grave, and it leads him on a search to find out what really happened. I was really disappointed in this film. If you haven't seen any black and white dog movies, then you would be hard pressed to find anything decent to watch.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a disaster from start to finish. The acting is sub-par at best, and the plot is ridiculous.  I mean come on... what was this movie supposed to be about? The entire premise is an excuse for the main star, an actor who is a professional bodybuilder, to get more screen time. In this movie, the character and his alter ego meet a bunch of other bodybuilders and get involved in a plot about a killer bodybuilder named John Dillinger.  The only thing he actually kills is his wife and child and he has the excuse of getting into the circus in order to hide his crime. The whole movie is an attempt to sell more action and he is completely unable to pull off any of the action sequences.  A movie like this is not going to appeal to many people as it is just plain bad.  For those who are interested in watching this movie just watch the previews on YouTube.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters of these two movies were so bland I had to find some new ones to make this crap worth watching.   They play no role in the movie, they are just background players and can be heard to yell about something but their role in this movie is only to tell you what the fuck is going on.  I give it an A because the special effects were good and it had a very original idea in a science fiction setting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film has an epic tone, and it's great to see something in this type of story. As someone who's never watched it before, this is a perfect introduction to it. I was glad they went out and hired great actors to play the parts.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It has been so long since I last saw a film with good acting, I couldn't believe it.   The director of this film has only done a few other bad films and I was ready to be shocked, so I was not.  The acting in this film is very bad and the bad acting is from all the characters in this movie.  Some people might be attracted to this movie but I didn't.  My parents and some of my friends also enjoyed this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst of all my films. The only thing worth watching is the soundtrack to this movie. It was so funny and so good I laughed until my nose bled.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never read about the shooting that happened to this movie.  In a lot of ways, this is a bad remake of the original.  The same characters are in it, except they are younger, and they have to take their own lives, and some even in jail, in order to end this nightmare.  I think the film was made as a cash-in.   What could be done better:  I agree with everyone, that some people would have made this a better film.  It doesn't try to be much more than a "happy ending" movie, but it really doesn't have enough action.  Unfortunately, it also doesn't really work as a remake, either, as it has no real "original" story, except for the one about the two young girls that start it all.  This movie was shot in black and white, and that is the only color I remember.  When the police get a call that there are more than 40 dead bodies, they show up to find the bodies, including the bodies of the two girls.  That is how they know it is not just a random murder, and no one knows how or why.  The two girls are not happy about that.    This was really a bad idea:    I always loved the idea of a group of people who go into a building, and kill everyone inside.  How the film never actually went into the building, I have no idea, and it does not give us any idea that any of the people in this group could escape in the first place.  There are lots of fake suicide notes, and the two sisters do not take any of them, as that would be too obvious.  They don't really know that they are being followed by a guy, either.  In the end, this movie is really not that bad:  So, if you have seen any of those "happy endings" movie where the main character dies after the movie ends, this one will not make any sense.  But, if this movie has your taste, you might enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so sad after watching this movie. There was no emotion at all. There are so many stupid things they did to make this movie better. The director is in bed at home and doesn't realize that he is making a bad job. This movie is the worst horror movie I have seen. The acting is awful. I can't believe they did it to scare people.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a pretty poor movie, and a really bad film at that. The plot is incredibly dull, the acting is bad, the direction is bad (especially for a'star-wars' film), the special effects are all over the place, and the characters are bad.   Even worse, the special features consist of a couple of terrible outtakes from the movie.  It's just not worth seeing at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie for the first time in a theater and the director of it got very defensive at the beginning. When the credits started rolling, I realized that this movie would never have been made if it weren't for the fact that this guy could have directed it. I guess his name was Bill Morrison.   This is a poor film with a bad director.  A couple of scenes that are cut out from the rest of the film. The music is all over the place, and there are a few weird parts.  The only good thing about this film is that it isn't a remake of some other movie.  I guess this film wouldn't work at all today.  A bad remake of a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie I have seen.   This is a movie you shouldn't even watch if you don't want to be disturbed, or even if you do want to watch a movie.  The story was bad, but the acting was not funny, and the acting in this movie was so bad that I thought the movie was over and that no one would care.  It is not funny at all, and this movie should have never been made at all.  What makes this movie so bad is the acting.  In the movie, most of the characters are not even interesting.  Everyone you see in the movie seems to be a stalker or someone who has a bad attitude.  One of the main female characters tries to get her way by getting someone's man's clothes and making a movie with him to make him jealous of her.  She wants to get him into something stupid and has him trying to be something that he is not.  This movie is just bad, and it makes me sick to think of the actresses acting as this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie, from what I remember, had a great plot and the acting was great and I loved the setting of a small farm.   What I hated was that there were only like 6 people at the farm and the only other thing they had was a tractor and a few chickens.  That was it.  There were no extras and no real atmosphere and no excitement.  I hate when I watch an entire movie and then only get about 3 good scenes and nothing else.  In addition, there was not a single moment where the movie was moving, something that was important to the movie.  The whole thing was just a bunch of talking.  If you look, there are several things that I wish they would have changed.  For example, if you go to the next farm in town, it is not in the same area, so you should have seen more of it.   This is just one movie I saw, but it seemed as if it was made by someone who was just starting out, but still had plenty of potential to make a great film.  The movie, at one point, actually ended with a cliffhanger.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a bad film with some great acting. The story was not bad but I did not like the acting.   The story about the murder of an elderly woman by her own son is true, but I am not sure if this is the right time to tell this story.  It is too soon to tell the truth about a crime and the killer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A film with too many flaws to be a good film, this is a film that does not deserve its award of excellence.   It is a shame that this film has so many flaws that detract from a good picture.  If a film had this many problems, it would never get an award.  This film makes poor use of an excellent actor, and one that would go on to have some of his best roles.  The film would have been a great one if the actor did not have to play this role.  It gives him no room to play his character and it is a hard task for one that is not a good actor to try and play someone that he has not portrayed before.  When this film was being made, the film makers were very young and inexperienced, and while they had some good actors in the cast, they were not used effectively.  The movie shows the problems with the actor, as a person, but it does not show why this person should be the star of the film.  Perhaps the film was made with a good cast, but not the film maker who thought the film needed this person playing the role.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this was an amazing flick. The production was amazing and everything looked like a big budget film. The movie was actually well done. It did have some faults, but it looked beautiful. But then there was a scene that I didn't like. It was a little corny and felt like a cheap try at comedy. This movie just needed to stop. The story was good, but the acting wasn't as good as it should be. Some of the actors could have been better. It all seemed a little forced and didn't seem to be really going anywhere. Also, I don't really understand the story line or characters. But I guess the movie was made to promote their new product, "Stacy's Baby Milk."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not good, and not fun. It was boring, and had no originality. It would not get any worse, and it could not get better. The production quality was horrible, and the acting was all very one-dimensional. The sound effects were so over the top that it was hard to believe they were supposed to be realistic. If I were to watch this movie today, I'd pass it up in disgust.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was very entertaining but the plot was very bad. This movie is good but I think it needs a director who knows how to write a good movie. The ending was stupid and unnecessary. I was expecting a lot from this movie and it was just a wasted chance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When it comes to horror movies, I know what I'm looking for. A well made movie, with good actors, and good gore. However, this movie is a train wreck and is full of stupid things that make the movie really pointless. A bad horror movie, but if you want a cheap thrill, you can't go wrong with this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie many times, and it is all about the same thing, which is an annoying man. He has a terrible attitude, and in all the movies he was in he had an obnoxious one. This time he is played by a very creepy old man, who is also a bad role. The plot is like every other horror movie that you can think of, but it's just boring and over the top.   The special effects are very crude, and the movie has a lot of cheesy, "Oh my God" moments. The special effect at times are just not done right. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never had this movie. It came on tv. I saw it a week after it came out on vhs. I was a big fan of the tv show and the movie. I remember thinking it was great. But it's a bad adaptation of the book. The book doesn't take place in the late sixties. It takes place later in the 60's. This movie changes the story completely and makes the characters much more likable. It's like the book was written for the tv but the script was written by people who never read the book or have any knowledge of it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It has some good moments, but you are too busy being confused to really care. It's a fun time when you're just bored. I would have enjoyed a more involved story, but this one is a quick and silly movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have had a hard time trying to put my finger on what exactly went wrong with this movie. The story is good, and at times, the acting is so good that it makes up for it. The film has great effects, and that always makes the difference. The characters are so completely and totally evil that it is hard to enjoy watching a film where anyone isn't a villain, and some are just so bad that they really are not worth watching. But the bad actors really do not work, and it is difficult to believe they could be given the opportunity to do the kind of bad acting they did. The most memorable scene is when two soldiers take their prisoner out into the desert, and the prisoner is shot in the back of the head by the soldiers. It makes for a really tense and scary scene, but the movie is so bad at acting that the camera never even looks at the victim. The whole film looks like it has been shot on a low-budget film. The movie makes some really great special effects, but they are ruined by a poor acting and script. This is one of those rare films where the actors are actually worth watching, but just cannot do anything well. The acting in this movie is simply awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While the story is interesting, the plot gets old. The acting and acting performances are nothing special and the production values are lousy. The plot is not very convincing.   A lot of this movie was filmed on location at a military base in Pennsylvania. While there is a military facility, it is not a major facility. There is a lot of "out there" scenery in this movie.  This movie seems to be shot for the military base. There are a few scenes where the soldiers are outside of their base or on different bases. This movie was shot in 1980, so it is a little dated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad. The only redeeming quality of the film is that it was made in the 50s so it was pretty dated. I'm glad it's available on DVD, though. It is about a boy (Tom Selleck) who becomes a war hero for defending his small town during a nuclear war. It was actually pretty good!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is awful and I would never recommend it to anyone.  A horrible, terrible film that should be watched in a theater.   It is absolutely one of the worst movies ever made.  The film has no actors, it has no dialogue, it is an epic disaster, and it is complete nonsense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a horrible movie. I was expecting a good movie, and instead this turned out to be a gross joke. The acting was terrible and the humor was really lame. There were tons of references and it was pretty long. The story of the kids getting a gold watch out of a treasure chest with no place to hide was totally ridiculous. And the actors seemed to be trying too hard to be cool. I'd have been better off watching the video of the movie on Youtube.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie but the ending is really bad.   The movie is about a big dog who saves a baby bird but his girlfriend leaves him because she did not want to leave her babies.  The dog is then killed by a car and he is sent to heaven where he met Jesus.  After a while the angel comes back to tell the girl that her babies are dead and she should be happy.  I am sure that people love dogs and the movie was very cute.  However, the ending was really bad and I really hated the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really liked this movie and the cast was so great. The plot was good, and it had a great lead performance from James Caan. But at the same time, the movie was a mess. If you're looking for a good action movie with a good story, this isn't the one for you. I found the acting to be terrible, but even James Caanon can be really irritating. And his co-stars don't add anything to the movie. The best thing I can say is that the movie made it to #13 on The Best of the 70s list in 1979.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie sucks   The acting is bad   How many times has this film been released on DVD and why was no one really watching it?   It is really hard to watch this movie because most people have never seen it   I would have liked to watch it in theaters   So if you ever saw it and you don't know what to do with your life, it is still worth checking out  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is based on the novel by Kurt Vonnegut who wrote several other short stories like Breakfast of Champions, Cat's Cradle, Slaughterhouse-Five, and Player Piano. While this movie is an interesting adaptation it doesn't match the writing and Vonneguts vision.   He uses the concept of time travel to give an interesting concept and the fact that it's not used in this story is what makes it so interesting.  The special effects are fantastic though.  It does not match the great work by the Vonneguss character.  Overall a good film but is not worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie with a good cast.   The acting was all bad.  The lead in this was an idiot, and the two other lead roles are terrible. The only reason this was made was because the studio thought that they could make some money and just had the actor and the crew of the movie do as much as they could to make it look like a big studio production. The acting in this movie is just bad and the music is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was great, but I found the movie a chore to watch and the production quality to be far below that of most movies of its ilk.    This movie is a parody of the 1980s, complete with black and white.  This is a movie that was created to bring in younger viewers to the movies.  I don't even see how they could possibly market this movie.  For an 80's movie that has no connection to the movie that came out before it, this movie is downright terrible.  And if that isn't bad enough, the sound was horrible.  It had no music and it seemed like they just used a sound effect every 5 seconds.  If this movie was made today, they'd have to do a lot of work to pull it off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very cheap movie with a terrible story and poorly acted by a group of idiots.   In my opinion, the director should be ashamed of his horrible movie.  For anyone interested in the story of a family man and his wife's attempt to escape from Cuba to their children, it was a waste of money.  The acting by everyone is poor, the writing is terrible, and it was poorly filmed and edited.  I have never seen so much wasted time and money for this little movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The entire movie is a complete mess.  It has no pace, no direction, and is absolutely terrible in all aspects.  The actors, who are supposed to be the stars, seem to be there only to be annoying.  As far as acting goes, this movie had a lot of people who had no talent.  These people are supposed be the best in the business and should be able to bring something good out of the character.  They did not do that at all.  I just kept thinking, "That is it? That's all she did?"  I am embarrassed to watch a movie that was made like this.  Not only is the acting awful, the acting is awful at all the characters.  A lot of the actresses just seem to have no talent at all, which is so sad because the acting has a lot to offer.  For a movie like this to be so bad it has to be bad on all fronts is too much to believe.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was hoping to see some good things in this movie, but I don't get any of it. It is a mess of an action film, with absolutely no plot, no character development, and a plot with absolutely zero logic.   One of the actors in the movie looks like a robot.  All of the other actors seem like they just wanted to be in the film for the money, and they played the role of a robot like they wanted to act as robot. That isn't to say it is bad, but it was a pretty big waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoyed the movie because of how original it was. It was kind of cool that there was only one scene in the whole movie and it was a very unique scene and it really caught me off guard and I didn't know what to think about it. The acting was great and everything was set up perfectly for the movie. The whole movie was a really well written movie and the actors did a great job. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves a classic sci-fi movie or anyone that likes a good action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only movie i was watching last night that was not an insult to the intelligence of my viewer.   It wasn't as good as some of the others in the series that i was seeing but it had a good ending.  And i didn't have a problem with the fact that it was a long movie (2hrs), but it took too much out of me in the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first 15 minutes of this movie are just a waste of time, with the main character getting his ass kicked by a drunk guy for no reason.   This movie will make you think you're a badass for being in a karate fight.  The story does not add anything, you know who's been in this place, you don't get any of the characters' back stories.  When the movie was over, I felt cheated.  This is the last movie I will watch in my lifetime because they were not going to make me laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is about a man who lives alone and gets into a fight with his daughter in the street. It seems to be about some kind of accident that happened, the daughter is never mentioned again, and the man only appears in a few close-ups (when his head is buried in a tree). There was no way that this could have been made at this time (1975) to be a funny movie, even by today's standards. It looks very silly and is nothing but a cheap B-movie, filled with bad acting, dialogue, and a bad script. The movie looks very cheap, with all the effects done cheaply and the camera work just does not work. There are also a lot of long takes of long shots of a group of people talking at the edge of a cliff.   I don't recommend this to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is called "Toxic Avenger", but that sounds horrible, and in fact it is, it is bad. The special effects in the movie were all pretty terrible and when you try to shoot somebody you don't even get blood or anything like that, it was just some smoke and smoke, and it didn't have much of an impact. You could tell they tried to make it look like a big green alien monster with the big green face, but it was really just smoke and green.   There were plenty of scenes in the story where a green alien is attacking a person and I thought they had to have some kind of special effects to help make it work, and when a person gets attacked by this green alien, it's really not like the alien should be moving really fast and flying at them at a high speed, it should be just sort of slowly walking or something. It is hard to tell because it was kind of hard to get all the angles and stuff, but the people they use are all pretty bad, all they have are some really slow people running and some really fast people and they do the whole thing with one character who is a really big old man who doesn't seem to be able to move at all.  I would like to see a better version of this movie, and I guess you could call it a "Titanic II" or something, but I don't think they had any chance of getting anyone to want to watch it, and they are probably going to make a sequel to this movie at some point, but they might as well make it so that this movie was made to get the attention of all the big guys at Paramount and Warners. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I haven't seen this one. I'm sure it will be great. But I have no interest in watching a bad film. I want to see good films.   This film is awful.  The plot is really poor. It seems as if the director wanted to get a big name in this film and wanted to use that to sell the film. But you would have thought that if they needed a star to sell a film they would have chosen an actual star.  All of the characters are horrible. The best part of this film is the special effects.  I think that they had a great plan to make the film seem like something it isn't.  This is a bad excuse for a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is very bad. Very short and not very good. I would not recommend this movie for anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a horrible waste of time. The plot is a complete mess. A young girl moves into a huge estate. Her mom's dead and her dad remarried. There's lots of fun stuff going on. But then, in the middle of all this fun, a guy who's in the neighborhood gets murdered. He had a wife, three kids, and was a good person. Now, the daughter has been locked in this place for a year with nothing to do. I was going to watch a movie, but it just got worse and worse as I watched it. There was a killer in the house! There were ghosts and evil things around the house that needed to be destroyed! Why was this movie made in the 1980s? I hate it!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is just a bad, boring, poorly directed, and poorly acted movie. There is one bad line in the whole movie, and that line made me hate the movie. If the movie makers could not make it more entertaining, then they would have had to make the whole film more entertaining to try to get an average rating.   I think this movie has ruined many lives because it's boring and has nothing interesting to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see this movie on the way home from a concert, and it was really depressing, and I really hated that the lead girl got to go home and watch the movie and she looked so tired. The scene at the end with the old woman's house and the old couple crying and going down the stairs was so terrible that I just wanted to vomit.     This movie is about an evil clown that is the cause of a lot of murders, and the lead clown tries to protect a little girl by putting a baby doll in her mouth that she would be able to watch and laugh at the clown, and when the child goes to the hospital for some tests, she is found to be "dead" the next morning and the police are trying to find the killer. I think the movie was filmed on video and was taken off the shelf and put on the shelf in an office and the owner left it on his shelf. I saw a lot worse movies that were far worse.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is bad.  I had to turn away a few times and thought I was watching a bad video.  The film is so low budget and poorly edited and some of the dialogue is so bad it makes the entire movie look like it's trying to be funny.   This film is just a joke, not worth watching, especially for kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My fiance and I did not like this movie at all. First of all, it had very poor acting and bad direction. The actor playing the character of Mr. Big said it very poorly that we just didn't really get what was going on. I think that's pretty much it. The other actors playing the other two female characters were also not very good. The first one was played by a girl that was actually about 10 years older than the other female. I thought that she was playing a 13 year old girl, but the age was really a problem because she was over 10 years younger than the 12 year old who was supposed to be playing the lead. The second female character was played very well, but she was not a "real" girl, rather she was a really young girl that could have been any of the young girls on tv. So the rest of the female actors playing girls looked really young and looked more like kids than actual girls. Not that there was a problem with them in the movie, but they didn't look like real girls.   We went into this movie thinking we would enjoy it and we did. The characters were not very developed, but we didn't have to wait for them to become more like a real girl to enjoy them. The story was not very well written, but it was entertaining enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As a first timer, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie. I didn't really get the comedy or the acting or the action but what made it good was how well it captured the atmosphere of an old time radio station.   The ending was disappointing, and I was hoping that they would come up with another good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    * The only reason I gave it a 4 is because of its plot and some of the dialogue. A great movie though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A poorly written and rushed movie. No one seems to remember that the plot is really quite funny.   It does have the ability to be very funny and it does have some great action scenes but the story is rushed so many times.  When you are looking at a movie and you can tell that it has not been well made, its probably not going to be any good.  It seems that this was a movie that was produced to give a decent movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've never seen this movie or been to this place, but from what I've read and seen, this place looks like a bad dream.   This movie was very weird. I had no interest in going to the "Disco" for no reason.  They only had one table in the "dance" area, and you had to pay to get in.  It was just a bunch of people dancing to pop songs and the music was terrible.  The only people I saw dancing were a couple who were really skinny. It was really annoying to see how short they were.  I found it really odd.  If you want to go see a weirdo disco, this is the place to go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is NOT worth a single dime. The acting is laughable, the dialogue is annoying, the story is bad, and the actors are all playing the same character. I found no enjoyment in watching this movie and I'm disappointed that the creators even got in this project.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The bad movies don't go away! The bad film at the theater where I went had the most laughable dialogue and bad acting. The other bad movie at that theater has the worst acting, writing, and direction. The acting in this one was very poor. I can't remember any one who seemed believable. It had the worst characters in it. I didn't find anyone in it I could really connect with. My friend was laughing his head off at everything. I'm glad I didn t get it and I hope I never see this one again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was just watching a movie at my friend's house, and I came across the movie. I didn't think it was bad at all. I watched it in about a week and then went back and watched it again the next night at my friends house and I was a bit confused.   The movie was very old school, and had an old school feel to it. The plot of the movie was about a guy who has been in the military for 20 years, and he is trying to get revenge on the man who was in his unit that was supposed to be "dead" or "kicked out" 20 years before, but somehow never turned up. So the plot was really just a little different from most old school movies. It really didn't have much going on, and the acting wasn't as good.  I really think the movie would have been better if the plot had been changed, and maybe the actor who played the guy with the sunglasses on should have been a little bit older. I think he was probably about 30-35. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie.   I was expecting something good with the casting.  There was absolutely nothing that could make the movie interesting.  The acting was terrible.  I think that all the actors had the same voice and everyone just looked alike.  A couple of them were on drugs and had the most boring dialogue.  Not worth watching if you want an entertaining movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went into this movie with no expectations and left with a feeling that the entire thing was pointless. If you don't really care about the movie you have a choice to either be entertained by the antics of a bunch of dumb kids, or you can be pissed at the director for wasting a good opportunity to do a good movie.   The movie begins with a scene with the entire family sitting around a table. A large, balding, pompous man (played by William Fichtner) is about to give a speech at a high school reunion. The kids want to hear it, but their parents don't want them to. Then a few of the kids jump in, saying "I want to go with the rest of the band!". The older kids turn to the younger kids and begin yelling out the song. The movie then cuts to the principal (James Mason) telling the kids that there is nothing to see and that they don't need to listen to this stupid shit. Next it cuts to a group of kids at a baseball game. The camera pulls back to reveal a bunch more kids jumping up and down, trying to get the attention of the crowd. It cuts to another group at a game. They look like they were in a very old western, probably from the 1930's. The whole movie is just an excuse to have the kids do silly antics. In one scene a kid with a shaved head is doing flips. After they jump up and do the flips, the scene cuts to some kids at the beach. The director just cuts in and out of a group doing nothing while he walks along behind them.  They are even trying to have a party during one of the scenes. The scene cuts back to the kids at school. They start talking about how it was so fun to go to the beach with a group. After the scene they walk off to go have a little fun on the beach, which they do by jumping up on a rock and throwing sand in each other's eyes. This is repeated several times in the movie, yet this is supposedly supposed to be entertaining.  These are the only 2 scenes that were entertaining to me.  It wasn't even that bad.  The only bad thing about the film was the acting. All of the children were stupid and their performances were terrible. They would make the most idiotic facial expressions and not seem to be enjoying it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In spite of the fact that this movie is bad, it was fun for a few minutes and I'll probably watch it again. The characters, as the movie implies, are all very strange. All the characters in the movie, from the main character, and her sister (with a nice accent) and the son (with no accent) to the kid in the park (who doesn't speak a word of English and has a very annoying accent) really annoys me, and the only reason I enjoyed this movie for a brief moment was because of the guy who goes to school with the kid and they are almost always fighting. This is a movie for adults only (for example, I watched it with a 4 year old, and he had a blast playing the kid).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are a couple good movies in this series but they don't stick in your head like they did when I first watched it.   The only good thing about this is that it gets the story off on the right foot.  The second half of the film is just the plot-twists, and then it just repeats the plot twists over and over again.  I was ready to watch another movie, and when the end came around I couldn't stop thinking about the characters and who they might have been with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen so many bad movies that I just know there are many more that will be good when I am older.   The story is not great.  The acting was very bad.  This was the best thing they could think of.  I'll probably never watch this again, but I know I'll remember it when it is on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie about a group of people who are sent to prison for killing people and not really knowing why... but that is just a small detail. It would be better if the main characters actually knew why they were doing what they did and not just do it because it was done in a story.   I didn't like the movie at all. I don't really know why this movie was made but it was poorly made. I think it was a mistake to use that girl as the main character. She is not the only one who is just too much of a bitch. The other girl is not even interesting because she is a boring character. The characters didn't seem to have a good reason for doing what happened, they just did it. I'm not saying that the guy or girl is innocent but at the end they just don't seem like good people.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is really not worth watching.   They just kept changing and changing the script. I'm pretty sure it was supposed to be "Gangster of Love" in the first place, but the director didn't like that.  A lot of the actors don't seem to have any chemistry with each other.  For some reason, they changed a couple lines to have some "safer" version in case someone wasn't supposed to know about the murders.  One of the main characters is played by the same actor as the main bad guy.  They filmed a real street fight scene in the desert, but then the desert was really a lot better to film.  So for all the hype they made about this film, it is really a cheap action movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is an unmitigated disaster from start to finish. It takes itself too seriously, and is just a huge waste of time.   The acting is laughable.  A few minor characters make the movie, but most of the characters are completely uninteresting.  I would have loved to see some kind of original story with a lot more humor and actual action.  Why did this film have to be so bad?   In all seriousness, this film is a big waste of my money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is about a man who is an alcoholic and a thief. He has a family and a wife who loves him but he just doesn't get it. The movie does not show the true nature of the man but shows his weakness and how he deals with this in a way that makes it worse. He is addicted to a very dangerous substance that gives him hallucinations and the ability to see people in the past and in the future, etc. He does not think before he takes the drug but the consequences are always worse than the good that he gets from the drug. The family was a mess with the wife not wanting to believe that she is dead and the wife's new boyfriend doing all the work. I wouldn't have believed that the wife is still alive but the movie makes you think it could be. It is very boring and not very realistic. The script was very bad and didn't fit the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was boring and predictable and the acting was terrible.    My parents and I watched this movie at my grandma's house. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "If you have the money for something this great, there are plenty of movies that will give it a run for your money."   This is my third time watching the film (the first was the original) and the same problems, but worse.   I'm a huge Robert Zemeckis fan but I find this movie is just as bad as the original.  The story is pretty much the same and there is no humor, just sad and depressing.  I think it would be a better movie if it was about a bunch of guys who are on a quest to rescue a princess (like Zemeckses own film "The Day the Earth Stood Still") but for some reason no one is doing anything with this story, which is a real shame because I really like it.  So many actors in this film are horrible (I just noticed that one of them is playing a character that looks exactly like Will Smith).  I don't know how they ended up with this guy to play the lead character (he looks about a 10 years older than his character) but the casting is really bad.  They just do not have anyone who is a good actor who can do the scenes they are trying to do.  One thing I'm pretty sure this movie was made for is a remake of the cult film "Rescue Dawn" but they tried to hide all of the terribleness by using a big budget so it will be worth the money.  Also the movie is way too long, there should be a short version that has just one story (like the first time I watched it I just wanted to go home and watch it all over again)  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a total piece of garbage! Why did I sit through this? The actors were really bad and the director (who plays himself) was also bad.   The only thing I remember is that the bad guy was wearing a white robe with a black cape and the bad guys voice was the stereotypical "ghetto guy" voice.  This film was so bad that when I watched it with my granddaughters (we had just watched The Big Lebowski and that was what our minds were going off of) they could not figure out if it was a movie, a television show or the bad kid from The Big lebowski.  All of the actors were so bad in this that I almost wanted to throw this out the window.  The acting in this film was terrible and one of the worst movies I have seen.  It's so bad it almost makes me want to watch the bad boy from The big lebowski and say "what a dumbass" (it's the same actor as the "bad boy" from The bad boy in the movie...just in a different outfit).   A film like this is just an insult to any film or actor.  For one thing, this "black ghetto" movie takes place in a city that has many people of color. This was done to make the film more "black" by showing black people in a non black setting and making the baddies look like they are black.  I feel like they would make a better film with a white lead, but this film made the audience think it was black, and that's what you want when making a black film.  After this film I was so angry at this director and at the actors because what did they do to deserve this film?  It was just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're not a fan of the James Bond films or the action films of the seventies, then this one won't be anything for you. This film was directed by David Niven and it was a good idea. Unfortunately the plot was so bad it really wasn't funny, and even if it was it was very hard to care about the main character and his love interest. This was a very uninspired movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible film. It was bad enough that I would not watch it again, but I had forgotten how bad it was. The actors are all completely terrible. One actress is really awful. They don't know what a role is supposed to look like and they seem to be trying all sorts of things out to get a character to look realistic and natural. I think it's funny that this director is trying to act as if he cares about these actors, but he doesn't. The music is terrible too. There is no atmosphere and it doesn't fit the film at all. The acting isn't even worth the price of admission.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought it was just really bad. I'm not saying it was bad, just that I just didn't want to watch it. I mean, I'd seen "The Last Detail" before, but I thought this one was even worse.   It was also very badly acted.  I'm sure it's a good movie, but... I was not looking forward to watching it either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is bad. It is a film about the war of the 20's, but it is not as good as the book. The film was so poorly acted that when there was a shootout or fight the actors didn't act, but just jumped and did the movements.   The characters were lame and did not have any real depth.  There was a scene where a man is being driven to a military prison for being a spy and he tells a joke and the soldiers laugh and that is the funniest thing in the movie.  These soldiers do not act like actual soldiers.  A good movie would have been a good war movie, but this is a disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie of the year!   This is terrible!  The plot is so stupid and you do not learn anything from it, but if you like mindless movies, you will love this movie. I was expecting to see some amazing effects or something, but all you see is a bunch of people sitting on the ground eating chips and drinking soda and it is not funny at all.  It is like a bad 90s action movie.  The main character is a man who has lost his mind.  If you like this kind of crap, go watch an action movie, not a horror movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is crap. I hated it the first time I watched it, and when I saw it a few years ago it really didn't impress me. This movie should be called, "Don't put on a show for me." It is not a good movie, nor a good director, nor does it have a good cast. It is just a very bad movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen this movie when I was very young. As a child I knew nothing about the movie so I had never even heard of it until I found out that this movie was based on a book called "The House at Pooh Corner". I thought this movie had a nice ending.   There are several things I don't like about this movie. I don 't like the bad voice overs, I don t like the actors in the movie, and I don' t like how people die off screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For a bad flick, it's pretty good.   It looks and feels like a cheesy teen flick from the 80's.  The only thing that doesn't work well in this film is that the movie never seems to take itself seriously.  In one scene, a couple gets together and it's like this movie is just trying to make them seem hot.  It just doesn't do it.  This movie is a good look at some of the craziest sex acts you can think of.  Not a bad watch if you're looking for a cheesy 80's flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a big disappointment.   The whole plot and everything was so boring.  They had to give a movie that has so much potential a movie this boring because no one would be interested.  I didn't like how the director was talking on the phone, which made me think that he didn't know what he was talking about.  There were so many clichés about a group of people who don't know how to get along in the real world.  The movie just wasn't funny, it was boring and pointless.  This movie was supposed to be an American made movie with an American director.  You really have to make it like a western, I was expecting something like "A Fistful of Dollars" or "The Searchers" or something else with good acting.  What did the writer do?  He just took the characters and made it a western.  Just like they did in "The Magnificent Seven"  Why make it a Western if you don't have to? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It really doesn't matter what you do if you're going to end up making a shitty movie. The film was pretty good at first and I loved it. It has a very entertaining plot and really keeps you entertained during the 80 minute runtime. It's all very silly and it's funny all the way through. However, it starts to turn around towards the end and by the time I'm through with it, I didn't care for the film.  The first half of the film was a great start but by the last third, I just wanted it to end. It just felt like it was dragged on. The acting is okay at best and the dialogue seems a bit overdone.  I really loved the music and I would have given it a higher rating if it didn't seem to be so overbearing.   I would recommend this film to anyone. It definitely has a unique premise and it has a great plot.  It has an excellent cast and the humor is pretty funny. It doesn't disappoint.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is the worst I have seen in years.   The film was shot in one continuous take.  The acting is atrocious.  It has a very unsympathetic and nasty vibe.  I would rather watch the first part of the original "Fahrenheit 9/11".  This film should have been shot in black and white.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was really bad movie, it was good only for one scene, in this scene he got shot and the doctor said the movie was bad, but I don't think it was bad at all  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have a soft spot in my heart for the classic horror/thriller/mystery genre, but this one is too convoluted, pretentious, pretense-driven, and poorly acted to live up to its potential.   The movie starts off with a slow, creepy crawl through the corridors of a house. The house itself has been taken over by a dark force that has transformed the people living in the house, all of them into ghosts and skeletons with their faces completely missing.  The first person to see this, a young woman (Liv Tyler) has an unexplained encounter with one of these creatures, but the house itself is not completely clear. We discover that this house was once the home of a wealthy woman named Florence (Marilyn Monroe), who was murdered when her husband found her corpse in the basement of the house.  She was believed to have been murdered by an unknown serial killer, but was actually killed by the house's previous owners, and her killer was never caught.  This story has a lot going for it, but it's mostly missing one crucial ingredient: an original and originalistic twist.  Unfortunately, this film's story doesn't make any sense at all, and the twist never seems quite right.  It doesn't even feel like the house is being haunted at all - there's just so much tension, and this whole house seems to be in such a state of disrepair.  I feel that a lot of the "mysterious" aspects of this house have a little too much of the campy/comedy vibe, and I can't help but think of it as a "slasher" movie, like Halloween or Friday the 13th, because a lot has gone on in this house over the years, and a lot is still "haunting."  If this film is going to have any success in America, then it needs to find a different direction.  If the film's writer and director/writer, John McTiernan, is ever going to make a film with the same level of quality as the James Wan film from ten years ago, it's going to be with a totally different story, and with a different director.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is just bad. It starts with a very funny scene, which is about a very good friend of the main character, and a guy named John who loves him. But then they start to go in a very bad direction. It turns into one very nasty scene after another, which were very badly directed. They try to make the movie seem like a very serious movie, and at one point when they're talking about something serious they just turn around and put a really bad joke in their scene. It's just not funny. The plot is also kind of a joke. It has nothing to do with the main characters. The main character is so good looking that he makes the other two girls all jealous. The two girls, who are all very very pretty and cute, decide to steal the guy away from the other guy. After they do that, they make him go to a very boring party where he meets some people at a coffee shop. I think that it's all just kind of very stupid. I don't see why people like to watch such bad movies.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you're looking for a fun, fast paced adventure, look elsewhere.   There's no humor or charm in this movie.  The cast does the best they can, and make it believable that it would be fun to be a pirate.  There is a reason the pirates were so greedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie the director has some nice moments. The acting is all good and the plot keeps you interested. It was all done well, but for some reason this movie had a hard time getting a release. I was waiting for this movie for some time and finally they released it. It is a decent movie but the sound and acting were horrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a total ripoff of a TV series about an astronaut who comes back from space and is forced to live with his former partner (which is actually the show's original writer). The movie has a good cast, and is not too bad for a TV movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is not even good.   This movie is about a man, whom we never see in the movie, who's daughter gets killed by a man he was trying to help. It's a very bad movie.  It's one thing to make a movie for kids and teens, but this movie needs an adult's input to be good. I did not enjoy this movie. I think it was produced by the people who made "The Grudge" or "Watchers of St. Olms". I saw this movie because I was bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would give this movie 3 stars instead of 4, as it is a fun film, and it has some good moments. But I have to say that in a couple of the scenes it is almost too obvious that they are trying to get people to laugh.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie for a couple hours and there is absolutely nothing worth watching about it. No plot, no drama, nothing really happens in this movie, which is weird because the first half was very good. The main character is the daughter of a wealthy family, and she decides to be a writer. There are a couple of characters that really deserve more screen time, but they don't get any. There is a good part of the movie where she meets a group of artists and she starts to realize how little she knows about life and art and what really makes people happy. I really wish it had been a couple more hours so that I could have seen how her life turns out. Also, I wish the music was more interesting than it was.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a mess. It's so bad that I can't believe that people in the real world think it is a good movie. There are no jokes in it, no plot, no characters, no action, and it just gets worse and worse, and worse and then gets really bad. There was so much of it that the camera literally cut to it, like a bunch of people were watching it in the same room, and the camera is just moving in the way that a person might move in the middle of a really bad movie.   There were a lot of bad actors in this movie, the worst being Tony Curtis, who was in The Great White Hope, but this is one of the worst movies Tony Curtis has done in years, and this is a really good actor playing him. The actors should just give it up and get the hell out of the business because this movie was so bad it didn't deserve Tony Curtis. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this is a great movie but, the only real problem with it is that the acting in it is terrible.  The actors really don't show anything more than the camera is pointed at them.   They say this is in the 70s, but the acting looks a lot better in a movie like this where the actors could at least be seen.  This movie was made in 1974 and was the last film made by Sam Peckinpah. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I never had a bad time playing the 'Willy Wonka' card. I had a good time watching the movie."   "The 'Wonka' movie is just silly. It has nothing to do with Willy Wonka's candy, the chocolate or the game of riddles. Willy won't even tell us how the movie is to be played. No matter how many times I watch it, I can't figure out why they made this movie. The characters are all stupid. And Willy himself is one of them. There is not a word he says that is true. And if you are interested in anything of the real world, you won't find any clues there." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had watched this movie at least three times by this point. I loved the plot, but was never satisfied with the execution. It was almost as if the director just went for a quick buck and forgot to put in the time and effort to really make the movie. It would have been better if he had made a sequel to the movie or something.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's just something about this movie that makes it not worth watching at all. It's just a complete waste of time.   The actors don't do anything interesting for the most part.  I found it difficult to stay interested in this movie, especially since the acting was so bad.  The plot didn't even add to the story, it just kept repeating and repeating itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a really, really bad movie, and it's one of the most offensive films I've seen. It's really, in my opinion, not a "true" war movie. I wouldn't classify it as "true." I think the main character is being used, and the acting, while well done, is pretty much terrible. Not to mention the way the film is made is offensive.   A movie like this is not worth watching, unless you're a true, in depth "war-time" aficionado. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am sorry this movie is so bad.  I was watching it and thinking how horrible it was, but I was really surprised at the awfulness.   The actors are awful.  The acting in this movie was horrible.  These actors are supposed to be actors but they did nothing.  They were terrible and the acting was so bad it was laughable.  It was a bad effort of a movie.  This is not a good movie at all, it was not funny, it did not have the potential to be bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I enjoyed this movie.  This is a pretty straight-forward comedy.  If you are looking for a straight-up comedy, this movie will not give you much.  I think this is one of the more enjoyable movies that you can watch.   It is fairly funny.  The only thing that can be really annoying is how it cuts off a lot of the scenes and then picks up a second or third scene later on.    I got this movie at a screening of some other movies.  At the screening, the guy in charge of showing the film said it was "good but a little short".  I like that they kept the movie short.  A couple of the jokes could have been cut down. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is very bad and very poorly acted. You'll think you are watching the "Hollywood" version of the movie.   The worst thing about this movie is that you think you see it on tv but when the film ended, you will find out that it was filmed on a soundstage.     Also, the film is filmed very poorly.  And the acting is very poor as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of actors try their hand at comedies. The problem with most of them is that they can't hold a joke for more than a second. You can't tell if they laughed or if they were scared.    The most memorable character of this movie is a black guy who makes jokes about being tired.  And the one of the worst movies ever is when the movie's narrator goes on a rant about white people trying to steal the land and white women sleeping with white men. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you want something that will make your day when you get home, this movie is for you.   But...the movie has a lot of "tricks" that I find to be very annoying, and sometimes a bit over the top.  The "dramatization" of a great story, it's one thing. But this is the same story told, and with almost no changes, with a completely different actor.  But this does not matter at all.  What i find really annoying are the "action" scenes.  They're not long and they're never exciting.  I mean, these guys, they could have been working in real life, they should have been real action heroes.  Also, I think that the "heroes" in this movie are very...shallow and/or unimportant.  To me, they don't seem to have any depth.  These people were great actors and they could give anyone great performance, but they seem to give these "hero" performances that don't really have any real substance, and they just sound very cheap.  Overall, this is a great movie, but it's just a bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending was the worst part of this movie.  The story was really good, but the ending sucked. I hated everything about this movie and I would never watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best movie i have seen in a while. It is so much better than what i saw on amazon and i wish they would remake it. i wish i had seen this movie a long time ago!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A good movie is not hard to watch even if its really bad. This movie is so bad it should be illegal. The movie is totally worthless. It should be banned.   I had not even seen the movie before I read this review, and then I heard that it was the worst movie in history. I thought it was a real shame that Hollywood made such a pathetic film to show the world. What makes this worse is that this movie is even worse than the one that it's based on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am so glad I did not see this movie. This movie is so over the top. They are so over acting and the acting is so bad. I am not going to watch any more of these movies from these stars. I will never go see a movie starring this people ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is horrible, I was surprised at the horrible acting, the acting was terrible, the music was bad, and the story wasn't really good either. The whole movie was just awful, and it's supposed to be a love story between two guys, but this movie was all about the sex and the sex was terrible. I really hated the movie and felt like it was just another "love story", that made the entire movie just lame, and for a movie where the sex scene didn't even get a good look at my face, the fact that they used CGI to make me look like I was having sex was even worse.   I am actually glad that I never got to see this movie because I really felt that it wasn't good and I hated the way it was made, and I don't think that anyone should get to see it ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just watched this movie last night and it had absolutely no impact on me whatsoever. I think it was written for children and made for little girls to watch and get a laugh. The movie was really bad and made no sense at all. All the actors were terrible and the film was all shot in black and white. The film was also poorly written and the writing was bad and I felt that the movie was made for children.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was really surprised about how bad this movie is. This movie would have been better if they didn't use the same actors for the characters, it was really boring and had no suspense at all. This is the worst horror movie I have ever seen.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The biggest weakness in the movie is that it's overrated, because the ending isn't what you expect it to be.   It's not a great movie. The story is predictable. The plot is contrived, and the characters are not well-written. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so excited to see this movie. I loved the trailer. It had lots of cool ideas and the actor looks really good. The movie is just mediocre. The acting was so bad, and the story is just plain stupid. There was no logic to the plot. We know the bad guy is going to escape the police, but why does he need a body to do it? Also, why do the cops need to capture the bad guys so much that they're driving into a lake? The scene in the lake where the bad cop was shooting a bullet at the bad bad guys (which never happened) is a complete ripoff of the movie Escape from New York.    For a crappy movie, the music is good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a good movie for all ages and all levels of interest in cinema. I like the story and the music. My wife, who does not care for a lot of music, loved it. It was entertaining, interesting and entertaining. I do not see how this could have been improved, but it is a lot more entertaining than it is bad. I give it a 7/10 and would recommend it to all people.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I enjoyed this movie a lot and found that it was very funny, but it was really over long.   When they say "20 minutes," they mean "20 minuets."   The movie starts off a little slow, but then the story starts to go off on a little tangent.  This movie is funny, and it is definitely worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is boring. It has bad writing and the acting is terrible. The scene in which a guy has sex with a woman was very embarrassing to watch. I hope the makers do not take this movie and release it with a new title because it is so bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really liked this movie. It was about an elderly woman who was married to her son for many years. After their death they were buried in the backyard, she loved them and wanted to take them back. But a couple of years later her husband was found dead in a basement. I thought she was very selfish. When she found him she was not crying as a widow but as if she wanted to show off by having him buried there. The plot didn't make sense, but the acting was great. I just wish that the plot would have kept going. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was disappointed by this movie. I guess this is because it was produced in the 60s but it doesn't have the same effect as other 60s films. It's more of a historical fiction so I think that makes it better. It had a lot of good actors in it. The music is nice and the story line was great. It also had some great action scenes, but there wasn't a lot to choose from in this movie and I guess that is why I was so disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, the good news is it's good for what it is, not much else. But, the bad news is that it's so bad that it ruins what could have been an amazing movie and ruined what could be a great movie. And even when it's trying to be funny, it just misses the mark. Not funny, but not bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see this with my mom, and it was the first time my mom has ever seen a movie. It was so good, and I got into it so quick because it's so enjoyable. But it's also pretty disturbing.    If your interested, go see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's pretty bad. It's not bad like Star Wars, or bad like Terminator, or even bad like Predator. It is just bad. The acting is horrible and the plot is ridiculous. The action scenes are bad, and all the special effects look fake. It really has no style.   And the worst part is that they did a better film and made more money off of it... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie several times and it always makes me laugh, the comedy always falls right into the right places, but the story and direction are terrible.  The main character is the same as in the last one, a dumb and pathetic loser who has never been able to get any respect from anyone, even from his own sister.  For a second he was so innocent that he didn't know that he was playing a movie, but in a way it was perfect.  They keep adding more and more bad people to make up the film and they never really end up being bad in the end, only funny.  There are some other people in the movie who are funny too, but they are not as good.   It has a few really great lines, but when they come together it feels like a joke.  I also think it's a bit unfair that people are so quick to point out that the movie doesn't have a happy ending.  It doesn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie and loved every scene and scene with a lot of great lines. I loved it. But this movie is over rated and no one liked it. It was crap and I am glad I watched this over a decade ago. I don't like over rated movies at all and this movie was over rated.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "It's an oddity for a director to work from two source material, and the result is a strange, over-determined little piece of work that might have been better off not even being made."   The movie was based on two different books of the same name, both by Douglas Adams, the latter of which I never actually read, but was so far from the actual stories and ideas that I could barely understand them, and which I didn't see the point of reading them in the first place.   My interest was first piqued by the first book, and then I got hooked by the second.  One of the reasons that I thought it would have been a great idea was because it had been done before.  So it was interesting to see how the film got made, especially since it was made for little money and it seems like Adams could have probably made a good movie even without the book.  I thought the director, George Nolfi, was trying to make the movie from the book, but it's actually a lot more like a director's cut of the first movie than the original movie.  And it seems as if Adams has a few lines of dialogue that he's cut out of the original version, which was disappointing.  This movie should not have been made. It is a mess.  If you don't like Douglas Adams or don't enjoy reading the books, you will probably hate this movie. If you are interested in some classic sci-fi or fantasy, I suggest you pick up either the original book or the movie first.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is terrible, the acting is terrible and the plot is bad.   I saw this movie twice, both times at the theater with a large group of people. This movie really is an eyesore of a movie, and a huge disappointment to anyone who thought it would be interesting.   -  "This movie is like watching the Titanic sink to the bottom of the ocean.  I will never go to another movie because of this one." -     It looks like a terrible film from the start. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a huge disappointment to me.  It does have its good points but this movie was way over priced, I paid the money but this was overpriced for what you get.  I will never watch this movie again, it made me feel horrible because I paid over the top for a "pump and dump" movie.  The director should have had someone at the beginning of the movie explaining all the "accidents" before it even starts, he would have saved the viewers time and frustration.  Also I am disappointed that this movie will never be remade.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is so much dialogue that you don't know what is going on. The actors seem confused in almost every scene. The music and sound effects are terrible. You have to pay attention to the subtitles as it gets way more ridiculous than it should. I gave this movie zero stars and I think it's time to take it off my "to watch" list. I'd never see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a great film, and what I got was a bad film, as bad as the original film in which this is an adaptation.  It is basically the same story from the old film, except that they take this time and make the story more silly and campy.  The plot is stupid, the acting is bad, and the acting leads the viewer to expect the worst from the film, which is what happens.   The special effects are ridiculous, but at least they are not so terrible as to spoil the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story was simple enough.   It had the right amount of humor, but it was a little too light on the drama.  Unfortunately, it didn't really work as well as I would have liked.  The characters were just not interesting.  A little more development could have made this story more intriguing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked this movie. It's a fun movie. But the acting was a little boring and it was too easy to tell where the joke was going.   In short, it was kind of lame.  I'm not saying it wasn't good in my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Just wanted to say that the movie had a great story but the acting was awful, and I can't remember anything about the story because I couldn't hear the dialogue at all, it was just kind of blurry and out of focus, I was just watching it on TV and I saw a car running down the street and it looked like it was chasing the cops, but I could not tell what the cop was doing. The scene where the car crashes was very disturbing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is an awful film. Not only did it fail to live up to its potential as a film, it failed to live out a story. It does not follow the first film by a long shot.  The film begins with a group of teens trying to score drugs, and ends with a big explosion with the teens caught in the middle. The film has no sense of place, or any real sense of story. The cast seems very uninspired and the acting is terrible.  This is a film that will only add to the list of trash films made during the 1990s. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It had nothing to do with "being a bad person".   You don't even know what a "good" person is.   The best thing that could be said about this movie was that it was made in the early 60's.  It is an old style of film that is still in use today.  In this movie, the people are just so much better than people in other films in the 70's and 80's. And the violence in this movie is also a bit better than in other 70's films.  If you're going to watch a movie with violence that isn't as great as the one in the old 70's, this is a good place to start. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you don't want to see a remake, do not buy this film.  This is the worst movie to date, and it has everything. Bad acting, bad writing, and bad special effects.  A remake is more than welcome, as there are a lot of movies that are bad, but this one is bad worse than anything that has ever been seen before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a terrible movie to watch. The acting and the writing was awful. I mean really, how can someone say something like that about a movie where a girl gets raped by three men in the bathroom? The plot is awful too.   The movie was supposed to be about a girl who gets raped in the girl's bathroom at a restaurant. I thought this was a really good idea because I liked the movie. The only problem was the acting.  And then when the director wanted to get the girl back to the table and she didn't want to do it, he had her throw up and walk out. This is how you make a movie about a sexual assault.  After she has thrown up and left, the rapist grabs the girl and starts to rape her.  I thought it was disgusting to have the girl walk out of the restaurant while the rapist is raping her. I also thought it is weird that the guy in the restaurant doesn't know if the girl threw up because she is acting like a girl.  The story was really bad.      It really didn't make any sense.  They did a bad job with the script.  No one can do a script like this.  It was really hard to believe that they made it.  If they wanted to make this movie, they should have just done it. It was ridiculous and made no sense. "A girl, raped at a place called "the restaurant", walks out of a restaurant, and gets followed to a parking lot, where she is assaulted by four men who force her into the trunk of a car, rape her, then throw her in the trunk." "A girl who has been raped in a bathroom is chased by her attackers, and is forced to jump out of her car and run into a waiting car. Her assailants then lock the trunk and drive away, and are never caught." "It doesn't take long for an older woman, with a small daughter, to realize that something is terribly wrong. Her neighbor is a prostitute and tells her the same story--a young girl, who just got out of an old-age home, was raped in an old, dark bathroom." "An innocent young girl who is raped by a stranger in the back seat of a parking car, and her assailant is never caught!" This movie was terrible. If they would have just made this movie in 1975, people would have been talking about it instead of making crap like this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only movie i watched recently that was bad and not very good. I'm not too fond of the movie but I guess it wasn't very good at all and is just a bad excuse to make money off the success of the TV show that it is a prequel to.   It has a decent cast but they all are uninteresting and some of the actors are even really bad. It was also shot in a crappy manner. I don't see a single good film in here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen this movie many times. Every time, it seems to be making more and more money. The bad actors and the poor acting are just ridiculous. I wish they would stop making these movies.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A really bad movie. This is a film where a couple are trying to get away from their abusive boyfriends and end up staying together. This doesn't have much to do with the characters, but I still don't like it.  The actors are really bad. They don't seem to have any idea what they are doing or how they are supposed to move the camera, or their expressions.   The sound is really bad, which I suppose is to be expected when you have to shoot on location and shoot all of the bad acting scenes on location.  A terrible script and bad acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry but this movie was a waste of a day of my life. The writing, the acting, the set, the costumes, the action, everything, was all just a joke. I really think that this could have been better had the filmmakers not tried to make a big deal out of this movie, especially after the success of the film "Beverly Hills Cop".   This movie was really not for me.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was pleasantly surprised when I got the DVD of this movie, it is a very well done retelling of the story of the movie.    It is well cast and it does a great job of making the story sound natural.  I did not see it until this summer, but it looks like a lot of people enjoyed it too.  It also seems like it is going to be a hit at the box office, so maybe it will bring the story out for a new generation.  A movie should be enjoyed by everyone regardless of age or gender, if you like good writing and acting, give this a try. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I haven't seen this movie since it was a young child. I think my parents took me to see it because it was in a drive-in.  It's an okay movie, but I wish the music and the sound effects were better! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a big horror fan, and I haven't watched a real "classic" until this movie. The premise is simple - the kid moves into his aunt's house, so she lets him stay for a weekend, and has her mother and brother over. On Sunday night, he comes to bed. His mother, being the most overbearing type ever, grabs the remote control and starts watching TV and playing the "games" on her phone (most of which involved her yelling at her kids and then taking their cell phones away. Her brother, who seems to have no interest in watching TV, is playing a game on his phone, and that's when the lights go out. The whole house is in absolute darkness, and this kid is trapped. It's a horrible movie, but it's real. It really happened.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't understand how a movie like this could be marketed as "comedy." I found it funny and made me chuckle. However, it has nothing to do with a funny movie. The acting was bad. There is no chemistry between the characters and it is hard to feel any sympathy for any of them. All they do is insult each other. It's an anti-social movie. It is a joke. Nothing more.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this movie was awful. I have seen all the big films in Hollywood. They all seem good. I saw this and thought it was a huge disappointment. I could not believe the script of this film was done by a 13 year old. I am embarrassed to see the actors were 13 year olds. I will not be going to see this movie any more. This was a complete waste of time and I can not understand why the studio produced this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie ever made. I mean, if this was an "A-grade" movie it would have been. And it was just horrible. It was filled with bad acting, a bad script, and worst of all, lame performances. If this was made today and was made by a new director, this film would be laughed at and considered one of the worst movies of all time. It would still be funny at times, but you would never hear a joke made by Bill Murray or Tim Allen. It is absolutely horrible.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I ever saw.   There is nothing good about this movie.  The story is terrible and the acting is bad.  This movie is just a mess.  They should never have made this movie, this is really bad. They should have gone with a lesser actor.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was in shock, but my husband was laughing his ass off.   He told me I should be happy, but I think he was saying "I know you're having a bad day, but you have to try it."   The actors seemed like the most uncomfortable on set, but at least they were playing characters.  I have seen some terrible movies with terrible actors, and I always think it's the actors who have the problem, not the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had no idea what to expect from this film and found it a letdown, not for the reasons some people give it credit for. The acting is good, except for one who doesn't seem to want to be there. In the end the film is not a bad film but nothing more than a long commercial for some sort of car, the kind you can use for a brief period of time, then find it's tiresome to drive all the time and never go anywhere.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie is so wrong in every aspect, I would never buy a ticket for it.   You get two completely different performances.  The lead guy is so annoying, he constantly interrupts and annoys the other actors. He doesn't have any lines and he makes all the lines for the other people.  This is such a bad actor.  He makes all of the other bad actors on this movie look good.  Why couldn't he just act like the rest of the cast.  It is funny that a movie like this would be made if he was an actor. He could have been someone with a great career.  If you watch this movie and think it is funny, you are a complete idiot.  I never would have seen this movie if it was not on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie more than a few times but i have never actually enjoyed it. It has always been a chore to get through. The acting is poor. I think it would have been better if they had taken out all the "dummy" characters and only had the baddies to be seen.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film that makes me hate the franchise   is also the worst movie of the whole series.   At one point in the movie they go to a hospital and get a sample from a patient that has an extremely rare form of cancer.  The hospital staff tries to hide what the patient really has and we never really find out what it is.  It looks like a normal lump but in reality it is a tumor, and once it starts to grow it starts eating its own skin and other internal organs.  Once it starts growing in the patient it grows extremely fast and after that it starts destroying his entire body.  This is the first time that anyone tries to kill the patient.  While at the hospital they also try to save him by removing his stomach and heart.  He escapes in the car to a farm where he finds an old truck which is full of weapons.  We then see a large man walking with a long sword, and a small girl.  She starts to walk towards the man.  At first he is afraid, but she smiles and they walk towards each other.  Then suddenly the man pulls out a giant sword which impales her in the chest.  Her body is then ripped in half and it falls to the ground where it explodes and releases her from the explosion.  In the hospital the doctors try to give the patient another shot of an experimental drug, but it only seems to make the tumor grow.  Eventually the hospital staff try to find a solution by extracting more body parts.  They pull the tumor from the patient, but to their horror it begins to grow even faster, and in a few seconds they are all killed by the tumor.  A giant spider crawls out of the tumor and then the movie ends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst films ever made. The dialogue is terrible and the acting is bad. I would not recommend this to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found it hilarious. There is a really great scene where there is a scene on a roof at the beginning and it's raining, and the cops come by and one of them yells at the person watching. When the person turns and sees the cop, the cop's head starts to move back and forth and the guy looks at him. Then the cop gets all pissed and points a gun at the guy and he says: "I was watching you the whole time". That scene was funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think this movie is awful and you should leave it alone.   It is a comedy that features a lot of dumb people that should be in jail.  The acting is terrible in this movie.  For example, when the police officer and the guy with the mustache run into each other at the end of the movie, they have that awkward moment where they stare at each other.  There are some great lines in this film that were supposed to be funny. For example "I don't want to spend my time with you, because you're just another man that tries to make a living. You think you're rich, but you're not.  This guy was a little rich for his money, but it's no excuse for his bad acting and dialogue.  I don't have time to go to a fancy theater and watch the movie like some people do.  It was awful.  They never told me what the title meant and the actors never told the audience what the film was about.  A funny film that you could watch without being bored, but with a few funny moments here and there.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has been out of print for so long. It seems that even the people who had the rights for this film, haven't been interested in making it again.   I was glad to find it at a second-hand shop, but the picture quality is too low to be considered in a theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. I was not sure about it at first and then it got better, the plot was very well done and they even made it sound good (in a cheesy kind of way). However, the ending was stupid and I was bored after a while. I don't think it was worth seeing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a fun film that isn't even good. The actors look like they are playing a video game game. The music is ok. The plot is predictable. It has all the ingredients for a bad film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You know the "I love it" stuff.   "Just the way it was made."   "I still get chills when I think about it."  They are all clichés, so they all must be true, right?  They just do not work for me.  This is one of the worst horror films I have ever seen.  I really could not take the horrible acting.  All the actors were very stiff and lifeless.  The film did not have any sense of danger.  It just showed up one night and then disappeared.  My wife and I did not even know this movie existed.  If I wanted a killer movie, this is not it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie because my aunt is a big horror fan and she suggested it to me. I thought it would be a good idea and for a short horror movie it was very good. Unfortunately my aunt was watching it on her iphone so it was not very clear. I had a lot of fun but the only thing that got annoying is that the movie is almost a parody. If you liked the movie then I suggest you watch it again because it will probably make you laugh harder then you are laughing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is very good as an historical piece and a very entertaining mystery. I did not find the acting to be anything exceptional.   I think I will watch the movie again, as it is a good idea for a crime/mystery movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting something special from this film, but I wasn't able to be disappointed. This is one of those movies you could only watch once and never get the chance to see again. It had me hooked from start to finish and it had me wondering if there was another film in this vein. The ending made no sense to me and it was one of the biggest let downs of a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is a retelling of a book, The Bible. A story of how the Bible is wrong in every way. The actors who are portraying the characters are very stiff and do not have a natural charisma. I do not believe they actually know what they are doing and make the entire film like it is written on the page. The ending was very bad. There is NO payoff. I guess if the actors did not have such a small role in the whole film then it would have been better.   I hope the directors read the Bible. The story should have been changed to about the Bible as a story about how the world was made right with Jesus Christ. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are only so many times in my life where a man can play a bad guy.   This movie would never be good but for the actors and all the extras.  It's just a good movie that makes you go back to the old westerns that you have seen before.  The actors are so great and they just love the old west!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot of this film, which is about a couple who are moving to a new town with their children, is fairly simple. The problem is that the plot is so poor. The plot is about one man's jealousy of his friend's relationship with the woman next door. He is the only one who sees her, and when he comes over to her house the other man is already there. At first it appears that this relationship is going to get them both into serious trouble. However, in a twist that almost defies belief, the wife changes her mind and marries him instead. The only problem is, she can't get over her boyfriend. The couple is just not together, and after a few weeks in town the husband is forced to leave town.    In a film about jealousy and infidelity, this was another movie about nothing. Not even one word. It was more like a parody of the classic comedy classic "How to Marry a Millionaire." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My father (not a good movie buff) was giving me the DVD copy of this. His brother saw the film and thought it was a bit ridiculous and "gay." He then proceeded to tell me that I needed to read more about it. I didn't, so he sent me a copy of the book (in the same edition) which he wrote about it and he said that he thought it would be hilarious and a good flick if they had made it. He said that the film would have been a hit had they cast someone like George Segal, who is a lot of fun to watch as he laughs at himself, and makes the whole thing hilarious. He thought that it could have been really good if they just went with a straight guy. I do not recommend this for anyone (myself included), not even my father, who liked it for his own funny purposes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is bad. Not good, but bad.  As an action movie, the movie doesn't have much of a story. There are action scenes, but nothing worth noting. There is also some sex scenes, however they are nothing special. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of a group of hippies being held hostage by a drug kingpin was a pretty good idea. But the execution was so sloppy that it almost ruined the movie. It was supposed to be a campy action movie where one of the characters got really drunk and had to break into a prison with a couple of guys to free some of the people held captive, but what we got was a cheapo exploitation film with no real sense of humor. The movie is about a group called The Family (they were called the Family back in the 1960s) who go to a hippie camp. The leader of the camp is a drug addict and gets captured by a gang. One of the guys has an attitude problem and starts talking about how he will kill the drug dealer if he doesn't do what he wants and take his place. The drug dealer goes along with it and helps him to break out of the prison. After some time the leader is taken by the gang. The gang leader is given $20,000 to make a movie. They decide to film this on a prison bus. The guy who had the attitude problem in the movie is played by a big, dumb guy who does a lot of yelling and doesn't even have much of a role. I wish I could have seen this movie before I saw it. I really hope the makers of it learned a lesson. - January 25, 2009A cheapo film
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My husband and I loved this film! He had never seen it before, but I did. And I loved it so much! I felt like we were watching something really special. We loved the movie and my husband is an even bigger fan. This film is well worth the watch, even if it is not a great movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was fine at best. The movie is full of errors, the writing was pretty bad too, and the acting is weak. It is not a good movie, not even close.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst thing that could happen to me.   I had a wonderful time, but all the action scenes in it are boring as hell.  It has an extremely slow pace.  I did not know the "Mongolian King" (his name is actually not even on the poster) was supposed to be the evil guy.  He only says "Hahaha" or something to that effect a few times.  That's all it takes.  This movie made me hate the movie.  The film starts off with a slow slow shot of a guy riding a horse, running for his life.  At the end of the first hour or so, there is a lot of running around and the horse keeps going in circles.  Most of the action is at night, so the night scenes in this movie are very dark.  There is no blood, so there is no gore.  All of the villains have the same names, but I still don't know who they are.  What I do know is that this is a bad film.  A complete waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those "bad" movies. It has a "bad vibe" and the actors don't play their roles to the fullest. The movie is a bit slow paced and not as funny as the trailer shows. I hope there's more to the film but this movie is very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a terrible film. I was actually really disappointed with the quality of the film. The acting was poor and the special effects were not believable. The writing is also very poor. The only reason I watched this movie was because of it's being on the "Ascension" set. However, I can not recommend this to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was awful. The acting was awful, the plot was bad, and the acting was horrible. The music was not memorable. I do not know why anyone would want to see this movie. There was never a good laugh in this movie and there was never one good moment. This movie is not worth watching because it was so awful. I can never watch this movie again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie over a period of 2 days after a long day at work. The movie takes place on a farm which is where we first find the film's main character. He is a farmer who wants to quit but the only thing he can think of to do is take a break to play his guitar. This gives us the first impression of the film. The plot is so bad it's not even funny. The farmer is supposed to be an old man who died at least 30 years ago. The whole movie is based on this old man's journal that's been hidden by his wife. He wrote down everything that happened to him over the years. But as the movie progresses we find out that the farmer wasn't an old guy, he was just a very bad actor. The story gets much more ridiculous with him playing everything from a drunk to a madman. The entire movie is just a bunch of bad acting and bad acting is always good. When he is playing the madman, the director even said that he's actually insane, but they couldn't fix him up for the movie.   When the farmer actually dies at the end of the movie, he is shown in the hospital and we see that he is still alive. There's a shot of him in the hallway of the hospital as we cut to the end and there he is.  This movie is so stupid it's almost funny.  If you really want to see a great old-time movie, this is probably not the film for you. It's an awful film, it's a terrible film, but it's worth seeing for the scenes where it is so absurd you can't help but laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a great movie. Not the best but still a fun one. A little too long but you can't fault it. Not a bad watch either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie with a group of friends and we were all laughing. It was hilarious. I think they had some really funny scenes and one of them was the main guy who was in prison. It really caught us all off guard and we laughed so hard at the jokes. It just kept us on the edge of our seat. I thought it was so funny.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The entire film is horrible. The actors are bad, the music is horrible, and the special effects are poor. The dialogue is annoying. It is like a movie made by someone who has not seen a movie in ten years. There is no story and the actors can not act. This movie should not be made.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The biggest problem with this movie is that it really isn't a horror film. I thought this movie was supposed to be scary, but that's not the case at all. I've seen movies where you see a man getting killed by a wolf, and you think that's scary, and that's the scariest thing you'll ever see. But the movie doesn't even try to scare you. There's no sense of suspense, no tension, and nothing at all is real, and the only thing you're really looking at are people's faces.    I think a movie about a man who is murdered by a wild dog would have more tension and intensity. I understand that the movie is a horror movie, but it's just not scary.  The only way the movie could've made it more scary would be if they did some extreme close-ups on people's skulls. The film isn't scary, it's cheap, and if this film ever came out on VHS it should be destroyed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really excited to see this movie.  I have no experience with any of the characters.  The only thing I had to do was click on the video file and then select a different language to see a brief introduction and a few scenes of the movie. The first thing that caught my attention was the title.  It was so much better when the title didn't sound so pretentious.    As far as the movie itself, it was a complete waste of time.  There was absolutely no humor to be found.  Sure there were a few gags here and there, but they were so poorly written and acted out that it is hard to take them seriously.  They could have used some kind of audio-animatronic effects, but that didn't work because the voice-over was so bad that even if they used a voice-actor it would have been very hard to follow the dialogue.  Instead, they went for the quick "silly" laugh at the end, and the "laugh track" which didn't really help.  This movie was so over-the-top that it actually made me feel bad for the characters, and especially for the actors.  Overall, this movie was a total disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I have read this book before and I loved it. This is a wonderful, fun, dark story.    It is a very good book to read if you like a good story with a nice plot and character development.  But I would not recommend this book to anyone else. It is too dark and there is too much violence and sex and no love or caring at all for the characters. I have to agree with the reviewer that this is not a good book for a teen.  There are two versions of this book, the first is an original novel with no changes. The book has an even darker side to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    -I'm still recovering from watching this film, and I wish that I had seen it in the theaters, I would have loved to have seen it. I thought it was terrible, the acting and the direction were bad, and it was boring as hell.   You will never go back to seeing a movie like this again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst thing is that all the people who worked on this movie were paid too much to waste their time making this. All the actors who worked hard were too lazy to work at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the worst movie I have ever seen. It was so bad I could barely watch it. The characters were boring and the acting was horrendous. The plot was stupid and un-original. The only good thing about this movie was when the kids showed the picture that said "A BUNCH OF CRIES".    I think it would be better to make a sequel to this movie, because it only goes downhill from here.   If you want a good laugh, watch "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is just a cheap version of the movie  . The main villain is a stupid, annoying actor who is not needed in a movie like this.    This movie does not have any meaning, it is just about the two characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The main thing that keeps the movie from being anything more than a mediocre B-movie is the dialogue. It's completely unbelievable. A good actor would've been perfect for the role, but for some reason, the actor who played the "bad guy" (with a "t") was a really bad one. The dialogue just isn't that interesting, either.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is really bad. It's got no idea what it wants to be and just kind of bumbles on through like it's trying to get by. There were some decent jokes to get people laughing.   This was a very poorly produced movie.  The only really good thing about this film is the great fight scene in it.  I guess a good actor and an idiot can make for some great comedy.  There are more than enough bad movies out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You don't need to know much of anything about movies to be able to tell a story about this one. The film doesn't really have a plot, and that is because it was made to be a movie about a movie.   This film is so stupid, that the plot doesn't even really exist in the movie. The entire movie is just about what the hell is going on with this guy (played by Richard Lewis) and his two sisters (played with the perfect dead-on accent by Barbara Stanwyck and Barbara Stanwix) who are trying to get in on the new TV show that is getting all the money.  Richard Lewis is not that funny or entertaining as the two sisters. He doesn't seem to be in love with any of them, and they are all just trying to take his money. The only time he seems to be interested in them is when he asks them if they can "get a taste" of a "special treat".  The rest of the film is filled with a long list of things that the three sisters do that Richard doesn't mind at all, and then they ask him to get rid of them so they can have "a good time".  All the action in this movie comes from the fact that these sisters are constantly trying to steal the TV and are very clever about it. They are the same two sisters who gave us "Lucky Lucille" and "The Last Picture Show".  These two sisters, who were given the chance to play in the TV show, are all very talented, and it is hard to imagine how they could have been able to get away with stealing it.  It is also hard to fathom how these two women could have found a way to steal it when it was only on for a short time. I think they were trying to make their way onto the new "talk show", but they could not find any studio who would agree to let them do it. This could have saved them a lot of money. I can understand how a TV show could make people like these three sisters, but they weren't given a chance to make that show work.  This movie is a complete train wreck.  If you want a good movie about nothing then this movie is not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is terrible. I didn't even find it funny. I mean, just the way she was talking about "dumb white girls" was so funny. But, even her stupid white boyfriend and dumb white mother were not funny to me. I found the whole movie so stupid and offensive. I'm sorry, but there was not much that was funny about it, anyway. - July 17, 2010Ugly and stupid
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't hate this movie. I guess my biggest issue with this movie was that I just didn't understand the message it was trying to get across.  I was supposed to feel compassion for these three little girls, but I couldn't.    For this movie, a little girl is abused by an older man. She is raped and tortured, and then her mother is raped. She says she feels pain every time they have sex.  When her mother says she is going to kill herself, she screams and tries to get out of the house.  This movie didn't seem like it was meant to be a dramatic movie, and to me, it was just sad.  In a movie like this, I want something like a movie that is supposed to be about the suffering of the little girls.  The sad part was that these little girls were just little children, and yet their parents were in such terrible shape, so what message was that supposed to get?   The only thing I can say that I actually like in this movie is that the three girls' dad talks to them about how much his daughter loves them and is proud of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge horror movie fan, and have watched all of them. I have never seen this movie. It was a fun but lame movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It doesn't get any worse than this.   The acting and writing is really poor.  The characters are so cliché and over the top.  They are like "bad guys" from old western movies.  So when you are on a mission to save the girl, you get to fight and kill them.  When the bad guy attacks you, you just shoot him and run.  It is just plain bad.  This movie will be burned into my mind.  I did not even enjoy the actors.  If I was a man I would have been embarrassed by the way they acted.  "If you're going to do something, do it right!"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film where every bad choice is bad and it is obvious who is making those bad decisions. There is no tension or tension building up, there is no suspense, not even a slight sense of danger. The actors are the worst, every one has been in the worst films, some have even been in a really bad movie in the past. Even the supporting characters have a very limited and boring plot.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is simple, but poorly executed. There are plenty of problems with the story itself, but it really starts to fall apart when the focus is on one single woman and her quest for revenge. This movie just goes from being a "bad movie" to being a complete mess within the first 5 minutes.   This movie would have been great for an older audience. It has the "bad girl in love with a good guy" formula down pat, but not enough for a grown man to enjoy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had the same problem as others had about how a lot of the scenes were cut.  It is a shame that I have to pay $20 for a bad film because of the flaws it has.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is quite terrible, as its title would suggest. Its a pretty straightforward story, but this film has far too many terrible dialogue and acting, the main characters are so flat and not interesting, the action scenes are awful and the acting is horrendous. The film even had some truly bad voice acting on the entire film, but all in all the film is not bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a complete dud.   You see some funny lines.  But no actors that you'd ever want to see in the role.  No acting is really worth it in this film.  The film is only 3 hours long.  I think that if you have to see it, you'd have to wait for the next one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is simple but it's so poorly done that it almost makes up for it in stupid jokes and bad acting.   A group of four high school kids are on a vacation when a bunch of teenagers (some of them underage) try to break into their apartment, and while the girls are asleep, the boys decide to have some fun, and one of them ends up with an 8-inch cock and one with a giant pussy. This movie is so bad that it's hilarious, and the plot is stupid.  If you are not laughing, you must be retarded. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While this movie was really good, it is really slow.   I really wanted to like it but it takes way too long for a film to go where you don't know who is going to die, and I really didn't think I would enjoy the film at all.  There are a lot of really stupid things in this film like the man who dresses as a clown and talks to children and the clown is in his bathrobe.  The other characters don't have that much depth either, some are really annoying to watch and one of them has a really stupid accent which makes it hard to understand him.  It would be really funny if they did a film called "Stupidity" or something like that.  All in all, I would recommend watching this film on repeat and getting a headache trying to keep up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought it was a horrible film and would not recommend it. It is a very poorly made movie that has some very bad actors.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I first saw this movie I was completely enthralled. There was just a certain appeal to it that I just couldn't put my finger on.   The premise of it, of course, is something that is almost always a pretty cool idea, but the execution never really shines.  I think there's a certain "tug of war" going on between the audience and the filmmaker here; it's easy to see why they decided to pull the trigger, but it just doesn't really click.  The performances, particularly from the two leads, are good, but don't really come together.  One of the things I loved most about this movie is that it is about two friends who have never been in love who finally do have a moment.  It's not necessarily one of my favorites, but I have to say it does have a "hype" factor to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Hi! This was my first time going to see the "Lion King", and I had heard all the hype about it, so I decided to go. There were so many great things about this film, but it never quite hits you. The lion king himself, Simba, is a very cute character, but I'm sorry to say that this is only a tiny bit about him and his family. The story itself is about the struggles of the two main characters, who are very naive and kind of silly. They're on a quest for the "Curse of the Lion King", which they think will give them power over all the animals. So far, this was the worst part of the film for me. The people and animals they meet are kind of funny and entertaining, but the story and characters are just so unbelievable that you just don't believe it. It's very simplistic and makes you feel a bit like you're just there to see Simba do stupid things, or watch the lion king try to seduce Simba. And the special effects are just awful, there's not a single one that I liked. They were just laughable and I found them incredibly out of place, especially in this particular scene where Simba has to climb a tree and the camera pulls back on his head, like a movie special effect! The special effects in the movie are even worse in this version, and I can't understand how it was supposed to look like. The music also seems to have been lifted from an old Disney cartoon. The only thing that really makes me laugh out loud about this movie was the scene where the two friends, Nala and Rafiki, were sitting around the campfire and the smoke made the smoke dance all around them.  I really liked this movie, but even with all the problems, there are some funny scenes that were extremely clever. Some of the songs, which were originally created for the film, have amazing music and are well done. Overall, this is a great movie, and if you're a big fan of the Disney princess movies, you might like it!  One of my favorite characters in this film is Mufasa, because it's so funny to see his silly actions. This movie was released in 1992 and is probably the most accurate to life as the characters actually were at that time. The film is also well worth watching if you want to see some amazing lion scenes and lots of funny characters. There's even some
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was in high school when this came out, and I thought it was pretty bad. I'm glad that I was too young to see it, but the idea of a high schooler becoming a vampire wasn't too appealing, so I didn't really pay much attention to it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "This movie was a total waste of time and money. I guess the makers were trying to get some publicity for a remake of a movie that never worked. It was so bad that I actually found myself wishing I had watched the old movie with the original actors instead of seeing it on television as an action movie."  - Michael W.   I'm a little upset that no one thought to remake this movie. I actually really liked it when it was originally done. You know what the first thing that popped into my head when I saw it was?  "Holy Moly!"   - Tim H. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was really funny, but in the end it is just sad.  I'm sure if they had made this movie 20 years ago they would have made it into a fun comedy, but it just fell apart.    This movie was also really stupid and it really shows.  This is a very unoriginal movie, but I liked it.  It has so many jokes that were old, but funny.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For a movie with a very promising and unique premise, there is just a lot of bad choices in this movie.   The acting in this is really bad.  Most of the time, you will be watching the wrong actor and it makes the characters seem really fake.  It really looks like some of the actors have been hired to play an extra.  There are some cool parts in the movie but they are really not that great and really fall on the low end.  The story is pretty weak.  A lot of the action seems like it came from some generic action movie that never came out on DVD.  This movie is really just a bad experience.  I'm giving it one star out of five, because it is better than most of the other bad movies of the same genre that have come out recently. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie that is made by the same people who made BOO! was the only thing i was going to watch before seeing this one and i was wrong. This movie is way too much of the same, i mean i know you can do anything but they have to try and make some kind of new style out of the old. If it was the other way around i would have given it a 7 because it looked better in it's original version, but the other version looks far worse. 1/10  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film has nothing to do with "The Great White Hunt"   The acting is not as good as in "The great white hunt",  it is more like "The little mermaid and her two sisters in the forest"  Not to much action and it seems there is not much story to tell, but if you are in for a "great white hunt" and have a little time on your hands this movie will do well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was only 15 when this came out in 1985 and I remember it very well.   The story was very simple, a young man named Ricky (Bruce Willis) is trying to earn money by taking a job as a private detective.  He's good at his job but his wife, Mary (Susan Sarandon) is having a rough time.  One day she says that she's going on a business trip but she needs to be back in time for her birthday.  Ricky agrees to help but she doesn't show up.  The next day Ricky finds her at her apartment and it turns out that Mary had had an affair with her boss and they're going to divorce.  When Ricky arrives at her place he discovers that she is missing.  So he heads out to find her but the search turns out to be harder than he imagined.  As he's chasing her, Mary calls him, saying that she had been kidnapped.  It's a pretty simple plot but there are so many things that get in the way.  A lot of it is the slow pacing, the way the story seems to get lost and the way it just seems to not get anywhere.  Even though I know how the movie ends (or at least should have been) I still had a hard time getting into it and the ending left me a little cold.  There are also a lot of scenes and people that are just not all that interesting and it's very easy to tune out.  I don't recommend this movie for kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie really was crap. I would say this is one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. It was just plain bad. I thought they were going to make it into a classic with an amazing ending, and instead it just turned into an awkward and very long movie. The acting was really awful as well.   I never would have thought that someone like Paul Rudd could be that bad in a movie like this.  It would be funny if it weren't so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's bad, and I had never seen it.  I love movies, but when I see movies I have to go in with an open mind.  So I was like, "What the heck, I'll see what I can find in my local video store" and found this.  It has one of those weird "sounds" to it, so weird that it just doesn't quite make sense.  This movie is one of the more interesting horror movies I've seen.   So let's just say it's not my thing and doesn't leave me satisfied.  If you have a little time to kill, then go see it. It's worth a try if you're looking for a little fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't watch horror films much anymore. I saw this, and I was surprised at how awful it was. I've seen worse. The acting, the acting, and the acting were terrible. There was so much wrong with the film that it was disgusting to watch. I have no problem with the acting because they did a great job in portraying the people on the film.   The film is about a woman who lives in a haunted house, which is a little disturbing, but there was nothing creepy about it. The film had very poor lighting, but it made it look really dark and scary.  The only thing that made this movie worth watching was the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie is just another example of Hollywood trying to cash in on the current pop-cultural obsession with vampires. It's a lot of fun with a few great moments, but nothing in it is original or unique.   It feels too much like a "mockumentary" on the vampires themselves, and it just doesn't make any sense.  It makes me wonder why these vampire fans would pay to see a movie that has nothing to say about them, and is just there to make a buck or sell some vampire merchandise. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wanted to like this movie.   It was a new take on the "fantasy film" genre, and it did have some fun scenes.  In the end, the director had some bad decisions going for him.  The acting was pretty good, and the script was fairly good.  But, they did a bad job with the editing, making it look like there was a lot more going on than there really was.  It didn't help that most of the time we're in the woods, which had the "I just want to be out in nature" feel that it had, but it felt like there were a lot of cut scenes in the movie.      The characters were mostly flat, and none of them really stood out.  I had never seen any of these people before, but I would have liked to have seen some of them get a little more development.  One thing that was pretty funny was the whole scene where the lady and her friend were trying to hide the money they were making in the bank.  They were trying their hardest to keep from being discovered.  This film is not a bad one, but some things were cut out.   The film's title is a pun on the word "chocolate", which is an extremely popular candy.   I think it's funny to think that these guys would dress up as something that they wouldn't normally dress up like.   This movie is filled with funny characters, and lots of action.   But, it's not really a "funny action" film.   It was mostly just shots of people running, shooting, and then falling to their deaths.   They did a great job with their special effects, but you just couldn't really tell the difference between them and normal people.   One thing I really liked was when the "chicken" guy started to jump out of the window and kill himself.   Unfortunately, that sequence was not at all convincing.  It was shot with such shaky camera angles that you really couldn't tell what was going on.   For some reason, the cameraman couldn't even tell if the guy was on the ground or in the air.   There were also lots of times when the camera would get completely stuck on something.   As a result, the shots just didn't feel real.   Finally, the acting was ok, but the story was pretty weak.   If this was one of the more fun action films
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are going to see a bad film, I would recommend this one, but if you have a good sense of humor, I don't think you will enjoy this one either.   The movie is so bad that even I found it a bit confusing at times, but the dialogue and acting is really bad.  I have seen worse movies, but it is one of the worst I have ever seen.  The plot is horrible, the acting is bad, the plot is completely made up, and the music is atrocious.  It is definitely worth a watch, but with all of these other bad movies out there, I wouldn't really recommend it.  1 out of 1 found this review helpful.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst part about this movie is that they filmed this as a horror film (they shot it in an abandoned school which was creepy and scary) and then decided to add the zombie theme and a zombie horde.  I was sick and tired of zombie movies (and other "horror" movies) before this one.  The zombies seemed to have no sense of smell or taste and were constantly trying to eat my brains.   I hated that there was never any way to escape them.  They were like zombies in an amusement park. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was at a movie theater in LA and this movie was playing and I saw the poster on the wall that said "A star is born" and I thought "I guess this is going to be ok..."   This is a cheesy movie that didn't do much.   The film stars some great actors and I enjoyed the movie, but it wasn't bad at all.  They should really make a real Star Wars movie like with Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is very funny, but it is a movie that takes it's time, and takes its time getting you to laugh. The only other movie this year that can be compared to this is "Stoner", however it's a different movie. This is the best thing I have ever seen in a long time, because it was very entertaining and the action was amazing. I thought the story was very good, and the acting was good. I will buy this movie again and I know that people are going to love it. It will make them laugh and give them a good laugh!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was a little hesitant to watch this movie because it looked like it was going to be a cheesy parody of action flicks. However, I wasn't sure because the characters looked so familiar to me. I did enjoy watching these action stars. However there was really not that much action that happened. At times it looked as if these actors were trying to show how well they knew the movie they were playing. The special effects were cheesy but nothing too bad. The acting was alright and there were some really good scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this film for my family. Our kids had never seen a movie like this before. I thought it was just too good to be true. I love the story line and the acting. The only thing that would have been better is to have had a good soundtrack to go along with the good acting and story line. I would buy this film again to see the cast in person.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When you first hear about it, you want to see it but by the end you get frustrated you can not watch it   This movie is like a movie with no acting. The only actors that really had any sort of life in this movie was a man with a white mustache that looked like Michael Jai White. He was playing a man named Frank who is a very violent guy who seems to be obsessed with a strange white statue that looks like a human with a snake for a head.   I think this movie would have been better if the director had tried to make a good movie out of this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a total disaster.   The plot was stupid, the characters were dull and stupid, and the plot seemed like something a 5 year old made up.  This is a very typical Disney "comedy".  And when they had the chance to do a "sequel", they went all out and made a complete mess.  The only reason why I bought this was because I heard it was a great movie.  For the first half of the movie, it seemed to be interesting and funny. Then the third act came and it became a huge, unreadable mess. There was no story to the first act. The story is about a little boy who tries to save the princess. When he finds the princess, the boy does not get very far. It was so pointless.  In the first 20 minutes, we had no character development at all. No jokes, no dialog.  It all just felt like a waste of time.  There were so many times when I was watching this film and wondering what was going to happen next. The last 20 minutes made no sense at all, so I just gave up and was sad that I spent so much money on this movie. I have no idea who Disney was thinking they were doing by making this movie, but it turned out to be a complete failure.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very slow pacing.   The actors seemed like they were talking on the phone.  This movie has no direction.  I mean really no direction at all.

I had to watch it to make it up to myself.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was pretty bad in the way that it was trying to show you a good story and not a bad one.   While the story was good, it was badly shot and bad in every sense of the word.  The music in this film is awful and you can tell they wanted to create an illusion of this being a film with a good sound track.  Not only that, but you have scenes where they don't even bother to try to use the sound track because they just do it on the spot and the music just gets in the scene way before the dialogue can.  These scenes would not work at all if the scene would have had a decent amount of time to build-up to it.  While this film does have a great concept, its execution was just way off.  I feel like if they really wanted to make a film that was very good and it would have been great if the movie would have used the sound-track more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a very good movie but it doesn't really know what it is. The music is not very good but I guess that's because it was filmed by a guy who just thought he could do a good job.   The acting is terrible and it's a shame that it took them so long to make a remake of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really not good with gore or violence. When I got this movie I was hoping to watch it on DVD or the like. I've seen it a bunch of times before and it was still bad enough to make me sick.   If you're interested in watching this I suggest that you avoid seeing it until you can actually look at it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at my local movie theater when it was showing at 8 pm. The movie was great. The people in the movie are fun. They do not act as "actors". The people are real people. They act as they do in the movies. I was excited to see this movie because I am a big fan of the movies and have seen a lot of the other "tribute" movies. The actor, Richard Llewellyn is not as good as in the other movies he has done. He did not look as good. I think the movie should have been shown at 9 or 10 pm on a Saturday night when it would have had better lines of dialogue. If you are looking for a good movie to watch with a group of friends, this movie will make you smile. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just too cheesy to be taken seriously. It is an obvious parody of films like "Star Wars", "The Matrix", "RoboCop", "Titanic", "E.T.", and "The Goonies". This movie has more than enough bad jokes to be funny, but the acting is horrible and they are never funny. The main characters in the movie have a bad case of bad acting, and the whole movie is made very hard to laugh at. If the main characters were anything good, it would be funny. I will not be watching it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "It was a disaster. I will never ever go back to that film. It was bad and very boring to watch.   I have seen "Fatal Attraction" and "Jaws" in the theater and I never thought of a movie getting better, but this movie had no talent.  The plot was ridiculous and all the characters were over the top.  I didn't care for any of the actors or actresses, but I will remember that film because it was one of the first movies I ever watched with the VCR.  That's all it was.  If you want a movie that is just a comedy to keep you amused then that is what you should get, but don't watch it for the plot or actors.  This movie is just too bad."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only good thing that came out of this movie is that the director is not a child murderer.   I was so upset with this movie.  They tried to sell a story to children that involved kidnapping, murder and child molestation and it is terrible.  The bad actors are horrible.  I hate when actors think it is okay to say stuff in a movie that they know to be horrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm an average guy, and have never been good at sports. However, I love football and love watching it. I am a huge fan of the Chicago Bears, and this is my favorite Bears movie. It's a great drama with great acting by the cast. There's also a pretty great music score. This film would make a great movie on its own.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is just terrible. The cast all look terrible and are all just terrible at acting. The one guy that has an interesting accent was just there to be annoying. It was so bad the whole film was just awful. The acting, plot and plot holes, just... there.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie i've ever seen.  I felt uncomfortable when i saw it on a bus with a bunch of people and i was about 11 or 12 so it's hard to get the full impact of what it's like to be in a crowded theater. I guess some people can handle it but i was too young to be bothered and i have been to plenty of bad movies, including a few in the 80s and early 90s.  The actors were awful, and none of them came close to making a good movie. There's a scene with a guy getting mugged who ends up in a hospital, and all the nurses are wearing tight clothes, the camera angles are all wrong, and the acting is awful. There are some good scenes but they are scattered around the movie.   This is so bad that you have to wonder why anyone bothered to make it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was expecting a movie about a woman who has just lost a baby to a cancerous tumor. What I got was the classic "The only thing worse than a real-life person is a person that's pretending to be a real person." With this movie, you'd expect that, but instead of the movie trying to be serious and showing the effect the disease has on a person's life, it instead shows the movie maker trying to make the film more scary than it really is. There is a scene where the doctors are discussing the tumor in the patient's head, and the way the doctors talk is really creepy. I can't imagine how that happens in real life, but here it happens with complete disregard for how someone might be affected by such an awful disease.   As far as the movie goes, it's okay. The actors are all okay, but nothing more than that. And if you're a fan of real cancer patients, you may have a harder time tolerating this film than I did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is horrible.   First off, why does everyone else in the movie have so much fun?   This movie is so bad, but why does nobody else get the joke?  Why does the movie not have a proper ending or any resolution for anybody?  If you like this movie, it's only because someone else liked it.  It's not a bad comedy, but the acting is so awful.  There is no one else in this movie that's worth a damn.  If your not the funniest person in the room, don't go in to see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It has the right amount of violence for a slasher film (I'd guess at least 40% of it was blood) but the action was pretty lame. I wasn't a fan of the "barker man" part. The final girl was an especially weak girl. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A great movie, it gets me into the mood of the movie and the music and actors and makes me care about it.   The ending of the film is very sad, but the last scene of the story is great, and very sad at the same time, i do enjoy watching sad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't care for this movie, the acting is terrible. The acting is even worse for the movie itself.   This movie doesn't have any sense or sense of humor at all.  This is a horrible movie.  The characters are not even believable. The only one who I can see being real is the guy who plays the sheriff.  I saw this movie for a cheap laugh and it just isn't funny at all!  I will only watch the movie again when I'm on a low budget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I have ever seen.   It was so bad. The acting was awful and the music was the worst I have seen. This film was made to just be some cheap thrill and if it had stayed true to the book it would have been great. The story line was horrible and the script was horrible. The director was just a bad director. It is also very difficult to believe that this story took place in the 1970s. The actors were all very bad.  There are a lot of things wrong with this movie but the worst part was that it was done to raise money to make a movie about a crazy old man. The movie was so awful it was worth a laugh and if anyone thinks this is true, they are completely crazy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're a fan of the 90's teen romance, the new "Taken" movies or a great horror movie, then "Temptation" is a perfect movie to watch. The acting is great and the story lines are great. It's not exactly what you're looking for, but it's definitely a fun movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen this movie a lot more times than I've seen most movies, and in this movie, it really gets boring. I had to leave it to go watch another movie. This is one of the movies I saw on TV as a kid, and never got to see in theatres.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've heard it's a great movie. It sounds really good too. But it's so stupid it's hilarious. It's not funny. It has nothing to do with the movies that came before. I don't see how someone can see this movie and not get tired of it. It doesn't give you a good laugh or a great laugh, it gives you a sickening laugh. It sucks, and that's why it's on this list. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had to force myself to watch this movie and see it's awfulness. The story is about the man who was raised by a couple of dogs and was adopted at a very young age. He then went on to find a wife who turned out to be a woman and gave birth to a boy. His son died at a young age, and after a long battle with grief, he went back to live with the dogs and raised the dogs as his own.   What's so terrible about this movie is that there is absolutely no romance in the movie, and it feels like it was made just for the money. There is no reason for a man to be with a dog and then go off and marry a woman, let alone have kids, especially since he would never have any more kids.  If the dog had been a boy, the story would have been much more realistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen the movie many times, and I know that some of the shots (including some of her most beautiful ones) are taken from the actual wedding.   They are so distracting, they make me lose the focus.  The wedding is supposed to be a celebration, but instead of being joyful, they just seemed like it was a business meeting to get more business for this company.  I guess this movie is really about the company and how it became such a monster after that one person left.  There is a great music scene when the wife goes to pick up her car from the shop, and she is being followed by a police car, so she drives off...when she gets to the house she starts the car and parks it on the lawn, the cops then start following her...but then when she leaves the house, the cars goes back to the shop.  If the producers of this movie had gotten some of this story right, this would have been a good movie, but they didn't do it.  Also, the "daddy" of the bride is never in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love the new Ghostbusters movies.  But this is NOT a good movie!  The original was great, the first two sequels were so entertaining and funny. I was really looking forward to the third movie.  This movie is lame. It is not funny or entertaining. It just is.  The costumes are awful. They did not even change the original costumes at all.  You will see a lot of old actors. They try to make it look like they are still playing the original characters.  All these actors are in their 50s and 60s. There are not even any great performances. It's just a bunch of guys playing the same old roles.  It really was not funny. It was a long and boring movie. And it was terrible.  I am disappointed!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My wife and I went out one night and saw this film. I must admit, I am a little bit disappointed. It was pretty bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very bad, the acting, cinematography and writing are bad as well as the special effects.   It was a very bad movie and you can see that they used all these different kinds of camera equipment like a camera, a zoom lens, a long lens, some that is not used for normal film photography and so on.  It wasn't funny at all, the actors didn't have any chemistry with each other and they made some kind of a movie for the sake of making a movie.  I don't remember the names of all the actors and the way they were in the movie but it was just really bad.  Even the acting was bad, but I thought it was really bad because when some actors were talking, it was very bad and when they were laughing, it looked so funny but in reality, it wasn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is all about a young girl and a little boy. They live in a house with two other kids. One of the kids goes away and the parents want the child to come back. When he comes back and he is so young and sweet that she and her brother love him right away. She gives him some money and he decides to go fishing. She goes fishing too and they get caught in some big waves. The parents go to a hospital and the family gets separated.   This movie is a great film with a beautiful soundtrack. They had great actors, lots of action, great music and great acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a really poor movie that I would not want to watch again.   The acting is awful and the acting is really bad, that is why I give the movie a zero.  I also cannot get over how cheesy the plot is.  If you want to hear people talking, watch a movie with Richard Pryor or something.   - Richard Pryor in "Somewhere in Hollywood".  - Richard Pryor, in "Lucky Strike", 1977.  - "I'm always a little bit tired, but after a while I don't feel that way any more." - Richard "The Blackout" Pryor, as he tells the story in "The Big Break" (1985) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      The only reason this movie wasn't worse is because it had a decent cast, I wish it was just about a bunch of actors sitting around talking.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie i ever saw and a movie i never want to see again, the story, characters, and acting is so bad, i never saw any of this made and it all looks fake, it's like they wanted to show how ugly the world is and have this one bad guy as a good person.   I never saw it, and i don't want to watch it,    this movie should have never been made at all!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've watched this movie on video at least 2 times, with no results except that I have seen it twice. I think this movie was shot in black and white, because the quality is awful. I guess it was the first movie of a sequel to a film that came out after this.   So this is the same old story about a couple of cops. The guy got in a fight, and it's in the police station, so no one hears him. No one can even find the guy. He runs into a room and he gets shot. It's a quick little scene. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not only bad it was made by bad people. If you watch this movie you should really think twice about how much you think is funny about the world. It's really not funny at all. The acting was bad. If this was the script and the actors were better it would have been better. They don't have much to do and it just drags on.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie which I really liked, but a movie which had to be a bit overdone, even with the actors in it. The actors play characters who are very different and have nothing in common. This is not a story of a young man who wants to get married.   The movie is about a guy who takes an old car from his father and tries to find his father.  This is an old timey sort of story that has a touch of romance. But for me it had to end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only film in my collection that I've seen twice, and the second time was a real disappointment, which made it the worst of the trilogy.   It was a big budgeted film that never really hit it's stride until the third act.  A few shots were beautiful, but the rest was either poorly shot or poorly written.  When it was over, I wanted out, but I couldn't do that and had to go see the film again, which is another story.  I think it should have been better.  If you want to watch a great piece of cinema, then you should definitely watch it again, but this time in a theatre.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't even understand why I watched this movie, but this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.   This movie is a horror movie with the typical cheesy monster movies, so the monsters look really bad and are very unrealistic.  The whole film has the same feeling, the camerawork is horrible and has some weird camera angles, the acting is awful and the plot is just a joke.  It would have been much better if it was a horror/comedy movie instead of a monster movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not a movie I could watch in a theater with others watching the same thing in the same movie.  I didn't expect much in a movie, especially with the title, but this is a really bad movie and I don't think the director understands what he's trying to do.  If I were you I would have rented this from another site or rented from a friend.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that had a scene where an entire wall is covered in pictures. This film is also a perfect example of why it's so hard for me to find anything positive to say about a film.   It's not a terrible movie by any means, but there's so much going on in one of the film's two scenes (and you probably don't need to see the second one to understand why it is bad) that it's almost impossible to concentrate on what's going on at the screen.  They cut the film in half, so there's a big chunk of the movie where you have to sit through the entirety of the second scene just to understand what's happening, and at the same time it makes the audience realize that this entire second scene is a complete waste of time.  If you can't even focus on what is happening on screen, what are you supposed to think about?   My wife and I watched this movie and we had to turn off the television for the entire time. It was just too much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had no idea this movie would be as terrible as it was. I have been looking for a movie that would have the perfect balance of horror and comedy to make my blood boil. I had heard good things about this movie and figured I'd give it a go.   The first act sets the tone for the movie, the characters are so bland and not likable.  It seems like this guy is having a real rough time of it, which is funny, but it's sad because he could be a whole lot more interesting. This is one of those movies where it seems like the writers are making jokes on the way, it feels so out of place, but they have no other place for the joke. It's very sad to see this guy get so depressed because he was a big star.  I was a little disappointed that the movie wasn't even more interesting, it was just a generic horror movie. The script was very sloppy, the actors were very bland, and the characters didn't really fit together.  I just can't get over how terrible the film is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A good movie with an incredible cast and great direction and acting. I've seen better but still a very nice film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed, poorly-cast, poorly written script which lacks the charm that made the original classic.   The acting was really, really bad, and the acting coach and producer never did any work to develop their actors.  They could have made them look better, and they could have done a better job with the plot, but instead, they gave up on the entire series of films and went straight for the bank.  It was sad that they didn't get better actors and try to make something new out of it, but they're not going to make any more movies with me and the only thing they're going to get from me is a poor review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a "totally good" movie. However, it's way too long for what it has to do, and the acting is so bad. I didn't like any of the characters in this film, so it was only worth it to watch it for the acting. This movie is so boring, that you can't even care about what is going on.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole movie was just a complete nightmare and I cannot see myself watching it again. I think the director put a lot of effort into this movie and I don't know why, but the acting and the camera work were very poor. You had to work very hard to forget about the bad acting and bad acting was the whole movie.   This movie is not a good movie but it was entertaining, it was just like watching a bad television show and you could not help but laugh when it was funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping that this would be a good movie, and the fact that it's really not makes me really not want to watch it.  I really did not expect anything from a film that cost so much.  What you got was a really crappy director, an actors who can't act in a professional way, and actors that are just completely over the top in this terrible movie.  And the music is really bad as well.  A real piece of trash.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While this was a good movie, there was really nothing special to it. It really felt like a re-hashing of a bunch of old westerns, which isn't a bad thing. And there were a couple of very bad scenes, but I won't spoil it here. The movie really felt generic and repetitive, which is kind of a big deal because it did so well.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie when it was first released in the '90s, and it's one of the biggest disasters to ever hit the big screen.   A bad movie, in many respects.  To top it off, this version is bad in so many ways, it's ridiculous.  This movie is filled with terrible acting, bad dialogue, poor directing, and terrible writing.  The acting is poor, and many of the actors look as if they are still in high school.  Not to mention that a lot of the scenes are filmed in poor lighting, which is the worst part of the whole movie.  The music is awful, and the actors don't seem to care about the movie at all.  I don't understand why this movie was released at all, and why the producers thought that it would be a good idea to release a movie called "Powder Blue".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the reason this movie is a horrible horror movie is because the actor in this movie isn't even afraid to show his full body.  The acting is so terrible that the whole movie is filled with this bad actor.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never really gave "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (1972) much thought.  I was in my teens and did not watch westerns back then, but I was familiar with this movie.   "The Grapes of Wrath" is an entertaining film that has a few scenes that remind me of this movie as well.  While the violence is low, the acting is good and the dialogue is amusing.  The musical score of "The Band Played On" is interesting.  " The Good, The Bad and The Ugly " is a very fun movie that takes the best parts of westerns of the past and makes it fun to watch.  My only problem with this film is that it does not tell its own story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know why this is considered a 'good' movie. The acting is horrendous, and the acting is only really bad because of the terrible acting. The characters are bland and forgettable, and they only have so much screen time to do anything. I guess this movie should be a sign of how awful acting and the story are in the movie business.   The movie is about the "Giant Killer Bees" and their hive that's been infested by other bees. They use "hive guns" to scare off the other bees into leaving the infested hive. The movie has a very campy and silly feel to it, but the characters are also very unlikable, especially the leader of the bees. The leader is constantly talking about how he wants to "Kill" the "giant bees".   It's actually very silly, and I can't imagine any serious movie trying to make a movie like this. The music is great, but you will definitely not want to hear it at work or at home.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a waste of time. The actors seem to be too busy talking about sex or drugs or whatever to act in the movie.   It was really boring and over long at the end.  I do not recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director made a great movie, but the director is a horrible director. The dialogue is so out of tune. The acting is awful. It's so hard to imagine there being anything interesting about this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a terrible movie. I thought I'd love it, but I was disappointed and I feel terrible for my kids (who watched it).   There are so many problems with this movie and the worst one is how unprofessional the director and producers were. They made it seem like I was a part of this movie from the very beginning and even at the beginning, as I'd always see things and know what was happening (even though I know nothing was really happening). I was the one asking questions, not the director who kept telling me, "No, no, it's okay."   I saw a trailer for this movie before I got it because the trailer had just been released on DVD.   The movie is so bad, that it's unbelievable that they were going to make a good movie of it.  Even though the movie is bad, I can't imagine what was going through someone's head to make this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very unoriginal movie.  It has some interesting ideas, but never gets very far.   I can understand that he wanted to be different and to make something different.  At least it is better than most people think.  I didn't think it was all that bad.  This one is fun to watch if you are looking for something different and funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this movie on television, I was impressed by the quality of the acting. Unfortunately, this is one of those movies that is filled with terrible dialogue, a poor plot, and a cheesy acting. The acting in this movie is atrocious, but at least it is good enough to not be annoying. The story involves two families in conflict with each other. One family has the son of the other family on their side, and one of them has a young daughter of the "enemy" family. The daughter has just been released from an insane asylum where her father has spent the last years of her life. One of the families is trying to get back the daughter. The other family wants the daughter back. This is the classic "Who is a traitor and who is a friend" type of conflict. I think that the script was written by an idiot. When the father finds out the daughter is still alive, he goes berserk. I don't know if the actress played by Barbara Barrie was insane, or if she really did have a baby in her mouth, but there is something very wrong with her acting. She keeps going around with her mouth open during the entire film. Her lines are just so unintelligible, so her face is so swollen it looks like she has a piece of glass in her skull.   I think the problem was the actress was supposed to have a little baby in the back of her throat during some of the scene in the asylum. It was hard to make out any of her lines, so it looked like she was speaking with a baby wrapped around her throat. I didn't think the story was very well done. I guess you could get away with that on television and people will still watch, but not in a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a terrible movie and the writer did a horrible job.   You have no idea who the director is, the cast sucks, the director and his wife did a crappy job, and you have a movie that was totally over the top.  - April 16, 2010Crazy, horrible movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has some good stuff but really doesn't deliver on the awesomeness promised in the trailer.   The acting was bad and the story lines weren't original.  The acting in this movie wasn't that great and the plot was just not that original.  The film is very good at the first half but then loses its grip on you in the second half. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After reading reviews, i have to say that the movie had a lot of problems. The director didn't know how to use a good performance by the main lead, which is very annoying. For example, when a cop finds a guy with a loaded gun, he doesn't shoot him immediately. Instead he says "Good morning" or "I got your name" or something. I was annoyed by that. And the movie got boring very fast, since there was no suspense, nothing dramatic. I guess he thought the film would be released on Friday, like the first one. This movie is an embarrassment to the movie industry, it is not worth watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you like the kind of movies that are so bad they make me sick, this is not one of them. The acting, the acting, is absolutely terrible. It would be funny if there wasn't so much stupid shit going on.   The only thing that gets worse than this movie is the music. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a pretty bad movie.  The director does nothing wrong, but the actors did nothing right.   The dialogue is terrible.  It doesn't even really matter how the film was made.  Why would you make a movie where the main character is constantly swearing and talking about his girlfriend?  If you could get a good film out of it, it would have been good.  But that's not what this film is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "Jupiter Ascending" trailer and trailer for "Jurassic World" was pretty misleading. While it was cool to watch a giant dinosaur, the actual movie was disappointing.   I was hoping this movie would be just as good, if not better, than the "Jungle Book."   If it weren't for the ridiculous action scenes, I may have enjoyed this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie from Amazon only because of the "bad reviews" on here. It's the same movie, just different actors. So I am going to review it the way it was meant to be. The movie is about a woman who has just had a child and is looking for some support for it. She meets an older couple and they tell her that she and the baby would make a perfect couple. They also tell her to find someone who can raise the child and make the child happy. Then she meets another couple who are interested in raising a child. She makes plans to visit them in their place and leaves a note saying that she has no other place to stay. When she arrives at their place they have a dog and want her to take it, but she doesn't want to do it. So she says no to them and tries to leave. But when they say they want to kill her she goes to a local hospital. There she finds out that she may have contracted rabies. So the guy that originally wanted to kill the woman for having the dog has been trying to get her to agree to give him the dog. She says that she is willing to go back to her place and to take the dog, but that she doesn' t want to go to the hospital and be treated by strangers. She goes back to the hotel and says that they should leave her alone since she doesn t want them to do this. When they leave she goes up to the room of the guy who had the dog and says to him "I'm not leaving until you come up with the money for the dog". He replies, "I'll give you $50 and then you can leave". Then he disappears. She calls his wife and she says that he's gone and that she's going to go find him. So off she goes in a taxi. After she gets to her hotel the couple asks her for a ride. She agrees to take them since she's tired and she goes into the bathroom. When the taxi driver starts talking to her she suddenly gets up and tells him to leave her. Then the couple goes into her room and she has to fight them off. Eventually she is able to get away and then tells the taxi guy to call her. He does and she tells him that he should never call her again. So that's the story. The only problem I had with this movie is the way the people acted in this. I can see how it could be very
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie   Is this movie  bad? It is the first movie i have seen in a long time that made me want to get out of my house and go to the nearest mall and buy a few dozen candy bars to take home with me.   The reason for this is the way the movie is told.  It is told from the characters point of view, which is a little hard to get used to. There is a lot of talk but none of it is meaningful. The story starts with a girl named Alyssa, who has fallen in love with a bad guy named Jack who is married to some woman called Lisa.  This is when she is in college. She sees a movie and her friend (Lisa) and her boyfriend (Jack) are in it, as well as some old people. This is the point where Alyssha is introduced. Jack tells her that he has just bought a movie ticket for her, but she is so happy to be in it. He makes her dance and she is very happy. She then takes off his ring and then they have sex. Then she goes to her dorm and leaves her boyfriend to go to bed. The next day she goes home to get some food. After she leaves, Alysshas fallen asleep and the next morning Lisa finds her missing. Then Lisa says she wants to see Jack again, so she goes and looks at a computer with Alyss and Jack on it. Lisa gets a message from Jack saying that he and Alyss have left town. Now Alyss lives with her dad (a doctor) and is having trouble adjusting to college. Her mom has come down with a cold and wants to move in with her. They are married now but Alyss is not very happy with her husband and has been seeing some guy named Dave. When Alyss's dad comes to stay with them, he leaves behind a key, which she needs for some stuff. When she finds the key, she starts to go through the stuff and finds some stuff she has never seen before. Alyss also finds a little bottle of Jack's semen. Then Alyss sees something that really pisses her off. It is some young girl's body and some of Alyssah own blood. It all ties together really well for a little movie. I did like the way Alyss started thinking about things that are going on in her life. There was a lot to keep track of, but that was okay because
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film had a really strange story-line, it was just all over the place. I liked the film because of the plot of the movie.  I thought the action scenes looked very nice and it was pretty good. The special effects are really good and you can really feel it. This is a movie that is very good to watch with the family. It also has a pretty good plot to go with it, which is good. My favorite thing about this movie was the car chase scenes. The movie didn't have a great ending at the end, it just went on and on. The best part of the film was the chase scenes- the car chases looked cool and scary. I enjoyed the movie but the special effects in it were very hard to see.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A great movie, except there are some major flaws. The dialogue between the main character and his mother is not very interesting and it gets very repetitive.   The story is pretty boring, and the scenes are either too long (I counted 12) or too short (I guess only about 5 or 6 minutes).   I believe this is the only movie that I haven't seen by the author.  What a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this when it was in theaters on TV. I can't remember the name of the movie, but I think it was about a little boy who lives in a small village and he has to travel to find a girl who is the last one left.   He was given a gun by a girl and he travels out into the forest to get her.  While he is there, he is attacked by a giant snake who tries to eat him.  A girl, who was standing near a river, saved him. She then told him her story.  I think this movie should be put in a museum.  It is just horrible.  The only redeeming feature in this movie is the girl. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a very boring movie. I don't think it's very well directed and the acting isn't that great either. I just think it was poorly written and acted and that it doesn't have much to say. The story was really lame. I can't stand horror films and this is worse than some of the other crappy ones I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was at first hesitant to watch this movie because it is so violent.  I mean seriously, you can't watch a movie like this and think it's okay.  This is a terrible movie.  The whole movie was a nightmare, and not a good one.   If you don't want to see a violent movie, avoid this.  It doesn't matter if you're 13 or 50, this movie has enough violence to kill your family.  If anyone else wants to watch a violent film, they can find it.  For a movie about "a woman trapped in the house of a man who killed her husband and two kids in an apparent random shooting", the acting was awful.  Every single actor had their performance drop the minute they started acting.  Not only that, the screenplay was as bad as the acting. The story was so bad, the whole movie feels like a bad dream that you wake up from.  But there is a part where the bad acting and bad screenplay are almost forgivable because it has great acting and a good script.  When they were making the movie, they didn't bother to research on the history of the family in this movie, because there was never any mention of the fact that the family was a member of the "Langoliers".  The only reason they filmed the movie was for the gore, so they filmed it right after the attack that happened in this family. And there it is, the last "good" horror movie you'll ever watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most boring movie ever.   Even the acting was atrocious.  It was like watching a "Star Wars" movie and only one character was a good guy (Roddy McDowell).   They even had all those classic "Space:1999" shots.  Why don't they show the movies in a theater like they do with "Star Trek"?   I was more entertained watching "Space 1999" than this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just a cheap B-movie that is poorly directed and it's full of old stereotypes.   There is no story and the plot is lame and lame.  The actors are lame and they don't even try to act like they have the talent they show in the movie.  There are more people who have bad acting skills than who have a good one.  I have seen this movie dozens of times and I have never seen a better version of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie in the early 90's on a friend's VHS player and I don't remember much else other than some pretty bad acting, the title and title card were done by a movie actor who had a short career and no filmography, it's an ugly film to look at, the lighting and look of it were pretty bad, it reminds me of the black and white version of a certain film by the same title, and I hate black and whites, and this has a very poor looking film to boot, the acting is awful and the direction was not that great, but if you liked that movie it should be ok, but it's not, there is no replay value to this one, it has an okay runtime, and a terrible score to go along with it, it won't be showing up on any Top Rated list any time soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film doesn't really give any context for the reason why they were all there or how they got there, but I feel like it would've made a great thriller or a really funny movie if they were given enough time to get to know one another.   It's just one big group of people who aren't doing anything and they've got to leave soon.      
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "Maniac Mansion" (1984) movie was directed by David Fincher. The film was produced by Paul Verhoeven. The movie has one of the most interesting storylines ever made. A guy with a huge ego, a young hotshot (Matt Dillon), is sent to "the mansion" to do a little training with a professional "killer". The film also includes some of the best gore you will ever see.   A very entertaining film, and David F. really pulls out all the stops in this movie. The special effects are pretty impressive, and the acting is fantastic.  I loved this film, so I highly recommend watching it if you get a chance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen this movie before and thought it was decent, but not great, so I just watched it again to see if they would do anything to make it better.    The actors were great and had a great time making this movie, but it felt like they forgot how to act and the writing was really bad.  For example, the police officers are always talking about something that was going on when this incident happened, and it would have made more sense if they said something was happening when the shooting happened.  The only thing that makes this movie worth watching is the great acting by all of the actors, especially the lead actors, so if you like these actors and want to see them doing something other than what they do on the television, this is a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My mom gave me this movie when I was a kid. My mom is the first person to ever bring me a movie that doesn't suck. I thought the picture looked okay but it was just a crappy movie. This movie was just crap. Not worth the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a good movie, but it's also one that you'll find hard to take in. The dialogue is so bad that you end up laughing as you watch it. The acting is very bad, but nothing to be worried about.    I watched this movie after seeing a trailer about it. When it first came out, I thought it was a comedy and went out and watched it. I was disappointed. I never thought it would be a movie about a crazy person and a crazy group of crazy people but, it is. It's just an entertaining comedy about a bunch of crazy guys, but with the worst acting in the world and not much plot going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was in the cinema waiting to see this movie when the first trailer of the movie came up.   It was very creepy, creepy, eerie.  So, I waited till the very end to see it.  But, at the last minute the movie cut off, and the trailer came back on again.  The movie itself was not as creepy as the trailer, but the movie was not worth seeing, but to be sad that it's not more scary or creepy.  It didn't make me feel any kind of fear, I was just kind of looking at the screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just finished this. It was fun while it lasted.    If you are a fan of horror, especially movies like "Carrie," "The Exorcist," and "Rosemary's Baby," this is not for you.  If the movie was good, it would have made a lot of people happy.  "The Conjuring" is the story of two young girls, one is possessed and is being haunted by a spirit of a girl murdered many years earlier.  They start a strange investigation, and find themselves in a home that is not normal. This house has a strange vibe, it is the sort of place you would see in a horror movie. This is where it gets very creepy. I am glad to see that the movie wasn't good.  But, for what it was, it was pretty good. The girl is not well developed, but you can see that she has been affected by a powerful force. I don't think she was possessed or anything, but her possession, I suppose it could be called that.  The makeup was great, and the actress, who plays the possessed girl, was really scary. She looked like a demon, not someone who would be afraid of something like that. I was very scared when she showed up.  There were some really weird parts, like one of the girls and her mother were making a strange ritual involving a mirror.  While it is a very strange story, I thought the movie kept it interesting and made it worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't enjoy the movie. It was awful. I mean, that's how the first half was. The acting was terrible, and the story was stupid. The actors could have used a little more acting practice (the whole cast was good), but the movie was so bad that I didn-t really care. It didn't help that it had a weird soundtrack that made you want to turn it off.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a real disappointment.   It is set in the 90s and this movie is filled with nostalgia from that time and nothing else.  It lacks the creativity of the new movie from 2008 and there is no reason to watch this.  In the 90's the big studios made their movies look cool and with this movie it is pretty much the same.  You should be ashamed to show your kids this movie because it is completely forgettable.  I will never see another movie from this studio.  The movie is boring and I cannot wait for the new one! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As the title suggest, this is a bad horror movie. It is poorly written and the actors/ actresses did not seem to be capable of anything else. A good actress like Tippi Hedren or even Melanie Griffith would have easily made this movie interesting.   This movie is one of the few horror movies of this decade that you will never watch again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wanted to like this movie. I don't really know why, since the acting and directing were not to my taste.  I guess it is because it was all done in a high school setting. I guess I should have watched the other parts of this movie instead.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad part of this movie is that it's all in black and white so you can't see if the characters are actually talking. I didn't like this at all and think the best thing you can do with it is have the family sit down and watch it on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A boring and dull movie. If you are expecting a good horror movie then you got some other shit. I had some fun with this movie, it is very interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is really bad.   A lot of times movies will have some really good moments and some really bad moments, but for this one, I am really not sure if this movie is just bad or if there is no scene in this movie where it was good.  The story is kind of funny because it makes you want to laugh with the characters but there are a lot of really bad things that happen in the story.  I just really did not like this movie.  This movie did not really make any money at all, and the studio did not take advantage of it.  It was made in 1992, so it is kind hard to even get this movie anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love this movie   It has a lot of laughs and it's all in Japanese   When you first start watching this film you're going to think it's going to be one of those silly kung fu movies. It's not. I found it to be quite the challenge. When I say this film's challenge I don't mean it's a hard movie to watch. It has that old school movie charm that has made the likes of Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jackie Martling, etc. and many others famous. But the film has a very different feel to it compared to those others. There is a lot going on here and if you want to enjoy a classic kung fu film without spending a fortune on the latest and greatest kungfus, you'll love this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A really poor film. This movie is so bad, I had to watch it a second time just to get my thoughts out.   I have never seen a movie so terrible. The acting is terrible.  The plot is very confusing. This film has a very poor plot, you have to watch this film over and over again just to understand the plot.  There is a whole lot of action, but they don't bother to shoot a good amount of film.  I could not understand why the police would allow this guy in, it would be inhumane.  This is one of those movies that just makes you say "what a great idea, but it will never work."    This was a bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of those horrible movies, so bad that the only people who watch it are people who are actually retarded. And the movie is so bad, so uninteresting, and so ridiculous that I am amazed anyone would think that this could be made good. A guy in an old car crashes into a carload of people, all of whom have been playing a game in a restaurant at the time, but he's been asleep at the wheel, and then the person driving the other car decides to go at it, and he doesn't see that it's too late and he's dead. You think that sounds stupid? Well, this movie was made by a retard who thinks that a movie about a dead guy running a little game in an arcade is a good idea. That and he didn't have any money for a stuntman, or a car with a special license plate, or anything. A few of the people in the other cars are pretty well-known, and there are actually a lot of them (you can tell because the guy who dies and wakes up in the car with the other people doesn't have much body hair, he is obviously a dwarf, and is wearing old clothes, so the other guys see him and think they are in a video game). The rest of them are all very, very unimpressive, like some of the extras in the movie "King Kong", except this movie has so many of them that the real-life "King" Kong doesn't look anything like them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has all of the classic tropes of slasher films but with a completely different feel to it. It's like a mix between the slasher movies of the 60's and 70's and the "Friday the 13th" movies of today. The main character (I think he's named "Nelson") is very much like Jason Voorhees. He has a strong and mysterious persona and always seems to know what's happening. However, he's the only one who really knows who is killing people and he has no clue what the killer wants. The one saving grace of this movie is that it manages to stay true to the slashers of yesteryear while adding a modern feel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "B" is very obvious for all the money it was going to bring in. The film is poorly made. The actors don't seem to be acting, or even being in the movie, which makes it seem even more stupid.   I wish the actor who plays "the detective" had some real talent! He has great potential and seems to be making up a lot of dialogue to get the scenes he's in.  The "B"'s are very clear on how many people will be watching the film, which means a lot more will be wearing seat belts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is no way you can judge this movie with one view. If you have seen only the first half of the movie, you would think it was the last part of the story. It is the worst part of a film that is so bad and completely different from the first one.   I hope some day this movie will be released in all countries because it is a masterpiece. The only way to get it in DVD would be to go to a movie house or buy it from a friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I remember that I saw this movie when I was a kid. I remember seeing it when it was in theaters for the first time, and I remember thinking it was great. I was also really impressed by the special effects. It was quite shocking at the time when I saw it because it was pretty much unheard of to show a movie like that. I think it's a great movie, and it's hard to believe it's actually a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In short, the movie makes the "bad guys" look like heroes, and the bad guys look like losers who just don't want to win.  This is the exact opposite of "Die Hard", and if the movie was the latter then the action should have been better.  The movie just keeps on repeating itself and never makes you laugh or even give you a good feeling, and you can't help but feel like a complete idiot for having to sit through it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is terrible.   I watched it for the first time on video and really didn't like it.  The acting, direction and editing are all very amateurish.  I was expecting something like the first version of Caddyshack  but with less of a movie star.  All the extras were very bad, from actors who were supposedly in the movie, to a crappy poster.  At one point they showed a short film with actors who never appeared in the film, including one who looked like Robert Duvall  (I think).   This was the movie I heard about on the grapevine, and it turned out to be just another terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a huge disappointment. It's not that it's bad, but it's just not all that interesting, funny, or entertaining. It may be a bit boring and predictable, but at least there are some good moments in here.    It's a shame that this film was made and made by the same people as the others I've seen before it.  If you like campy slasher films you can look at these others, but this one just falls a bit flat. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I have seen. The actors were all very average at best. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was an ok movie, but it didn't live up to the expectations I had. Not a good start, but definitely worth a watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad. It is so poorly acted, written, and filmed that it is impossible to watch. It doesn't have any originality. The actors all do very bad impressions of each other and their characters are all bad. This is the worst film I have seen in years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I hate watching the same movie over and over again. I want a new movie. Not a remake or a rip off. It needs a director with some talent to bring something fresh and new. It also needs to have some new actors and it needs a new plot. I think it will never get any better and I am very disappointed in this movie. It is not fun to watch. You will be bored and want a different movie. I hope the film industry never gives up trying to do it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In all seriousness, it's a good movie. It has a great plot and character development, and it has some fantastic music and visual effects. The characters are fun and likeable, and the performances are excellent.   I think the film takes a bit of a strange turn when the action scene takes a turn to be more psychological than action-packed, and this has the unfortunate effect of creating a lot of tension, as well as making the ending slightly rushed.  A lot of the action scenes seem like they could have been cut out and cut out the parts where the characters are talking about what they've seen, instead of going straight to the end of the movie where everything comes out at once. The movie is worth seeing, but if you can get past a few quirks, you will find a nice little science fiction movie with a great story and lots of action scenes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so bad it is bad. It is like watching two people having a good time, one being retarded, the other retarded, and the dumbone in the third was a little retarded and was just making noise.   It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I am going to watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this was a terrible idea. A little bit of violence and nudity is okay...but the dialogue was terrible. The actor who played the villain was the weakest, and the girl who played her love interest was a total whore. The villainess had a lot of hair, and her clothing was just cheap and not very comfortable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible movie and a waste of your time. If you're a fan of movies like this, and like to see your favorite actors in terrible films, then you should never see this movie.   The plot was incredibly bad. It was supposed to be about a father trying to rescue his daughter and the evil alien who's trying to destroy the Earth. Instead of just showing a father helping his daughter, the movie goes into some really cheesy sci-fi stuff. It made my head spin and was pretty embarrassing to watch.  As far as the actors go, most of them are not good. The only actors who I think are good are Kevin Sorbo, and his wife, Sandra Bullock. They made this movie so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was very nice of the producers to make this film, and there was nothing wrong with it.  It is very well made, with some nice special effects. The action is great, and the actors do a fine job.  But the story is so bad, that I would have liked to watch it a second time to watch the actors act it out.  They really are trying to do a romantic story about two people who are married, but the characters have no chemistry and the movie never takes them anywhere, the actors never learn to act together.   I will watch it again, but not after seeing this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I gave it a five out of ten and was very disappointed by this movie.  I did not think the actors were at all believable, the plot was completely nonsensical and the whole movie has a cheap feel to it.  I will never go see this movie again, just watch some old classic movies like The Great Escape or the Three Musketeers instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really wanted to like this movie. My daughter and I sat through it together and loved it. But the acting was all over the place. You could tell they did it for ratings and I really wish they would have had actors who could really deliver what they were saying. There were a couple of really great performances and one great scene and they were done by Michael Jai White (a big name at the time) and Robert Forster. I thought for sure that they would get these actors in some of their movies but that didn't happen. They just didn't have the right caliber of actors in those days.   So in summary, this movie is really fun and funny. It just doesn't come together as well as it should. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a horrible movie. Don't waste your time or money. It's only a half an hour and it has some of the worst acting of all time. The script is terrible. A real disappointment.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those movies that you really have to see to understand how bad the writing is. It is so bad that it is painful to watch. If it were any better, it would be a comedy.    No matter how hard I try, I just can't find any humor here.  (3/5)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you want a bad Sci-Fi movie, this is it.   One of the worst I have ever seen.  One thing that made this movie so bad was the way it ended, with a long (unintelligible) rant by a man about how he wanted to destroy Earth and everything that it stood for.  You want Sci-fi?  Watch this and then the other crappy movies with a really low budget: The Dark Crystal, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Escape from New York, Raging Bull and the like. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a disappointment   The main villain was never developed enough to be interesting and the entire cast was just bland, especially if you think of some of the actors from "Fargo". "The Mist" didn't deliver on all the potential it had when it was first released and, if it was even half as good as it appears to be now, it would have earned a perfect score from me. "The Man from Nowhere" is not a bad film, but it just wasn't made as well as it could have been.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst film I have seen so far! If you like a good laugh and enjoy a cheesy 70s action flick this is the one for you!   This movie is full of so many jokes and one of the greatest action sequences ever made!  The most impressive thing about this movie is the performances of the actors, the way they use different angles to give their scenes a different feel.   I love the way all of the different groups of people fight on screen and it adds an element of tension to the movie!  After all this effort put into this movie and the huge star cast it just all comes off as a slap in the face! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the third time I've seen this movie. The first time, I thought it was good, the second time I thought I saw a bad one, but the third one was pretty bad.   The story starts off OK, with a character who thinks he is the one who knows what is going on, but then he decides to investigate, and has to deal with the people he believes are out to destroy him.  When this guy thinks he knows what he is doing, he is really digging a hole for himself. He thinks he can make himself a hero if he is a good guy. Unfortunately, this is just not the case.  The whole time the character is trying to be a good person, he just isn't.  He is so obsessed with doing things that people think he can't possibly do and then is not able to live without having to go back and look for the things that are missing and what he has been trying to cover up.  This guy really has no self-control.  That is the most disgusting thing that I have ever seen in a movie.  They didn't get away with making a movie like this and then playing it backwards.  I know it is a film from the 70's, but they could at least have used a good editing machine to make this movie better.  It is a real shame because it was so good and I think they should remake it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie off the internet. When it came to watching it I was skeptical of it. I am so glad I took a chance. It is just as bad as it was reported. The acting is terrible, and there is just no excitement whatsoever. It doesn't even feel like a movie anymore. It's just a crappy movie where all the actors have no talent whatsoever. What a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a bad and sad movie for kids.  The children in this movie act like idiots when a truck full of drugs runs over some kids. This is really bad, the kids just go crazy trying to get the drugs and get away.   All the kids in this film are so stupid it makes you wonder if they are really humans or animals.  What a waste of money and bad actors!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really like this movie, but I think the writing of the movie is completely lame and that is the only good thing that the movie has. I think they got the script from a movie like "Stardust" (which was a terrible movie too) and that movie was written by David Zucker and David Zucker's son. I don't think this movie was directed by Zucker's daughter and I think she was so scared of Zucker's reputation that she made the movie when he was dead. I liked the actors in this movie because they were all really good and their characters were really good.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say that this movie is one of the most frustrating I have seen. It is the sort of movie that you feel you have seen or seen is just a very bad copy of something.   The story is a complete joke.  It is so over-the-top in its presentation and dialogue.  You don't have to be a genius to get this movie, but if you are, you really have no business watching it.  This movie is like a poor-man's version of a B-movie.  No actors that can really bring anything to the table.  The special effects are so bad you cannot believe how the actors do it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love the first one and this one is better. I think it's a better film but I wish it had a more interesting storyline. The second film makes the first movie seem boring. I don't understand why they went back to this plot.   It's a very boring story, and not a lot of laughs either.  It really seems that they just used the first film as a template to re-do a second film. The story just feels like they just wrote something and made some changes here and there.  The acting was terrible in this one, and the plot of the movie just does not make sense.  There was also a guy in the first who played a character and that guy was in the second film as well but he has no lines in this film.  Even the "good guys" didn't have any lines, which makes it look like the "bad guys" were the only ones that had lines.  I didn't understand the whole "fate of a world" plot. All I wanted to know is: "Who will win in a fight between two evil aliens?"   The only part of the film that was really good was the third act, but that was it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is good, but it is over-done. If you want to see the most dramatic chase scene in film history then this movie is for you. It is more like a crime drama than a chase movie, and it really gets the adrenaline pumping. The action is really well done, and the special effects are pretty good. But it is all just so rushed that the movie doesn't really live up to the hype. It does have the makings of a great action movie, but you just have to watch it with the window wide open.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is all over the place. When I was first watching it it was all the different cultures and countries. I was laughing and happy at the same time. Then there were a few things that just felt wrong. When people of different races or religions were fighting it made the movie go from comedy to farce. I am glad the movie was only 2 hours but if it was more I am not sure this movie would have lasted more than that.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very bad movie. What a rip off of the old horror films! Not much happened and the acting was bad and the scares were fake.   I was so disappointed when I found out this was a ripoff and it was going to be re-released on TV.  A great movie is ruined by these cheap copy movies that are out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had all the wrong things going on. The acting was pretty bad and the acting was bad because of the actors. The plot was very bad and was a waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not very good. It was very badly written and badly acted. The acting was bad.   The music was also terrible. The song "When I Was Young" was not that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I just wanted to see this movie. I was looking for an action movie and I found it.    It's a fun movie but you don't really see that much. It really needs more action and the special effects really did not wow me.  "  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot of the movie is quite simple, its a movie about a man who finds out he's dying and decides to kill himself so he doesn't have to deal with the pain of his suffering. It does, however, have some flaws that hinder the movie from being completely entertaining. First of all, I don't know how much of a guy this guy is, because he clearly is going to kill his self and doesn't even care about the person that he just killed. I mean, he even says "I don't care." There was something so unsympathetic about this guy. The movie also takes its time getting to the point of the plot. It takes almost the whole movie for the main character to realize that he's actually dying and has to decide what to do. The main character then has to deal for the rest of the film with a lot of his friends and family who still love him. The plot could have been much more effective if it had gotten into the characters and what they went through before they finally made up their minds. I could have made this movie much better with some more characters and plot. Other than the problems the movie has with its plot, the movie itself was still enjoyable. The music in the movie was great and I liked that they used a different composer for each of the music tracks. I also liked the character that the movie dealt with, he was a lot more believable than the other guys in the show. I think the movie would have been a lot better if it was made a little longer and had more characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just finished the movie for the umpteenth time. This is the only thing I have heard of this film and I don't want to spend any more time on it.   There is no humor, no charm, no character development, no music.  There are just some scenes where I wanted to slap this movie out of my head.  This is like a bad version of "G.I Joe".  This movie is completely bad and I am sure that there are worse movies out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was so excited to see this movie. I watched it on DVD, so that was a plus for me.   This is basically a very bad movie.  From beginning to end, it's just horrible. I'm pretty sure that the original producer, William Lustig, tried to remake this movie as a "true-life" account of the events leading to the creation of the atomic bomb, but it ended up being way too close to the movie (The movie "wasn't that good").   So why does it have such a terrible rating?  There's just too much bad acting, horrible acting, and bad dialog.  The scenes where the characters are having dinner with the people that designed the bomb, are just as bad.  I wouldn't even give this movie a 0 or a 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I enjoyed this one a lot. I didn't see a movie like this for years and years and loved it. The cast was perfect for this movie. The story was interesting and the acting was fantastic. I just hope they find someone to play Dwayne Johnson. It would be fun to see him in something more action packed.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid. I was so disappointed by it. The writing was poor. The acting was bad. I remember thinking at the time that it was just a low budget movie and not worth going to see. It doesn't hold a candle to some of the movies on this list.    The only saving grace is that it has some really bad monsters.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have been wanting to watch this movie since I first read the reviews about it on a movie forum. I love the movie and will probably watch it a few more times. This movie will make you appreciate the classic action movies that were made in the 70's. You don't need to have seen this movie to enjoy it but it is still an entertaining watch. I would recommend this movie but I would not recommend watching it alone. It is just too difficult to watch with one and only person.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so bad, I could not find even the most basic of details about the plot. I would recommend this movie to those who want to see a bad horror movie in a cheap theater.   The actors are really really bad, they give such bad performances that I have a hard time believing this is a movie that they made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I was little I saw an old black and white movie about a boy and girl who go to a circus. I don't remember much about the movie, but it was pretty bad. When I saw the movie a few years ago I decided to get it. I got it and was surprised to find out that the movie was not made by the original director. The movie was actually done by a movie theater. When the movie theater was closed down, the original filmmaker, who had already made a lot of other movies, was forced to release it. The result is a terrible film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a big waste of my time. I'm glad I didn't waste too much of it watching it.   I'm not a big movie buff but I thought this movie was crap from the beginning to the end. It didn't have any redeeming qualities except it is a stupid movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked this movie a lot, but not enough.   It started off with good intentions.  They wanted to show the atrocities that occurred in WW2 and how the Japanese army killed the POWs.  After that, the film went off in a different direction.  Most of the movie is shot in a Japanese prison camp.  For a while it made you want to see some of the scenes.  It was a really bad movie.  As a matter of fact, it was a poor excuse to film a movie.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a waste of time. It is not interesting, it is not good, it was filmed in the most expensive way possible. It was terrible and i am sad about it. I will never see this movie again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie looks cool, but it doesn't do much with the actors.   I am a huge fan of the original Alien and this film doesn't bring any new blood to the movie.  It's a bland, boring movie, with little to no plot.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a terrible mess of a movie that's not worth seeing.   The film is in black and white and there are no sound effects and there is absolutely nothing in the story to make you believe this film is worth seeing.   Director Paul Morris is a known and liked director who shot a couple of low budget horror films but this film was nothing like anything he has done before.  Morris made the film and it was finished in about 6 weeks but Morris still did not know how to shoot it.  What a terrible movie and Morris should be embarrassed to release a film like this.  Morris has no idea what he is doing and he should do another horror film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was extremely disappointed with this film. I thought the story line was intriguing and very well-written, but the acting, cinematography, and production of this film was so bad. The only good thing I can say about it was that it was made with a good intention, but if the film was made by someone else, I would have never seen it. The cinematography was very poor, the actors were mediocre at best, and the acting was laughable and annoying.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I both had a lot of fun at the premiere of this film.  I found it interesting to watch a movie about two lovers who have been apart for quite some time.  It felt to me like a love story.  They have been together for so long that it almost feels like the two were meant for each other.   The sex scene between Scott (who is a very good actor) and Catherine (who has a great personality and wonderful sense of humor) was really hot and quite entertaining.  The director wanted to show this loving couple get close.  While this was going on, I thought the movie had a nice pace, but was missing something.  This was a very emotional movie.  But the sex scenes were pretty much gone after the first scene.  That said, we ended up going to the second part.  At least it was an enjoyable movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. It was great fun and I really liked how it was about a little girl and her family in a small town in Maine. The girl's mother is pretty much a bad person and the family seems like they are in good spirits.   The movie has been out of print for a long time and it is so well known that there is no need to go back to watch it and it has never been released on video.  The only reason I found the movie worth watching is because it was fun and it was a good laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, it's not a bad film, but it's certainly not good either.   It is definitely not worth watching.  It's a poor excuse for a western that will leave you wondering, 'did anyone else see this crap? ' There is a very interesting story here but it doesn't have enough substance for us to care much about it.  The acting is very bad.  I was really expecting a much better film here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The reason that this movie is terrible is that it is all set up, so that you already know exactly what you're getting. There are so many twists and turns in this movie that you don't realize what's going on until it's too late.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just didn't like this movie at all, i loved the other horror movies that the director was doing like   The Conjuring  and the last one,  but this one sucked   What an awful movie to watch and watch a lot of times  . It was horrible  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I hate that I watched this movie. I didn't want to, I was really excited to see it. I got to go on a family vacation with my daughter and my son was only a year old at the time. My son is now 21 and my daughter is 26. I am ashamed to say that we were both in love with this movie, the whole family did. We had it over the weekend and watched it last night. It made me feel bad for my son. I guess there is something very wrong with the family when he was a child and I still love him to this day. I can only assume he didn't get his acting job because his mom wanted him to have more sex with another man while his father watched, just like we did in the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are looking for the most realistic portrayal of war from the last 50 years (with a small smattering of action thrown in for good measure), look elsewhere.   This movie is not a realistic depiction of war, but an attempt to portray a very realistic "what-if." It is not at all a true depiction of the "realistic" war experiences. The action scenes are all staged.  It is just a very poorly done "what if."   A lot of people like the movie and would give it a 9 out of 10, but not me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has very low production values. If the movie was produced at any higher level then it would look great. There are only 3 actors and no CGI. The only one that you should care about is the one that does the "dancing" scene.   The plot in this movie is a complete joke. It has nothing to do with the actual movie. It's just an excuse to get in some weird scenes of people dancing on water with no life in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So, here's the review that's been sitting on my hard drive for a few months now, just waiting for someone to review it. I've seen this movie at least a dozen times since its original release in the mid 80's, and I don't know that I can ever come close to the original. The remake is not the movie I saw back then, but I've watched it enough times that I still can't believe that I saw it the first time.   My favorite scene in the film is the final one, where a boy is about to be sent to the guillotine, and he gets this one last kiss from a pretty old lady. It makes me sad that this film was a victim of a Hollywood budgeting thing, as I think it might be an 80's classic, and one of the best.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked this movie, but it was a total let down for me. The acting is okay, the plot is not very original and the pacing is kind of slow. It just doesn't keep me watching and wondering what the hell is going on, and I never felt anything really "exciting" going on.   If you like the "new" slasher films, this may be up your alley. If you don't like slashers, you will probably hate this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing about this movie is how funny and entertaining it is! I did not find any humor in this movie at all. The acting was terrible. Not only was it awful, it was downright embarrassing. The one and only time I laughed in this film was when Bill Murray was being a little shit and he was a really pathetic drunk.  I did laugh at the stupid looking man on the right and the lady in the car and I thought it was funny.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My brother had a copy of this movie. It scared the hell out of him, and he didn't understand why his friends were laughing at it.   The plotline is crap, the characters are one-dimensional, and there is no plot.  This movie is so bad, that the only redeeming feature of this film is its soundtrack. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the kind of film that is made to get you to see it, it's not bad, it has a lot of humor and a little bit of heart and it's a film I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a quick laugh and some entertainment.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting is awful. I don't care if the "bad guy" is the actor who plays him. I'm really pissed that this was allowed to be made.   I watched it in the theater, and was disappointed.  The pacing was very choppy, and I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen while watching it.  I really don't know what it's supposed to be about, but it doesn't work as a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a bit hesitant on going to see this movie, since I'm not the biggest fan of this type of movie. That being said, I can tell you that this movie wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The actors were all very good, and the acting was really good. The story is pretty good, but nothing special to me. If you are not a fan of the horror genre, then I would give this movie a miss. However, if you like a good horror film, then by all means, go see it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure if this was actually a bad film, but I think it's probably best avoided by audiences with any type of taste. As I said in my reviews, this is a very poorly made movie, with bad acting, cheesy acting, poor direction, and bad special effects. I guess they went with some of the most poorly animated films of the early 80s, which isn't a good thing, but this is by far the worst film of that year.  It looks like a kid's cartoon that was made for the Disney channel, and that's a shame.  The sound is awful, even when it's not playing. The voice actors don't seem to know the lines, so they just speak randomly. The music is awful too, it's a mix of the songs from Disney theme parks (which is bad) and the music of the 70s (which isn't that bad).   The only thing in the movie I enjoyed were the "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" music videos that are shown. The action scenes are laughable, and the way they are made is terrible (even worse than the movie itself).  And to top it all off, they didn't even bother to finish the movie in time, so the kids' animation from the movie, while it is fun and well-done, is nothing close to the real thing.  I give it a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My mother and i are old friends, so i knew her to watch movies before I was born, and my father used to watch them with her, too. But this was bad, the acting was bad and the scenes were all wrong. There were scenes that were supposed to be scary but there were no scares and the actors never looked scared. The worst thing was the ending.   What happened to the monster? I know they said that a man saw it and it was scared out of his wits, but it was just a little girl. I hope this movie never gets made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not worth it. A good movie with a bad director would not have been this bad.  I would have been able to enjoy it if not for this bad director.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It doesn't make much sense why they made this movie so long ago. It's supposed to be about a boy who dies at a young age, but they didn't include a close-up of his face. He only has his eyes, hands and feet visible. I think the director and writer thought that would be an interesting way to show the death, but then nobody else had heard about it, so no one bothered to make a movie about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a very bad movie. The actor is really bad. He has to be in his 40's and the acting is all over the place. If you are looking for a movie to sit through and watch people act like idiots, this is the film for you.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had never seen this before, and I can only imagine that most people who had never had any experience with it had no idea what to expect.  I would recommend this film for the gorey and brutal scenes, but it falls flat for the rest.  The acting in this film was pretty bad as well, but I guess that was expected when you are shooting a film with a budget of under $5 million. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie I ever seen.   It's the worst bad movie  I've ever seen   I think. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are a fan of the late 90's and early 00's then you will probably love this movie. It's a great example of how you can make a great movie for a very low budget. However, this movie is not worth seeing at all. It has a poor script that is filled with lame jokes and terrible acting. Also, the director (Eddie Murphy) was always a joke in every other movie he did.   The main cast: Eddie Murphy, James Woods, Chris O'Donnell and John Goodman are the stars of this movie and they don't give a flying f@!% about each other or what anyone else thinks of them.  Funny stuff: The movie has some truly funny stuff, including Murphy's great impression of a drunk man saying " I want a little something for my m*!#"   This movie also had some really good acting as well. They all did a great job playing their characters and really gave it their all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a fun movie, it is a lot of fun to watch. But I do not like this movie at all. I mean I do but it is so wrong and so boring and stupid, and I would not recommend this movie to anybody.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is garbage, no good acting, low quality, awful plot, terrible acting, no dialogue, it was very long, but that's not a good thing, it is a terrible movie and I hope nobody watched it.    My son was watching this on TV one night and he saw the ending, and he asked "What about the plot?" And I said "I don't know...we had to go into the bedroom and he shot the baby"   A woman who plays the mom just does not seem to know how to act, she's not good at acting, and she doesn't really act like a mother to her kids.  If you are going to watch this movie, watch it in black and white, it's just not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I gave this movie a 4 star rating because it had some good moments, and the story and characters were good.   The plot was so convoluted and ridiculous that it made the film completely ridiculous.  I watched it with a friend, and he kept asking me if it was a joke, and I had no idea what was going on, and how this movie was supposed to make a plot twist.  Then I realized the plot had nothing to do with what was happening on the screen, and it was just a cheap excuse for the movie to take a quick break.  If the movie was meant to be a "what would happen if all the world's governments were to come together and create a world government", it was awful.  There were some good characters, such as Bill, the President of the World, who did have some good lines and was very charismatic.  But he was also a bad leader.  The film was over a decade old and was obviously put together in the 70's.  This movie was also terrible at creating a new world government, and while some people think it is an amazing idea for a new society, it was too ridiculous to work.  In addition, the movie did a great job of showing what is wrong with the current political system, and not only is it too easy to manipulate, it does it in a way that would be hard for people to believe.  Overall, a very disappointing film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love the first half of this movie and I love most of the actors in it. It is a fun film but has no redeeming qualities. The last thirty minutes or so are a nightmare. The story of the people who found the bodies in the river was interesting. I just wish they would have cut the scene where the cops are driving by the body and a cop in the back of the car comments on it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie and I have to say it is a very dull, uninspired film. The plot is all wrong and the acting is not what it is suppose to be. There are so many things that are wrong with this film that it is hard to keep track of all of the issues that it has. The actors are very flat and there is not one good line from anyone. The story is very confusing as the characters are not explained and it is difficult to follow what is happening because it is all told through exposition. This is a movie that I wish I had never seen. The acting and plot is not worth watching at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like this movie, it was over-rated. I am not a fan of big screen action flicks or action movies in general. I always had problems watching them, but this one seemed to have gotten a bad rep, so I guess the studio was afraid to release it. I liked the premise of the film, but the film never developed well and just fell apart. The acting and action scenes were good, but it is an action movie so it falls flat. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You know, the problem with this movie isn't the acting. You think the acting in this film is bad because of the director, who never has the acting figured out. Not only did I like most of the actors, but also they actually played the roles. I'm not going to lie, I've seen a lot of horrible movie's and this one did not have much bad acting. It did have some terrible acting, but it did have the actors playing the roles in the right way. The problem is that the bad acting and acting that was on screen is not worth watching. I would have much rather seen the movie without the acting, especially for a director who hasn't figured out how to get the acting right.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was an awful movie. The entire cast was awful and the plot was pointless. If you want to see people getting their throats slashed, stabbed and raped, then this is the movie for you.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you're going to watch this film, be prepared for the worst possible performance by the actor who played the villain.   The film takes place in a future where a powerful company has come up with an anti-gravity device that, once you take off in it, is undetectable by any type of sensors. The plot follows the story of a young man who is traveling back in time to thwart the evil mastermind behind the invention.  However, the film doesn't go into detail about the "dark" future they're living in.  Also, the whole thing ends with a bad ending, even though it doesn't get worse than the movie starts.  This is probably the most boring, uninteresting, and uninspired film ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a very poor re-telling of the classic "The Wizard of Oz." The original story is wonderful, and the movie tries to make it sound like it is. It just doesn't work.   Here are a few more reviews from people who didn't watch this terrible movie: The Wizard Of Oz is one of the worst horror movies ever made. The acting is horrible, the story is terrible, and even the special effects suck. I hope that some of you out there watch this movie and tell them to put a guy in a witch's outfit and let him fly around as Dorothy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If there is one flaw in this movie I will give it to the special effects. The character's skin seems to be made of plaster. Not to mention the camera was not that good. The acting was terrible and there was never any plot going on. I guess all the special looks on the faces of the actors was not a good idea as they could not pull off any convincing facial expressions. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have a hard time remembering the last time I actually saw a movie that was so terrible. This is an example of bad filmmaking.  This movie is made in China and the people who made it are not very skilled at making movies. The script was horrible and the acting was very bad. They should take this movie out of China and bring it over here for some real talent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "We are left with nothing, except the sound of wind, water and the sound made by the animals." - The film's narrator I don't even like this film, but it's not as if I have not seen it before. I'm not a scientist, but I know that this isn't really natural. And it's so strange that it's on film.   The film opens with a shot of the ocean, but then it switches to a man, with the words, "Cinema is a mirror." The man is on a boat, and he is being told by another man, "Take a closer look at me." A second woman in a boat is also being told, "Get a closer view of me." The woman in the boat is asking why she's being told this, and she's pointing at the man. We are then told, from a man on the boat, that the woman on the island is pregnant. Then, we see an image of a whale. A woman comes up to the man on a sailboat, and the man is telling her that he can save her. He takes her onto the sailboat.  The rest of the film is filled with scenes of these people on the sailboats, sailing off into the distance, while the mother and baby girl remain on the shore. They have a son.  It's as if a film is trying to tell the story, but is not able to, because the people involved are trying to avoid the camera, as if they are afraid it will see them.  And the best part about this film is that they don't realize it. They don't seem to care what they are doing, and they are unaware that the film has captured them. It is a complete accident that they were caught on camera. They should not have been filmed, but they were.  At one point in the film, we are told that the animals that are on the film are living and thriving. The animals on the movie are not dead. They are just being filmed. There is one animal that doesn't want to be filmed, because they think the people will find out they are on film, and that they will be punished, and will be killed.  This is very disturbing, but the film never tells us that.  I was disgusted at the thought that we would all be like these people in this film. I am surprised that such a film was made. I feel bad for the

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not a big horror fan but this one scared me. The music is bad. I think it was supposed to be for the actors but it really made the film very disturbing. The acting was not good either.    All I can say is the actors are not trained at acting. They are just too old and old looking. This is not a very good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a horrible movie. The story is really horrible and it will give you a headache from the beginning to the end. This movie is completely boring and has no redeeming quality. I'm sorry, but if you want to see something funny, try an old Disney movie. This is not funny at all.  I'm giving it 3 stars because it has good production values and it does have a really good plot. But this is one of the worst Disney movies ever and it's not worth seeing for anything other than it's production value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When it comes to bad movies, the only movie that really came close to this list was "Crazy Stupid Love". This was a really cheap movie, so they probably had to go for the cheapest parts they could find. In it, they basically made up for the fact that it was so cheap with a lot of terrible acting and an awful story. I mean, what kind of film is going to be based on a book that only has a few pages? They went with a really bad actress for the part of the character that they had to write, which is pretty bad. They also had no idea of the plot. It was all based on the author's imagination, and no one even cared. It's a shame that they didn't get a higher rating for this movie because if it wasn't for the terrible acting, this would have been one of the best movies ever.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is really good, with a good amount of humor, and the movie itself is a fun ride with a great soundtrack. However, the script is too long and doesn't make sense. I just can't see this movie not working in the long run, but I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for a fast paced action movie with a little character development.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the year 2065, the Earth is suffering from a mysterious disease that kills its victims in minutes. The only cure is a drug called "Vitamins" which is the source of all evil in this film.   The first half of this film is filled with ridiculous characters, some of which are very bad, and some of them make no sense. However, I did find myself liking the main character in this movie.  A guy with a shaved head and a mask on his face goes to find the Vitamins, which he assumes are spread by the government.  As he does, he has to fight through hordes of zombies and his own human enemies. I don't think I could handle the insanity of this movie at that time.  This movie is also not the greatest. The acting is bad, the special effects are bad and the soundtrack is bad.  I give this one a 0/10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is really bad.   You can say the same about every horror movie.  It has the same problems and the same bad special effects.  When i saw the trailers it looks really bad and then it starts to show and the special effects are really bad but the movie starts to be interesting.  If i want a good horror movie  i would choose a movie called "The Devil Inside"  But the one from this movie is not good and it will make you go sick after watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the last film i saw by the legendary John Milius. i saw it on a friend's suggestion, so i was excited. The movie was okay, nothing special. The actors were good enough, but the film was not great. It is really not a bad film at all, i enjoyed it, and the actors are good enough. However, if you are looking for a good action flick, you can go get "Rambo: First Blood Part II". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am going to say I don't remember seeing this movie. This movie was made during the 70s and they had the actors from the time, you can see it clearly in the film. I think they shot it in the late 70's or early 80's and it looks bad. I don t remember who was in this movie but I remember it was made in Hollywood in the 80's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this movie sucked   The story is poorly written, and the acting is bad, to say the least.   These actors don't seem to have learned anything from their last movie, "Saw", but this is definitely worse.  If this was a bad car movie, they would have cast Gary Oldman and Paul Hogan as the villains, and made it a western. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie last night and had no idea that this movie is a terrible one. The characters are all terrible and the screenplay is horrible. It was just a joke movie and this is the reason why I couldn't finish it. The story is based on a true story about a poor man that became homeless and ended up stealing and doing drugs. He was arrested for a crime that he didn't do and then he was forced to do some sex acts and he ended up having an abortion because he thought that it would get him out of the situation. The film tries to take a serious story and make it into a funny joke. The acting is really bad and the writing was really bad. It really doesn't belong in the horror genre and is a huge disappointment to see a movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a really stupid movie. There is not one scene in this movie where a single moment of intelligence occurs. There are many scenes where the characters just get into random physical or verbal fights. It doesn't even matter what is said in the film, because the film just moves on with no time for a punchline or anything to develop the characters. It really is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The last half hour of this movie is awful. It's so bad it's hard to believe that the script has a real story. They shot the movie with a lot of CGI in order to get an action scene. The CGI looks awful. You think you are watching a "real" action movie but it's just a bunch of CGI characters running across the screen. I don't understand why the film was made. It takes up a lot more than a third of the runtime. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen the original "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" on VHS. I loved it and still love it. It has great acting, great music, and a great story. This film is bad. It is a rip-off of "E.T." It doesn't take itself seriously. I found a lot of the jokes, gags, and jokes were recycled and uninteresting. It really ruined the movie for me. The acting is terrible. They seem to be improvising most of the time. A lot of times the actors are very good, and they are just not as funny as they are in the other film. There are a few scenes with some of the cast that I love, but they were a few seconds long and the whole scene just didn't work. The scenes with the monsters are horrible. The special effects are awful. The only things that work are the monsters and the monster with the chainsaw. The director tried to make the movie like the other films, but it didn't really work.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie will be in the top 100 worst movies of all time and you can't make a good movie out of this.  This film takes a classic movie and is horrible at all the levels.   They didn't use the original movie as the basis for this movie and instead used a new made movie called "Bobby," which is about a very thin actor who had problems with his weight.  They did this for the extra $7 million it would have cost to make the movie.  These guys do not even have the cast of the original movies for this film.  The actors who do play the roles in the film are terrible at their own roles.  There is no sense of timing, acting, or chemistry between the cast members.  As a matter of fact, the only actor who really works is the fat one who plays the role.  In the new version, there are 3 fat actors who act for a couple of minutes and then are gone.  I never realized how bad these movies were until I saw this version and it is even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this as a gift and was very excited for it. This was a bad bad movie. I know nothing about guns, but I knew that was a real bad movie if it was called. The actors were not great, and none of the guns looked realistic. The story was not even good, it was just about a young man getting his gun stolen. I think it was some type of a revenge movie that got mixed up with some kind of gang movie. Very lame, very poorly made and very cheap.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only reason I gave this movie 5 stars is because the director had a cameo in this.   I think he was the only one in the movie and I wish I had seen him, because the only reason it didn't suck is that the girl and the guy are perfect for each other, no other actress in the film played a girl or guy this good.  I would give this a 4 if it was made by someone other than David O. Russell. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - December 4, 2011 I was excited by this movie, but I was disappointed. It just wasn't that interesting to me, it was just kind of boring. The cast, especially the leading woman, are extremely annoying and I really just didn't like them. I also felt that the acting wasn't very good either. I really wish they would've just made this movie about a man and a woman who get married, instead of some gay guy and his girlfriend. - November 23, 2011 Terrible movie, horrible acting, poor plot, and a boring cast of actors. - July 16, 2011 A great movie, I would never watch this movie over a good old fashioned movie - July 7, 2011 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's the most boring movie I have ever seen. The only thing is, it wasn't that good. There's really no story, and it's just a bunch of boring shots and lame lines and sound effects.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a very strange movie. It begins with a very unusual premise - a girl (Jasmine Thomas) gets kidnapped by a group of young boys. They don't tell her why she is in their place of detention, they just say that one day she will be released. A couple of days later, her family discovers her on a riverbank and are in shock. When the police arrive, they arrest the boys and bring them to school where they are subjected to very strange questioning by a very stern principal (Clare O'Toole) and the rest of the staff.   One can say that it's an unusual way of telling a story, but it's also a very good one and I don't think it can be described as boring. The story is quite well done. The actors, especially O'Neill, are perfectly believable and their character's emotions, when they are shocked, are very believable. A great performance from Thomas and a very entertaining one from O'Hea.  The ending is also very interesting and I wouldn't have seen it otherwise. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is bad! I was excited to watch it. I was going to be doing a documentary and wanted to film this one. I wanted to see some bad movies but with a little research I found this. I am disappointed in it and do not recommend it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is trash!   It is not funny at all, I laughed out loud when the clown is shot. It is too bad because it is so very fun.   I like a clown but there is no way they should be shooting him all the time.  If they made a movie with this character and it was funny it would be top ten!  The clown is so lame and the movie is so cheesy. The only reason why it is good is because of the crazy acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you like your action movies bloody and violent with plenty of blood and gore and lots of explosions. You will like this movie.   This movie is pretty much a copy of "Sudden Death" by the same writer/director. He has a very similar style, and also a pretty similar feel.  As far as I know, this is the only film about a killer that ever starred in a real-life incident. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most depressing thing in my life was watching this movie   I loved this movie as a kid. The soundtrack is soo good and the acting was top-notch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen this film a few months back, and I loved it. I watched it again recently, and though the movie is good, the story of the movie was terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a very bad movie that is supposed to make you feel good because it's about Jesus.  The movie is full of lies and a lot of lies.  For example, the movie has a guy named Richard who goes to the New Jerusalem and sees it. He is so happy that he falls in love with it.  But he stays there for years just to see the ruins of the city. This is another lie. The New Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 A.D. and the ruins are on the border of the old city.  You don't have to be a very educated person to see that it is not there.   The New Bible, as it is called, is actually a collection of "fake" stories of Jesus. The film was made by people who have a strange fondness for ancient religion and so they had to lie about everything.  And the movie is filled with lies about the New Testament, even the story about the woman taken in adultery.  So what is the good in this movie?   There is a scene where the woman, who is supposed be Mary Magdalene, is looking at the new Jerusalem in her mind and she sees it like it is the original.  What about the fact that the new city was a real place? Was it not destroyed?  So, yes, this movie is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love to watch bad movies.   The idea of watching "a movie" that you can watch at your own house is cool.  But   This  movie  is  full of  bad  ideas   that are not going to make you enjoy the movie.  If you look for a movie to watch on a rainy night, do yourself a favor and watch "Leprechaun 3: In Space".   They are doing the same thing, making a movie that you have to watch at home with a group of friends.  I had to watch this movie twice, because   It  was  such  bad ideas  that  you are  going to  get  tired of them.  When you get tired of ideas that are wrong,  you have come to the right place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved this movie and wanted more of it, however, it was just ok.   The story was not all that great, and it is really hard to get past the plot, which is not really a big deal.  The acting in this movie was very poor, and the story was a mess, I was never really sure where this movie, and who was the main character.  Also the ending was a little lame and cheap, and some of the characters did not get much development at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       Very poor quality, but an entertaining watch.   When this came out in 1968, it was hailed as one of the best comedies of the decade, even though it was written in the 50s and had not been shot on film, and was shot at very low frame rates to preserve the natural beauty of the Hollywood hills. It features a marvelous supporting cast, including Robert Ryan, Ernie Kovacs, Frank Morgan and Mary Steenburgen.  While the screenplay is a parody of the popular comedy films of the time, the writing is clever and the characters hilarious. However, the whole movie suffers from very poor direction, with poor camera angles that create an odd look on the characters, who are all given very long, stiff movements.  The acting is a little better than the script, but not good enough to compensate for the terrible plot and acting.  A must see if you have a copy of the classic silent film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very bad movie and a terrible waste of time. The acting is horrible and the film itself is just bad. I would never see this movie again and it would just be a waste of my time. - April 5, 2009Crappy bad movie

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think I have seen a worse movie to go to. I was very disappointed in the movie and it will be hard to see this movie again.  The characters were all wrong. No wonder the movie was so bad.  There were no believable characters in this movie.  This movie took up so much time it would have been better for a movie of this type. I will not watch it again.  Rated 4 out of 5 by dennisd8 from The good, bad and the ugly I think this is a great movie. I have always liked the "dub-movie" style. This is one of my favorite movies, though. It has a great cast of actors and the director does a good job. The actors in this film are pretty good as well. The bad things about this film, which was made at the end of the 70s, is that there are not enough women in it to fill every role. The other thing is that the actors are mostly on drugs. You'll notice this on the very first shot of the movie where the camera goes down a couple of women's shirts. It's really annoying to have the camera go down women's clothes. This was one of the more "dramatic" movies of the time. If you like a good drama with lots of action and sex, this movie will be a good choice for you. If not, you're better off looking for something different, like "Blow-Up."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most entertaining movie I've seen in years. It is completely ridiculous, which is great because it adds to the comedic relief. The actors do a great job of portraying all the different characters.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love a good horror movie. This was an excellent movie. I enjoyed it much more than the remake of the original. The cast is excellent, it's funny, and there are scenes that are really scary. The music is excellent. I think the special effects are great. I can't recommend this movie highly enough.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember watching this when it was on cable a long time ago. When it was in theaters and being promoted as a film with nudity, it was clearly not. It was a porno. This is why my wife hates to watch porno movies and is the reason I watch them. The sex scenes were way over the top and gratuitous and I can only think it was a publicity stunt. I feel sorry for this movie and the person making it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best part about this movie is that there are some amazing performances.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In every way, this is a bad picture.  There is absolutely no story, no dialogue, no characters, no acting, and most importantly, no enjoyment. It is boring.   The film is an overstuffed, overblown, and overproduced mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a terrible film. I had the idea to watch this film because I'm an avid fan of John Waters.  My first impressions were wrong. I think I'm going to try and find out who made this movie.  I don't think this film was made by anyone I know. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so excited to see this. I got my son a birthday gift and this was the only one he wanted. Unfortunately, it was really bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was terrible. The actor who played the bad guy (he was an amateur) was totally uncreative and his character was pathetic.   This movie is an old horror movie from the 70s and the bad guys were really lame.  The script was terrible and it took forever to get anywhere.  I saw this movie at the movies, and the girl who was in the shower at the end of the movie was so awful she looked like an ugly doll.  It took me five minutes to get through the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was thoroughly disappointed. The characters were so dull, so boring, and so stupid. What a joke. It is all very predictable. This movie would be much better if the characters had a bit of personality, or if the script was changed. I found it almost impossible to care about any of the characters. It was just tedious to watch. It seemed that they just thought of these actors, and then just made them into idiots, and not changed their ideas about the characters at all. I do not understand why they did not write their own script, or rewrite the dialogue to make it more realistic. The actors just had to act as they did. I guess they thought that people could not tell a true story from a ridiculous one, so they decided to try to be as realistic as possible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was terrible. I'm not saying its good, but its not worth watching, or even having on your DVD. If you have an hour to kill, you might as well watch an old movie.  My Rating:   Read More Reviews
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's all over the place with this one. The acting is very poor, and the cinematography is bad at best.  This movie seems to be made for the cheap thrill of the camera. A few of the sequences are just silly, like the whole part where the guy is watching the girls and his daughter is in the room. I didn't mind the acting too much. I don't think the acting is that bad. If anything, it's just that the director is so poor at directing that he just goes overboard with the camera angles.    I really want a sequel to this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen several people mention the same problem with the "jumping" gags of the film. These scenes are all the same: a woman in a short skirt runs down the street to hide from a guy who is chasing her. She keeps telling him to get off of her, but he keeps running after her. He keeps taunting her. Finally she runs up to a trash bin and hides there. In the bushes, she runs into a light, hits it and falls to the ground. She has no idea how she got there. The guy runs off and she goes home. When she comes home she finds the guy gone. She checks the door and finds the door kicked in. She rushes outside, finds a man standing in her living room and the camera zooms in on his face.   The "jumps" and the "bodies" are all too repetitive, and the editing seems to be doing it's best to get to nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst thing in this movie is it's voice actors. The acting is so bad you could swear that they had no clue what they were talking about. They say "the girl" at the end of the movie, "I know you know what it's like to be lonely" it sounds like she's saying she was in love with someone else when she was with this guy. It's just a terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It would be awesome if this movie had been a good one instead of the bad one it was.   I am not sure about the plot, but it seems like something like 'a guy's wife runs off with a married man' and the husband turns into the bad guy, and they have to stop him by shooting him, or by blowing up his car or something.  If the plot is actually bad, then there are a lot of plot twists, and I would have liked a better script and a better director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't get it either, and I've seen this movie a couple of times now.   It seems like something that would be better in the 50's, but it doesn't quite work.  Even though I understand what they're trying to do, it just doesn't feel right.  The dialogue is cliche and not funny.  I like the song (by Bruce Springsteen) at the end, but I also find it rather sad and cliche, not very funny, and very unmemorable.  If this movie was made before the days of the Internet, I would have loved it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie because it was showing at an airport. As soon as the movie started, I was very disappointed with the quality.   The film was just bad. It was extremely bad.  They didn't do anything in this movie to really make it worth seeing.  I think this movie just came out of the director's "brain".   If the director had done something a little bit better, this movie would have been worth a look.  What a shame that this movie was never released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like this movie, I know the story, the cast is good, and they are doing the right thing by having this movie made. I like the style, the characters, and the director. It's about a young man who is a part time truck driver, who works with the army, and goes on to be a soldier himself.    The only problem I have with this movie is that it's just way too long.    I know it takes a while for the movie to get going, but the amount of time spent on the "story" and the way it takes ages to get to where it needs to be is just a waste of time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think this movie was meant to be more entertaining than it was.   The acting was not as good as in the others but the dialogue was really lame.  The plot was very weak and I felt like the acting was very bad, the acting of the leading actress, Kim Jee Woon, was so awful, she just stood there staring, it was not a nice thing to watch.  I think the movie was also over-long and not interesting enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has some good stuff in it, but there are so many mistakes in it.   The acting sucks.  You'll think you see some great performances, but every time there's a new character, he has the same old routine.  It's a lot of fun to see the characters acting like idiots, but the actors don't do much with it. They just keep doing the same thing over and over again.  The cinematography is pretty terrible.  Sometimes it looks like they're just taking a bunch of stills from the movie and filming it with the camera looking down from above and over the characters.  This was made in the 80's so it's not bad to look at, but they're not adding any kind of depth to the film.  Overall, this isn't a bad film, but it's clearly a remake and not a new version.  If you liked the original version, then you'll probably like this movie as well, but if you weren't a fan of the original, then I wouldn't recommend this to you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know why people continue to try to defend the film with such ridiculous excuses like "it's better than the original." This is the worst film in the entire franchise and the worst acting in the history of acting. It has such terrible acting as well that you can't believe this is going on in a Hollywood production.   The bad writing and acting are so bad in this film that even the scenes that are good are poorly written and not at all believable.  The writing in this movie is the exact same thing as the first film in that the bad guy, General "Blackjack" Pershing, is always talking about the good soldiers and how the bad guys are just trying to overthrow him.  There are no soldiers of the Good Side.  This film is a joke and even the original film was a joke.  I really hope these people at Paramount see this film and either let it be released or make it an R rated.  It will go down as one of the worst in the film series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't think they did a good job in this movie but that is the worst part of it. The movie is bad enough to warrant giving it 2 stars but this is where the movie starts to get really awful.   The movie starts with this guy running to the bank to get the cash for his house because he is going to be arrested for his drugs and it's going to cost him a lot of money. He is carrying a big bag of money and it falls on the floor and he breaks his hand. He calls his brother for help and they run to get help. The scene starts with an old woman telling him how he ruined her life and how he has to pay her back what she took from him. It is not long before the guy tells the story of how he stole drugs and how his brother caught him and how the cops showed up. The next scene shows him and his brother getting out of the car and then a big old man shows up and the old woman gets mad at him and throws her bag at him. The brother gets out of his car and kicks the old man in the face and he runs away.  And on to the real problem.  It turns out that the old lady's son is an idiot who can't make a decision and does stupid things all the time. He has a knife in his hand that he always carries and he is really violent. He breaks the boy's nose and kicks him. He also has a gun and he pulls it out and shoots the brother in the head. He then shoots his brother in his back. The old woman shows up again and it turns out she has a daughter that also has an IQ of 65 and she is just as dumb as her brother.  In the end, they just hang them up and throw their brains in a sack with the gun.  After the movie, I never got why it was a crime to take money from a person and keep it. I just didn't understand why they would think it was right to shoot an unarmed man.  The old lady also talks to the cop and talks about how he killed her son. He tells her she killed her own son. Then she shows him the knife and he says he should just kill her. The cop tells her how he shot her son and he should kill her too. She calls him a liar and tells him if he doesn't get rid of the knife she will kill him.  I just don't understand how this
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *SOUNDS LIKE A BAD MOVIE*   I really didn't like this movie. The film does have its moments but it just wasn't that good and it had a lot of problems. The acting was awful and the plot is really stupid.   This film was supposed to be about "The Man Who Lost The Princess". Well the film doesn't even say who he is! It just tells you and you don't know. The director thought he had something when he came up with this idea but he just couldn't figure it out. It was pretty much just a one scene and a one girl short and that is the best thing that this film has going for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason this movie gets a 2 is because the original source is the only version available for streaming. No matter how hard I try to track down a DVD or blu-ray (I know there are some), they are always out of stock and unavailable at the moment. The only way to see this movie is to buy the DVD or purchase the original, but then you'd be paying a lot more.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's not as bad as I expected from the trailer but it's still not what I thought it would be.   There's only one big reason for the terrible acting: the lead actor, a little kid, doesn't have an actual name.  Even when he's in his underwear, he keeps saying his name, which sounds like a stupid name for an actor.  I'm not sure why the guy didn't play a baby when he was in his 20s.  You're looking at a child who was either not cast because his name is funny (that's what the lead looks like) or he's not good looking enough to play an adult (that is what the supporting actor looks like).  The bad acting is really noticeable when it comes to the leading lady, who's pretty much acting like the bad girl in the movie (she acts very childish and bad but she still looks like an adult).  She's the only one who looks like a real adult, while the others look like kids.  The director should have cast someone a little older and better looking to play the bad guy.  My recommendation is to watch the trailer and decide if you want to watch this bad movie or not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was bad. The characters were very stiff and acted like they were all in the wrong place at the wrong time. The dialogue wasn't great either. This movie is so much better than it was written in it's poor, bad quality. If you have never seen it, don't waste your time. I'd stay far away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so excited to see this movie when it came out. I was thinking it would be a lot more fun than it turned out to be, but I wasn't really surprised. I'm just disappointed that I didn't think more of it.   It's really bad. The first 30 minutes of it, when the action is set up, is pretty good. The movie takes itself very seriously, and even gets serious about what it's trying to accomplish. I felt for a good part of it that this is a serious film. This isn't just a kid's film. It's serious enough that the main character seems like he's really serious about it, and the acting is decent enough. The script gets really silly in the later parts, but at least the story keeps going. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie when I was about 10, but i still can't believe this crap came out in the year 2000. The cast are all kind of retarded, and the script was just horrible. The plot was just stupid and the acting wasn't that great.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had high expectations, I am a huge fan of horror films and I really enjoyed this. I like the style of the film, the suspense, and I thought it was creepy as heck. I didn't really understand the "ritual" part of the ritual, but it was very eerie. It wasn't disturbing, but I was intrigued by it.   This movie was terrible.  It is a pretty good movie, but why would they cast such a low quality person to play the part of this ritual? There were no special effects, no actors to make it believable. The special effects were bad.  And why is there a man (who played a ghost) in a coffin. I was expecting an old man, but they put a man in a wooden coffin (like a mannequin). I really hope they cast a real actor, that the film could have been a lot better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a movie with a bad plot, which leads to a poor film. The actors are all great and I am enjoying it. But this is a movie that could be better. I didn't like it very much at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really looking forward to this one. The trailer made me hopeful. It didn't make me like it.  The story is really boring. You have a bunch of old people running around and fighting each other.   No sense of danger.  It felt like it was going to be a bad remake of the old 80's slasher film.  I will probably not see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I've only seen this movie twice, and I think it was just supposed to be a low budget horror movie about a serial killer who has his victims decapitated and dismembered, but the third time around, the movie devolves into an out-of-control parody of the 1980s slasher flicks. It's also one of those movies that are so cheap and crappy that it will always be hard to get it out of my head.   I think it's supposed to remind you of Scream, but instead it's like a Saw remake.  It has the same cheesy and cheap acting, the same weird production values, and it's also a remake of the 1989 slasher movie with the same name. It has a completely lame love story that never gets resolved, the most unbelievable set of characters, and the most laughable "pornography" jokes ever.  The most disappointing thing about this movie was the fact that the director decided to play around with the premise. There's nothing wrong with making a film with a "crazy serial killer" theme, but this movie just feels like an attempt to cash in on the successful Saw franchise.  I've already seen it twice now and I'm already sick of this crap. I just don't get the appeal of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this was the most boring movie ever and the writer and director should really watch more comedy movies, then maybe make a movie like "The Proposal".    It was so much more enjoyable to see a different movie that didn't have the typical Hollywood production values that they use over and over and have no problem changing a good movie to make it better.   The most boring part was the beginning and the ending, I didn't really care at all, but the movie really kept me on the edge of my seat. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a story about a young couple who have to get the kids out of their old house and go into their new one in order to start over.   After that, they had to figure out a way to support themselves, which involved moving into a place of their own.  What's really funny is that the parents are having all sorts of problems, but they never mention any of it, not once, not even when they're having a really bad time of it.  When it comes to kids in movies, the worst ones usually involve a child getting lost in the woods, and the other kid coming to the rescue.  Not so here.  I couldn't stop laughing throughout the entire movie.  The film is based on the book by William Golding, and is about a married couple whose new house has all sorts problems. I know that sounds like the typical plot, but it's not.  This story is so well written and acted, that it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's an absolute mess of a movie that tries to be a "serious" film, but instead goes from ridiculous to ridiculous to absurd.  It's hard to find anything that can be really funny about it, so it's just all of these bizarre things happening.  For a "comedy", it just becomes really tiresome.  I'm glad it's finally being done in a different way because it's really bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of the worst movies ever made, if you are not a total retard you should watch this movie. I mean really this is an obvious attempt to get some quick money for no reason. They were clearly just making this for a laugh and I do NOT know how someone who is this retarded could even do this.   Also if you have a problem with any "black people" and are a fan of the "n-word" movie like this is you are stupid and you should be ashamed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you enjoy bad movies then this is a must watch.   For the sake of a good laugh this is not the worst movie ever, but it sure isn't the funniest.  It is a story about a man who becomes insane as a result of a night of drinking, and a woman who gets kidnapped by some sort of alien.  She wakes up after a brief moment of terror with the alien on top of her.  She then has to escape through a huge door that leads into the alien world.  When they escape the door they find themselves in a huge underground city filled with insane people, a flying saucer, robots, and other crazy things.  If the movie were to be edited into a 2.5 hour movie it would still be about 2 hours long.  And while the movie is very well made, it is not that interesting to watch, so it is more of a fun extra.  What this movie is great at is how it depicts an insane mind.  The aliens really come to life when the alien queen is killed, and everyone becomes crazier.  But this is the point of the movie: insanity.  There is an incredible amount of weirdness going on in the movie, and while there is some bad acting from some of the characters, the movie does a great job portraying an insane man that is running around and having a good time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of those "oh-s**t" films that is so terrible it's not even funny. The main character is a big man. He has huge muscles, huge cock and a huge belly. The "pussy" of the main girl is portrayed as tiny and she's constantly teased by the giant cock of the man. The film is so bad it's a nightmare. The actors have no talent, the sound is bad, and there is no plot.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie should have never been made. They never bothered to cast the actors, it is all actors playing actors. It is also very poorly written. The acting is terrible, and they could not even learn the lines. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film has a lot of good ideas and is a great way to entertain your friends. The movie is not very good, its only about the main character.   This is one of those movies that you could watch once or twice and never watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film has a lot of issues. 1. This is not the true story of the abduction, but rather, a true story, but altered by the author, and presented in an amateurish fashion. 2. There is no actual kidnapping, but is just a child of an abductee who happens to be found on the street after a long time being alone and having been left with a stranger. The author says he took the child home for the sole purpose of being sexually assaulted. The child's story was so disturbing, that the director wanted to remove it from the movie, and this is exactly what happened. 3. The movie is edited so badly that it has become a mess. A lot of scenes are missing, or altered so much that there is no way to know what is in the movie. 4. The film was so bad, that when the producers decided to release it, they did not tell the public, but instead, a few select people, to see it. When this film is seen by an adult, and then shown again to a child, it becomes extremely disturbing. 5. The production company has had no qualms about editing the film to make it more shocking. 6. There are scenes that are so disgusting, that one wonders why they didn't just delete them.    Play it in the dark? The child is very little in this movie. I had to put the light on very low so it would not be too much of a problem for me. This movie is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was a joke.   The actors who are supposed to be the best on the planet are a joke, and most of them act in horrible ways.  They are not even all in it. Some of the other actors are in it, but not in the scene where they are supposed be the most ridiculous.  I don't understand how they thought this was going to be a funny movie.  It is not funny and everyone involved is so far out of it that it was laughable.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story was very basic, boring and predictable.   I would never watch this again, and don't plan to.  I wouldn't even suggest watching this film in the theaters, since the sound quality is not great.  A couple of scenes are hard to hear at all.  The ending is not very funny and the movie is over within 20 minutes of being over.  My rating for this film is a 6 out of 10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I watched it, I was hoping to find some sort of humor in a pretty dark film. When I found humor, I found it really weird. The film doesn't seem to have a real purpose, and most of the time, it just ends up feeling like a cheap commercial.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think it's a pretty good movie but it's just so bad that it should have stayed in the early 90's. It was a big box office flop and I don't remember seeing it. It seems to be a remake of a movie from the 50's or 60's with the same name. I remember it was really bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie that I can't believe they made in the 70s. It's all very cheesy and over-the-top.   So much so that one of the most annoying lines ever to have been said by an actor is:  The reason my car smells so bad is that the garbage men have put something in the gas.  It makes my car smell like shit, and it's been like that for years.    This film is about a bunch of kids who go to a gas station to get some beer.  They see a guy who looks a lot like their dad, and they say,  "Hey, look what dad is wearing!  I wonder if we can get him some beer?" And the guy says, "Sure, why not?"  After a few minutes, they all walk out the station and their dad is still nowhere to be found. So the kids are all looking for him.  He doesn't show up and they wonder where he went.  Then one of them realizes that the guy is his dad, so he goes off and asks him about his car. The guy says that he had bought it from the gas station and he had it towed to his uncle's house. Then one kid asks if there's any gas there and his dad says "Yeah, here's about ten bucks." And one of his kids says,  Well, this can't be right! How could this guy's car be in the trunk of an uncle's car and he can't find it!  Then the kids hear a car pull up behind them and they look in the car and find the car of their father.  So the dad gets in his car and the kids all start going off to a party at their uncle's.  The next morning, a couple of kids find the old guy's old car and take the keys and go find him. But it turns out that the old man is dead and he has no clue where he is.  This movie is such a joke that I wish they would have made this movie after 1970. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's one of those films you watch for the plot and what it's trying to say but once it gets to the first act it's a lot of mindless violence.  The acting is atrocious as well. The scene where a guy gets a hammer and beats the shit out of a guy with a bat. He gets away with it only because he's a cop.  There's also a scene in the desert when a guy is chased by a guy in a cowboy hat and the guy on the horse comes running down the side of the cliff and it's not even clear if he's hit him or not.   This was in the 70s.  They had to go to a special effects company for the stunt that the guy did where he jumps off the cliff.  A guy tries to punch a guy through a wall, he gets beat up but he's not really punched. He's just pushed through it.  A cowboy is knocked out of the saddle and gets knocked to the ground. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think this movie is terrible. The story is really bad. It's just a group of people going down to the ocean and killing the sharks there to make money. No real reason why, and when they do get out, they kill the shark(s) back again. Then they are told they can go back. The rest is just random shark attacks. There's no real action in this movie. It just seems to go on forever.   1 of 6 people found this review helpful
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was not a bad film to watch. It was very funny and had a decent acting and story. However, it is not worth watching. I don't think the movie would make much of a profit.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the film and enjoyed it, but it was just too far into the ridiculous to be taken seriously. A typical "he said she said" thing that was just funny.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My expectations of the film were so high. I was not expecting much. I had heard many good things about the film. I loved it. But I could not have been more disappointed.   The plot is so bad it is so laughable.  The characters are so stereotypical. I know a lot of people have hated the movie, but for me it was great. The script is really bad and I don't know why people still like it.  What would have been a good movie, turns out to be a horrible one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For some reason, when I watch "The Sixth Sense" I don't seem to remember anything from the last twenty minutes, including the opening and ending theme songs.   What the hell.  It was a movie I saw once in a theater, but it didn't bother me.  The ending was very confusing to me, I was really confused by it and could not remember much of what happened in the movie.  As for the movie itself, I think it was good, but I wish it had been better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is one of those movies that you will never want to see and it just made me angry. I just didn't think it would ever be made.   The entire script has such terrible dialogue and the directing and acting is just awful.  I am disappointed and I have not seen a bad film like this since that movie called THE WIZARD OF OZ.  The movie begins with a young woman, Anna (Julia Roberts) being pulled into a dark alley by a man and a young boy. As they enter the alley, she runs into a car and the man and child jump in the car with her and drive off. The young boy, (Robert Downey Jr.), says "Hey babe, why are you going to the other side of town?" as he gets out of the car and runs off with Anna. The woman doesn't know where the boy is going and they are heading into the woods and the woman follows. The man is laughing as he takes a large knife to Anna's face. The girl is also in pain and screaming for help. As she keeps screaming, the man pulls a knife on her again and she falls to the ground and starts bleeding profusely. As the woman begins to try to help Anna, the car suddenly pulls in front of them and two policemen arrive with rifles and open fire on the car. As a police officer puts a bullet in the back of the boy's head, he sees the girl in the passenger seat crying out in pain as she is shot in the head. The two policemen continue to fire at the car as the boy and the driver, the boy who is naked, then run away. The movie was so bad and so stupid it made me sick. I was sick, disgusted, and angry at the film for making me feel like I was watching an old movie from the 1950s. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film suffers from poor special effects.   I am not sure why this film was made, as there are more important things going on in the film that are more fun to watch.  What could have been a great story was ruined by some of the worst special effects ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only thing that I remember from this movie are that all of the actresses were horrible, they looked like they were made of styrofoam. The only good thing I remember of this movie is the ending. I hope that they make a movie about the life of the woman who was shot in the back in this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was well shot and the acting was all right. The plot was interesting and was done well. However, the movie is full of errors and has no suspense at all. The special effects are bad and the effects in the rest of the film are good. The movie takes too long to start and the ending is rushed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film has some nice moments, but it is a complete failure in all aspects.   This is a cheap attempt to cash in on the "War of the Worlds" phenomenon.  The only "scary" thing about the film is that you could actually walk down the street and scare someone in it, if you put the right camera up.  There is also a bit of a "Babylon 5" vibe, with lots of weird costumes and weird alien things.  These characters are really just one-note characters, who act as one-off gag characters.  A lot of the plot is also lost on you because there is no logic to it, nor anything of consequence happening in the film.  The ending is also completely unneeded, and I could almost see a man standing in a tunnel, holding a bomb.  If this film had been filmed by David Cronenberg, it would have been great.  As it is, it's just an attempt to be the next "The Day the Earth Stood Still", but it's not a very good one.  F.W. Murnau, "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My husband and I went to see this movie. He was excited about the movie. I thought it would be good, but it is too long. It is too boring. My husband kept saying "where is the action?". My son kept saying the plot was silly.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film takes place in a small town in North Carolina. The only other thing I've seen about this town was in the movie.  This is a short film. Not a long one either. But I could only sit through it because the only thing it really had going for it was the actors in it.  I'm not going to go into all the boring details of the film. The short is boring. It has nothing going for this film. Everything is done in a dull, unoriginal manner. There's no drama, no action, no suspense. The acting is atrocious.  It's all very dull.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a big fan of horror. Most of the horror movies I've seen are just pretty bad. But the worst of them were in a cheesy style. I love the movie, but I just couldn't get into it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never understood the popularity of the "bad movie" genre. I mean, really, if you can't tell a bad film from a good one, there's something wrong with you.   The worst thing about the "Bad Movie" movies is the actors. I can't say anything bad about them. They're actually good actors (except for the bad actor and the bad director), but they're not actors. They act like they are.  I hate the bad movie genre, so I'm glad there aren't too many of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's one of the worst movies i've ever seen. It's so bad i don't know what to say about it.   The story line is so bad that you wouldn't even want to watch the movie. The acting is awful. The sound is so terrible it's almost unbelievable that someone thought this was a good idea.  The acting makes me want to scream.  This movie is the worst movie i've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went with my brother for this movie and it sucked. He was the only one who was bored during the entire movie. He looked like he'd rather be in a cave. I was just trying to watch the movie and he couldn't even look at it, so why would he like it?   Helpful good for kids, but not for adults, i would avoid it  Loved the trailer for this flick and had been wanting to see it. I had to buy it and the fact that it was a horror movie made me a little hesitant, but the film itself was really good. I loved how the kids were played off against each other. The music was really creepy and scary. The acting was decent, and was just what i needed to get into this flick.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has so many issues, including:  - A very low budget movie that has the director saying his script was only written about a month ago.  I guess his script already has some of the dialogue he planned to use, which was probably cut by the studio due to budget reasons.   - I love the scenes with the people from the movie who are trying to talk to the dead people who are saying the same thing, and they get caught by the police and thrown in jail.  - All the cops in the movie are really annoying, with their stupid jokes and attitude, like the police captain in the jail when they find a missing person.  Also, I really wish the police would go to the movie and try to solve the case, as well as get some witnesses.  - The police captain's character is really ridiculous.  He looks like the same character from a tv show, and his character has not been changed at all.  It is obvious he was designed with some character from some tv show.    - The police captain doesn't seem like he is trying to find out what happened.  I have seen the movie, and the police has gone to a lot of trouble to find and interview everyone who was at the movie theater when the killer was going on and on about his plans to kill all the people in the theater.  They also have a guy who is a psychic (who is really annoying) who shows them some things he has seen from the past, but never once mentions the movie.  Some people are afraid to go into the theater now because they don't know if they will see the killer at the same time.  The cops also don't look like they are trying any harder, as the movie makes no effort to show how much they tried to investigate the case. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A really dumb movie from the 70s.   They're acting like kids at a carnival.  You can tell it was made for the cheapest of pocket change, and I think they did it to show how dumb they were.  They didn't need to do it.  It's not even that great.  This guy is wearing a red suit and a funny hat.  The guy is in a red car and the other car is blue.  No one knows where they are, and they seem to be on a long journey.  Nothing happens.  At the end, one guy gets out of the blue car and runs away.  Then they cut to another scene.  When you see the red car, you know where it is, but you don't know if the guy is really in the red.  All they need is to be in a big old movie and they can't figure out where they're at.  I don't think that this was a big directorial flop.  But you'd have to go back to something like  A Goofy Movie  or  Big Fish  to see that kind of stupidity.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would love to have seen this movie in the late '80's, but I guess it wasn't made then. It has some great actors, but this movie just doesn't have anything to offer.   The only reason I remember this movie so much is because it has a lot of crazy effects like the movie was shot on a VHS tape and they had to use a lot to make this movie look real.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought the DVD at the local independent shop for $1. It is so bad, that when I finally watched it on cable TV I realized that it was not a terrible movie at all.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "poster" of this movie is made by the same person who did the poster for this film. The same person. The only difference is the poster is now on a plastic cover, instead of a vinyl cover, and the film itself is no where near as good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a disaster.   A poor film that has no plot and only one line of dialog.  The acting is terrible and the actors never make any facial expressions or expressions other than "I'm not in the mood for this film".  This is the worst movie I have seen and I have watched many bad films.  I was expecting to see some interesting actors like Sean Connery or Harrison Ford to make the film interesting, but no one did this film justice.  This film is one of the worst films I have ever seen and is so far removed from reality and I am glad to be done with this movie.  I give this movie a 2 out of 10
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is all CGI. The CGI is horrible, and the effects look like they were done on an old super 8 camera. All the monsters look like one big head and the actors look like actors with the wrong heads. The monster looks like it's been put through a blender, and no one has the right size of head for it. The voice of the monster is awful and sounds as if it was recorded with a phone and put through an auto tape deck.   It doesn't have the humor or the action. It looks like a Disney movie that had no talent in the actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You know what I'm talking about, right? You know it when you hear it and it's annoying, but in a good way? It's what everyone was looking for in a modern day epic. Just when we think we're getting somewhere, the directors try to pull the wool over our eyes. The production quality is solid. The cinematography is gorgeous. The performances are fantastic. The action sequences are exciting, and the romance is heartfelt. The movie is good.   The ending is somewhat disappointing though. The villain didn't die, and they decided to have a big fight in the ending which takes the movie out of the realm of epic.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are so many bad movies on this list. I'm sick and tired of seeing them on this site. It really is so annoying. There are just too many terrible movies on here. It's so bad that they get sequels and remakes so they can keep making them.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never understood the people who hated this movie and I always thought it was just a bad copy of The Mummy. The only difference I saw was that this one had a great ending. I never did like the mummy, and this movie only serves to prove that. It is hard to explain how this movie made me hate it. But I never liked it and I thought this film was a total flop. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *sigh* *slight sigh* It was a really good movie, but I don't remember any of the jokes except a few that I remember because I was around it when it came out (though the rest of the time I just heard about it from the radio). I think the humor came from the fact that it was a comedy with a message.   A movie like this, with a good script, a well written script and a good director, would have been so much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a shame of a movie. A bad movie that is not even bad for a bad picture.   The acting is bad, the writing is bad. This movie is so boring and one sided. This was a movie where someone has to put out the trash. It is really bad and nothing happened in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many movies out there like this that are garbage. This movie was garbage! I just want to throw this movie in the garbage can, I won't bother to watch any other one after this. I will just stick to the other crap in the trash can!   I had seen this movie at the local movie theatre with my wife and all we could say was "How come they made this crap?". The director should be in jail for making this garbage movie. It has horrible acting and bad writing, it's all bad. The director is supposed to be a big director, but they let him run his mouth with this movie.    My favorite movie of the year! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a movie for me. I had heard great things about it, but was very disappointed. It was slow, overblown, and did not have enough action.   It would be better if the guy were an android, with no emotion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen this movie many times, never got it, but always remembered the first time.  I thought it was just about a drunk driver who gets in a car with a young woman.   He just wants to get drunk and crash his car.  It's not a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a big fat F*CK up!  The story is a load of sh*t! They show a woman who is in love with a man she just met. She falls in love, but not the man she loves. The man turns out to be a man pretending to be female, he then goes into the woman's house, has sex with her and then leaves. The woman tries to get pregnant to get the man, but he doesn't want to be in a relationship with her. The two of them decide to stay together for the baby, but they eventually end up divorcing each other because the man is a fake man. The real man shows up at the woman and makes her fake a pregnancy so he can stay with her... and then he tries to kill her and get all the child's money! The ending makes it seem like this is the woman getting pregnant, but this man just did the real thing to her.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this a long time ago and when I heard about it coming out I went in with my eyes open. The movie is really good, but there are a lot of scenes where the plot just gets lost in the process of not making any sense. I know it was made in the 70's and it's supposed to be a sci-fi story, but in my opinion it should have been made in a time when science was considered a serious topic. The plot and the way it is explained is all very complicated with too many characters to follow. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have had this movie many times, and have never liked it. The acting is poor, the story is poor and the music is horrible. The only reason I bought this was because of the soundtrack, and was not expecting it to be as awful as it was.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this on Netflix and when I saw the movie trailer I was not impressed at all. The actors looked stiff and it was a horrible acting job. My favorite characters were the evil scientist and the little girl with the "sucky" look. If you like cheesy, bad movies, then this is the one for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is awful.    It's a terrible, terrible movie, which is why it's such a disappointment.  It has all the things that I hate about a movie, and I was hoping it would be even worse.  The acting was bad (I was never impressed by anyone in that movie), and the writing was even worse!      There was a scene where a friend of a friend was telling a joke about the two people who had just been in a car crash.  When the friend mentioned the second victim, it was implied he was killed in the crash, but the movie played the joke wrong, so the victim was killed just before he got to the joke.      After he heard about the victim, the comedian went back to make his joke and when he was done, he looked up at the guy who was his victim and said, "How do I know that you were killed in that crash?   At the end of the movie, after everyone is laughing at the wrong victim, one of the comedians turns to the other one and says, "I guess that the other guy you were laughing at in the movie wasn't really dead."   "I was dead!" the other man yells out.  "Oh! I'm sorry," the comedian says.  Then they both look up at each other and hug each other.  In the end, the two comedians are laughing about how the dead guy they were laughing about in the car crash got away.  I don't know if that's a good joke.     I think the problem with this movie is that the directors just didn't think about what they were doing. They went to see an old movie with bad acting, bad writing and bad direction.  They thought they could just make a decent movie out of the whole thing.  Even the actors. The one who played the victim is so lame that it's like someone put a kid in a grown man's body.  This is why this movie didn't make it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While I don't think I can really rate this movie, at least I think you can be honest about it.   It's not that great but it's ok.  It doesn't do anything amazing to me.  I wasn't really looking for a good comedy but I didn't really want to watch a bad one.  There are some funny moments in this one. I do think it's a remake of a better movie that was made before.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was so bad that I really don't know how to rate it. It has a pretty decent budget. I would be surprised if it was at least a little good. I was very surprised when I watched this, and there is no way I would see a movie like this again. There are too many poorly written scenes that really didn't make sense. There's no way that the movie is any good.    Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never been into the horror genre, so this movie was a little disappointing. Not a terrible movie (though I didn't enjoy it very much) but it felt like a long filler to set up the next one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A film full of bad acting, bad acting with actors who should have learned a more believable accent. If you want a great romantic film then this one is for you.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think the title of this movie was just lame, it really is just a rip off of the 1980's classic "Dumb & Dumber". It's even worse than that movie, with a more dated plot line and actors who look like they're in high school. I guess if you like cheesy comedies or just old time movies, this one should be on your radar.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a terrible movie that had little to do with the actual story. It took place in an African village and focused on the main character, a man who had been banished from the village for raping his sister. This was not an original plotline and was clearly a cheap attempt to make some quick money by using the "mugging negro" story as the backdrop. The characters were weak and boring and the acting was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is a lot like it's predecessor. It doesn't try to innovate or make the story any different. This is just the continuation of the last film. And I really enjoyed the last one. The acting is bad, but so are the stories that are told.   My favorite character was the one who did the murders. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Wet and Wild"   This is one of the worst movies ever made. It's a complete waste of money. The only thing it's good for is getting young women's panties wet (even though that's not what it's really all about, I digress). In it's defense, it was filmed in the 60's which made it pretty wild (the camera zooms in on one of its stars giving an amazing close-up) and the music is catchy, but really it's not worth a single second of your time. I watched this one twice and didn't give it a second thought. If you're ever in a bar and want to get girls drunk, show up, let the alcohol take you over, and then have them give you blowjobs on camera then this is the movie for you. I've never been so thoroughly disappointed in a movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending was ridiculous. The plot was retarded and the script was completely bad.   I was hoping that the end was going to be better because I know that was the original script. I just could not stand the ending of this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you like movies that tell you there's a world out there where your favorite animals live in harmony and enjoy an abundance of delicious life, this movie is for you.   It has all of the elements of a good movie, but is lacking in plot, characters, and an actual emotional connection.  It makes me question my life choices.  My only regret is that I didn't know about this movie when I was young. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film had some good special effects but overall it wasn't a good movie. The plot was not good either. It seemed to be a cop movie but I couldn't really get into the acting. It was too low budget to be good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible. The acting is laughable, the story is completely unrealistic, and the characters are all bland and uninteresting. I don't know what the filmmakers were trying to do. I know the director was trying to make the film look like something out of a slasher movie. The film was full of obvious jokes that just don't work. If the makers of this film were really serious about the genre, they should have used an actual slasher film, or maybe a real killer.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is not all that good, but what it is is a fun story of a couple of young guys trying to impress their hot girlfriends by throwing a rock up into the sky. It's funny as hell and the guy is very convincing as a rock hater. I enjoyed the film a lot, but for the most part it was very over the top and had no real plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is just a movie to see for those who have a soft spot for comedy.  I can't tell you how many movies have me laughing and thinking to myself, "this was a good movie.  But it would be a terrible movie. It is a really bad movie. I can see how the writers were trying to make a good gag, but all the jokes and acting is so bad that you would find yourself forgetting about the joke after 30 minutes.   What the studio is going to do when this movie opens?  It is very disappointing.  It was pretty funny, but then it goes on and on. I expected better from this studio. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I like the film, but the writing was so bad it made me laugh.   My girlfriend laughed at the scenes where they were eating.  How could someone talk about her vagina and then do something like that.  The actors were also so bad.  They were all so terrible.  I think they should try acting in the movies they are in first.  If someone has a good talent, it doesn't mean he can't make a bad film.  This film was so awful, you could have watched it with your parents and they would have laughed at everything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought that this would be the classic western of the era. I really wanted to like this movie but it was so bad. In the movie there are four women who are trapped in a house. They go around to various places and they are not allowed to use their phones. This is all in a very cool, low key, and fun way. This movie is set in the early 1900s and is about a group of women who take a trip to the west to do "some good". I loved the concept of the movie but this movie is so bad that it almost ruined it for me.     Review by: J. A. Cates - Feb. 23, 2014: I loved this movie. The women in this movie were the only characters that were really memorable. It is set at the turn of the century in Arizona and it was funny the way that they were trapped in this house. I thought it was a nice way to make fun of the western genre of the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are a movie snob and you haven't seen this movie you will be disappointed. The only thing I can find wrong about this movie is that it looks too much like an old film that people made when they were really young. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a shame that when "Faces" was in the making, George Lucas chose to spend the money on the "Star Wars" franchise rather than spend the time to do the kind of work that a good independent film should. It's very obvious that "Fates" was made with a budget bigger than the one for "Star Trek" or "Back to the Future" or any other Spielberg production.   When the film finally came out in 2001, it bombed so bad that when they put it in the "best of" list, the word "disappointing" was the only adjective they could come up with.  The story of a young couple (Kathryn Bigelow and John Hurt) who have the wedding of their dreams at a desert cabin in Utah and then are killed by a crazed fanatic, the film has plenty of bizarre moments but it never gets good. The acting is sub-par (even for a Hollywood film, "Fate" is full of actors that you'd be hard pressed to think of as having any acting ability, let alone acting talent), the story is totally implausible and even the special effects look cheap. It even looks worse now as compared to the early "Star-Wars" films as the CGI looks dated (the desert cabin has the typical Utah-type of look) and the effects were shot on the cheap. The film also suffers from a number of terrible acting and editing decisions.  George Lucas is clearly one of the biggest fanboys of Star Trek and he obviously didn't want to waste his talents on a film like this. The only thing good about this film is that it's one of those rare films that is fun and entertaining, even if it's not very good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen a few bad movies but this one just kills me   The special effects are really terrible.   This movie is just so bad that it is hard to sit through and I did not even watch it twice   They do the best they can but just look horrible 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen all of the "Star Wars" movies. And to be perfectly honest, the movies were all pretty bad.   The worst was "The Empire Strikes Back" which is like a "Jaws" with robots and was just a total disappointment.  "The Return of the Jedi" was good and "The Force Awakens" had a lot of potential but it was way over budget and I wouldn't have wanted to see that "Star Trek" ripoff (I'm serious).  The best part about the trilogy were the animated movies but they just sucked.  I haven't seen the "Battleship" movies but it's always disappointing to see a big budget movie with all those CGI models.  The next movie was "Rogue One" and it was amazing and the first time I saw a really "Star War" movie that had a sense of fun and I was actually entertained.  Now we have "Rogue Two" but the quality of the film was really just the same as "Rogue Three".  The "Force" film was great, so was "ROTJ".  I really hope they make a "Rogue Four" but I've heard it's going to be way more expensive than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are not interested in a story that starts in space and ends in hell, then I'd recommend skipping this one.   The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the great cast that you will see in the future.  But that's not the reason why I have to give it a bad review.  I guess because it's so bad and because it has nothing to do with space or hell.  For the last 40 years it's been a cult movie.  Why?  If the movie is that good then why doesn't anyone make more movies about the plot of hell?   I am surprised the people of the 70s didn't watch it as many times as the 90s.  It's that good.  If I was in the 70's I would have watched this movie as well.  The cast is amazing in this movie.   Tom Hanks is very good in it.  Roger Moore is pretty good.   Sean Connery is great.  They all really fit in and the story is interesting.   I guess the reason I am saying that this movie is worth watching is because it shows us the history of space in the past.   When I saw this movie I thought about when space exploration was happening.  Now with space travel we don't need a hell, but we need to have people that want to go to the stars.  Then I thought, why hasn't anyone made a movie like this?  But then I thought back to when we made movies and I realized this movie would make a great movie in the 50s or 60s.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at the local theater when it was released and it was very fun and very cheap. I wish that they made it in the style of the old 80's movies instead of this new boring one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first heard this film was a TV movie I thought to myself "How can someone who doesn't know how to make a film really make one?"  But after watching it I realized that it is the best thing I've ever seen.  The acting is absolutely top notch and the movie doesn't hold back.  I am really looking forward to seeing what the filmmakers are going to do with it.  For me, it is a "must see" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A film so bad that it was not even worth watching or having a bad day. There are so many people out there that just have bad taste in films. This film will get any film lover riled up but the only people it will get worked up for will be those that can't watch movies without making a scene. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is an excellent movie to pass the time, but it just so happens to be bad.   The only reason I can really give it a "5" is because of the great acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was pretty sure I was going to hate this movie, but I was totally wrong.   This movie has some good stuff in it, some bad, and some completely boring.  I really enjoyed the old giallo stuff, but this movie was nothing to write home about.  It does have a great cast and they are all good, but they just don't bring enough of a story to it.  This is not the most interesting movie of the year, but it is enjoyable enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is terrible.   It has one scene where the guy gets hit by a car and gets knocked out, then wakes up, realizes that he is on the wrong street and tries to walk to a more populated area.  If this was a real movie with real people, this scene would have been the end of it.  The other problems with this movie are obvious.  This is a movie for adults.  These kids who watched this movie for laughs were not amused.  It is one of the funniest films I have ever seen.  I do not understand why the director took the time to make this movie and I do think it is some kind of a parody.  There are many more movies to watch if you want to learn a little more about the inner workings of our society. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was poorly made and was a terrible waste of time. It didn't matter how much of a good movie it was, it never seemed like there was enough.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was very impressed with this movie.   It was a good movie, but it was not good.  If you want a good old fashioned old time adventure, give it a watch, but don't expect much out of it.  There is a good story, but they are not very interesting.  I was not in the mood for a movie with a story like that.  You could watch a whole series of these movies in a row and not see much more than a whole episode.  It would have been cool if they had made more of a series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best movie in my life!!! !    Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from The BEST. It will give you nightmares. The best horror film you will ever see. The music is just amazing. I have seen all of the Saw movies and this one is the best. It's so scary and creepy and it will haunt you forever. I was scared straight and I was watching it with my boyfriend because I didn't want to go to sleep until I saw this movie. The cast is great. You will never forget it. It really took my breath away! I had to stay up all night just to watch it. And the best part of it all... I LOVED IT! Thank you horror. Thank you Spielberg!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are looking for a movie that is not very good or even bad, and you think that "Dumb and Dumber" would be the perfect movie to make to show the world how dumb and dumb it can be, then you might want to look away. Dumb and Dumbers doesn't even try to be clever or witty and instead just makes it seem as though it is the most ridiculous movie ever, especially considering that it is a comedy. There are times where you think the actors are making jokes, but then they make a face and it seems as though you are watching a movie. For example, when they are talking about how a guy and a girl are going to do a threesome and then they are seen holding hands and laughing and smiling at each other when the girl is getting fucked. It is like watching a comedy sketch on the first day of school. Then when the movie was over, I looked back and realized that they made fun of this scene and made me laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot of this movie is nothing special. It's kind of like a kid's version of the '80s cartoon "Mickey Mouse Clubhouse"  This movie was filmed in 1981 by an unknown director in Canada  He hired a handful of talented artists and casted them in a live action version of "Mickeys"  He had to shoot the movie over 6 months because he had a young crew  They tried to make the film sound like "Micmac" with lots of "flutes and guitars". But it is a completely terrible movie   It was filmed on location at the 'Wizard of Oz'  It looks and sounds very dated and dated  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a terrible movie.  It didn't live up to the hype.  This is one of those "so bad it's good" kind of movies.  Not worth watching.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So when I watched this movie, it didn't leave a very good impression. As for the movie itself... well... it doesn't make any sense. This movie is more or less trying to teach you that a child cannot consent to sex, and that's just not true at all. So the movie should be taught in a different way, not the way it is. I didn't understand at all what was going on, and this movie isn't even worth watching for that reason.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie based on the comic book hero. The only problem I see is that they didn't cast the right person for the role. The guy playing Captain America is no George Reeves, he's just a guy that is good looking and has a bad body. He looks more like a middle aged guy than the original and that's not what it is about. I know people hate the idea of a man wearing a uniform with a costume, and that is where the problem lies. There were no guys that could look like what the original had and the only guy that had the right body and face to play Captain America was Robert Downey Jr. Not only that, he was playing the same part, so the actors needed to be very close. It just doesn't make sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know why people like this movie. It's one of those "takes you back in time" films with bad acting and a cheap plot that has no originality. It is filled with clichés, cheesy lines and the main bad guy seems like a cartoon character.   There is a scene where a boy is hanging from a rope in a dungeon with several men. One man talks to him about how great it was when he was a child, as if this is what all these men did in the past.  It seems to have been shot using a "pink film" technique.  All the actors are not very good and they all seem to be "on vacation".  If you are a fan of the 80's you might be into this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is horrible, and the acting is even worse. I wish the characters were as fleshed out as the actors are. The acting was so horrible that it seemed like every actor was just playing a part, and there wasn't much to them.   I just wish the director had been more careful with his directing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a good story, but the story does not work. The main character, a cop, has his memories erased because he has seen too much and he just wants his job back. When he wakes up he finds himself in the past. He does his job, he saves the day, and then he finds out the cop that shot him, who has a son, is now the same person as the guy he saved.  It was like watching an old movie and not knowing the next scene.  This was a terrible movie and I thought it was a disaster before I watched it.   I'm so glad my daughter doesn't like it, but for my wife it was like being in the first movie of "The Exorcist" where the woman and girl in the woods are killed, and now you want to go back there to be sure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad, terrible movie. I really hope it will have more of a cult following.   The production was so bad that it was ridiculous, the director is a complete unknown and I don't know if he even knows what he's doing. The actors are terrible, the acting is so bad, the directing is terrible, and the acting makes it even more awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched the movie, and it was all wrong. The acting was weak, the story was wrong, the pacing was wrong and the acting just was not good at all. This movie is like a badly written soap opera.   The plot is all wrong, it was made by a girl (Julia Roberts), her character is an adult but she was written to be a child with a horrible imagination. The only character that actually acts like a child is the father (James Caan). They also did a poor job of setting up the characters and setting up a believable story.  The only problem with the acting in this movie is the terrible acting of the child actors. I saw Julia Roberts in this and I was disgusted by the acting of her.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I found out that this movie was a remake, I was more excited about this than I was for the original.   It's pretty good as a remake though.  It has a similar vibe to the original (which I still really liked).   I loved this movie and I think it was pretty underrated, I guess because it was made way before the internet was as popular as it is now.  I think that this is a pretty good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting something more, but what came out of the camera was a complete disappointment.   The main character, the most intriguing character in the whole movie, is a total goofball. He talks to himself and has no common sense. He thinks he can tell when a girl is ready to sleep with him. He just hangs out around girls and he doesn't seem to care that his ex-girlfriend left him.  His girlfriend also leaves him, because he has some weird attitude about her.  The movie is totally ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is an abomination.  It's horrible, it's stupid, it doesn't have any plot, no characters, no plot, and a really bad acting and plotline.  You know what a good movie should have?     A good plot, a good story, good acting, and good music.   The only good thing is that I really enjoyed the acting and the music. The bad thing is the acting.  The acting was so bad.  I don't like bad acting.    For the acting to be this bad I wonder what they did to their actors to make them act like this.  There is nothing that is good about this movie.     It wasn't fun watching this, it was painful.  A really painful movie to watch.  This is a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved this movie! The movie is good, the cast is good and it has a good plot. The acting was really good, although the characters didn't really have any depth, but I liked the characters.   It was supposed to be a parody of the James Bond films, but it wasn't funny at all.  The story was a mess, and there was no real mystery or suspense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just awful. It is the lowest grade of the 3 Dvd's. This movie makes me very sick to my stomach. It has all the elements of the most terrible horror movies. It looks and sounds terrible, it has an awful story, and it just feels like the film makers were out of their minds!    I was hoping that this was a special feature for the 2nd edition. I am sure that the people who made this film do not realize how terrible it is. The acting is horrible and the cinematography is completely lacking. I have seen worse films and I will be glad to never see this one again! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While the movie was fun, it was so boring I didn't even have the time to do anything but walk into my room and fall asleep. I would suggest trying it in a theater.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was a disappointment. The only reason I had to see it was because it was a screening I had been invited to at a local cinema.   The plot is a lot of crap that was supposed to be "trying" to be about "family" but it was nothing of the sort.  I understand that the plot has been going on for a while now but the acting was just horrible and it really didn't have any point.  The family really needed to cut the crap and go back to the original story.  It was obvious that the director was trying to make the family seem as stupid as possible and the poor acting was to thank.  If you want a good family movie this is the one to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did not want to watch the movie, but was forced to by the commercials for it, and it turned out to be just that.   It wasn't bad, but it was not good.  This movie is just a piece of crap that is meant to be a joke, and I don't think it was intended to be serious at all.  The actors were not funny, and the action scenes were not entertaining.  I would never waste my time watching this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was horrible. The acting was atrocious and I could tell it was filmed on video at a high school. It's like someone took a bad video of all the guys on that football team, added some crappy dialogue and edited it together to make a movie. The movie was shot like a high budget film and the director didn't even care about making a good movie.   I would NEVER buy this movie. It was awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went into this expecting a good movie but the acting was really bad, the story was not interesting, and the cinematography was so bland it was just so boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The ending was not believable. The plot was totally a piece of garbage. The story is totally fake.   A terrible idea for a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I was getting a good movie at first. I had seen all the films of the great actors, and I thought it would be a real treat to watch these two. They made me feel very sorry for the man who wanted to kill the woman he loved so much. I was so upset about all the problems in this world. The last twenty minutes just did not add up. It was too much for me to handle.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is absolutely terrible!   We get the idea that there is a giant UFO, and some other aliens have been spotted, but they never do any of the things we're meant to see. They don't even seem to be coming here. The aliens are really out there, and it's easy to get confused by their strange behavior. The scenes where the aliens are being held prisoner by the humans are particularly bizarre, and they even have some "alien" names that don't make any sense. What was up with all those "aliens"?   I don't know, but it's just not very entertaining.   The writing isn't even that good, and we've been exposed to far too many of these kinds of movies to accept that "alien movie" is a good name for a movie, especially when it ends up being so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie for the first time last night. My family and I came in on a Sunday night. We sat right in the front row and waited for this movie to start. I thought the opening credits would be pretty good as the people walking around talking about this movie looked pretty drugged up, so I thought nothing of it. When I saw the actual actors walking around in the movie, I was not impressed. This movie looks like it was made in the '80's or the '90's. I guess that is because it is being filmed on old video cameras. The actors were not very believable and the actors were so over acted. The only time I noticed the actors was when they were trying to talk on the cell phones. I know that you are supposed to put the actors in a certain position in order to give the actors a more convincing image, but it is a little sloppy to put a man and woman on a cell phone. The director could have done much better. It looks like a cheap, low budget, bad movie. I was expecting something much better and it is what it is.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A terrible movie, so bad that I wanted to see it in a theater. The plot is a lie. The actors did not act at all, and there is not a single scene that makes you laugh.   If you want something "good", try watching "Wanted", and the cast of actors, including Christopher Walken and John Cazale.  I have heard a lot about this movie. It is an awful movie, and it will leave a bad taste in your mouth. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been wanting to watch this film since it came out in the summer of 2015. And I thought I had found it on a VOD site. The trailers did not do it any favors and I found myself getting more and more nervous the longer I looked.   My worst fear had come true. It wasn't as good as I remembered it. The plot and characters were all a bit contrived. It just didn't work. The dialogue felt very off. It seemed to be in the style of a film where people talked over each other.  I was just really annoyed that it wasn't funny. The acting was terrible and every character felt completely flat.  It's just not funny, it's not entertaining and it's a mess of a movie. I thought it would've worked better as a comedy than a drama.  I'll never watch this movie again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:        I didn't see the trailer or any of the ads for this movie. I had been told that it was a remake of a short film of the same name (The Short Film of the Weird and Horrible) and that the producers wanted a new star. My wife and I went in for the premiere at the Alamo Drafthouse in Hollywood on a Saturday. This place is always pretty packed. It's a pretty small theater. We were seated on the floor next to a giant screen, so we couldn't see what was going on, and the director (James Ponsoldt) and star (Richard Grieco) were playing cards. It was pretty hard to tell who was talking to who. It wasn't until after the first act that the actors stopped talking and just started going at it. There was no dialogue in the entire film. The only time you see dialogue is when someone makes a remark. This was just a terrible movie. We had to leave. The people running the theater were very nice and very kind. It took my wife about half an hour to realize this was a terrible film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this because of the premise of the movie. It didn't really do what it set out to do, it really only seemed to be an attempt at making a big budgeted "bad" movie. The acting was bad, the story was predictable, and the whole premise was stupid.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     In the end this movie is pretty disappointing. The acting is pretty good and all the characters are interesting, but in the end it's not a good film.   I guess they are trying to make something that is a bit different from the usual stuff that is being done these days. There's a real lack of action and in the whole movie they show us very little. A bit of comedy and a bit of romance too. A good idea though, but as I see it, they could have done much more with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is not worth watching, or even listening to, and is not funny at all.   The first thing I found out when I heard about this film is that it was based on the real life story of a woman named Patty Hearst.  She is the daughter of a very rich family, but she had a habit of getting into some serious trouble.  Her name was Patty Hearpoo, and she got caught for kidnapping someone and had to pay an extremely high bail.  After she served her time, she got into a lot of other trouble again, including running over a police officer in California.  So you can see why she became a very dangerous woman.  The film starts off very boring, but things become funnier when it becomes clear that the man who has kidnapped Hearst is a crazy old man.  In the meantime, the girl tries to get out of the car and get away from him, and eventually she makes her escape, but her pursuer catches her and tries to drag her to a desert, but the girl manages to get away.  When the man finds out about this, he puts a gun to the girl's head and says "You better tell me where the other Patty Hearsts are, or I will shoot."  He then runs off.  I found this movie to be absolutely atrocious.  And you can guess why it did not get the funds it needed to make it.  Instead, they made a crappy movie out of it, but I thought it was more entertaining than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a lot of good movies out there but this is a bad one and the actors are terrible. I would be more attracted to the good movie The Good Son. I give this movie a 3 out of 10 and i would not watch it again
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read about this movie as an urban legend on youtube a few years back. After seeing it I was shocked and didn't think I would actually see it. I was wrong... The whole movie was made up... It wasn't made up out of whole cloth, they took real life events, and then re-titulled it... The movie is really weird.... You know something is wrong when the guy looks like he is the bad guy and all his people look like the good guys. The movie was in black and white, and that's where it fell apart. It looks like something that was made by some teenagers in a garage or something. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was really not all that good and was very poorly written. The actors, who do nothing special, do little to give any emotion or sense of realism. I really thought the actors, and director, thought it was cool to film the scenes without any lighting or any sound at all.    It is like a movie that is made to be forgotten, it has some great shots and one of the best fight scenes in the movie and the plot was very well done.   I was expecting more from this movie, but the actors had no idea what they were doing and never acted in their scenes. The story is just a bad waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love the movie and the casting. This movie is terrible! The main character is played by a boy. He can be so sweet but his actions and language are so wrong. He is a total pervert. He will do anything to have sex. I can't believe this was produced by Disney.    What really bothered me was that this guy has a wife who he thinks he is the one. He makes a movie about her that he thinks she will like. He pretends to date and talk to other girls in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has no plot, no plot line and no character development, so what was the point of wasting my time to watch it?   The production was horrible and there was not one person to help.   No one even wanted to look at the set.  The acting was horrendous, with the poor acting being a bigger problem than the acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this was a good idea, the casting was great, and it was entertaining to watch.   But the action scenes were stupid and didn't have any kind of tension at all.  There was nothing to keep me interested.    There were too many dumb shots of guns, and the camera was not focused.  My favorite shot was when someone was shot, and you could hear the pain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen and loved this movie. It is very well written and acted. The actors and the director have the talent to pull this movie off.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The cast is just fine, and I am a huge fan of Paul Rudd, but the plot is just silly.   One of the best parts is the opening sequence, which has a fantastic slow-motion scene of Bruce Lee and George Lazenby fighting, with a very cool music track.  The movie goes from action to a comedy in a few scenes, and it looks great.  I just wish it had kept it going.  Very much worth watching, but not worth the $15 to $30 you will have to pay for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a waste of your time and money.   I would give this film a low score but it is a film with little redeeming value in my opinion.  This is a poor excuse for a film.  The film is slow, boring, and predictable.  Nothing new here, other than a director who makes movies of this ilk.  I can say that this is just a cheap attempt to cash in on the success of "The Shining".  It is only the worst of his films and is not worth a time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought it was going to be an okay action movie, but it sucked from the first scene, to the end. There was nothing to look forward to. It's really disappointing for a studio that is known for action movies. I hate when they try to cash in on the "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" brand, but this just turned into a lame movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie a few years ago when I was really young and really excited to be doing this. I had been told that it would be an entertaining and fun film to watch, and it was. The special effects and special effects of the day really made it seem like the day was really the 20's, and the movie was definitely filmed in the 1920's, with the actors dressed as period costumes. This is an okay movie. It's a little cheesy at times, and I feel like I remember every time a character does something out of character, but it is also interesting, and definitely worth watching.

I hate this movie, it is just really bad!   The script is horrible, it doesn't make sense, and the actors are terrible! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that I was expecting something like "The Shining". The ending was disappointing, and the acting was pretty awful.   It's too bad because this movie is about a man on the run from his sister's killer.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was bad, in a bad way. If you were expecting the "Avengers", "X-Men" or "The Avengers" of today's films, you will be completely disappointed. It's very obvious the writer/director has nothing going for him and decided to make a cheap action film.  I can not think of any decent actor who could have played this part.  The film is so badly made, the actors are not believable, they don't look like they could act. I don't know why the director decided to have a couple of bad actors in the film. It made it look bad.   The "good" part of the film is the great fight scene.  The fight scenes are all over the place, there's not a proper scene that fits the action.       There's just too many bad scenes in this movie.      The acting is awful.  Most of the actors have a horrible mouth, but no one ever gives them a great performance.  The film is a disaster.  There's just not enough story to tell and it looks so amateurish. I guess I shouldn't be too harsh on it, because the movie was meant to be a low budget action movie, but it just doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of awful moments. The story of a guy whose wife's father is a Nazi officer and his family's history is an allegory for how one can be affected by evil. A movie that was originally directed by the talented George Roy Hill. Unfortunately, Roy Hill was also a child molester. The film has some nice acting, but the dialogue is cheesy and it's just not worth the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I like this movie. It's a good idea and some really good actors in it. The story itself is pretty good, the cast is great, and the plot line is fun.  I really want this movie to be successful, but it's not even entertaining.  It's an awful movie.   The only thing I liked about the movie was the sex scenes in the end, but even that was a bit strange to see.  The movie could have been so much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie, not only with its plot but with the acting. There was nothing going on with the actors and they were all completely uninterested in the plot, and most of them had no idea what was going on either. In fact, the only person who really cared and did anything was the "main" character, an extremely dull, passive girl. The other actors that were in it did not look like they cared and seemed to be doing it for the money.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have only seen the original "Dirty Harry" and have not seen the sequels. "D-Day" was about the day that a million German soldiers marched across the English Channel during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. It had great actors, a good script and a fantastic action sequence.   In my opinion this movie was a total flop and was never given the credit that it deserved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the end, the movie was very bad. I was expecting something much better but it was a waste of money.   I was really disappointed in this movie.  There were alot of cool moments and good acting.  Unfortunately, it was mostly boring scenes and boring characters.  The worst part was the ending.  It was so contrived and silly.  I got so bored.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Weird" is a good way to put it. The film was filmed in such a way that you could easily believe that the film was the work of a high schooler who watched a few bad horror movies on a college campus. This film, made by a group of high schoolers, was just a product of its time. I'm not sure why they put the camera so close to the actors faces to make them seem so "weird". It just looked really unnatural. I also liked the music in this film. But the acting in this was very weak and I'm just not sure what the purpose was in it. If you are looking for a "weIRD" horror film then check this one out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an all around bad movie. All the actors were terrible and I was disgusted at the terrible story line, the acting was terrible, and I felt like this movie was not even fun to watch.   The only thing I think could of made this movie better would have been a sex scene with the main female lead or one of her friends. I could of sworn the male lead was a lesbian and it would have made it more believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's an OK movie, but it's very dull and it lacks any kind of interesting plot. This movie has no depth and no real twists and turns. There is an idea, but that idea is used in such a dull way that it doesn't really work.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I read this book when it was first released in the US in 1987. My mom gave me a copy of it when I was a kid as a Christmas present. The cover was beautiful, the description even better. I thought it would be a good time to look up the film on Wikipedia. I didn't read the Wikipedia version because it was in Russian.   The movie is not terrible, in fact it is kinda okay.  It has a few moments of originality that I love, but the movie itself is kind of generic. I can't say the same for the book.  So here are my thoughts.  The story is actually quite different from the book, but it was actually quite good. The plot is similar to the book's, but there is only one person in the whole movie, so it doesn't really add much. The story has a lot more action in it, and is more entertaining.  I think this movie could have been made much better, if the movie and the book had gone hand in hand. The movie has a great action sequence where a kid fights with a dinosaur. It's not that great, but still it's pretty neat.  Then the movie goes back to the main character, and the story becomes more interesting. I do love that it was made to look similar to a real dinosaur, so that it would make a much better movie.  When this movie came out, I didn,t really understand how scary it really was.  My sister's brother watched the movie while she was in the other room, and said that it scared him, but that it could've been a lot scarier. He said that he liked the main characters, but felt that it went too far with the stuff they did.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked this movie, but for a "action" movie.   Very simple and predictable plot.  It starts with the hero, an elite military man, tracking down a terrorist cell.  His main opponent is a young woman, who in a perfect, evil, and manipulative turn of phrase, tells him, "My name is not Alina. You are."  The ending is predictable but not bad.  At first I thought it was really well acted, but it was just too long and there was no fight scenes or action.  I think I just didn't like this movie because it just didn�t work.  The reason it's on here, is that some people seem to think this movie is good.  A lot of people are on this site who claim that it is the greatest movie ever.  And that�s kind of a big deal because the only other movies that make this claim, are all action movies.  This movie is a failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a really bad movie. I can't believe that this shit got made. I'm surprised it's even getting a limited release, the reviews on it are all so fucking bad, the people that have reviewed it really need to read the original script, it's so bad, so stupid. It's really funny to read about the writers of the script saying how they didn't get the story but the idea for it. The only time it's good is when they are on the beach, they have a party in the middle of the ocean, they are having such a great time, the director is shooting at it and there's a huge explosion and the waves are hitting the camera, it was hilarious, you could tell that the director had a blast, he must have just had such fun.  It gets so bad in there it's fucking horrible.  This movie is so stupid it's embarrassing, I can think of a movie that is worse.  A movie like this makes me feel sorry for the director.    I wish he would never touch a movie like that again, he needs to do the fucking script a fucking favor and change the script and then he will have a great movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In my opinion, a film that is about killing your brother is a poor choice for the director. The story is completely out of whack and lacks the motivation that would make the audience believe in the characters.   Another reason to not watch this film is the acting. You have John Wayne doing a laughable imitation of a tough guy, and that is all the movie has going for it.  John Wayne in his worst performance since "John Wayne's Westerns"  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie in a movie theater. The movie played for two hours and it was about 45 minutes of a man standing up on a building and talking to people on a rooftop, but I thought it was way to long. So, I went to the movie store and got the two hour version.   They should have at least added a song that plays at the end of the movie.  I never have seen a movie that was so boring.  It was such a waste of time.  One of the reasons it is not worth watching is the stupid ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A really poor movie.   I'm not really sure what to say about this one besides I don't think I've ever seen a movie that was so poorly acted that it was downright embarrassing.  The plot and the acting in this film were horrendous.  One of the characters was supposed to be played by a man and when it was finally found out that the actor wasn't the right person, he was replaced by a female.  This film was never about the characters and what they were going through, it was more about the plot, which was not worth watching in my opinion.  To start with the actors who were supposed to play the characters were either under par or had horrible accents.  I remember hearing someone say, "My wife said she heard someone say he was a man", and I thought it was supposed t o be a subtle joke, but no, it came across as " My wife heard me say I was a fool".   The other actors in this were also not that good.  There are other things in this movie that are more important than the acting, like how the plot never made any sense, what kind of movie would make a character walk around naked in a hot summer day, but that was not even the worst part of the movie. The worst thing about this movie was the horrible acting.  I don�t know why it was so hard for directors to find people who could play their characters, but it�s so hard to find actors who can really play a character like this.  When it comes to acting, I usually try to see how well the actors play their own character, but even when you get people who are really good at acting, the acting really doesn�t add up.  My favorite part of this film was when the man who played the man said that the man that played the other man was just like him, except instead of being a man, he is a woman.  It just was so funny watching a woman be all macho and fight in a movie. I thought for sure there was going to be a fight between the man and the woman, but then I realized that they had already fought one and then a few minutes later a guy comes along and gets beaten.  Another thing I noticed about this film is how terrible the music was.  Not only was the music terrible, the film also had horrible acting and terrible music.  What kind of filmmakers thinks that they can make a

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like your action movies to be well done, well plotted, well acted and in a time when you couldn't get a decent film for less than $200 (including a little bit of merchandising), this one is pretty good.  This was a film made in the 50's so it has all the things you would expect, plus a little more.  A few things in the story are a little silly, but overall the action is pretty cool.  I thought that the main lead, Jim Corbett (the guy with the white hair) was great as the hero.  It is clear that he loved being in the movie, because his excitement level was through the roof.  The supporting cast were all great too, and the ending left me a little unsatisfied.   I wouldn't want to see this movie again, but if it was on a budget I could see it being a really fun flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first half of the movie is great and all I'm saying is there's a lot of badness in there. The badness really begins when the badness of the bad guy in the movie becomes the baddest bad guy on the screen. The movie has no heart at all.   So why is the bad bad guy so good?  Because he has the most retarded character ever.  You have to watch the movie again to find out who the bad good guy really is.  There's nothing in his life to justify being so awesome in this movie.  It's the first in a series of crappy movies where the bad guys have to be as awesome as possible to make up for the lack of any redeeming qualities in their own characters.  I know the movie was made in the 70s so the actors had to play older versions of themselves, but the characters are still as stupid and annoying as they ever were.  The only thing that has any kind of real emotion is that one scene where he cries over her death. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is all about the girls, so I was happy to see it has the potential to be a pretty entertaining movie. However, it fails at almost every other aspect of being an entertaining movie, and I would not recommend it to anyone, at all.   I think that, with the cast of female characters, they could have done so much more to make it fun.  It has a few nice jokes here and there, but none of it is really funny. The acting is mostly terrible, especially in the beginning.  The film only takes you through about the second or third act.  If you are not looking for a fun flick, you can probably pass this film by.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I saw this movie it was for the first time and I wasn't a huge fan of the characters. This movie makes no sense. The movie is a terrible mess. It is so bad I had to watch it on Youtube so I could watch it over and over again. The best part of the movie is the actors who are in it. They all do terrible jobs and they just give each other bad lines. The only decent part about the movie was when the actors did the scenes in a studio and they were all drunk.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So bad, it's hard to be positive. There's no chemistry between these two characters, and that's a shame.   These actors were supposed to be a match made in heaven. Instead, they didn't even make it halfway through their film before falling apart. It was like they didn t even care about acting, and didn't have any idea what they were doing.  It's a real shame that they wasted all their talent on such a boring script, as the story they were trying to tell could've been interesting.  One of the worse scripts in the history of the movie business.  I would've been happy if they spent less time on it, and focused on getting the rest of the cast right. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A classic movie with a few small issues.   It is a beautiful movie and has great performances by John Wayne, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.  It does not start off well and is pretty slow.  This is a little dated but still has a great ending.  Richard Burton did a great job and is still remembered fondly.  A little dated in parts but it still has some good parts.   This is not a terrible movie but it does have some issues.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has no plot and is an excuse to see a woman give a bunch of bad head.  This movie is awful.  The bad acting, poor acting and bad effects really give the film an off taste.  There are no jokes in this movie, nothing.  I can't understand how this film got green-lighted by Universal Studios.  It's just a bunch shots of bad acting and terrible effects.  They would be better off using a $1 million budget.   This film has no story and is just another excuse for women to be seen doing dumb things in front of men and not having much sex. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot was boring. The story was simple.   I never wanted to see it again.  No one cared about this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it was a horror movie. I watched the movie and it turned out to be an awful movie. The acting, the story, the pacing, and the music was awful. The characters in the movie are all very unlikable. There's no personality to the movie. It's just a bunch of people doing the same things over and over. The director really wanted to make a horror film, so he made it the way he wanted to. However, the only reason this movie is worth watching is because of the amazing music. I love the movie but I'm sure no one will like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love "The Thing," so much so I was so disappointed by this one.   The only reason I didn't give this a 1 star was because it was filmed in black and white.  The sound was fine, but the movie is just too dark. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In some ways, this movie is a good rip-off of  The Shining. I mean, there are similarities between the characters in the two stories. They both have a haunted house to investigate. I guess you could say that the people in the house are more frightening than the apparitions that haunt them. They're both ghosts who have escaped their own physical bodies. The people in this movie are probably less terrifying than the ghosts in the movie because they are only glimpses of the ghosts that haunt the house, and these ghosts are pretty harmless in comparison. If anything, they're more terrifying than Jack Torrance himself.    Overall, I'd rather not see this movie. I really hate bad sequels and I think the people making this movie made a very poor job of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My mom saw this in the theater and I don't remember it so I can't comment on it, though I do remember her saying "This is not the movie I was expecting"  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A horrible movie that is really very boring to watch.   You have to watch it on youtube if you want to understand what they are trying to say, but that is all the help they can give you.  I have seen a better movie in a movie theater.  If you are looking for a good thriller, then this is not for you, and if you like action movies, then you will not like this movie either.  They are trying too hard to make a movie with some substance.  It is not a real thriller, and not very good acting either. The plot is extremely stupid.  There is no meaning to the whole thing, and the actors just do not give it any.  The best way to describe this movie would be to say that it is like watching a movie about a killer who is a robot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am a fan of the movie and it was good but it was a terrible flick. The first act is horrible and I just wanted to throw my popcorn at the screen and go home.   What a wasted opportunity to make a good film. The plot was ridiculous and the characters were nothing special.  This movie is just a disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen several movies in my life, many of which were bad. Some were even pretty bad. My only negative experience with a bad film was the "E.T." film, but it had nothing to do with this film. This film is simply awful. A film that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. The sound was horrible. There were several instances where I heard the camera zooming and panning in and out of the actors and/or the screen and not moving anywhere. This movie really sucked.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was so excited when this movie came out.   This movie made me a believer.  When I saw it, I knew it was going to be the movie to see.  I had never watched this movie before.  But after seeing this movie I fell in love.  It is a movie about life, the ups and downs of living.  At the end of the day the main character is happy.  That's when you know a movie is worth watching.  The best part about this movie was the fact that it was made in the 80's.  You can tell it was shot with a camcorder.  There were so many great actors in this movie, and it still holds up.  This is one of the great movies from the 80s, 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie a couple months ago on tv and I'm glad I saw it. I like it! I like the director. The actor is good. I really like the actors. The movie is interesting and well made. I think this movie is really good and I hope that one day they make a great movie with a great actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If I were to rank movies from worst to best, and I had to pick just one movie, and no matter what I thought I would pick this one, and this movie was not bad, it was just really bad. If you are like me and really like 80's cheesy comedies, this movie is probably for you, and if you are not, then don't even try. If your looking for a comedy, then there are lots of better ones, if you want a more serious movie this is not it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very bad movie! It was a bad idea, but they went for it! Bad acting, bad characters, bad plot, bad production, bad editing...you know. I'd give it a zero, and if I could give it an A, I would.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've had some bad experiences with this movie. The first one I remember being really bad. I think I was in my junior year at college and this movie was in the cafeteria. My friends and I all watched it together and it was really bad, kind of the same kind of scene from every "bad movie". I was so shocked, and disgusted when I saw it. This movie is so bad that I think it's better to just leave it out of your movie library, unless you have a special interest in it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is boring and cheesy and completely forgettable.  It's kind of weird that they didn't just film it from a third person view as I thought that would make the movie more interesting.  Also, the girl with the huge boob is a joke.  The only thing I think the movie is good is that the director had an interesting take on the subject.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was supposed to be a horror movie, but this was just an action movie.   The movie did have a decent script. It's like watching a guy in an old silent movie trying to act like a professional, but his acting wasn't very good.  In a lot of movies there would be a good, scary script, but there's nothing scary about this movie. I've been waiting to see a sequel to this movie, since the first one sucked, but it just looks like a cheap horror flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this film thinking it would be a great addition to my collection.   The whole film was enjoyable.  I was a little disappointed though when it hit me.  I thought it would have been a great twist on a classic story.  This twist was ruined by a stupid plot and a lack of action.  The characters are all uninteresting and forgettable.  There is really no reason to watch this film at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen all the movies I wanted to see in one day of one month of my life, so I was really excited for this one, but after watching it I realize that there was a lot of wasted potential.   First of all the cast is awful.  Most of them are the stereotypical "cute blonde" types.  Even though she looks young and pretty, Michelle Monaghan is a total douche.  The only time she is likable is when she is pretending to be an old lady.  And, of course, there's the main villain, who seems to be more of a comic relief than a serious villain.  There was a scene where he was holding a baby and throwing her around the room, but it looked really cheap, and there was no way that was something you would be able to do.  Also, there were some scenes that were just stupid, like the one where he comes home to his family to get revenge on them.  It was like the writers just didn't give a flying fuck about the plot at all.  I think the movie could have been better if the whole movie was just one giant sex scene.  To be honest, I didn't care if there were any kids in it, as the last 10 minutes were just ridiculous.  If you want some really bad sex scenes, look no further than this movie.  Overall, this movie was like watching a group of teenagers on drugs.  Hollywood has ruined movies for the last couple of years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with a bad song, and then a song that's terrible. The actors can't act, the dialog is terrible and the film is full of stupid dialog. Then the movie gets really stupid as it follows the evil queen in a crazy mansion. In this movie the actors don't have any lines and the dialog doesn't flow.    When you see this movie you might as well give up. It was really stupid. It had a lot of terrible lines and it was filled with cheap acting and bad dialog. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a pretty bad movie.   The writing style is awful.  It's always saying the same thing.  We're in a war and a giant alien spaceship attacks and kills everyone.  The aliens are trying to take over earth.  This movie would never get a rating of bad if the aliens weren't a bunch of racist stereotypes.  I don't know why, but they all look like black men in drag.  They have horrible accents and look like clowns.  There is no sense of danger in this movie.   If there was a giant ship attacking earth and the aliens were going to invade this is what I would have seen.  Why are the aliens trying to dominate us?  I really don't understand how this movie even got made.    I watched a lot of bad movies growing up. This is one of the worst I've ever seen. I would never watch this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie just has no story or meaning at all. I really thought the actor was going to be a really good one. But he does absolutely nothing for the movie and they just keep getting better and better.   The story is totally uninteresting and there is really no motivation to the movie to keep going or for the actor to keep doing these stupid and silly scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie should have been made by a lower budget independent film maker.   They were obviously trying to make something fun but the script was terribly written.  For example, one character is a famous film actress and another is a high school kid who is a real "clown" with a great story to tell.  One scene in the movie is one of my all time favorite scenes.  The movie was directed by a very good director with a real flair.  It looks like it could have been great, but the movie did not come together as well as they had hoped.  Overall, it is a great movie with a good story and fun actors.  I would have loved to see it made with an independent director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie two stars.  I really enjoyed the premise that it's a love story but I didn't really get it. It's the most bizarre romantic comedy I've ever seen. The two leading actors are in the worst romantic comedies ever made.   It's like they tried to make a rom-com starring the two leads from Grease and one of the leads from Step Brothers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A really boring story about the boy who is going to kill the evil witch.   It is basically a long prologue about the girl who lived with the boy but the boy never really shows up and when she dies and she has her revenge she does it by trying to kill him.  It could be entertaining to see the boy finally get some attention, but the movie just becomes completely irrelevant at the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad movie I bought is one of my all time favorites.   It was a very well made film. I don't see how anyone could have rated it better than it deserved.  What a movie, I was so entertained and happy after watching it. The acting is top notch.  This movie is in my top ten favorites.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am giving this movie 4 stars for the reason I wanted it to be 4 stars.  I thought I was going to have to get a different movie that night when the theater started showing the movie with no ending.  The movie was bad and not fun to watch.  This is why I am leaving out the details that made this movie the best of it's kind.  There were some cool action scenes with great acting and the ending was awesome.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have never heard about this movie, but now that I do, I think I'm going to see it and I'm not sure what to think. The acting is very weak, the plots are very weak. What they were trying to do was to make a really cool movie where people go on a safari and they get shot at a time of day that is different than what they thought it would be at.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this at a theater in San Diego. It was a great first date movie and I loved it. The couple is very nice and I liked how they both were very flirtatious during the movie. It really made me think about what would happen if two guys were dating and one of them was a millionaire and the other was a poor guy in his early 30s who was working two jobs to feed his kids.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had the pleasure of going to the premiere of this movie at the historic RKO Theaters in Hollywood back in the late 80's. I have long been a fan of the book series (I was a teenager when I read it) and this film is a classic and very memorable.  This movie was directed by Sidney Lumet who had a lot of hits during the 50s and 60s, including The Graduate, Being There, and Vertigo, so I knew it would be good.  The cast of characters were all interesting and the plot was very well written. It is interesting to see how much was borrowed from the book and how much it was written by the director and his production staff.  It's a shame this movie didn't get made at some point because this is a great film and I would love to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's good for a laugh, I got it in the summer of 1993 when I was living in a small town in Vermont.   What it does is it's just funny.  You don't have to be much of a comedy fan to know what's funny, but if you have a bit of a sense of humor, you will find this pretty funny. That said, some parts are so over the top it doesn't really hold up.  It just makes you laugh a couple of times and then you're like, "Whoa, that's pretty lame."   The guy's name was Eric. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was good, but just not worth the $18.95 that they charged for it.   They really should have had a better script and made more of a movie out of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a bad example of the way people try to make a living in the porn industry. They have absolutely NO clue about what they are doing.   They have no idea what they want or what a "proper" porn movie should be. The sex scenes were lame and there were scenes that just made no sense.  The director does not give a damn about what his actors are doing and will tell them to do anything he wants and he will have someone else play the part.  This is just bad filmmaking.  These actors really shouldn't be in porn in the first place, if they were acting it would be a lot better.  They were also not very talented in the acting departments.  A little talent and they would have been a better movie.  I wish they would cast someone that can act like a real porn star instead of these actors.  At the end of the day, the actors who are in this movie have a hard time actually acting and it is hard to take it seriously.  All of them are horrible.  If you think this movie is funny, you should not watch it.  For every good scene they have, they have 3 to 5 other scenes where they are just doing a bunch of bad stuff to each other.  That is all the sex in the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first film i saw this movie was at the theater i worked at.  It had me completely turned on, and the sex scenes were fantastic.   I think this movie is awesome,   because of how sexy and dirty it looks and the amount of detail that went into making this movie.     After watching the first couple of minutes,  i think i wanted to be a part of this movie and get caught doing some dirty stuff.  I thought it was so hot.  If you are looking for a good hard fucking movie you need to check this one out.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is not bad, but it is not amazing either. The story of the first half is ok, I think it can be improved by an explanation of where he lives, but overall it would have been better if the director had shown some love to his native land. The movie is not interesting at all and does not bring anything exciting to the table, like the French New Wave films. This is not a good movie, at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love this movie and it's just a really fun movie, but not the best.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first two or three hours are pretty much non-stop action, then after the first hour or so we get some decent character development. By the time the third hour rolls around, all the characters are basically dead, so it's a bit of a slog to get through it. If you like action and want a good story, try the better film on the list.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only redeeming quality about this movie is that it's fun. The actors have fun in this one, as do the actresses, and if you can find a copy, you should definitely see it.   This was one of the better ones for the '80s. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie when it came out in 1994. In case you don't know, this is a horror flick, with lots of blood and gore. The movie is set in a small Texas town, with people in a diner. A young man is attacked by a man in a clown suit, and then stabbed in the head by the killer. Then, in the next scene, a man dressed as a witch gets into the bar, pulls off her hood, and kills the bartender in a different outfit. After that, everyone just kind of looks at each other for a bit, as if to say "Whoa. Did they just do that?" The killer was never caught, and the killer/witch/diner-dweller was never identified.   This movie is an absolute joke. There is no way that it is remotely believable that someone would dress up as a woman, pull off her mask, and murder people. And you have to wonder: How much of the plot of the movie was based on real people, and how much was just made up for shock value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I hate to be the one to tell you this, but this movie is a joke. It's a terrible joke.   For a movie called 'The Wedding', it should have a happy ending. Instead, they make it a terrible comedy.  It takes place after the wedding, in the house of a very rich guy who lives in the mansion.  There's a horrible accident and the wife of the dead guy, is so upset and the couple decides to get divorced.  This isn't really what happened.  The wife of a poor man is married off to the rich man, and is told that she needs to clean out the mansion and sell it. So, she does that, and all of her belongings and furniture are stolen.  That's not what happened either.  After the guy dies, the rich woman has to pay her back a few thousand dollars in damages.  When the rich wife asks why her stuff is gone, she gets a sarcastic response and says "I'm tired of taking it back."  It's an interesting premise, but then they go on to make this poor woman be a victim for the rest of the film.  They tried to make it seem like they are victims.  But, there's a lot of people that are going to look at this movie and say that that was one of the most depressing things I've ever seen.  I don't think I would even call it a comedy and not a horror.  No one seems to be in a good mood in this movie.  Even when the wife's daughter starts to be sick, she doesn't seem in a happy mood, she's all sick and upset.  Also, this movie just doesn't make any sense.  In the beginning they are telling us that it's a good time to be married, and then they start to tell us that the husband died before the wedding.  Then they have to spend more money on this wedding than they ever did for a real wedding.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a very good movie and not as bad as the box office said. This film is just a very bad movie with too many bad choices.   The main actors should have known better than to do a movie with no money.  For a movie about the war in Vietnam and a big movie they should have done something a little different. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was alright at first, but then I realized that there were some minor and major flaws with it. There are a few major flaws, mainly a bad performance by Christopher Walken. This movie was made in the 50s and was actually made in Europe, but the European film producers of this time just didn't have the budget to produce movies of this type. The music in this movie is just terrible, especially the famous "Kicking and Screaming" music. The acting was horrible in this film. The actors didn't even appear to be acting, it was just them screaming at each other. It was awful. I had to laugh so hard, my nose would hurt after watching this movie.   This movie has an annoying voice over that just keeps repeating and repeating. If you are watching this for the screaming then you are in the wrong movie. The dialogue in this was also annoying. In this movie you will hear about people having sex in the forest and the movie makers made this movie so terrible that there was no sex in this one! There is no sex on this movie at all, so why did they make it so bad! If you want to see the sex scene in the movie, it's on another movie called "Lords of Dogtown" which you can get from Amazon, it has that sex scene and it's much better than this one.  Another thing that I don't like about this movie, is that it doesn't have any humor at all. Most of the humor in this is made up of nothing but screaming and screaming. This isn't a comedy movie, if it was a comedy it wouldn't be as bad, but it is just a bad comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an "action movie" that has nothing to do with what it claims to be. The fight scenes are not impressive at all and do not contain any interesting camera angles, special effects or stunt work. It is just the same old same old that is out of its prime, old style and full of faults. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very poor movie. This is the movie I always wished was made, it was good back then. There was so much more happening that would have been made a great movie today. It doesn't live up to the rest of the series it is based on.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was just an average to mediocre movie.   The acting and writing was really terrible, and the plot wasn't very creative.  The plot was so generic that it doesn't even matter how much the movie sucked at all.  There were too many things in the movie that didn't make any sense, and most of the plot lines were very confusing.  It was a real chore to sit through this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad things:  They had to put a fucking shark in the movie.  They don't make a fucking movie without making a shark.  The only thing the shark does is walk around the ocean and eat things and look like a fucking dumbass.   There was an actual movie about that in the 80s and they never released it.  I guess they wanted to be able to use the shark as a weapon in the movies.  No real sharks in the ocean.  If there was a real shark, it would have been on display at the movies instead of being there to be eaten.  This was a movie about the movie that didn't exist.  One of the characters in the trailer looks just like Arnold Schwarzenegger.  And if you saw this movie, then you'd know what the actual story is.  There were no real sharks.  Even if there was, that wouldn't have been a reason to put an actual shark in it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a horrible movie. The people in this movie are disgusting. It's like the first half of the movie was filmed on a low budget.   I think there should be a disclaimer on these kind of movies.  The people are really sick and gross. They were really rude to the director when he was giving a preview. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is NOT a good movie and definitely not a good remake. The story is boring, and the acting is terrible. They did NOT even try to use the "original" cast. The only original cast member was Michael Jai White, who had nothing to do in this movie.   The original film is a classic, and they totally messed it up.  The whole movie looks like it was filmed in the 70s, and it is just a mess of bad actors and crappy special effects.  This was a great film in the 1970s, but this remake makes it look like crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It would be a better movie if they got rid of the boring dialogue and put some good stuff in it. It really doesn't get any better than this. The film is really not worth seeing, but it is worth watching for the dialogue, which is good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film takes a lot of liberties with the original series, so the original cast is all over it. That's fine if you want to watch it as a sequel, but the movie tries to be a direct sequel to Star Wars and it really falls flat.   It does give you the basic premise of the story, but it's a long stretch that goes nowhere and the action sequences in the movie are really cheap. The effects are all over the place, and the film doesn't feel like an official sequel to anything.  I wouldn't say this movie is bad, but I would definitely look for another Star Wars movie if you're into that kind of thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie. The writing is great, the acting is great and the story was quite enjoyable. The movie isn't very good. The acting is very poor, and the movie takes many liberties with reality and with fiction. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see this movie on my cousin's birthday and it made me sick. The director never really understood what the movie was supposed to be and just made it more pretentious. This movie has terrible acting and acting was never even good at this point. It has a very boring story and it didn't add anything to the movie and only made it sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was so excited to see this movie when it came out that I went out of town to see it and didn't get home for a week. I didn't even see it on release and I'm really disappointed that I didn' buy the DVDs that I wanted. The story was just horrible and the acting was terrible. I was pretty sure it was a parody of the 70s "Hobo" movies but this movie took the original style of those bad movies and made it even worse. I guess this is the new "Crapo" movies and if you like the old "Hobos" movies this is pretty good. This movie is very uninteresting and I didn't enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After having watched a handful of great, action packed movies (including the best movie of the decade, The Bourne Identity), I was very excited to get my hands on a movie that took place during WWI.  I thought this was going to be a great film because it was set during the Great War and they had been very careful to not make the movie all military.  The only thing I disliked was that the soldiers were portrayed as the bad guys so much so that they made it seem as if they were the aggressors, not the others.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is predictable and ridiculous. The characters and story aren't interesting. I wouldn't give this movie more than a "two-star" rating if I were you.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie i ever saw! The story is just bad and the movie just makes you want to walk out. It has all the characters from the 80's and 90's that i hate and i hate how everyone is there to make a movie to make money, not to make it good or even fun.  I give it zero stars because it is just boring and it made me want to get out of the theater and forget about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember seeing this movie when I was in the 5th grade. It had some really cute girls, which was fun to see as a kid, but the plot sucked. I didn't like it much, I would probably never watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an ugly and unpleasant movie.   If you want to be grossed out by watching a horrible film, this is it.  This movie is a disgrace to human life.  The movie is not even funny.  A sicko like this is just trying to show off his own ignorance.  He claims that "God" doesn't exist.  Even if you don't believe in God, this movie is trying to prove a point.  I thought it was funny that he has this kind of behavior when he is on stage.  It made me laugh.  Don't watch this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had watched this film before in theaters, it was amazing. Unfortunately it was never released on video and has only a brief run at the American Theater in Las Vegas, where I saw it. This is another of those movies that could have been much better than it was.   The movie starts out with a beautiful, romantic scene between a couple that we will never see again. They kiss, then they go into a car and drive off into the sunset. This movie could have gone on and on and had more wonderful, touching, and romantic moments, but it never was that way. I think it is very misleading to make the movie look so romantic and love filled when the entire movie is about them getting a DUI and making a bad decision that could very well ruin their lives.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went to see "Gone With the Wind" when it was first released, and it really shocked me. It didn't shock me in the "I'm sure I'd love to go to this film" way, but in the way I thought the story was dumb. I was not looking forward to this at all. The film was "a little slow" and "dumb". I'm sure that made the audience think that they were going to see a romantic comedy when it really was going to be a love story. I still enjoy seeing a romantic film when I see it, but that doesn't mean I will go see this film again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just bought this. I was expecting a big, heavy, dumb action film. The first act is really, really awesome, with the big action set pieces. The movie then gets a little bogged down with a lot of plot problems that the actors (particularly the women) never seem to be able to solve. There's a lot going on here, but the writing is a little confusing. When things are happening in a scene, you can see that there's a big plan going on behind the scenes, but it's never made clear what is happening. And even when the actors are playing the scenes well, the plot seems to have a mind of its own. I can't say this was an original idea, but that the movie never seems to be trying to find its own identity.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete train wreck and I really didn't want to watch it. The acting is terrible (even worse than in   ) and the plot is so dumb and over the top.   It has the worst voice acting and acting in a film has always been something I can't stand.  I feel like this movie has been filmed a million times with all kinds of actors and that they were all just trying to make a quick buck.  They spent all their money on the stupid music video (if you want a good soundtrack you should have stayed away from this movie) and spent way too much money on wardrobe and special effects.  The best acting in this movie is by the girl on the bench in the pool.  It's actually her who breaks up the fight between the two guys.  This is also the worst film I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have been waiting for a long time to see a movie like this.   I just read that it was the longest running TV show ever.  It was on for three years and then the show was cancelled.  I am a huge fan of old television shows, so that makes me feel pretty good about the movie.  It looks like it was filmed in the late 50's or early 60's.  The only thing that bothers me are the bad acting, and the nudity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most expensive film in history. I was in a theater and someone in front of me asked "How is this possible that it costs more than The Godfather?" So it's not for people who are rich. If you know about movies like The Godson and that "The Godfather" trilogy is the most expensive movie ever made, you know this is really bad.  The story is like "Twilight Zone" meets "The Devil's Advocate". This is like a parody of a film like "The Wild Party".   This film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola.   It has everything that people like to hate about the movies they love. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The badness does not really start to seep in until about half way through this movie. There is a scene at the beginning where we see some of the students practicing an acrobatic maneuver. They are all in tights with little pads under their eyes. I did not care for this scene at all. It was like they were just jumping on someone's back and they were not wearing tights or pads. They were jumping in tugs-of-war without tights. The first bad scene was when the lead character goes to his brother's house to watch TV. There he runs into his brother and has to go to his room to change his clothes. He takes off his shirt and has a hot towel wrapped around his head. I couldn't understand what he was trying to do. In the next scene we see him in the shower and he is still wrapped in the towel. Then he is in the same spot a couple of times and is still in the blanket. The whole time he is wearing that blanket. Then his father comes and says to him "Where is my son?" and he says "He's in the attic". This was supposed to be funny to a child and it was not funny to me.   It was not until the last 10 minutes of the movie that they got some good material together. The bad and the silly parts of this movie finally made a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is completely uninspiring, with poor acting and dialogue. The plot consists of two men, in an office with the man on the left talking about "the best thing he ever did," and the man behind him talking about his "worst nightmare". The entire plot is just "this guy did this, this guy did that, this man made an enemy, and blah blah blah" and there's nothing that really sets this movie apart from the rest of the genre.   All that I can say about the acting is that most of the characters look like they are trying too hard and it is very hard to believe that they are talking about the same people that we see in everyday life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this film at a theater with my friend I was instantly hooked. He had only seen it once previously and after seeing the poster for it I was sold. The opening credits are great and the first 15 minutes are absolutely fantastic. The acting is top notch and the story is really quite good. The way they do it is by starting in a school and showing all of the people that work there. At first the film seems to be just some kids at a school, but when they finally reveal their true nature, they become one of the most disturbing films I've seen in a long time.   The way that these kids are so brainwashed by the cult that's been in control of them for so long is incredible. It's almost as if there are hundreds of these people all over the country and they have been working their way into all of our schools and communities.  The cult members have used a combination of sex, drugs and violence to gain the obedience of the kids that are brainwashed into believing that the cult has come to save them.  I love this film and the cast is excellent. When I watched the trailer I was worried that it wasn't going to be good but I've really enjoyed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well I don't really like this movie. It was made in 1970 and was directed by Fred Zinnemann and it was supposed to be a movie with a good sex scene. Well I guess if it was good enough to make it to the silver screen, it was bad enough to be made into this crappy video. The sex scene is pretty boring and I did not like the lead actress (who looks a lot like a porno star or something) at all. The plot was pretty boring as well. It's about an old man who goes to Florida to see his wife and he meets a girl (who I'm guessing was a pornstar?) and she takes him to her mansion. This makes him angry because she has given him his last penny. Well he takes the money and they have sex. Then he tells the girl that he had been looking for her for years and she never answered his calls. Then she disappears and he doesn't see her again. He gets sick of living in this house with this girl and he moves out. He ends up finding out that she had been having an affair with someone else and this new guy is a doctor (who is supposed to look like the old man) and he's trying to kill her and kill the old guy as well and kill them all.   The music is very bad and I can't remember it off the top of my head. The acting was so bad that the only part I can remember was the girl's husband. There is no chemistry between the actors and I found it annoying. It made me think this movie was not made for the silver screens. It really is a shame because the movie was supposed the be a porn movie and I really think it should have been made into a much better movie (I know Fred Zunnemann had a lot of films made) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a sad, sad film.   The story is lame and the acting is awful.  You really get the feeling that there was no talent involved.  The film is a real chore to watch, as there are more scenes with the same acting that don't add anything to the story.  They are all the same person talking the same lines in different situations and the pacing of the film is so horrible that it is hard to stay engaged.  It feels like they had to cut it so that they could fit the running time into a movie and that they didn't want anyone else to see it.  Even when it does focus on a new character, it feels like the old one just came back to the show.  To add insult to injury, the film ends up not making sense and you would think that this is a movie that could be set on the Titanic, but instead it is on an old submarine in the middle of the ocean.  I gave it a 5 and I would have given a 1-3, but the fact that the whole film feels like crap is too much to bear. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It would've been better if they just didn't use the main character at all.  He has nothing going on for him in this movie.  I would've preferred a more interesting character.   I found it to be pretty slow paced but still interesting.  They tried a few different things with this movie and ended up with something that was interesting and good.  The acting was good and well-done.  It wasn't really my cup of tea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I guess this movie is more of a guilty pleasure. I'm a huge fan of "Fargo" and "True Detective" but this movie was so bad it was laughable. The acting was terrible and the script was just lame. The plot was very amateurish and I'm sure some of the actors had a really hard time trying to sell their scenes. It was also very predictable. It wasn't exciting, it was just sad. - July 11, 2014I wish "True" would have gotten a chance to prove that it can still pull off an action-horror movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have been a big fan of James Bond movies for many years now. I loved Casino Royale, and even the older movies with Ian Fleming. This movie does not live up to the expectations that I have of Bond movies.   This is the worst James Bond film I have ever seen. Not only does this movie lack any of the charm or coolness that I remembered from the original movies, but it is also a completely boring and predictable plot.  I do not understand how Ian Fleming can think that a movie like this is going to make money.  The actors do not even try to sell the story.  This movie is an exercise in bad acting and lame plotting.  My only reason for watching this movie was because I had seen the older James Bond films (Casino Royale and From Russia with Love ). I remember I was really looking forward to watching this, because I thought that this one was going to be a lot better than those earlier films. Unfortunately, it does not match up to those older films at all.  As far as the action is concerned, it is a big disappointment. I liked the first film, but they have completely taken it from me with this movie.  Ian Fleming did a fantastic job writing this film, so much so that I was excited for it. Unfortunately it is nothing more than an average spy movie that never even manages to capture the charm and coolness of the original James Bond books or films.  Even the music does not seem to be up to Bond's standards either. I guess that is what people who read a lot of spy fiction think of when they see Bond movies: They are boring and bland.  For all that it is worth, this is an extremely dull movie that I would not recommend to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie that is so bad it is funny: a bunch of people in a car make a trip to the beach. On the way they run out of gas. They decide to spend the night in the beach house, but they have all kinds of fun: they run over a cat, they go swimming, they play in the pool, they smoke pot, they pee in the ocean. A couple of the guys sleep in the car and when they wake up the next day they find a bag of daffodils. (The movie was made in the 1950's and not in the 2000's, so there are a lot of funny looking pictures and it is just a real shame the story doesn't work.)   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this on Netflix and it made me feel bad. I feel like the actors were all over the place, with the best looking actor being a guy in a hat. And it is just a comedy. There was no emotion or any real drama that was done in this film. It was just a goof and not even funny at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was decent and the acting was better than most movies I've seen.   But there is no plot.  It's just a movie with an acting style.  I've never heard of this person or this movie.    This was a ripoff of a popular movie that never was and never will be made.  A friend saw it at the movies and I watched it once. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked this movie a lot. The story is really good and interesting and it was well directed with some great special effects, but the acting was a real letdown for me. Some of the actors have no clue what to do or say, others do not seem to understand how to act. The actors did not appear to have a good grasp on the movie and they made some of the most hilarious and unbelievable mistakes, but they were just too far off base to believe. There are no laughs to be had for me in this one. I would recommend the movie to anyone who likes sci-fi and action, but I would also recommend watching it in 2D if you have not seen it before, because otherwise you will not be able to follow what is going on.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this film for my 13 year old daughter to see. This film was awful and completely ruined our childhood memories. This movie should have never been made. The actors were terrible and they were all terrible. I had to ask her to stop watching this film and that was about it. We all wish we had never seen this film. I wish I could go back and see this film over and over again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When i saw this movie I expected to laugh, but it wasn't funny.   This was just a comedy that happened to have real drama, and i hated it.  The lead actor was really stupid, and it was pretty hard to follow what he was saying.  This movie ruined the careers of many people, and a lot of good actors will never get a chance to work again because of this.  I think it would have been better as a movie with no drama. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie made me very uncomfortable. The acting was very good and they had fun with the characters but i really felt uncomfortable.   I hope they make this movie in the future and if they do make another one they should use different actors because they could not bring me back to the movie even though they were very funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very surprised when I watched this movie. This movie is just a bad imitation of The Crow. The movie is really bad. There are no actors in this movie who look like they were trying to pull off the character that this movie is made of. Most of the cast do not even look like the actors who were in this other movie.   This movie has no plot and no emotion.  I have to give the movie credit. It is one of the only movies that I have seen that I was able to get through all of it.  This is not worth watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a little bit silly. The acting is really cheesy, the camera is way too close to the actors, and the music is pretty annoying. If you're a fan of a certain sort of comedy, this may not be your film. I had to put this in a category with other bad movies.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was disappointed in this movie. The story is unbelievable, I don't understand why the studio went to this extreme. It took them two years to do this movie because they wanted to wait for the right time and the right director. If you are a fan of the original series, you will love this movie but it is really hard to watch. The music is really bad and the actors have no chemistry. If I had not seen the original TV series I would have never understood the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've never seen a better movie at a lower budget than this. They even found time for a few bad effects like that horrible dog being thrown off a cliff and a dog chasing a dog in a small cage.   This is the worst movie i have seen in my life and it really sucks that there are no less than five other bad movies in the 80's  I never saw the 80s before and it was just pure misery  It's like a horror movie with a dog as main character but with more gore and a better plot.  It takes way too long to get where it's going and the actors were just terrible at it.  The dog and dog attack is so unreal to me that when it's over and the dog is running and screaming there is nothing else but my memory.  One of the actors is so much better at it than the others but all the rest look so awkward and weak.  There is no way this movie is worth anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't know what to expect from this movie until i got home from a movie night. The first time I saw it I was pretty disappointed. It was a very strange movie. The only reason I saw this movie is because i needed a good laugh. The comedy was really bad. There is not a funny scene in the entire movie. They were doing the same things for different reasons. The plot was ridiculous. I didn the actors were not very good. It took me a long time to finish it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is just terrible and it is just a bad excuse for a movie. This movie had no chemistry and no character development at all. The two actors had a great idea for a relationship but they never develop it into anything but a joke. The lead guy was very cheesy and the female lead was annoying. This is an un-funny movie and there is no reason you should waste your time watching this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of those movies where they had all the right people in the wrong part of the wrong film. I mean the director, the producer and the actor were all friends (they were all from New York) and they had the film written and rehearsed for three weeks. It was in their home town so no one else was called in to do the filming. The casting was all wrong, the leading man had never worked before and when it finally was all done, it just didn't look right.   If you have never been on the set of a movie, you might think it is a wonderful job to be able to go into someone else's studio and be able do all the stuff they have written for you. There is some of that, but when you are working for an unknown director who doesn't even remember the names of everyone on the crew, it is not going to be that fun.  I guess the problem was that the movie was never really made at the correct time. It had to be shot in the Spring and Summer of 1981. I think they would have liked to put in a little more money and a little less time on it but they just weren't in a position to do it.  They didn't really know what was going to happen so they took a lot of chances. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't think this movie was made for children. The story is stupid and the characters are stupid. The children are supposed to be having fun, but they're just sitting around listening to these people do stupid things.   For some reason, these people think they can be the most talented children in the world. If you don't like this movie, don't waste your time with it, and don't let the poor kids think it is a good idea to act like a bunch of idiots. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is one of those movies that made me want to watch it but never did. It was a terrible film that seemed to be made by two people who did not care enough about the quality of the film to even attempt to put good effort in making it look good. They are clearly not even good directors or they would have gotten rid of most of their cast in the first act and changed the whole structure of the movie and made something better than this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie. This is not a good movie. The only reason that it is even listed is because it's been made into a hit movie in Hollywood. It has a great cast but the acting isn't really there. If you are only watching this movie for the acting then you will be disappointed. If that was the only problem with this movie, it would not be bad. This movie is boring and boring and doesn't have a lot of action. The movie is so bad, it's sad to even watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie, but not as much as the director. I have seen his other movies and thought the director did a nice job and that this was a good movie. Unfortunately this one just isn't up to the same level. The movie is just bad, with a horrible acting and horrible plot. This movie should have never been made.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was too long and there was too much to like.   I really liked the story but there was not enough for me to continue to watch it.  I'm not a big fan of the characters but there were not enough to enjoy them.  The best part about the movie was the music, and that was too short for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The problem with the film is that it tries to have it all in a plot that's never developed. The best scenes are the ones where one character shows off his skills or some sort of plot device comes in and messes with the plot.   I was looking forward to watching this film because I wanted to see a real action/drama film that didn't waste it's time on things like computer graphics and silly costumes.  I really wanted to have a good time with the characters and the action and even had a really good time on my third viewing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is very poorly handled. The characters were very unlikable, with no real character development.   They try to make the audience sympathize with a character, but he is the one who is the villain.  The violence in this movie was extreme. The violence was over the top, and you felt as if you were watching a movie of torture.  This was probably one of the most violent movies I've ever seen.  I've never seen a movie that had so many graphic violence scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this movie so many times it seems as though I watched it yesterday or the day before. The story is really lame and they have no idea how to write dialogue to save themselves from falling into a black hole. The actors are mostly awful, especially the one played by John Dehner. He is always at the wrong place at the right time. This film really is nothing more than a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a bad flick with no sense. All the actors act like total whores. No one does anything convincing.   All the stories in this movie were made up of two to three real stories, that were so similar that we know them from different films, in other genres. It makes the story look much more credible. I am not surprised to see it in this list of the worst movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think it would be much better if they had changed the title, so I'm glad I bought it at a used mall.   This film is a bit silly, and not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know if my mom was watching it or not.  The plot of this movie is a mystery, and the movie takes a while to figure out who is behind all of the trouble.   When the movie finally reveals who's behind it, they're not evil.  They were just kids who thought they could have it all their own way and it ended badly.  I wish the kid actors in this movie were at least better looking than the one they use.  At least they didn't do the whole "sportswear" thing and wear short shorts all the time.  This movie was written by a kid who had the most horrible time growing up, and he's now trying to make it as a writer.  His acting is awful, the writing is terrible, and this movie was a real let down.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In case you haven't seen this movie, I'd suggest watching it from start to finish. The film is well paced, the acting is good, and the film has enough of a plot to keep you guessing. I'm sure many people who will see this movie haven't watched it before, so I'll just let you guys discover the story for yourself.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie, in every sense.   The acting was bad.  They tried to make the movie as long as possible, but it's only a 90 minute short.  There was so much going on that it was impossible to concentrate on any one thing.  No chemistry.  What did they expect to happen?   They're acting was so bad that it's obvious they didn't have any.  The ending was so stupid.  You think they're going to solve the problem by just running away with the girl?  I'd like to watch the movie again, but after seeing it, I will never watch another movie again.  I'm not a big fan of horror films, but this movie is just too much for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this was very boring and it had the same bad acting, no emotion at all. I do not think I will ever watch it again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is nothing good about this movie. The story was not believable at all. And what happened to everyone is not even a little believable.   If you want a bad horror movie, look up the movie in the video store.  I hate to give this rating a 1, but the movie is so bad, it is worth a negative. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was poorly directed, produced and acted. It doesn't even look like it was filmed by professionals and the cinematography is just poor. If I am going to see a movie like this, I don't want to be sitting in a darkened theater in the dark.   I have seen many bad movie like these, but this one was just too much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In order to create some suspense, there was one scene in the first 20 minutes of the movie that was just a montage of shots of the characters and it's just a bunch of "oh they're going to have to get a special order" and a long scene of them sitting in a hotel room with their arms in the air saying no you're going down for a routine examination. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The thing that I didn't like about this movie is that it's a remake of a horror movie from the 80's."    I've seen that movie and it was bad. This movie is the same as a remake. There are a few changes, but it's basically the same story. I'm not sure what they were trying to do with this movie. It's just like a remake, and it looks and sounds the same.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am very disappointed with this movie, it is a mess. The story is about a couple (Bobby and Cindy) that are on a road trip in the back of a car with their dog. Bobby is on the phone and while he's talking on the cellphone, he takes a sip of his drink and the bottle breaks in half. The man that picks them up tells the driver to let them off the highway and let them pass through the town. They did not stop to check out the town, they just made it through the towns gates. I was really hoping this movie would be some sort of a real travelogue, but it just ended up being a generic, bad thriller. The only saving grace of this movie was the actor who played the lead role, Steve McQueen. I don't think he is even worth the watch.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was crap, and the director and writer just went for the cheap laughs.  The film has some decent acting, but that isn't good enough to make up for the horrendous acting of the leads.   My favorite line in the whole movie is one of the two bad guys, "Why don't you go back to your cave, asshole. It's been a few days since your mother and I were wed.  "  The soundtrack was bad as well, and I wouldn't suggest it for the movie as a whole.  I'd suggest watching it with headphones. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is crap. It is also bad in every way possible, and not only that. I can not understand how a movie about a person that wears a dress and makes her way in the world in a sexy way can come out and make me hate her as much as I do. I don't see the world from that character's eyes. I just see her as an object that can be used. She was clearly designed for no reason.    This is one of the most depressing movies I have ever seen. I will never know what kind of person that was and how she became what she did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A big disappointment. I'm not much of a horror guy and this movie falls flat.  The plot isn't interesting or original and it is only a few minutes long. The whole movie is shot in a very weird style and the actors really didn't do their job either.   If you want a short movie to watch on a rainy day you could do a lot worse than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was a mess. The plot was so horrible. It was about the death of a high school football player. His family and friends thought he was having a breakdown. His girlfriend was also missing and he was living with his mother, her brother, his two brothers, his aunt and her daughter. And that's all the movie really was about. So they go to a guy's house, the guy tells them they have to find a man named Dwayne (Kellie Dean) so they can put him out of his misery. And when the kids go to Dwayne's house it seems to be a home from hell.    I just saw this in the drive-in, so the whole thing made no sense.  The acting was all bad. The director, Bob DeWitt was so unprofessional.  I don't think I can ever see this movie again, just because I don`t think it was made with the intention of being watched by anybody but an idiot.  This movie is the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not worth the time and money. The main characters are not interesting, the story is not good, and they do not do any action well. The only reason I watched this is because the plot is so cheesy and so unrealistic.  I wish I never saw this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this and didn't care for it, but I think it was because it was made by someone who thought his idea of a big screen thriller would be better on tv. It was too over the top for the small screen and it made me laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have been watching a lot of horror movies, and this movie was nothing to write home about. The acting was terrible and the movie was very poorly directed and written.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought the acting was really bad. The movie was shot and edited so poorly that it was obvious that not a lot of thought had been put into the shooting and editing of the movie. It was very easy to imagine someone else in this movie and I didn't find it believable that the director had even considered anyone else. I thought that the casting in this was awful. When we first meet our "hero" the actor does not seem like the kind of actor who could have played this part. He was too short, too stocky, and too fat. He is very slow and uncoordinated. He doesn't look like he's in good shape. He's like a really ugly, overweight guy. It didn't fit his image as an actor. The rest of the actors were all so horrible that I could not believe that this movie could have been made. We even get to see the actor who played our "Hero" get shot at in a close up. This isn't a movie that you should see.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a good movie. It has been done better, but it's never been done any better.  For a movie that cost $5,000 and stars an actor with a nice name, this movie is completely unwatchable. The acting is so bad, that the film never gets anything done. I will not recommend this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is my first movie that I saw in about 10 years. It looks great. Very very good. However, the only reason I watched it is because it was on video, so I could review it. I hate to say it but this film has some horrible acting. The acting was just so bad that I felt sick. It's like the actors were filming a movie on a computer monitor. It was the acting that made it a bad film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is about a man, who's wife is having an affair, and the man gets the idea to shoot his wife in the head, and put a picture of her on the wall in his office. He does it, and then the movie ends.   It was boring and not entertaining, and i did not like the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was way too long, way too boring and way too overrated.   A film is never "great" just because it's entertaining and "unique" enough to be "good".   Here we have a movie that had great ideas in the beginning and some interesting concepts but nothing interesting to say about.  There's no actual plot that is compelling or entertaining.  They just use the same old formula of talking, screaming, shooting, etc and end up with a very boring and uninteresting movie.  The music and special effects are really bad and cheap looking and are never used to anything worthwhile.  It's just a collection of recycled, over-produced junk that's a waste of time.  I don't remember any of the characters or their backstories other than some generic "bad guy" that's the reason we're even watching this.  We have the same "villain" constantly getting killed off and then revived.  This film is just a giant excuse for cheap stunts and cheap special effects.  One of the main characters gets eaten by a crocodile (I guess that was the only way they could justify making a movie about a crocodilian being a bad guy?) and then his skeleton is found.  He was dead the whole time but somehow he managed to get resurrected.  Then we have another person who somehow gets revived by getting a knife stuck in him and then he gets a "heart attack" and dies.  No sense of stakes or danger whatsoever and the ending just doesn't make any sense.  For all of these reasons this movie is way too bad to recommend.  So maybe if you can appreciate cheap movie and cheap action and don't mind watching over and over again, then this movie would be pretty good.  If you want a movie where you never get to see much action and where you're constantly annoyed by a repetitive, cheap, boring, plotless script then this isn't the film for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "This was a poor film. They should have shot it at 2 different locations and not bothered to pay that much attention to the acting. The acting wasn't that great either, but it wasn't bad at all. It just didn't have much going for it either." - Christopher H. (Tampa, FL)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is terrible.   I was expecting some good writing and some great acting, but it is just so bad.  If they were making a bad comedy it would be funny, but the director is not funny.  It makes no sense to have all these crazy people, and why do they all want to go to this haunted place.  You get the feeling of a nightmare you had in school.  Even if the characters are not terrible, they are all boring.  And they are just a bunch of people who do not have a good grasp on what is going on.  This is not a good movie.  I would never recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't very good. It's like when you watch a movie and you're annoyed by it. It is so bad that you want to turn off the tv and then you think about how you could have done something better with it. The acting is like it's a 2 year old trying to be a child, and they seem so eager to do this. The story is really bad. It sounds like it was written by someone who wasn't a big fan of science fiction movies. The special effects were really bad and really boring. There's so much going on, and the special effects don't really help that. I would never watch this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want a good action movie where the actors do not need to be able to move like the best of them, then you should try the original Alien (1979) starring Sigourney Weaver. This movie has a great plot, solid acting and action sequences, and a very special heroine. It is also a very entertaining movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like this movie, but I really wanted to hate it.  It was terrible, and I think the director and star were drunk when they wrote it. It was just horrible.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is terrible. The actors are so bad, especially the main character. The movie would have been much better with good acting. The worst part is that the movie had a real life event as the actors used real names of real people, so it should have been made clear. I really had hope for this movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film itself, while not bad, is not good. Not because it's not original. Not as long as its not one of those "classic" sci-fi films that have been done before. Not in the sense that it's trying to be like old sci-fy films. Not even in the way the story is presented in its "dramatic style". It has no originality in those areas and no style of its own. The production, however, is really bad. It was done by a production company in South Africa and it looks like a "canned" film. The acting is horrible, even for the period. This is another one of the movies that shows a South African studio and the production problems.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The problem with this movie is that it was made for a different audience and it doesn't really work for them. The action scenes aren't all that exciting and the storyline is just very simplistic. The ending does nothing for me.    The film is very confusing and the characters don't really mesh at all and the action scenes are too generic. The acting is good but they don't give the right feeling to the characters and the setting is just plain boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is just a straight-up boring action movie. The hero and the girl have the same name and the only fight they have is a couple of minutes in. If this movie had been made with a better script and a different director, I would have enjoyed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A horrible movie from the 70s that would have been better if they didn't use that stupid shot of some guy taking a drink. A guy's head gets blown off and you can see him slowly fall down the stairs. And it's all so cheap looking.   The only decent part of the movie is the ending where the kids have a nice old time, but at this time, this movie is completely unwatchable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie should be banned.   I know it's a film about a boy and his imaginary friend, but this movie is filled with stupid characters and just bad acting from the entire cast.  This would never be worth my time.  I really wanted to like it, but I don't think the actors and actresses can even act.  It's a joke movie, no humor, nothing.  There are no laughs.  The only thing they do is use the kid to get to know a few of the older characters in the movie.  One of the female characters is not even believable.  They take a good kid and make him into an evil monster.  What a waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Losing her mind on the job" This is so sad. She is an actress who just needs a job and needs to get a real job. She seems like a very good person and I hope that this is just a temporary thing and that she will be back to her old self.   The first act is amazing and the second act is just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When i saw this movie i was expecting a classic "buddy cop" movie but i was very disappointed.   There is a lot of yelling and "f*ck off"s, no one talks to each other and it was boring.  I hope that after watching this movie the director will come out with a better movie but in the end, it was just another classic buddy cop movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is awful. If this was a comedy you would laugh and say it was funny, but this is just bad. I thought I was watching an old man get hit by a car in a car accident and then the camera pans around and it's a guy from the audience laughing at him. It is just not funny, the actors look ridiculous. When he is being pulled into the car I thought "I hope that isn't a flashback of the accident. But then the guy looks like the old man in the car accident." I just felt sick. It was just too bad they cut to a different guy with the same laugh.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like, you know, a guy with a heart. And I loved this movie, and it got me thinking about all the bad movie I've seen in my life, all the crap that happens to me. I got through it, but I'm glad I finally watched this one, in which you have a guy who gets up in the morning, and has to get up and do it all again, but he can't get up in time and he dies and that's just wrong.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My husband and I went to see the "Ghostbusters" and this movie. The film itself wasn't bad. However, when we saw this movie, the whole time we were thinking "oh my God, what the hell, these two little boys are acting like idiots." As a father of two little girls, and as a big fan of the classic "Ghostbuster", I felt really bad for them. As a parent, I always feel that I know more about the movies than my children. The kid in this film had some really poor acting skills, and seemed more like he was on the verge of tears throughout the entire film. The other kid seemed a little more like him as well. Both were really annoying. The rest of the "actors" were not at all talented, but they were still good at what they were supposed to be doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this movie a couple times and have yet to realize it was a terrible mistake.   The first half of the film is good enough to be interesting, but it starts to lose steam once the third act starts.  A great movie at its core, but a terrible one.  The actors do what they can, but this movie should have been shot in the 80's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you're looking for a cheap fun horror flick, look elsewhere. This film doesn't hold up on its own. The acting is pretty bad too, and the scares are laughable.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie should have never been made.  The script was a nightmare of lies, distortions and even outright contradictions. The actors are not bad.  But the plot is so flawed that I think I would have had more fun pretending to be the characters in the movie than watching it. The producers should have gone for a more interesting story.   The last thing you see of the movie is the final act. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really wanted to see "I, Claudius" when it was first released. I'm not sure why, but the movie is still not something I'd want to see again.  I've never really been a fan of Hollywood comedies.  "I" was a movie that could have been done with a more dramatic production and even a little more humor.  But a movie like that doesn't work on a major studio.  There are better films that have been made since then.  Even so, the film is really kind of disappointing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been looking for a great horror movie since I was a kid. I was fortunate enough to watch this one at a college theater and now that I think about it, I saw it again in a theater about six months ago.  It is a terrible movie.  The movie was awful. It is so awful that it makes you want to vomit.  Not just vomit, but just throw up.  I mean, not just any vomit, vomit that feels like you are in an open pit and you have no choice but to just vomit. I am so disgusted with it and so ashamed to have watched it.  You would never find anyone who enjoyed it and I would bet there are even worse movies in this series that I have not seen.  This movie does not deserve a single ounce of my time or yours.   It was just so bad and so sad and I am sure if it was a TV movie I would never see it. I could not find anyone in the theaters who liked it either.  But my favorite horror movies are the ones that are not terrible and have a soul.  "Oh, it's a movie about a woman trying to kill her baby. What is so scary about that?"  I am not saying that the baby was not a baby. I will even give this movie credit for the ending where you realize that this was a nightmare and that you probably just watched a nightmare.  So that is the last thing I want to talk about about this movie. I think I will just leave it at this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible. There is no reason for the story to go on for 6 months. This is another Hollywood movie where the actress and actor have not done anything special and the writer has not done a great job. They try to fool us that there is a story but it is a complete waste of time and the actor is bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I heard the reviews about this movie, but I didn't care, since I was very tired after a heavy workout. Then I was watching the movie for my friends, and my buddy said, "Man, I love this movie." Then he mentioned that he has never seen it before. I was like, "WHAT?!" I was also very curious to see it. I also had no idea it was made in the 1950s. I watched the whole thing in about 6 hours, because it wasn't too hard.   The only good thing about this flick is that the main character's dad (I think that's his name, not sure) never gives up on him. He really tries to take care of him. Then, on top of that, it's one of the only movies I've ever seen that shows parents and children bonding, without being mean.  (hide spoiler)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie last summer and thought I was going to hate it. The acting was terrible, the story was terrible and the cinematography was terrible. But after seeing it for a second time I realized that it was a terrible movie.   But it wasn't bad acting.  A woman in a suit was supposed to be an undercover cop investigating drug traffickers.  They had her going into some apartment to meet someone who has information that would help them track down the dealers and they were all dressed in white, but there was no one dressed in the colors they were supposed to and it looked like they were wearing costumes.  The guy who was supposed talk to her looked so dumb.  It was just not a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only movie that i can remember watching with my dad. The only problem is that they are trying to make a big name for themselves.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "good" parts of the movie are the first ones to be interrupted by the horrendous "bad" parts.  It is a film you watch when you're feeling down and want a light flick to cheer you up.  This is not that.  I am not sure if this is just me being too hard on it or if it is just another "bad film" by this director.  He has been known to make bad films but in my opinion, he has become too predictable and predictable with this one.   I just hope his next film is better.  A film you can watch for the characters, the music, the actors and the atmosphere but never watch for any of the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie sucked. I liked that they did not do a great job at trying to make it like a "Hollywood-type" movie, but I think they took this kind of movie too seriously. The "plot" was kind of strange, too; the kids went back in time and had to fight a monster, but the film showed that they didn't really defeat the monster.  The effects were really bad, but it didn't make the movie look bad at all.   This is a very "kids" movie; the whole movie is mostly kids, with a few adults. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's really no excuse to waste your time watching a bad Movie.  The plot is completely off and there's no real story. The characters are nothing but stereotypes and you can tell they didn't even try. They are all just so awkward and the actor is so bad it's actually sad how bad they are.   The director had no idea how to make a good movie.  I never seen so many of these actors playing the same character.  I just hope he never has to do this again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a terrible movie and it is a disappointment for all the other amazing movies it is supposed to be based on.  The actors all have bad performances. They do not look like any one in the real world.     I give it 3 stars.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     It's like someone at Paramount or the studio did not have the sense to hire anyone else to direct this movie. A movie that is a poor representation of the character, and the story being told. I can see why people like this movie, but I will not waste my time watching this movie again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very bad movie   The movie is called "The Exorcist", and it is a movie with lots of blood and violence. The actors are very bad, and I don't know if it's the director's fault. When I saw the movie for the first time, I thought the picture was so horrible I didn't think the actors would be able to act. However, they were not terrible, and some of the actors have acted really well in their later movies. I think the director should have used better actors. I am just sad the film is only rated R, because it was very well made and worth seeing. It is a bad film, but it's a very good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a LOT of potential in this movie.    There is a lot of potential and the acting is alright.    The story is a little convoluted but at least it isn't stupid.  This is a good movie, and I highly recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I got this movie for the first time. I was told about it and thought it was going to be a comedy. Not so. The acting in this movie is horrible. They're all really horrible and even the ones that you actually remember aren't funny at all. They should have gone with the ones with a few really funny roles, which was the original script. The story is really terrible. They spend so much time trying to make it real and believable and they end up making it look like a cartoon movie. This movie is all about the laughs and that's not funny at any time. The ending was just bad. I can't believe it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A dull and boring film. I really liked it though, but I don't see why people liked it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When i saw this movie i had to see it since my girlfriend is a big fan of it so we had to watch it. The movie had a funny story to it but was just a bit too long to really enjoy it.   Overall, it is a fun flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible movie. Its not great but it is just a terrible flick. Not the best one but it has something to it. I guess it is a comedy but it doesn't really make sense. I can understand why it is so funny but I just can't stand it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing but trashy trash.  All the girls are in B movies  This is so embarrassing to see.  I guess the producer got sick and went to a mental hospital.    The director is terrible and the actors are horrible.  The music is just terrible.  They should be more creative, but don't tell me about a great story, I've heard better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is based on a short story written by Arthur Kippenheimer (1908-1974) and his wife, Dorothy.   Both Arthur and Dorothy Kippenstein were active in the Women's League and are remembered as being some of the more articulate advocates for women's rights in that era.  The story concerns a group of women who travel to Mexico to find a missing brother, a man they believe was murdered.  As they begin to investigate, they learn that the brother is a drug runner who had been shot, his body dumped on a city street, and his head put in a vat of acid.  At the end of the movie, we discover that the two were part of a secret society that was set up by a wealthy family to hide the truth about the brother's disappearance.  However, at the end, the story is told from the point of view of the brothers (a boy and a girl) who had lost their mother, the entire family (except for the father and older brother), and their home.  Despite the film's theme of secrecy and murder, it lacks any real tension or tension.  While there are some moments of tension, none of the characters are particularly interesting or engaging.  It is also rather repetitive.  Unfortunately, the film is so poor that the director has little to gain by showing the film except, perhaps, the money from the sales of the DVD.  All this said, if you really like the Kippens and have read a couple of Arthur K. Kippenerms, this could be a good movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie made me angry.  My wife is a former nurse and I had asked her what was wrong with her. She said that she got a cold from seeing it and the movie was making her think that it was her illness.   The movie does not make me want to take my daughter to see it.  It makes me angry that this can happen at any age in America.        
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so bad it's actually entertaining, I got into this movie after seeing other crappy movies like "The Big Fat Gypsy Wedding"   There was a guy in the movie and I'm pretty sure he was a gay man, but when the camera zoomed out he was wearing a costume, the guy looked like a mannequin, it was a ridiculous movie but it wasn't bad enough to not watch it, but if you do not want to watch a film like this, just remember this was made in 1993, it has some good performances but the story is terrible, it's based on a book of the same name which is about a gypsy, but it was poorly made and the guy in it was not in the gypsy part at all, it is a bad acting performance.   The movie has one of the worst actors I've ever seen in a movie, this is because the film was not well made, the actor was a terrible actor.  The plot is ridiculous, I mean even if you didn't know anything about gypsies, you would think this would be a funny movie, but the characters were so stupid you couldn't take it seriously,   And this movie is one of my all time favorites, it isn't even funny, but at least it doesn't have a bad ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't like to watch movies. I like to relax. I also hate to waste money. So, I decided to see the movie 'I'm a Zombie.' After reading many positive reviews, I bought the ticket and thought I'd give it a try. As soon as I saw the title, it got me. I couldn't see how anyone could enjoy this film. The acting was laughable. It was like the actors went into the roles to just play themselves. The only character who was believable was the zombie. And the acting in the movie was terrible. If you want to watch a comedy, watch the original 'Zombieland.'   This movie is just a mess. And if you want a comedy then see a movie like 'Zombeld.' 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "Gangster Squad" is the best movie to ever star Michael Jackson. I had so many things I wanted to see. I love the way he's acting in this movie. He plays the role perfectly and it's really funny and has a lot of action and violence. The way the director put it together is genius. It really makes you laugh and the soundtrack is amazing and the actors all really are great.   I really wanted to watch this movie all the way through, and it was so good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed with this movie.  My brother and I spent a weekend watching the movie and he had a lot of fun.  The story is good, there's some good acting, and I liked the movie. However, the acting is pretty much non-existent.  As far as the story goes, there were some good jokes in the movie, but I have to admit that I didn't really get into it.  I had seen some movies with these actors, and they always made the same type of joke (not really funny), but this was all I could get out of this movie, and it's not a bad thing, but it's a real let down. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I watched this I was expecting a funny horror film. It doesn't live up to the hype.   The acting was terrible in this film. The actor who plays the guy in the mask only did his lines for about 10 minutes. There were so many times he was completely silent, which I didn't mind at all, but his co-stars were terrible. I hope they don't do this film again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never thought I'd see a scene where a character uses a fork to stab another.  I was disappointed when I realized the guy had the wrong fork.  Even worse, the knife looks like a large kitchen knife.   The characters are very stupid.  It is obvious that everyone in this film is very lazy, not very intelligent and have no idea of the dangers they are in. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a cheap exploitation movie that features a guy who falls into the water and is saved by a girl who doesn't like his looks. The girl goes on a revenge rampage on the guys family and when the guy comes out of the water he has lost his memory.   There is a great deal of sex in this movie and the guys girlfriend is very sexual. The girls boyfriend is in the audience and he makes some great scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this and enjoyed it for a few hours. There was a lot of action and some good acting in it. It had a very cool style to it and I thought it was very unique. The thing that bothered me most was how quickly they rushed the movie to make a profit.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen this film twice now, so obviously I know it's a terrible movie. I also have a high level of expectations for any film that includes Bruce Willis.   Unfortunately this film failed miserably, it's so bad that there were a couple of sequences that made me want to throw it into the trash can, and I have seen it at least ten times and I still can't get past the fact that Bruce Willis is in this movie.  The only thing that kept me going was that my sister, who is an avid movie-goer, enjoyed it so much that she even watched it with her parents, so I suppose I'll just have to wait until she's old enough to appreciate it in the same manner I did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this film in a little theater in West Palm Beach, and it was in the middle of the afternoon.  When the lights went down, I got scared out of my mind.  I was afraid of the dark and everything around me.  The film is extremely violent and disgusting, but is not enough to scare me out of watching the film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   We were looking forward to this movie since we liked the first one. But once we started watching the movie, we couldn't get into it. I thought it would be a great idea to take a group of friends who were in the same boat as us in our late 20's. Unfortunately the movie was just boring and they all felt it and the actors were all in their 20's so they did not know what they were doing. They had to act like they were high, crazy or drunk. The acting and writing was very bad and they were all actors. I feel bad for the actors as they have a tough job and they took it on the chin. The directing was horrible, the editing, and everything. And the script was a mess to say the least. The film was like a movie made for teenagers. It had some great acting but it was too long. I can not believe this film got a theatrical release. I would watch a comedy about high school girls but not this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad movie was so bad that I kept wanting to turn it off before the end.   My husband and I watched it in the theater and in the bathroom while we waited for our food to be delivered to us.  It was absolutely awful.  We kept waiting for the bad guys to do something or say something but they just did nothing.  And to top it off they kept cutting the movie to make it look like the guys had done something wrong.  So no you should not go see this film.  If you're going to watch a movie you shouldn't pay to see something like this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In all honesty, I don't think anyone will enjoy this. The acting is completely inept. I guess they are used to playing in low-budget low-tech movies. The only thing they do right is the music. It is horrible. I think the actors all were over-acting so much they could not carry the parts. If they had any personality in them they would have played a character. The rest of the plot is just stupid. They are in a cave and are supposed to discover a cave man (who has some sort of strange device) who has lost a tooth. Then a strange woman (who is the cave woman's sister) comes to the cave and tells the cave man to find a way to bring his tooth back to her. But then she tells him to bring back the tooth and he does and they have sex. Then the cave people tell the woman to leave him but then they see a strange man (also the cave person's cousin) who is much older than them, who goes into a nearby cave and disappears. They go back into the cave because they are desperate to find the strange man. When they get back to the woman's home, they find out the strange person is the real cave man. Then, the woman tells the men they should take the strange girl back with them. But all of a sudden, one of the men is killed by the cave girl (who happens to be the woman) and the other is going crazy. He starts talking in gibberish and he is really trying to kill her. The others are mad at the cave guy who is trying to cover it up but the women are also crazy. The people come back from the cave, only to find out that all the men are gone and there is no way for them to find their way out of there. So they leave. Then they all go back in. They realize that they were just too stupid to know what to do, so they go back out and find the missing men, only one of whom has a gun. Now they run through the caves looking for some sort if way out, only they get lost in there. Then some giant spider comes up to the side of the cave where they are and kills the people. They try to run back out but the spider kills one of them and the cave men shoot at it and then it disappears. After they try to search for the people, they all fall in the mud and are all covered with worms.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first half of this movie is a lot of fun. It was set in a college, and the characters had a college feel to them, which really helped the plot and the character interactions. The second half of the movie, however, just kind of stops, and they go back to college life and the college life style they had. This is disappointing because it was good fun, and then it just stops for no reason.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was a big fan of the "Tucker and Dale vs. Evil" movie when I was young, but it did not live up to expectations. The actors were all on a different level and the script is pretty lame, but that does not excuse the horrible acting. This film should not have been made!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is terrible, I can't believe anyone would go see it, the acting is horrible, there are no scenes that interest me, the cinematography and music are horrible, it is so hard to understand any of the characters, the dialogue is awful, and there are NO redeeming qualities to the movie, at least not for me.   It is a shame because the director did an awesome job making it a movie, the only things that were bad were the acting and the writing, the director and screenwriter have done an amazing job making this movie, and I hope they do an even better movie with their next project, hopefully that will make up for this horrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has a bad reputation from the very start. When I first saw it, I laughed at the whole stupid joke of the young boy who is in trouble with the bullies. After the first 10 minutes of this movie I realized that this movie is a big joke and the whole movie is to give the audience a feeling of bad taste. After this movie it was time to move on and other good movies like "Stunt Man" and "Bust A Move" are far better movies to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a bad film. It has a few nice moments and some great ones, but there are also some horrible scenes. They just seem to be random and not necessary in the movie.   The script and story are terrible, this is what is supposed to be an action movie and it's not. It is also kind of predictable.  It is a really weird movie. I don't know why people would watch it.  I don´t like how it is cut. I think the guy is supposed  to have a really nice story and I don`t see it because of this one scene.  The acting sucks. The story is really confusing and it takes away from the movie to have this weird scene and I would rather have seen this guy die and be dead in a good way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My mom always used to say, "This movie was made by the bastards from M.A.S.H." Now I'm just glad that's not true.   I don't think the movie was so bad that people should be watching it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie sucks, in all the wrong ways.   It is a boring "good guy" movie about a detective/murderer/cop.  While he's working on his murder case, he runs into a young girl and a police officer, and decides to help them.  The movie spends more time trying to prove he's the killer/good guy than the actual killing.  It makes for an extremely dull movie and I would rather watch a crime show instead of this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not that I don't like horror movies but this movie is just too stupid. It takes a very boring topic and tries to make it scary. What are you, an imbecile?   A story about a serial killer? What a waste of time.   This movie is terrible and really doesn't belong on television.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen this film multiple times. It has a very campy feel. There is so much going on that the movie just drags on for the first 50 minutes. It gets good about 10 minutes in, but then there is not much left.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have only seen this movie twice, but I remember it fondly as the last film of John Huston I saw when I was a kid. I loved the story, the cinematography and the actors. There is something about a movie about three guys playing baseball at the same time. The plot was a little slow and not as compelling as the first two Huston films I saw in my lifetime.  This is an old-fashioned movie that you could easily watch in a long bath.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot has absolutely nothing to do with the story, it makes no sense and I was never really impressed by the acting. The movie takes place over 10 years after a disaster and it shows you the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust. The film is about what happens to a guy after the event. What happened was devastating for the human race but the survivors don't know that. They have trouble concentrating and their senses are impaired. The guy is a photographer and is going to a meeting, he stops to take some photos, but before he can take another, the blast comes. The photographer is killed and his wife is very scared, but he doesn't see any bodies. He takes more photos and then he finds a little boy, and the little boy tells him that he sees many dead bodies all around him. This time, the photographer decides to go and find out the truth, but when he gets there, he finds out that no one is there.   I thought this was another mediocre film that didn't even try to make a decent movie. I never knew what was going on or why the pictures were not there, I guess some director just wanted to make the film look better for a more "edgy" audience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie does not make you want to laugh, but at the end of the day, it will probably make you angry and not laugh.  The characters in this movie are so ridiculous and I couldnt help laughing at their antics.   These actors did not know how to act in this type of film, but they made it look so fun.  In the beginning of the movie, I thought this movie was going to be a parody of horror films. However, after the first act, the film gets a little darker. The story starts off bad, but it gets better from there. This movie is a complete comedy.  This movie, should have never been made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would have never thought of this film as a good horror movie until about half way through. A lot of people liked this movie for being scary. But then I noticed the poor acting and terrible acting that was in this film. I couldn't help but think of the bad acting in the movie "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", and wondered how the studio came up with that movie's poor acting, and bad acting of actors like Michael Jai White, and Fred Kwan, who played the parts of the parents. But in the end, I didn't think it was any better than the movie they made. I think the acting was so bad, that it ruined the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well this was my first "classic" movie (a movie I have yet to watch in it's entirety).  The acting is pretty good.  This movie has no suspense, no atmosphere, no surprises.  It is like watching an old B-movie.  I can understand why it got such great reviews at the time.   However, it was a pretty boring movie.  There is little character development, the romance is predictable, and it really lacks any real suspense.  Also, the "plot" is just plain boring.  The music is okay, and the actors are pretty good for their age.  However this movie really doesn't hold my attention. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is so much that could have been done differently, the film would have been worth at least a 4/5 but it is so bad. It is so badly edited and edited so badly it becomes laughable. When it comes down to it, this is a bad looking and acting movie and even worse acting. It could have had a good story with better writing if it had been written well, but even so I could have seen the movie being more entertaining, but it was very poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What an utter disappointment.  The only reason this movie has an audience is because of its cast (Kellan Lutz, Robert Duvall, Jack Nicholson).  Even though its a classic, its not a great classic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can only imagine the trouble you had getting this movie.   The film's title is a pun, and it doesn't get any better. The character of Paulie was written to sound like a man trying to convince himself that he is the woman of his dreams.  Unfortunately, he doesn't realize that the woman is looking at him like a fool.  It takes many tries before Paulie is able to make up his mind, and even when he does, he's not able to live up to the woman's expectations.  He is the most pathetic character I have ever seen in a film.  There are a few interesting scenes, but they are only fleeting, and are almost too unbelievable for one to believe.  This is a movie that can only appeal to a select few who believe they know what they're doing, but as far as a romance goes, this one just doesn't work.  A sad ending with too much mystery and not enough romance makes for a terrible film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think I have ever seen a film so completely uninspiring. The story of a young man and a dog is intriguing. It is really a film that is just trying too hard. The dog has to be the best part.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        This movie is a complete mess of a movie that is filled with terrible acting, poor directing, and terrible cinematography. The main character, a former FBI agent, plays the bad cop and his partner plays the good cop, but their two teams of investigators are at odds with each other.   They are both trying to prove a crime to the local DA, and one of them is framed by the other for it.  The two investigators find evidence that proves the DA's crime, and the two men are sent to prison to serve their sentences, but while in prison, the man that framed the DA kills the other man and escapes to the other side of the country.  It is really very hard to watch this movie, even with all of the terrible acting.  In this movie you will find out that there is some real talent on the production team, the acting was really terrible, but it is great that they filmed the movie with a lot of detail.  They were going to release this movie on VHS, but due to poor DVD sales the movie was never released in full, but you can still get a copy of this on Amazon.com, and it is a much better movie than most of the other films that the same production company has released over the years.  I do recommend watching this movie with your wife or boyfriend, but be warned, because it is not for children.  Overall, this movie is awful, and I really do recommend that you avoid it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was terrible. There is just one good scene and that scene is a couple scenes into the movie. There are so many other scenes where the actors just look awful.   It was just terrible.  It looks like someone went out of their way to make this movie and it was terrible for it.  This film was supposed to be a big hit but it was so bad.  My friends loved it so I would have to say that it was worth it only if you want to see an acting nightmare. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As mentioned, I enjoyed this film. As a horror fan, I was surprised at the lack of gore (I only remember a bit of blood on the door). But I thought it did an okay job of creating a creepy atmosphere. The actors really do a good job of making me scared.   I wish they made a sequel.  SOME THINGS TO NOTE:  1: The movie is on home video, and it's in black and white. There's some good editing done in it.  2: There's a lot of violence, including blood, teeth, and bone-chilling gurgling. It's hard to watch.  3: It's worth watching the ending, where they try to scare the kid's parents. It doesn't work.  4: This is a pretty old movie (it's a remake of the 1958 movie "Scooby Doo").  5: This movie was made by the same people that did "Sons of Anarchy."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very dull movie.   Very repetitive, and boring.  Very uninteresting characters.  They all seem to have one thing in common: they're all stupid.  You get so many times they're just staring off into space or off into the distance and then when they move to where the monster is, they do nothing to fight it.  It's like they were expecting it to show up and there was nothing they could do to stop it. This isn't a story-line, so how can they not fight it?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a total disaster.  It is a movie with an atrocious plot and poor acting.  The movie was made for one purpose and that is to get on the tv.  I don't believe that Hollywood can do anything right and this movie just does not even try.  This is a complete disaster and I hope that someone who has seen it at the movie theater will give it a bad review because it is so awful.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was an awful movie that had nothing of worth in it. There was no plot, the characters were flat, the acting was horrendous, the music was horrible, the director was unprofessional, the actors were poor.   And why am I even talking about this bad movie?   The actors never showed any effort.  They all stood around, they were never moving, and the script was unreadable.  The director never showed up to any of his movie.  I could write a whole review about how bad this movie was, but I can't think of anything more that I would want to write. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am ashamed to say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting is all over the place, from pathetic to funny. The story is so dumb and it seems like someone wrote it on a drunken night. I hate this movie with every fiber of my being. I have not seen this one since it first came out, but the memories of it will stick with me forever. I was at the cinema the very first time it came out and thought it was just another dumb movie like they all are. If you think it's funny or even good, then go for it. But I really can't recommend it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very average movie. Very disappointing.  It doesn't matter how much it tries to be different, the characters are all just in it for the money, the action is so poorly done it's hard to take it seriously, and the story is just terrible.  The action scenes are just bad and boring.  I'm sorry this is the one I had to give a 1, but it's definitely a bad choice, and I can't help but think of the old film " The Greatest American Hero " with a bad guy named Billy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the trailer and decided to give this movie a go, but as the film progressed, I found myself bored. I'm used to watching good action movies with great performances.   It seemed that most of the action was just as inane as the movie's theme.  Some of the stunts looked like they were made up.  The film's tone doesn't work.  A few scenes had me laughing out loud, others left me cold.  If you're looking for action that will satisfy your appetite for violence, then this film won't be a good choice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very bad movie. Not a joke, or a parody.  It is completely stupid. It was made by people who have no idea about making a movie, about story. There is no story. No plot. No character.   It just has a bunch of characters all speaking at once.  I don't understand how someone would put a movie that is this stupid together.  They don't even have a script.  There is nothing going on.  The voice actors sound like they are just yelling random stuff.  A lot of people complained that it has no soundtrack.  If you want to watch a movie with no soundtrack you need to get a life.  This was a waste of a good script. The movie is just ridiculous.  Some people complained about the voice actors.  They said the voice acting was bad.  This movie had a great script.  The only problem is that the people in the film just had no idea how to make a movie.  All of the characters were just random.  In the movie, these random people are all talking at once and it makes it very difficult to follow the movie.  In the beginning of the movie there is a bunch a characters just walking down the street.  One of the people was talking to his son.  He had a big smile on his face and said he was going to "buy him a new suit".  Then we cut to his wife saying, "I don't think he needs one!"  What did you expect?  She was supposed to be the voice of reason.  You had a lot of different characters talking at the same time.  That makes it hard to follow along.  I just found this movie really hard to listen to.  It was the type of movie that I found the movie producers should have made by themselves.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first heard about the new Rob Zombie movie "Night of the Living Dead", I was really excited to see it since Rob Zombie is one of my favorite horror movie directors (yes, I love Night of the living Dead too!) This was a really interesting film and I can't wait to see more of it. I loved this film but it was really slow paced. I would have liked to see another character introduced, maybe even a more likable one like "The Woman" or "The Girl".   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie a try, and thought it was an interesting idea for a horror film. However, this movie is not worth my time. It's all jump scares and no suspense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first heard the trailer I wasn't really sure if I wanted to see it. Now I've seen the movie and I can say I liked it a lot.  This movie was a fun trip to go through and see the amazing effects of the film.  It was fun to see the creatures of the movie in action.  The special effects in the movie were amazing.  I really loved the scene where the creature was eating his face, and the effects of that were amazing to see.   The movie was really good.  As I said before, it was a great film to see a great creature film like this in.  If you enjoyed this movie I highly recommend checking out The Amazing Colossal Man. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are looking for a good comedy to watch, or for a nice action flick, this is not it. It is just a silly movie that should be forgotten about. It has nothing to do with the world of sports. It does not have much going for it. The acting is pretty lame, the plot is nonsensical, and the special effects are just plain terrible. There are just so many other better action movies out there, and this movie was just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is so bad. It is horrible.   They do not even try with this.  A movie like this can make great, good, fun.  When you think of horror movies, you think something like this will be good. This movie is so wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has been called "filth". "Filth", because there is no story at all. In a few minutes, the actors, with no story, just walk out the door, and just say "Goodbye". This movie is so bad that nobody can say "I liked this movie" or "I didn't like it". There are some good scenes in the movie, but they are out of the way. The music is bad, but it's better than most of the movies made during the "Pornographic Film Era", which was a few years ago. This movie really deserves to be labeled as a "B-Movie" or a "Worst of the worst".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only thing that made the movie interesting to me was the idea of a man in prison with an animal. It could've been done better. It was a great idea though.   I really wish I could give this movie 3 out of 5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is bad. The plot is horrible. The story takes a while to explain why the people of the village are killing one another. The movie does NOT make a good point.   Overall I found this movie a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read a lot of reviews when I was considering this movie for a movie night and I always got this one: 'Worthless, boring, terrible, dumb'. Well this movie, even if its 'bad' (and yes I know it was a $100 million dollar film) is worth a watch, even for a complete moron like me. This film is just one of those rare occasions when I can actually enjoy a bad film.  I found this film to be very dull, not the best acting, but the writing was terrible.  This film could have been great if the director wanted to put the time and effort into it, but unfortunately, the budget wasn't there and the production had too little money and talent to make a decent film. This is the first time I've seen a film from Japan in a while, but I guess it's because Japan really needs to be represented in Hollywood and I'm glad I saw this film, because I love its production and acting and I will never not remember how I felt after seeing this film. A great film, even with a poor script.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a movie that will forever be lost in history.   From the first scene, you know that this is NOT a comedy.  It is so violent and I didn't laugh once.  From one scene to the next, every joke was cranked out, every punch thrown.  I am so disgusted at the amount of rape and violence that took place in this film.  For the sake of the film, I would like to see the girl who was raped at the end of the movie get her rapist executed for what he did to her. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only "good" parts were the final two "spend the night with a good looking, blonde lady" scenes and the "joke" about how you can just pick up any "girl" and have sex with her.    If you have any sense of humor or know anything about psychology at all, it makes sense why people would find the whole thing laughable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie back in 1998 and it was horrible. The story was so bad and so boring that I couldn't watch the movie.   This movie took place in a prison where the prisoners (the inmates) have a contest to see who can survive the longest. This movie was filmed in a crappy looking prison, and the movie only lasted for about an hour and a half. It was a horrible movie, and it really seemed that none of the cast or crew cared.  I'd love to see a remake or a remake of this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are a fan of John Carpenter you are going to love this movie.   The story follows the relationship between a little boy and his grandfather as they both search for their fathers.  The film was an instant classic and it has all the charm that Carpenter is known for.  There is no music in this movie, but the soundtrack and the acting is absolutely amazing.  John Carpenter is a master in the horror genre, but this is his best film yet. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of those rare films that manages to be both silly and scary at the same time.   A story about a woman who finds her husband's lifeless body lying in a swamp is really a story about the loss of a good man, who leaves a life of luxury to die in poverty.  I actually found this movie pretty funny, it has a great cast, and the direction by Michael Curtiz was spot on.  It's also not that difficult to follow the plot, but it's a bit hard to follow what is happening during the "action" scenes.  A must see for fans of campy comedies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at the movies at my friend's house. I liked the movie. I felt sorry for the little boy who is so poor that he can't afford to get his picture taken and doesn't have the money to buy food to eat. It was a sad story and the boy looks so vulnerable. I loved his mom. I think that she really needed someone to love her. She's a woman with a job and money, and she had been through a lot. It's a good thing he had a mom like that.    I guess I should have seen this movie when I was little. I didn't really understand all of the messages in the movie and I didn'd been so brainwashed to think that all black people are dangerous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *The cast is extremely under-developed. Even if they were a part of the same film, it would be impossible to make the characters seem even remotely human. I don't remember any of the actors' names, but I'm sure you could find them with a quick Google search. They have no charisma. I thought it was a pretty bad idea to cast actors from other films and actors in less than stellar movies for the lead roles.   There are no jokes in this movie. It's just a boring, dull plot about how some of these kids become part of some bizarre cult. It is painfully obvious that the creators have never heard of the great movie "Cannibal Holocaust" (which was actually directed by another Canadian).   The film has no plot and is just a series of pictures of people in black clothing, some of which have a very specific face. The actors in this film are all very uninspired and it really shows.  I don`t think it's very good at all, it just seems to be a long, boring, poorly shot, poorly acted, poorly animated and extremely boring and poorly produced film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never heard of this movie before, but my friend had seen it and he was saying how he wanted to see it, and I thought it looked like a fun little movie with a good cast and an interesting plot.  I did enjoy it though, the guy in the movie looked like he was in a movie and he kept looking away and didn't do anything with his role and he seemed like he didn't care. The guy in my friend's version was just really hot though.   Not the best movie ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this was a great movie, but it was way too long. This movie should have been an hour and a half.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie in the theaters when I was in High School and it completely ruined my life. It started with a scene where we see a kid getting kidnapped by a monster in some random forest and the guy in the movie just walks off. At the end of the movie, when the monster is getting ready to kill the kid, there's a great close up of a kid holding on to a tree. So, we all watched a kid being killed by the monster. It was not even close to the scariest movie I have ever seen. I am sure that the guy behind the camera must have gotten some really creepy looks because people would always come up to him and ask what was going on. So I guess the guy was trying to make us watch the monster kill a kid, but the kid would always make it clear that he was going to escape. This is not the kind of movie that I would recommend to anyone, just because it was the worst thing I ever saw.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You've been waiting so long for your big Hollywood release. I've never seen a movie with so many holes in it. This is one of the worst I've seen. I'm glad the people who made this got arrested.   I didn't have the heart to watch this film. The plot is so horrible. The lead actors all had problems, the directing was atrocious and there was no tension at all.  I don't know how they made this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to say, I've never seen a film this bad and even though I didn't know who Paul Feig was at the time, it still made me laugh out loud. The plot was awful. Everyone was just a bit too friendly and too busy having fun to have anything to do with one another. I don't know if it's the script or the directing that made me uncomfortable. I know Paul Feige is a great director and I've seen the films he did but this one just seems off to me.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did not enjoy the movie at all.   The characters were not believable, they acted like a bunch of goofballs, and there were times they looked as though they were about to have a seizure.  The plot was nonsensical and boring.  It was a waste of time.  I would not recommend watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is made to be interesting and entertaining, but it is extremely dull and not worth it. I don't think the actors are bad, but they all don't do well.  I feel like all of the action and fights are completely uninteresting and are not worth a single dime.  It's also obvious that the scriptwriter was only able to think of one good idea that was completely ignored and not used for its entire running time.   This is not worth wasting your time on because it is so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie. Why did you make this?   Hollywood has become the biggest joke of the film industry. There are many good films made every year, but why would you want to watch a bad one?  If you are a person of interest to cinema, you should watch this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was one of the first I saw when I was 14 years old. I saw it on the TV in the family room with my mom and dad, and I remember thinking that this was the film that everyone wanted to see, since it was a pretty good one. However, it got progressively worse and worse from there on. It seemed that the producers and the director never had much faith in the acting abilities of the young actors and actresses, and the ending was downright terrible.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think I love this movie, the cast are good and the plot is interesting, I just wish that they were allowed to tell a real story, and give the audience the chance to develop a character. It really has the potential to be a classic, but the director should let the story and characters develop and not be forced.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is garbage, very old, not funny, horrible acting, and a terrible plot.   The director, Peter Bogdanovich, did not know what to do with this old, tired story.  The entire movie should have been re-edited and put on Youtube.  I feel ashamed of being an American. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love this movie   and   This is a very poor quality movie  The picture is terrible.   It is almost like a 2D movie.  There are lots of mistakes like: the director got drunk and decided to shoot on camera at a wedding.  The camera moves like a cartoon and is very silly.  You have a lot of close-ups of the characters that are very distracting.  It's like the director was just trying to see how much money he could make on this movie.   The acting is atrocious.  I could not understand how people can make this movie so bad.  For a movie that cost $35,000,000 it's a great waste.  My favorite character is the old man who thinks he is in the 1930s and talks like he is from the 1930's.  He is the only one who knows the truth about this movie, and he is the hero.  Unfortunately, the only thing you can do with an old man is watch him get murdered.  And the last scene with him is the worst.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For those who didn't want to watch it (the entire cast and crew except for a couple of extras) just to get a "look at the set" or "look in the director's eyes" kind of film:  For me it was "an average" film with good cinematography, some of the best set-work in recent years, and some great, great moments. If you have a set of blue eyes and are looking to look at someone's eyes then this is a film that should definitely get a look at. If not, it's nothing special.   The film is a great mix of comedy and drama, action and comedy, drama and action. There's a nice mix of action, comedy, romance, drama, and sci-fi/horror.  There were some great special effects in this film, but I don't think it made them all that special. A nice mix for those who don't like the sort of action films that are a bit more tame than what you find today. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is really bad and its really hard to watch with such a bad ending.  The acting was really bad,   the plot was really stupid and   I really hope they make another movie with these actors and do a better job this time.  I also really wish the actor would do a reprise as John Marston, 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad film from the same production company that made the movie "Star Wars" and "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade". They did a poor job at making a story, and the actors did a bad job at being the heroes. They try too hard to make their hero seem like a real "bad guy". When they are in danger, they always act like the bad guys. In fact, in almost all scenes, they actually act like a better version of the bad guy. This movie should never have been made and never should be seen by anyone. It is not worth the time or money to watch this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm disappointed that it's an awful movie. I had so much fun watching this, I'm going to do it again with another character and another film. I have no problems with the director's work, but I was disappointed with this film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The script is terrible and the movie is terrible. I hate to watch it but I can not watch this movie. You have to see it to believe it. It is horrible. If you are a fan of John Cusack, he will do a great job in the role of Larry.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *Dreadful* I had never heard of this movie before I watched it (and I didn't understand the title of it because it was a silent movie). The story was very disorganized and difficult to understand.   I found the actress, Marlene Dietrich, very attractive and had a great figure. However, the film was really bad and I think it is not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible. Its boring and boring, but the actors were acting so bad.   The only good thing about this movie is that the movie was made in 1987, so it's probably been out for awhile.  This is not the worst movie that i have seen, but it's not a very good one either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A few years ago I came across this movie after having seen an obscure flick about a man who kidnaps his sister.   At first glance this movie is about the kidnapping itself.  This movie has the same basic plot, but the quality of the actors is much lower than in the movie.  The plot is a little hard to follow, and the movie does not seem to make much sense.  What I like about this movie (and I think this would be a good film to watch during a cold or rainy day) is that the kidnapping is only one part of the story.  There is a lot going on behind the scenes.  I enjoyed the acting.  All of the leads are quite good, especially the male lead.  However, I felt that most of the other characters were less interesting.  One of the characters was not as interesting as the others, and I found the movie to be a bit uneventful.  The movie was also a little confusing at times.  Another thing that I found difficult to follow was the movie's plot.  It is not clear how the kidnapping plot line was supposed to relate to the murder plot line.  Even the scene in which the family of the girl who is kidnapped attempts to rescue her did not make much of an impact.  In conclusion, this movie does have a lot of potential.  If you want to watch a movie about a kidnapping gone wrong, but don't want to spend time in a movie theater, then this movie may be for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was not excited for this movie as I was really looking forward to it and it had some good potential and a good cast, but unfortunately it was way over my head.   This movie should have been a great flick as it has some great action and some great characters, but it just doesn't work.  The director and the cast are very talented but the plot just was not good and I just couldn't connect with any of the characters at all.  This is really an over priced popcorn movie that had a lot of potential, but sadly it just was a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie is a movie and if you want to make money you have to make some movies like this.   This is a horrible movie and the director should be ashamed of himself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is really bad and so is the author.    I had a good time watching this movie.  I have seen the movie at least 3 times already and they never seem to change anything about it.  It was so bad when it first came out and now people think they are clever with all of their sequels.  The film was all wrong.  They have never been able to get the film right.  This film is based on the book by George R.R. Martin and his publisher (who is a rich woman).  The book and the film are based on a story that the author never wrote down and the author said in an interview that he never saw the film.  A lot of time has passed since the movie was made and it is a lot of work to get this film to where it is.  Also they have never bothered to get any other information about this person that wrote this book.  What happened to that old fashioned respect that people had for the authors?  They are too busy selling out to the money grubbing people at HBO and Universal.  Don't bother going to see this film. You won't get your money's worth.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I just saw it with the kids at my house. They were very excited to see it, and seemed pretty pleased with the movie overall. I guess they are used to watching a lot of movies in the theater as a group. But, it was nice to sit with them and watch it with them, instead of at home. I would definitely not recommend it to someone who hasn't seen it." -L.J. from Florida    Sean was very pleased with this movie: This was a movie I had no idea was in the pipeline. I had heard it was being made for the big screen and I was excited to check it out. When I heard it would be a small studio picture I was a bit concerned, but Sean was pleased with what he saw. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "story" of this movie is so terrible it's unbelievable. They used the old "vampire movie" idea, but instead of having a normal human girl and vampire man, this film has the two main characters, both of whom have dark, demonic, demonic side. Both of the girls are in love with each other, but each has a dark side that they both hide at first. The director, as usual, does a poor job of conveying these two girls' relationship. They had two really interesting and well developed scenes in this film, one of which is where the two girls are playing in the woods and they have to stop and hide in the thick bushes. The vampires are about to catch them. The other girl goes into the woods to hide as well, but when she comes back, the vampires have caught her as well. She's in a really bad spot. It's clear the director is not really happy with his actresses at all, since they seem to be playing these scenes for the camera, and the vampire girls have these really creepy expressions on their faces. This is just such a bad film. The girl's names are very hard to remember, and when we see a character on the poster, we'll instantly wonder who that is. I don't see the appeal of this kind of movie at all. It is so cheap and sloppy. The actors and actresses are really not that good either.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was not expecting much when I started watching this movie.  My friend had given me the movie and he gave me the first few minutes.  But the movie went on in the first 15 minutes and it was so boring.  What I saw was a girl falling in love.  It was the same movie over and over again.  There was no tension, no fight, no suspense.  I could have seen the movie several times to find out how it would end.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A big disappointment.  I loved this movie, but the acting, directing, and script all fell short.  The actors were not great, but they did try.   They acted like real people, not actors trying too hard, it was not good enough.  The story had a nice feel to it, but unfortunately did not keep up with the quality of the movie.  One of the bad things about this movie is the acting and the bad editing, they were all over the place.  They made it seem like all the actors knew each other and were getting along.  This did not happen, at least not in the movie it was suppose to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the film is terrible. The acting is so bad in it that it's hard to believe they did the movie at all. The story is so contrived it's ridiculous. The characters are very stupid and are almost all idiots. Some of them are so annoying that it makes it a total waste of time to watch it. And the ending of the film makes no sense at all, and it ends with a cliff hanger to make people want to see another film. The film is supposed to be about "what if the World War 3 was real". But in the end, we get a huge "What If" ending and all the characters are dead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never heard of this movie before. I was so excited that it was going to be an old school film. The story of a man in a strange city that is full of strange and dangerous people is a cool premise. I love films that tell stories that are not "silly" or "crazy", but real.    I also really enjoy older films that are "real" like the classic David Lynch movies or the great Hitchcock movies.  But the film is so "off the wall" and "weird" that it just ruins the film for me.  It just does not work.  The characters are so weird that I never felt like I was in that world.  I was not scared of this film, but the strange things were very off putting.  There was a man with an axe in a city full of people that had never seen an axe before.  He was supposed to be in a movie that he did not like because it made him look like a "madman" but I found it so off and weird that he seemed to be really "crazy".  But there are so many bizarre moments that it makes this film almost impossible to enjoy.  A man who looks like a very attractive young man in his 40s dressed like a woman is going about his day. He has a mangy dog with a "little" tail that looks like it belongs to a child.  And when he was in the city his dog "puppy" was wearing a dress, but he never saw that, and it was never shown to anyone.  In the film the dog was going crazy and the man said "she" is not in the film at all. He was right.  This was supposed "to be funny" and I had high hopes for it, but it just didn't work. It had me on the edge of my seat but the movie ruined it for me completely.  This film was a huge disappointment to me. For the price of this DVD, it is an interesting film, which is a shame because I really enjoyed it. It is definitely worth buying if you enjoy old films.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm glad I saw this before I made a decision on a movie. This is a movie that really needs to be seen. Not only does the movie get a lot of things wrong, but it makes some obvious mistakes too. The whole thing is written to make it look like a good story and then, well, it isn't. There is some good acting, but no one is really convincing in any of the roles. The writing is bad. And it isn\'t too bad that you have to watch the entire movie to understand what happened. It's really a shame to see this movie when you're trying to see an action movie, because it's not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I heard there was going to be a remake of this classic, I figured it would be pretty terrible but no. It was so much better than I had ever expected it to be.   What's not to like about this movie.  The acting is so much funnier and more realistic than the first one. They really put a real feel of a movie that was filmed in the 80's.  It was also shot on film which made it look like the 70's, but with more color.  What I love about the second film is the soundtrack. The soundtrack is amazing.  There's so many bands that are from the 80s and I love listening to them.  A great song from the soundtrack, and I don't mean the famous "Jungle Boogie" by The Animals.  This song is from the film "The Big Chill."   The plot of this film is interesting.  In the first movie, a kid gets a video camera and starts making these films and they are quite bad.  One of the things I like about the remake is they didn't remake it with kids in it.  We have seen these people before.  I think the actors are great and you really do feel like you're in a 80's movie. The story takes place in the 90's in the desert.  The plot of the movie is like this.  In the first film, a group of people, known as "the desert bandits," capture and then torture a man who was in their tribe.  They torture him and force him to make his own movie. They then release the film onto the internet and it starts getting a lot of publicity.  These people are really cool and really interesting people to watch.  But then the desert starts to freeze over and all the people on the internet are cold.  So they turn to the Internet for help.  When a young boy makes the movie in this remake, you can just tell he was really interested in the story.  And the acting is also much better this time around.    It was nice to see these people who were in the first version in their 80's clothes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went to see this film with my family and was a bit disappointed when I saw the poster. I saw it at a theater and was really excited to go see this movie. I had seen it in the theaters so I didn't think they would mess up the poster and I was wrong. The posters for the movie always look better in the theater.   It's like something out of the 80s. The sound quality is awful.  I was very disappointed in this film and don't think I will be going out to see anything in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to see a good story, you should probably look elsewhere. The acting is horrible and the story is not interesting. A good movie with a bad script.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a re-hash of a movie in the same style, just a slightly improved version.  The only thing new is the action set piece at the end of the movie.   I didn't have too high hopes for this film.  I thought the film had potential.  But I can not believe what I have just seen.  To be honest, the acting in the film is awful.  One thing I must point out, I felt bad for the kids on the set of this movie. I saw them get hit a lot.  It just seems like they are doing something that does not need to be done in this day and age.  My only regret is that I did not watch the movie in a theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I watched this movie, I didn't think it was that bad. I was impressed by some of the things that they showed, as well as the actors. I think I had gotten over the shock factor of the movie, which was pretty much all the stuff they showed.   I was also disappointed with the ending, which I can't say was terribly satisfying.  I'm not sure how the movie ends (or even what it ends with), but I think the ending of this movie is pretty silly. I don't know what to think of this one, and I wasn't very impressed by the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can see that a few people enjoyed this film, but it's just a horrible film.   It has nothing good to say about it.  If it was just a bad horror movie it wouldn't have been bad, but with all the stupid things they do in this film it's a bad film.   They make this film even more bad by putting a bunch of kids in the same film with the same actors.  Why not have them play with each other and not be friends.  You can't just put these kids in one room.  It's just ridiculous.  They put some weird people in this movie.  This is the last horror film I will ever watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The main thing I dislike about this movie is the movie makers attitude toward women and their issues. There is a scene where a guy tries to buy a chick's phone with her money (she does not give it to him even though she is trying to make a sale. Then, a guy comes in and has a very bad reaction to the girl's phone. I do not remember if he said something about her wanting to be raped or something like that but he came in there and tried to sell her phone. He tried to get a free phone with his money. Then they say this is all normal in movies. I really do not think this is a good movie and should not be made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The characters in this movie are all pretty much one-dimensional and not very interesting. The main girl is a complete psychopath who does not seem to have a personality at all and is a very selfish and arrogant person who just wants her friends to be happy and to have fun. There is no chemistry between the girl and the director who is clearly trying to make the audience fall in love with him. The only thing good about the movie is the music in it which is very catchy and makes you feel like you are in the movie. The girl's father is so annoying too which is why he never shows up in the second half of the movie which makes you believe he is only there to make a cheap laugh.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you don't mind a generic PG-13 film, then The Last Days on Mars is a good choice for a lazy summer movie. The script is good, and the production design is really cool, but the effects are very shoddy and the acting isn't very good. Even the soundtrack is pretty bland. I will recommend the movie to fans of The Last Crusade but it is not one of my favorites. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible movie, and the worst part of it is that it is directed by David Ayer, who has an extensive resume of terrible movies. The movie is a glorified, over-produced, poorly scripted, and poorly acted slasher movie that never even makes the pretense of being scary, and it really should have been shot in black and white. As a result, it's really hard to find anything creepy in it. The special effects are laughable at best, and a lot of the violence is so graphic and violent you'd be more concerned about seeing the blood and guts than anything else.  The movie just makes you wish you were the one who had to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is bad, not a good movie but a bad one. I have not seen this movie in a long time but have seen a lot of bad movies in the last few years.   In this movie, the two main actors are not actors. They are just talking over and over, just trying to get people to go. The main actor does not look like a young man. This should be a comedy, the other one could not do it. The movie tries to make people feel sorry for the guys.  It is a movie where two idiots get into an accident and they think that they are going to be alive but in the end, they are both dead.  I would not watch this movie even if it was a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie itself wasn't bad, however it was a little over-the-top and really bad. It's a story of a guy who was a soldier in the war with the Viet Cong. His family is killed, he gets wounded in the arm and gets captured. After some time, he is released and goes back to his village to see how the war is going and is captured by the Vietcong. He is held for a while and then released. He eventually gets married and has kids and moves to a farm in the country. He has some troubles with his wife and she goes off and marries someone else. Eventually, his wife comes back from the wedding. He goes back and goes to the farm and gets a gun and goes out hunting. The war goes on. This movie really didn't take any of its story seriously at all. The actors were bad, the director was bad and the scripts were bad. I didn't really like the movie, but the fact that I had to watch it so many times was the reason I gave it 3 stars.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was terrible. The acting was terrible, and the writing was terrible for being "action." Even if the action wasn't bad (which it wasn't), you have to admit it was bad as a plot. We never learn what is going on. In fact, we never see who is trying to kill whom. It doesn't make sense.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete train wreck and an embarrassment to the genre. The entire movie is like a badly acted play, with everyone playing their role to the best of their ability. And the cast is horrible.  This is the worst acting I have ever seen, and the only thing they all have in common is that they are white.  They all have that southern accent which sounds like a racist knock off of black people, and even when they try to pass themselves off as a group, none of them sound anything close to black, even when a black person is speaking to them.  The writing is the biggest joke of all. It reads like a "dramatization" with many of the same plot points as "Saved" and "Ironside".  The actors all get so out of sync with the action and dialogue, that it makes the movie look really bad.  I watched this movie in the theatre, and it was terrible.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie. I'm not sure if its director is insane or just completely incompetent. I guess he knew nothing about writing movies so he tried to film in 3 locations at once. The only reason the actors were in one place at once is because it was all supposed to be filmed in a day and a half. He filmed in the woods, the road and then a restaurant.  I think he wanted to take advantage of the lack of light. It just looked awful. The movie was just a pile of wasted time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "mature" parts of this film were quite good. There were some great performances, especially by the actors portraying two of the main characters. Unfortunately the acting was a bit much for me, especially for one of the characters, who was in his late 30s and looked far too young for the part. The other characters were rather underdeveloped as well, although some did seem to have some depth to their characters (perhaps just me!). There were a few plot elements that were interesting, but the way in which they were used made me wonder just how much thought went into this film.   I will admit, the acting in this film was pretty good. The chemistry between the two actors portraying the two main characters was strong. There was a lot of action in this picture, but a lot less thought had been put into how it was depicted on the screen. The special effects (and I am sure some of this is computer generated) were certainly nice, and I would have liked to see more of them (especially for one scene, in which the ship went through some really interesting space). I could see why this movie was made, but there is very little enjoyment in this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When this movie was first shown on television, I was excited to see it. But, when I got home, I saw that it was showing on my new channel. The director, Howard Hawks, was already dead, and I found out that the movie was about the same story as "The Man Who Wouldn't Die," but the actors were replaced by extras. I was angry, and then I saw the title.   It wasn't a good film at all. I would never see this movie again, so I recommend to avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is pathetic.   The only two good things about this movie is the great cast and the great casting director.  The other half of the movie is garbage, if you want to watch a movie with poor acting and stupid plot twists and bad dialog then get this one.  There's something about this casting and director that I'm not sure what it is, but they just don't pull off the roles.  I'm just not interested in seeing more.  I saw it on a special at the mall, a couple of weeks before it's theatrical release.  It was not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, this movie is just an excuse for a bad story. The characters are never given enough personality or complexity to make them feel like real people. When the main character has to face a situation that was clearly planned out beforehand by the main villain, it was more than obvious he was already mentally broken, and would never come out of it unscathed.   I can't help but think that a lot of the writing was done on the sly, and that there was no actual plot or reason why the characters would even be involved in what they were involved in.  Also, the music is pretty crappy, it has a really cheesy synth-ish sound that doesn't work for me.  This movie is like a terrible, over the top, poorly written movie with very poor acting. It's really hard to get invested in characters, because the writers obviously know how to make the actors do very little and the only other character who does much of anything is one of the villains. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are so many good scenes in this movie but they're buried in the background.  This is the only time I had trouble listening to the film.   This movie makes me want to have sex with my wife. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is really bad, it's just a lot of bad acting and terrible writing, which are really hard to do well. If you are interested in this film, I would suggest you not watch it, but it is just really bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie itself was pretty bad, with little to nothing of the classic 80s science fiction that made me love the genre so much. Not much of an action movie, the only scenes of action were when they were in space, and even then they were done really slowly. The whole film was really slow, and at times I was really annoyed by it. They had a nice idea with the space suit, but it was done really poorly, and just made me feel like they had made it to the movie set, but in the middle of the desert.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie   starts off   good, however   as the movie goes on it becomes a total disaster.   There is not much to talk about the story but the whole movie  is   about   a guy who was found in the back of a truck and found to be   dead, which makes it   very   sad, which causes the guy to be blamed by other people, who start to   think that he is responsible, and   all   because of that he   is   beaten up   and  to make matters worse, they do not believe his story,   he  cannot be arrested because   the witnesses will not speak   they   say   what happened to him   but he  has a witness, and they go to find this witness,  and in the end we find out that he never really   died, but he is still a victim because of this incident.  I think it is sad that this movie will be remembered for being so sad and it shows how   weak the whole story is, however, it is not as if it is a bad film, but it just needs a lot more work.  This movie is worth watching once, and then watch it again,  but you will not regret it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a classic of the genre.   The story, acting and production value are all outstanding.  There is a "wow" factor to the movie that can't be explained by a single word.  All the actors are great and I am impressed by the production values.  The soundtrack is also very impressive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a film with a great script that should have ended on a high note, but the end was far from it.   There are some things in the film that were a bit too unbelievable to believe, such as the fact that an old man has to stay on his island for more than 70 years.  But the script, screenplay and acting were so bad, that the final product became nothing more than a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought that the plot was silly (with two main characters, one of whom is a girl, and two different women with two different accents, and the guy is a little bit of an idiot), and the acting was a bit off (some of the actors were playing their characters, not acting the part that they were playing).   What made this movie interesting, at least, was the "hilarious" way the director pulled a prank on his audience, at the end of the movie, he took off the soundboard, turned it upside down, and played the movie backwards, as if it was supposed to be a "hint" at some secret messages.   There were many jokes and "outtakes" (from the old film) in the movie that were pretty funny.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most disappointing thing is,   that when the movie was shot in a hotel,  what they showed is not the hotel, but a room where the actors stayed when shooting the movie in a new hotel.   This movie was made to promote the new movies,  and when you watch the movie, you will notice the "filler" or something you will never see on the TV show, or on TV (or film) ever again.  This is an example, in every TV show in the 1980's the writers were talking about their latest film, and would say how great it is, but then they would cut to a movie that was much better, and it would be a very short movie, but with too much plot, and too much action, so that the TV viewers never see it.  The producers and directors of this movie have to be ashamed of themselves because if they put a decent movie into a TV series they can sell the movies, but because they put this movie into their movie, they have to show it on TV for all the people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A horrible movie with awful acting and terrible special effects. I will never watch it again.   It's hard to watch a film with terrible acting and awful special effects like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a very silly movie that has nothing to do with the book or movie and yet it has some similarities to both.   There is a kid named George in this movie who is always fighting and killing everything that moves.  The most interesting aspect of the movie is that the characters are all animals.  At first I thought that the whole movie was about a pet dog or cat who escaped from his kennel and found freedom in the wild.  But then it happened and they all looked like people with different colored skin.  I thought this movie was very silly, but then when the dog finally got captured, it made me laugh out loud and had a good laugh.  There are many movies out there that have been made based on this book, but this was the first movie that I saw where I could say this was made in the 1970's.  It would be really nice if they make a movie where the dog goes back to the kennels where they all lived.  This movie should be a rerun on Animal Planet but it is probably too late for that now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This is really bad.   I really think that it should have been given a different rating, because it is really boring and it is impossible to connect with the main characters.  The film was so stupid that I could not believe that anyone could believe in this film.  I mean, this movie was so boring that I just had to leave it, because even I could find it boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A film that looks really bad when it first comes out. Very short. Very bad acting. Bad acting is never very good.   This is a low budget, amateurish film and is certainly not worth a dime of your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My wife and I watched this movie a few weeks ago and had a good time. The movie is about a couple who have just bought a new home and are looking for a place to move in. They are both very good looking people and they want something in the neighborhood where they will have to move out of a beautiful house they've always loved. But the neighbors don't want anything to do with them. They keep them out of their neighborhood and they have to leave or get out of the house. So they decide to move on and move back to their old place. At one point, they find out they can move back in the house and the neighbors will allow them back in. So it seems the neighbors are all in love with them and won't do anything to them. In this movie, the two go through several arguments with the neighbors. The two eventually end up sleeping together and getting into a fight over the house again. They end up leaving in a cab and then driving back to the old house. They sleep there for a night until the neighbors come to pick them up. When the two guys get back, they realize they made a big mistake by coming back. So the two decide to leave again and this time drive all the way to Los Angeles.   It was very interesting watching this movie. I enjoyed the plot, the acting, and the music.  If you are looking to do something more intense than a movie about two men living together, then this movie is for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie that you can see when you come in from the cold!   If you want a really cold movie, this is the one.   We start out with a guy who is sitting in his car listening to a very odd and terrible song that sounds like it has been pulled from the radio.  Then a cop comes in and asks the guy to step out of the car so that he can do an "autopsy" on him.  The guy gets very nervous and runs off... and leaves the car running, with the key in it.  We then see a police officer in a "hot pursuit" car.  At first the cop drives at a snail's pace...  He takes a left turn, and then an even more unexpected turn.  This turns out to be an old road that we never saw before...  It was dark, and we could barely see.  A strange tree was hanging over it and there was a strange glow on the road.  What looked like a man had his face down on the ground...  When the cop pulled in behind him, he went out to his car to put the car in park...  And the cop drove right over him!  What is it with these people?  The next scene was a cop talking with a couple who had just been run over by the cop.  When he was talking to them he had an eerie feeling and the camera was very close to him...  I am sure they were not going to get any help for this...  We have a police chief who goes to a house, and he finds a woman who appears to be dead.  She is a pretty young girl... but she looks very strange.  I think she might have been a drug addict.  While he is talking to her, it appears that she begins to laugh... so he pulls out a gun and shoots her.  He is told not to tell anyone about this... but this is one guy that has his eye on a very important case...  Then we get into the case, and the cop in the hot pursuit car is the man in the car.     I thought this was a very bizarre movie, but I like it!  I don't like the movie "Fahrenheit 451" but this movie has a bit of a "cult" look to it... and it does have a cult following, I think.  It has some very bizarre scenes... and some of
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The main problem with this movie is that it doesn't work.   Its bad acting and stupid plot make it one of the worst movies  I ever saw.  The worst part is that  the only good thing in the movie is the sex scenes.  A movie that has a lot of sex scenes isn't going to be a hit.  There is no logic to the plot and the actors don't do any of the things they say they are going to do.  No character development.  Nothing really to say about the plot.  It seems like a bunch of people in a house playing dress up.  This movie just doesn't have much to it, but if you want to watch a really bad movie, look at this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For the sake of the story, you can imagine the movie as "Dirty Harry on acid". It was not a bad film. The best action scenes were in the second half, when the story takes a turn for the worse. You will have to be careful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a total waste of time and the actors in it are all total B.S. They look like they are in a crappy film when in reality they are all so fake that it makes it very hard to tell who is acting and who isn't.   Some people are going to give this film a 4, some people are not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There was never a point where I felt like the movie had made any progress on the story it set out to tell.  It was still set in the past, with an almost perfect marriage of science fiction and fairy tales to make for a wonderful story.  Sadly, it was all but destroyed by the horrible acting and poorly written script.  This movie was a very poor imitation of a good film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have never seen a film quite like this one and never thought it could possibly be great. It is absolutely disgusting, not even one i could stomach after that awful "tasting" of its director's blood and the awful script. The acting, if you can even call it that, is just awful, nothing about it is believable. And in terms of acting, it is laughable, even for a movie like this. What a piece of crap it is, so horrible. The script is so bad, so cheesy and so obvious for anyone who knows a thing or two about cinema that you wonder if it was actually written by someone who knows about cinema at all. It reminds me of a film about the Mafia, about how it works. That makes me sick to my stomach.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had heard about this movie through the radio and was looking forward to it. I did not expect it to be this bad. I watched it at my friend's house and got the DVD from his mom and I got it at home and put it on and waited, I could not even wait until the movie was over, I went to my room and had a panic attack because it made me feel so sick and sad all at the same time, I called my mom in the middle of the night and told her what was happening, my heart was so beating so fast, I had to take my car to a buddy's house to get some sleep, my mom said if it ever happens to her she is never letting it happen again. I think the film is so bad that its almost worse than the film itself, the main character is so stupid and so unlikable, and it is almost impossible to root for him. This movie was just too bad to watch. I have never seen a movie like this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't see this movie when it was released, but I did see it on cable a few years ago and really enjoyed it. This movie is so bad that I couldn't care less about it. The actors are totally unmemorable. A real waste of money.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is the worst of the bad ones and was never going to be the same after its run on tv.  This film was made by a kid with a very high IQ who never took responsibility for his mistakes. He got fired from his job and became a junkie.   The script was terrible and there are so many scenes and scenes that should have been cut and he made it worse by never taking the time to write a script.  I had a friend who was a cop and he was in this film so i figured it would be a good movie to watch with him, I saw it again on tv and it was even worse than the first one.  You can tell this guy was in rehab at the time he wrote this crap.  The actors all had horrible acting skills.  In addition, the special effects are horrible and the writing is so cheesy.  If you want to watch a bad film that is not worth your time, watch this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason I watched this movie is because of the movie's trailer which stated it was from the 80's and was a horror film. The movie didn't live up to its hype but I thought it had the potential to be decent if it had a more subtle atmosphere. I just didn't really care for this movie.    I thought the director didn't know how to film the movie. It is just a lot of running around and being chased. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are looking for a fast paced fun action movie this is not the movie for you. The special effects were ok. The stunts were not very well done.    This is a pretty long movie. This movie is really boring and repetitive. It is so bad that you just want to turn the movie off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm glad to be old enough to see this, but it's not what I would have wanted. It's bad, but not as bad as it could have been. There are some good bits, and some bad bits, but overall, the whole thing just doesn't work.   For years, there has been a big debate as to whether or not "Back to the Future" is real, and while some people say it's fictional, I say it really is.  From the looks of it, the movie takes place in the future, so it's actually kind of fun to see Doc Brown and Marty McFly travel into the past and encounter all of their various incarnations.  Unfortunately, the acting is pretty bad. This guy doesn't even have a line! (This is probably why they cast this guy in the first place!) Some of the other characters are annoying, but some of the others are great.  The movie does a great job of telling you what happened to each of the characters, and that's really what the movie was all about.  This movie just had so much potential, but all of the parts just weren't good enough to overcome the bad writing.  Maybe next time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't see this when it was new. I saw it after it was released in Australia (just over a year after it's initial release). I had the best time watching this because I was so into the story and it was such an entertaining movie. It was a fun movie and if you enjoyed the original it's a good way to get back into the action. I didn' t get to see it when it first came out and have heard very little about it but I plan on re-watching it soon. I'm sure it's better than the remake so I'll definitely be watching it in the future.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movies i have ever seen, the plot was stupid and lame, and the acting was ridiculous. i really dont think that i would of given it a second chance and thought that it would be different, but nope, it wasnt. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movies ever made, by a terrible director. The script and actors are terrible, and all of the supporting actors are bad too.   I was so disappointed in this movie, I could not finish it. It was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is bad, you shouldn't watch this one if you haven't seen it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is boring and is a waste of time. I thought it was going to be interesting but the movie is just a long boring scene and no action or anything. The only good thing about this movie is that it was made by the great Stanley Kubrick but I just don't think it's any good.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For a horror movie I saw once, it had a lot of great moments. A nice film to watch and a good movie with an interesting story.   I wish it would be released again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible.  For me this movie was like a train wreck.  The writing is bad and the acting is not worth it.  This is not a good movie at all.  What the heck is that movie called "My Mother's Son"?  The actors in this movie should have been taken off of that movie.   I thought it was a bad idea to bring in all these kids to make this movie.    I hope this movie will get a lot of money for some money makers to make it and if they did this movie would be much better.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't care if its rated M, I'm not going to watch it.   It's a boring movie.  Its pretty bad in every way.  It has no plot.  No dialogue.  I just don't give a crap about this movie. I would rather watch a good movie like The Lost Boys or My Best Friend's Wedding.  My best friend is a movie buff and when she said this movie reminded her of the 80's movies, I knew it was gonna be bad.  Don't watch this movie, it just makes you hate life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's not bad. There is some good acting and good action. The main problem is that it's not a good movie. The plot and dialogue are so bad that it ruins the movie. I would only watch this movie if you like bad movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It's horrible, and it only makes my dislike of it all the more stronger. I was really looking forward to this movie, and I really expected to love it. The actors just don't do anything that they should, and they do it in a really horrible way. And I just can't understand how they were allowed to be in it in the first place, but now, they should be ashamed. I didn't feel the need to buy tickets to this, or watch it, because I didn, and then I found out that it wasn't any good. I don't know if this would have been good if the actors were good, or if it was a cheap cheap movie that just took advantage of those actors and directors to make money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only problem I had with this movie was its plot. I thought it was very stupid, especially since it starts off with such a bad premise. What is the point of an old woman telling her children to get their family out of a dangerous location? That was the whole point of this movie, to get the kids to a safe place so that they can forget about their dad (for real) and be a happy family again. Why not just say that it's a haunted house? That's just the plot of a cheap horror movie and it was all done with no effort at all. I did think they were being a bit dramatic, however. They had to have been at least a few minutes away from the camp because they never seemed to notice it, so what's the point? But this movie just feels as if someone at some point just started throwing ideas at the wall and seeing what would stick.   A movie like this really needs a good director because it just doesn't have one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went to see this movie when I was a young boy. I can see why it would be such a big hit. The movie is about two young people who are in love. They go to a party together and fall in love with each other. I loved the idea of a young man and young woman falling in love together and it is wonderful. There are great performances from both the young man. The young girl in this movie is so innocent and innocent looking. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has an old time feeling. I still have my original copy of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film at a local theater in California. The film started with an attractive woman in a sexy lingerie style outfit sitting in a chair in a seedy bar. She has a man in her lap and a glass of wine. The man has two young women in his lap as well as two young men. The woman and man are talking as they talk. The two women have a conversation that the man is not paying attention to. The women say they are doing what they should have done, the woman and the two men should have married. The conversation seems to be going along well until one of the women turns to the man and says, "I thought you said you wanted to marry this one." The man is taken back. He looks at the woman for a moment. His hand moves toward the woman. She pushes the man away saying, "No, no, no. You can't do this." Then the woman looks at him and says "And I'm telling you you can't get involved with this." The camera zooms in and shows the man running out of the bar. He runs up to the woman who is now naked. The camera shows the woman sitting on the floor with her legs spread. She is on top of him. Her lips are wrapped around his cock. The movie then shows the women kissing and rubbing up against each other. The guy runs up the street with the woman on top. The scene ends with a shot of a naked woman leaning over to kiss a naked man. This was an entertaining movie, but the acting, dialogue, and action were not up to par. The characters were all shallow and shallow characters. There was a lot of nudity, but it was never very attractive. A few scenes, such as the one with the man leaving the bar after getting into a relationship with a prostitute, were actually very funny. A guy had a hard time taking off his jeans as the woman took his cock into her mouth. The only way it would have been better would have had the woman taking it from the other side. The acting by the four actors was all over the place. At times they acted like they had no clue what they were doing. Other times, their character acted like the rest of them. One woman is supposed to be having sex with a man as she talks with him about a new book. The way she walks, the way she smiles, and the way her body moves during sex is all so fake that it could
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an extremely low quality film. I would have rated it an 8, but it's a 5 for quality. I've seen a lot of crappy crap and this is by far the worst of the lot. I never go see low budget films and this was the worst. The actors did very little but acted very stupid. They kept talking and making silly faces, and it was really uncomfortable to watch. One of the female actors has a terrible accent and the male lead looked like a middle aged fool. The director was a loser. He should have gone back to college and studied acting. This film was made for no money and it's just a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very mediocre movie.  The plot was poorly paced, there were too many characters, and most of the movie seemed to take place in the bathroom.  This movie did not make me laugh, and there was very little that happened.   There was a man on trial, and he claimed he was innocent.  He was accused of raping and murdering a woman.  I am not sure why, since he was so sure of himself.  We never saw him in the bathtub, but this is not uncommon for Hollywood movies.  They all have to have a big set up, even though they don't seem to know what they are doing.  It also doesn't seem like the real murder was in the movie. The real murderer, a man named Frank, was never even mentioned.  A lot of the actors did not look like they were in the right place at the right time.  My husband has seen a lot of films, and this was not the best. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked the movie, but it did not have anything for me.   The story was dull.  The actors were not well done.  Some of them were so over the top and not believable.  I hate when actors that are not well read or trained act in a movie.  The movie ended with a really dumb ending.  This movie was for children. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film tries to be something different and interesting. Unfortunately, all the characters have no chemistry and nothing about the story is interesting. If you want to see something different then watch more recent science fiction films like "Snow White and the Huntsman".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is absolutely terrible. A couple of the plot holes (and the acting is horrible) are so bad that they have to be put in parentheses.   The "evil" characters do not seem evil. There is no reason why these people could not have known exactly what they were doing.  And of course, the acting sucks.  This was the worst movie I've ever seen! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very disapointing movie, it was just way too bad and it was really hard to enjoy this movie, i was expecting a much better movie,   i would not re watch this movie again,  it was the worst   this movie is just not worth your money at all,  i just hope the director will work with someone else for a good movie  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see this movie expecting a fun sci-fi movie with the potential to be awesome.  It turned out to be an overrated, boring, clichéd, poorly acted, and poorly written movie that I never liked a single minute of.   It features a lame alien that is very similar to the stupid alien from the movie Alien that was directed by James Cameron.  I was not impressed with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only reason why I didn't give this movie a one or two star rating is because it did not live up to my expectations. It was a cheap movie made to get a ratings rating, but for all the wrong reasons.   I will not watch it again...  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is like watching a TV show without the jokes. The writing, production and acting is terrible, the story is completely made up and the special effects are the worst i ever seen. I hope no one ever watches this movie cause it is not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are going to watch this movie then be prepared to lose your shit over a plot that doesn't hold any water.   A character that has never made an appearance in the series is given a huge part in this movie and it's pretty much a non-entity.  In fact, if they were trying to make this character something that the audience would care about, then they should have just hired a real actress.  They had no idea what to do with him. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a boring, one-dimensional plot. And it's not even a true story - the author claims that he was actually there and he was the main character.   The worst part is, if you are thinking of watching this movie, do yourself a favor and skip it - it's just not worth your time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a total waste of time, and the plotline just makes no sense. The whole thing is just some guy goes on a journey with some weird character he's never met before, and then meets some weird guy who thinks he's some strange character, and so on, and it just ends, like many of these movies do.   This is an awful film with horrible acting, and terrible acting means that there's only so much that the actors can do with what they're given, and there's a definite lack of depth to the characters.  Some of the actors who are featured in this film are actually pretty good actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    SOURCES:  The film is shot on 35mm film, and contains a variety of old and new shots. The movie is a compilation of short, original films shot in the 70s and 80s.   The first film is about a young woman who is trying to escape her abusive father. The second film is a little girl's story of "tiger-nose" hair growing on her head. The third film is of a young girl falling asleep in her bedroom and waking up in her father's house. The final film is based on a true story and follows the story of two men who went on a hunt for the lost city of Atlantis.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After the first time watching this film I had to keep a mental log of every other movie they did with this character that didn't work out.   This was a real train wreck.  It looked cheap, cheap, and the effects were bad.  The acting was really bad as well.  If you can see this movie, I highly recommend not watching it.  This is the worst movie you'll ever see in your life, period. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so boring, so ridiculous and overacted. It also has a retarded ending.   This movie is terrible, like in all good movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a movie which is worth seeing just to be shocked. It should be remembered that most of the people in this movie are not in the movie industry. The reason this is such a good movie is because of the talented cast.   I'm still amazed that this movie can exist. It's just weird as fuck.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was like watching a crappy movie at an awesome club.   A few days ago I saw "Bachelorette", the sequel to "Bachelor Pad" and I was very disappointed. The first movie was great. They changed the girls and made it more of a reality tv show.  "Bach Man" is a complete turn off. It's like watching "The Dating Game" or "Who Wants to Marry an American Woman".   You might as well have watched the "Fifty Shades" movies or any other "reality tv" show.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a waste of time and money. It's almost as if they just picked up a cheap set of rules and then just tried to get a cheap film out of them.  The script is so stupid and the actors so stiff that it's like watching someone else have a go at a bad comedy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was pretty bad. I remember that at first when I watched it I thought that it was really good. It looked like a good action movie. Then after a while I remember thinking, "Man, this guy is a fag" because he was constantly yelling and faking a gun and firing it at people. This movie made me want to punch someone and I remember I threw the DVD at the tv as soon as it ended because the movie was such a waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The bad acting, the bad music, the poor production values, and the bad directing are bad enough, but the actors are terrible.  The actors are not good enough for this movie.    These actors were probably given their first roles at an early age, and are very inexperienced.  They are not actors who can get a laugh.  This was a film that was produced during the "golden age" of Hollywood, but this is clearly not a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really hope they do another one of these movies.   The acting is really poor.  The story is really bad.  It's a waste of everyone's time.  My only real complaint is that the story doesn't change with the cast change.  I have a feeling the cast wouldn't be able to do it because it's such a stupid film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie "Kisses For The Dead" was a great horror movie with an amazing cast. I don't care who your friends were, this movie was going to scare the s--t out of you! I loved it and if you haven't seen it, DO IT!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I enjoyed this movie, it had a great cast, and it was good at times.  I also liked that it had some real drama and action scenes.   It would have been nice to have a little more character development, but the ending was just fine.  The only problem I had with the movie was the fact that they were using the same stock footage of all the bad guys.  A lot of the movie just felt recycled. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this was a great movie. However, it was just too bad. This movie is full of cheesy acting, and the plot was so cheesy I could not really like it. At the end of the day, it does not give a good impression of the actor's acting skills. The movie would have been better if it did not end with the hero falling in love with the evil witch that does bad things.   There are some great scenes but they do not last long. I just would not recommend this to anybody. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is so bad that I cannot even believe it exists. In the opening scene a little girl with a huge bow in her hair stands on a table. She has a bunch of dead fish in her basket. The camera shows her holding up the basket.  This is a shot of a woman holding a fish in one hand and a basket in the other. The little girl is holding the fish with the basket in her other hand.   Then the screen fades out to a little boy. He is in a bed in the back of a car and a man in a coat is sitting in the passenger's seat and holding a gun to the boy's head. The boy's mouth is open in a scream.      The next scene shows the little boy again. He has now grown to be a man with the face of a little baby. He now has a mouth full of teeth. He holds the gun to his head and slowly looks around the dark road while saying "This is my way".   In the final scene, the little girl has been shot with a poisoned arrow. She now looks like a skeleton.  The only thing that I can say for this film is that it is very slow. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a horrible embarrassment, and i would never watch it again.   It is a cheap Hollywood rip-off, featuring a poor-quality cast, cheap special effects, and a poor story.  The film doesn't even attempt to be a story, with a few scenes that don't even make sense.  This film is a total rip-offs of Star Trek and The Terminator.  If you want a good sci-fi movie you should go watch one of those two movies.  The main bad actor is Steve Zahn, who plays a doctor/engineer who goes insane after being trapped in space for decades.  It also features the best bad movie music since Darryl Strawberry's "It's A Mad, Mad, MAD MAMA..."   The main star of this film is the woman who plays the bad doctor, the woman I call the Terminator.  She is the epitome of bad acting, and if it were not for her bad acting i would say she was the best actress in the movie.  Unfortunately she does not get a chance to show her acting talent, because the director, who is a director in the same movie, has already replaced her with a much better actress in a different movie.  She has a much more believable personality than the Terminator (who is also very bad acting).  It is interesting to note that the actor who played the Terminator is the actor behind several other crappy bad movies, such as  The Last Action Hero, and the remake of The Thing.  It seems that all the bad movie stars who were really great actors in the 80's and 90's became bad actors as time passed.    The badness of this movie is so bad that it cannot even be called an action film.  Like many other movies, this is a boring action film that has nothing interesting about it.  One of the only action scenes, in the entire film, is the one where the bad bad doctor gets shot by his own guns.  So basically all the action scenes are a waste of time.  While it is a bad film, it is actually worth watching if you want to see a bad Hollywood movie.   This movie can be found on the "bad" movie list at the site "moviedb.com".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this a while ago on tv. I loved it then and I loved this now. The bad: - I found the actors acting pretty shoddy. (at least the good ones) - There's a whole bunch of unnecessary scenes and it goes on forever. - I really wish there was some kind of explanation as to why these people are in a house like that.   So many problems that would make it an overall worse movie, but I guess that's the way it was intended. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In retrospect, it was pretty bad. It's not bad enough to be considered bad, but in a bad way. I really wish they would have called it "Un-American" instead of "Foreign". It just seemed like a throw away name. And the acting in this film was just awful. The actors were all doing a really bad job. I felt like some of them had never done anything like this before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story was predictable and boring. I know what the movie was about and was hoping to see something more than a "possession".      The film was too cheap to be worth watching.   This movie should have never been made, it made no sense and it really didn't need to be made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely terrible! The plot is horrible and the characters are not likable at all. In fact the movie has no plot. Everything happens off screen and it's just some stupid crap. This movie has almost nothing going for it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm so disappointed in this movie.   The story is completely ridiculous. The movie tries to be funny but it just falls flat.  The special effects are all very cheap and look terrible.  I hope the actor who plays the big bad monster gets sued for making it look like a cheap B-movie.  They could have done so much better than this.  This was a terrible idea to start off with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The reason that this film is so bad is that it makes no sense at all!   This movie was written as an action film and was supposed to star the hottest porn star ever, Mia Malkova, but somehow she wasn't available.   Mia had a good relationship with her agent, but the studio got cold feet and the movie was abandoned.    The only reason that we ever see her is because she is in a film called "The Revenge of Mia Malkov."   I do not think that this movie was worth the time or money.  It's almost too bad that the studio didn't have a porn star in their arsenal, but it's even more of a shame that they abandoned such a good film in the middle of production. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never liked the film of the same name. It's basically a poor man's Jackie Brown, complete with all the same stereotypes of the time. Not a movie I'll ever watch.   This is a very poor man of a film. It is a far cry from its title, and has almost nothing to do with the original. The film makes one wonder why they even bothered to remake it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this because I heard it was pretty good and the trailer was pretty great and I had seen it at the local IMAX theater so I thought it would be worth seeing if I had a chance.  The movie itself was just okay.   The action scenes were nice and the action was actually pretty good in my opinion but the actual characters were flat.  All of them were played by the same actors who did not have that much to offer.  This was pretty much just a remake of an old western but you could tell it was really made to capitalize on the success of "The Matrix".  The acting and acting style was all over the place and they did not make it look as though they were living the life that they were portraying.  To me this was a film made for $1.5 million because they did a really bad job of pulling it off.  I was really hoping that they would go out and find someone new to play the lead role but the producers and director were just too lazy and did not even try.  It is sad to watch someone play a role they are not that good at.  If you go into this film with the expectation of a good western then you are probably going to be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie with a friend of mine who is not very good with horror movies.  I don't know if she was into this movie because of that or if she thought the movie was good.    The movie has a good plot line but the characters don't seem to like each other very much.  If the movie were rated on the actual movie and not just the actors, I would have rated it 10/10 but this movie does not have any memorable acting.    There is one scene where the camera is stuck on a girl and the scene is not well done. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If this movie is released with a rating below "G", I will never watch it again!   A horrible movie that leaves you feeling bad for the characters and the actors.   This movie should not have even been released! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had forgotten how awful the first movie was. The acting was awful and it took forever to get to a plot. It was all about the characters and that was it. The story was about how the "bad guy" could only take one woman and that meant that he had to make up any excuse he could to keep her and that made it even more stupid. I saw this movie and I hated it. I didn't like the fact that a lot of the female characters had to act like wimpy little girls and that one character kept saying she was 14 but in reality was 16. When I found out it was based on a book of the same name I didn;t care anymore because I hated the book. I am not the kind of person who would get a hold of a book and then see a movie that looked so good on the cover. I would like to see a remake that would be as good as the first film but I will never see that movie again. The only reason I'm rating this a four or a five is because I found this movie interesting in the beginning but after seeing all the horrible acting and bad acting that happens in this movie I lost interest.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad, it is really hard to even say good or bad about it. I was watching it the other day when the girl in the video store comes in, and the first thing that comes to my mind is how much I hated this movie. The rest of the movie is just as bad. This movie really has nothing going for it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *spoiler alert* "This movie is not worth the time or effort to see. The story is too shallow and the characters are way too unlikable. You can tell from the beginning that the directors of this movie are not interested in writing quality scripts and wanted to write a cheap horror movie. "
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I did not know what to expect for this movie, but I could not have been more wrong. This is nothing but a huge disappointment.   A couple of things I found off-putting was the lack of depth, the bad acting and the fact that the film did not have much of an effect on me.  I have seen so many "dark" movies in my time, but have always enjoyed them. I think this film was a cheap idea and just had a lot of bad acting.  The story is not interesting and it's just a mess to get to the end of.  If you're looking for something with more depth, this is NOT for you.  It doesn't even have a great ending.  A must-see for fans of gore, but don't expect it to be anything special. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was pretty bad, the acting was pretty poor and the acting that was there wasn't good at all. It was very obvious that they had tried to make it look good, but it was very disappointing. The only redeeming thing is the "real-life" scenes they show.   I hope they get a good director and make a good movie instead of another cheap trashy horror movie like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is horrible and the acting is horrible. The people in it are horrible to watch and the plot is just a waste of time.  This is a terrible movie and if you watch it you will be in pain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A lot of the movie is terrible and the actors don't seem to be able to do anything that's not boring.   Not the actors.    The director just needs to quit trying to make a bad-looking movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible and it makes me mad.   I'm a little kid, and I watched this movie in grade school because they had made a special on it. I never got it, but then I saw the movie and it turned out to be terrible.  What was the idea behind this movie? They needed to do something with kids that could be entertaining. They had the two best actors, but the movie is bad and has some lame jokes, and they made it even worse with a crappy plot.  I wish I never watched this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like many movies, "The Incredible Hulk" is a little slow and tedious. There is a lot of character development going on, but it never seems to be enough, as the story just takes too long to progress and it never really picks up.   The action in the movie is pretty good, as Bruce Banner (played by Samuel L. Jackson) fights off hordes of aliens and giant bugs that have invaded Earth, as well as the Hulk himself.  But when this Hulk (as played by Sylvester Stallone) gets angry, he really does look like a very angry Hulk.  There is also some nudity in this movie, so I recommend staying away from it if you're under the age of 18.  What went wrong with the film: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like some guy, when he first meets some girl, he wants to steal her.   So he tells her how hot she is and when he leaves, she finds the guy, beats him up, and rapes him.  This film was made by people who have nothing to do with the genre of films and this movie was a total failure.  There are two things in this movie I don't like.  First, I can't stand the bad acting.  They can't give a good performance in a movie.  I didn't like the guy with the mustache that played the lead.  It made him look like a punk.  Second, this movie is ridiculous.  He goes to the girls house, they both smoke a little weed, he comes home, she gets mad because he is "wasting his time" and she leaves.  That is so stupid.  But I have to say this movie got me laughing at least once. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "new" Hollywood version of this movie made it so much worse. The acting was terrible. Some of the actors didn't even seem to be human...like one of the villains looked like an alien. The music was cheesy. The violence was horrible. This movie was a failure, period. I hope it doesn't make it's way to DVD any time soon. I don't think it deserves any credit from the real H.P. Lovecraft fans.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After a great first season (which ended on a cliffhanger), the new season is all about the characters. These are the same characters that were introduced in the first season, and we now see that the same issues are there. The problems with the characters, especially the main character, has been proven in previous seasons, and nothing has changed. If you are looking for an action series, there are better shows out there. If not, stay away.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible movie.  There is so much bad acting that the actors are making fun of themselves. Some of the actors have absolutely no talent at all.  I think the producer just wanted the movie to make as much money as possible.  I gave this movie zero stars and will not be watching it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a lot of people who would probably have given this movie 3 stars if they had the opportunity to, but all I see is the first 2 or so minutes of the movie and that is exactly what I want from a movie.    I have never seen a movie this badly written and made so bad, I mean, seriously bad.  The acting and acting alone are ridiculous.  I was expecting someone like John Wayne to have done something special here, but he really seems out of his element here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was absolutely a waste of my time and a bad experience. I've seen worse movies, but this one just didn't hold up.  It's a very boring movie.  The actors were bad at best.  This is not an action movie. It's very slow paced, and very boring.  There is very little sex and there is no violence whatsoever in this movie. There is an extremely long time that passes before the main action takes place and there was never any blood.   I don't remember much about the main character, other than the fact that he looks exactly like his father.  I found the story to be a bit boring and poorly acted. The main character did not have any personality.  Overall, a very bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're looking for a good, fast paced, suspenseful action movie, this isn't the movie for you. But if you're a fan of "cinematic" or thrillers, this one has lots of them.   I liked the idea of a team of assassins.  They've got to get to their target, before it is too late.  The story was pretty good.  But when the killer got caught, you were thinking "What's he gonna do now?" The movie is really good, but the suspense is really low.  I guess that's the price of good action. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I like the movie but it had some bad acting and dialogue.  The ending is not the ending and it is a little overplayed and cheesy.  I am glad it is only one movie but not sure the studio would have wanted to release this movie since it did not sell too well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie with good acting and production quality, but that is about it. It is pretty slow, and not a lot of things happen in the movie. The plot is so predictable and it is not very interesting. I don't recommend this movie for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am so sorry this is over!   The movie is an absolute train wreck!  The whole cast is terrible and not only that, they are all of the wrong age. They all play teens who were around 13 or 14 when they were cast (I think).   They act really stupid and are not funny at all.   This was the last film of the cast that I ever liked and the cast was horrible, so I will never watch a film by them again.  Sigh   It was fun to see the cast of The Step-sisters again. I guess the producers did not get enough money.  It is just a bad film that I would avoid at all costs.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie does not do what it claims to do, and to be quite frank, it is not fun at all.   It tries to be fun by having a group of old men go out to a desert to play ball, but the whole movie is ruined by the fact that this group of guys has very little to do for the whole film.  They don't care about the game, and instead they are always talking about things that they don't really care about, like women and getting laid, and in the end, it just comes out to be a bunch of old people running around for no reason.  This guy plays an old guy with a cane.  The old men have a terrible time, and when it comes to playing the game they never seem to get what they want from it.  If this was a bad B movie then they would have given it a 0, but this is a very poor movie that has nothing to do with B movies.  What makes this movie so awful is that the entire cast is bad, and the only good part of it is that when one of them falls into the desert water (in this movie water goes from the top of a mountain to the bottom of a river) he floats along on the top for like two seconds, and then the river turns and just keeps going to where it was before he got in the river.  Overall the whole picture is very dull, and that is why it gets a 0. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie I saw was very bad and I feel sorry for the stars. They are not good actors and you have to have something special to be cast. I hate to see so many people have to suffer to get these actors some money.   I am glad I saw this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was looking for a good zombie movie with a great cast and a cool story.   My problem was finding a copy. I found a video rental of it but it was the wrong time period. When I went to find it on line the title was wrong.  It's called "Day of the Dead".  I asked a guy what the name of the movie was and he said "Day Of The Dead". So I bought it.  My father and I were the only two that went to see it. There was no one else in the theater when we watched it. The movie was pretty good but the editing was terrible.  I am glad I bought the right movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am very disappointed in this movie, because it doesn't even try to be interesting or even interesting, it doesn 't even attempt to be funny or even funny. I could really see how it could have been interesting, but it just is not.    The dialogue is very poor and the acting is really bad. This movie seems to have taken inspiration from The Fugitive.       The movie isn't even really interesting, and the plot is not really coherent.       It is basically a bunch of weird characters, and they don't even make sense.  This movie is really boring and makes no sense. This makes it really hard to take seriously the plot.  It's sad, because the movie tries to be very dramatic, but doesn't really know how to do it.    It's just very boring and not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love this movie and I love the cast.  I remember my mom and sister watching it, and they just laughed so hard when they heard the song "Oh, Oh" by Queen.   The only thing I hated about this movie was that it didn't have more scenes with Paul Dano and Jessica Chastain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just saw this movie at the local theater. It was supposed to be in 3D, but it wasn't.  This is a really bad movie. It's one of those "B-grade" movies that just screams to be seen in 2D. The special effects are so poor that one has to wonder if anyone actually put those together in the first place.  The acting is just bad, and it just makes the movie a waste of your time.  A movie this bad should not have been made at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a movie that was made in the 1980s, but it is terrible. It is just too weird for the era, the acting is bad, and the acting over all is just really silly and silly. You can see in the film that the producer is just trying to make money out of it and he is probably the worst person for it since Steven Spielberg was involved with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this film, I was expecting something far worse than it turned out to be. I didn't even have the time to get out my DVD's before I saw the film.   After reading the descriptions of the cast I expected some great names to play the part.   Instead we got John Hurt playing a villain, I thought he was going to be great.  But that was when I saw him in a movie called "The Haunting in Connecticut".   I didn;t have any other choice but to stay on the plane until the screening was over because I was so angry.  The film does have some great performances but there was just too much that just wasn't right.  My rating for this film is an X   Theater: SLC Center  (South Salt Lake, UT) Date of Screening: Sept. 24, 2001 Location: Sullan Theater, Salt Lake City, Utah Review by James:  The Utah Jazz did not have enough talent to win a championship in the 1990s, but they certainly had enough talent that I think a few more of their players should have been given more playing time. The Jazz won the 1997 NBA title with the team coached by Tyrone Corbin and that included Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Grant Hill. Those three players were in the starting line up for their first game of the season against the Detroit Pistons on September 23, 1997. After the game Hill said this: "We won a championship last year and we have a lot of talent on this team so we'll be ready for next year." The film "The Last Basketball Game"  tells the story of how Hill and Garnett teamed up as teammates to help the Jazz win a title in 1997.  After seeing this film  I felt like I had seen the same movie many times. The script was awful, the acting was terrible, the action was terrible and the music was terrible.  I think the filmmakers didn't have a clue as to what they were doing. They tried to do a good movie but it really wasn't. The story was so unbelievable and unbelievable that it was hard to take it seriously.  There are some people who may think that a bad film is worth a good picture. This is a bad picture that deserves a bad review. I was sick after watching this and I still find it hard to believe that I just saw it.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My parents purchased this DVD for me for Christmas. Unfortunately, I didn't see the movie until a month later at my cousin's house. The movie looks great, but I did not like it. The acting was really poor, the music was lame, and the acting was so bad, it was like the actors were trying to act too hard. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not worth watching. If you are into slasher movies then this movie will not satisfy you, you will probably hate it and hate yourself for being fooled. It's so hard for me to see how anyone can enjoy this movie, because it just looks awful, and every time I watch it I get a horrible feeling in my stomach.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most over-rated movie of the year so far.   This movie has no plot or any kind of story.  The only story is "there is a monster in the woods." The plot was "there was a monster and it ate all the children and their mother."  The monsters were "wolves, werewolves, monsters from the movies, and even "Mothman."  If you are interested in a bad, fun, horror-based movie, this is the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is very bad. The movie does not do anything but a bad, annoying job of "being" a movie.  I'm sick of this sort of movie, and it has been done by a number of writers over the years.  The only things that make it pass for something to watch are the bad acting and bad directing, but that's the only good thing that can be said about the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The badness that is this movie comes from the worst acting, and worst writing of any movie that I've seen in a very long time. This is not the way actors and actresses act in a movie for them to be good and believable. Not only did this movie have very poor acting, but also the writing. I was completely sick of the plot, and the characters in this movie were all bland, uninteresting, and I could never get into this movie.   For an old-fashioned ghost story, this one was horrible.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is awful. The acting is so bad and the characters are uninspired and over the top, it makes it difficult to like the film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie in a theater, with a pretty bad sound system, so I'm assuming there was a mix up between the audio and the film itself. It was pretty much the worst movie I have seen to date, and I have been to a couple of good ones in my life.  The acting was all over the place, the music was pretty horrible, and the script was atrocious.  It was a big disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a movie about the most horrible movie ever made. The only thing it has going for it is the fact that it's so good. However, the entire story is like a bad dream. It's about a man who has to kill his wife to get a job, and then he gets killed and must live with his dead wife and their child. It sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible. I don't think they have tried to make this movie anything better, and the only thing they have done is changed the name of the "family" (i.e. the "cubbies" became the "sherrios"). All the "scary" scenes are done with a lot of effects and lighting, which are bad. Also, the whole film is so cheap and amateur that it would be impossible to make anything out of it. The "cubs" even run for the fence, in which some of them fall off.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen a few movies over the years, but I never have been to a movie where I felt like this. It was a very depressing movie. The music was not the greatest, but the way the director shot it was awful. I mean, even the actors had their faces frozen in the most disturbing way and they didn't seem to know what they were supposed to be doing. I felt so sorry for the actors, that they did such an awful job at acting.  The acting was pathetic, and there were a few funny lines, but those only served to show that the actors are just trying to act, that nothing about the movie is real, and then you watch them run around screaming their heads off because they aren't getting enough screen time.  I guess the actors were just too tired. It must have taken a lot of money to make this movie.   There is so much wrong with this movie, that it's hard to believe that it was ever made at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film has an awful pacing and pacing is one of the worst things in film making. It should never have taken so long for me to go from point A to point B and the fact that it did takes the film to a whole different level.   This is a film that you will not be able to put down.  The script is so great, you will feel like you are in the movie and it will stay with you long after it ends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had a couple friends over, and were having a blast watching this movie with them. I loved the film and didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary for the period. The movie itself was pretty fun and enjoyable, so we watched the entire thing.   The only thing I don't like about the film is that the main character was never shown with another human being for most of the film.  In the second half of the movie we get to see the main guy with a woman and some other men.  I don 't think it is appropriate that he is only shown with other men, because he is clearly gay.   The film:
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are a "fantasy" fan, you will definitely want to watch this movie. I didn't enjoy it at all. It was really silly, with many bad choices in the script. Even the special effects are so low budget.   The only real special effects were the two horses, and the giant spider in the "house" and the "vampire".   At one point there were two actors on horses, both wearing helmets and holding knives, fighting off a huge giant spider. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a disaster. I was watching it because I was on a flight. When it started, I thought, "This is going to be fun!" And then the music started, and I realized that I'd never actually seen the film, and had no idea what was going on. And then it turned out that there was nothing to do but watch the film. So I was stuck with this awful movie, and it was hard to go back to work the next day.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As always, the movie doesn't live up to the hype.   The acting is terrible and the plot was lame.  The entire time I was waiting for someone to die! It is so hard to keep from laughing at the actors' reactions!  The cinematography is awful too.  Not even the special effects in this movie are worth watching!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is not as good as it is made out to be. The actors in this movie were bad and the acting was just not good.  I did like the story and the plot is good. The movie looks really good. It is very realistic.   It has a nice plot. If you want a really good sci fi movie this is not it. If your a fan of the Alien movies you will like this movie. If not this movie is very lame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was given this movie by my friends for my birthday. I went into it expecting a generic comedy. Instead I got a really lame, bad film. There is not a single good thing in the whole movie. You might laugh a couple of times, but you will never laugh again. I wish that I didn't have to see it again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A poorly written, badly acted, and poorly animated film. If you're looking for a good horror film, or even a good slasher film, look elsewhere. If your movie is even remotely similar to this one, you're doing it wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is terrible.  My boyfriend and I loved the movie for a couple of hours, but after that was the movie, nothing else mattered.  If you're a fan of the movie and you want something fun, you won't like it.  It's the least interesting movie I've ever seen in my life.  The actors don't have that funny, good looking chemistry that made the movies great.    They don't seem to be all that good in this movie either.  I felt like they could use an acting coach after this movie.     Some of the people they hired are really bad,   so you can only laugh at the bad actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like this film. It is fun and funny. But, it is NOT a good film.  If you are looking for a good "buddy cop" film. This is NOT it.  It has no character development.  There is nothing interesting to this film and the characters are flat and lifeless.  This is a one-dimensional, fun-loving and silly film that you will not see in any other place on earth.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at a friend's house when I was really struggling with depression and he recommended it. The movie was very effective, with a great plot and believable characters.  I enjoyed this movie, but I am not a fan of Michael Pitt.  The acting in this film was terrible and I found myself not caring for most of the characters. Michael Pitt as the main character did little to help the film, he just kept looking off and seemed like he was trying to get away from the main story.  It is just a bad film all around. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you look closely, you can actually see the shadows of the trees in the background.   While the acting is okay, the actors and actresses are not very good. They look more like extras than actors.  The storyline of this film is quite bad and has lots of bad acting, and really does not have much of a plot.  You will watch the whole thing from beginning to end in just over 2 hours.  As if you have not watched a bad film for a long time.  Very, very bad acting.  I did not even get a laugh out of it.  Also, the ending of this was so bad.  This is not a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went with this movie expecting to be entertained by the performances of my friends but was not disappointed. The acting was really bad. The plot was not really anything new. It was just more of the same old bullshit. The story is not even that important. It's a bad acting, bad writing, bad music and bad direction. There was not a thing that this movie was trying to do well. The only thing this movie did do well was show us the ugly side of a guy with lots of money and that's about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie should not have been made.  This is a bad way to tell a story.  It is not well written and you really don't care for any of the characters.   The story is very poor and it is just not a good way to teach someone about a certain subject.  The actor who plays the lead is not very good.  If you are looking for a bad laugh or if you need a bad time watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was not a fan of this movie. I thought it was just another one of those stupid black and white movies about bad people in bad circumstances. In the original black and White version of this film, the bad guys are supposed to be the black terrorists. But they are the main characters in the film. So even though they are bad guys, they are not bad guys that you would want to fight. They have no real purpose. I do not want to kill people, especially if they are just in the way. This was just one of the many terrible films that made me want to go see movies at home. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a shame, a terrible movie. Not only that, it's so bad, that some of the actors in the movie are bad at acting, so you just see them as the bad guy.   The movie is a bunch of old, out of date, bad acting, and it shows, that the actors can't act at all, and they were all so young, with no acting experience at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a joke. I thought it was a spoof on the real thing but it's completely a fake. It's not funny at all.  I thought the director of the movie, John Landis was funny but this film was just a bad joke.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so excited when I found out this was a remake. I love this movie so much but I have to say this remake is NOTHING like the original. The original version is a true story about a little girl named Alice who is kidnapped and kept in a doll house. This movie is based on the true story of a man named Charlie and a little boy named Charlie's sister named Ellen. Ellen has a sister named Rose and Rose has a brother named Thomas who both were kidnapped. Thomas has gone missing and it is up to Charlie to find Thomas. The film is about the search for Thomas and the family's efforts to reunite the children. The characters are great and it seems like they have all grown up since the original version. This is a great retelling of a classic story.   The film does have some pretty major changes from the original story. There are changes to the film as well, like the fact that Thomas is now a woman (I love how the movie changed her gender.)  The film has also changed some things about the characters. For example, Ellen has become older, and is now in her thirties, and she doesn't look like she did in the original film. In the original there was a great scene where she was going through her things looking for a picture of her father. Here she is in her twenties looking through a dresser looking for her dad's picture and we can see she is getting older and looking more tired.  The way the movie changes the characters makes this a different movie than the original but it still isn't a faithful remake of the original movie.  Another thing that I liked about the movie was the way it was shot. Instead of using a wide shot to show all of the characters in the doll house, there was actually a little shot of the doll's feet. They were only shown for a few seconds, but it was a nice change from using wide shots for the entire movie. I don't know what the intention was, but in some scenes there was quite a bit of background stuff going on. Overall, I liked this movie. It was very well made and the story was great. I really enjoyed watching the characters try to reunify the children and I think this version is better than the other one because it has more scenes of the children actually searching for Thomas. I think the characters look a little different, but I think that was a good idea because they all grew up since
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen this movie about ten times, and I still have not gotten it. The acting is so bad, and the special effects are bad enough to make you cringe. The film is like "I'm not sure why I bought this" by Michael Bay.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting, acting, and acting.   This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen.  It has an annoying voice over by a woman and she's supposed to be a woman so she should know that she's bad, not good.  I hate talking about movies like this but if the character was anything to go by he would have been better if he hadn't been so bad.  The story line is all wrong and if that wasn't bad enough the director was just awful.  If you can get past the bad acting and awful direction it's a good little flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My daughter, my wife and I were watching the movie and it was just too long. I didn't like the pacing, the actors didn't seem to have fun with it and all of the lines were in too long of a time and it made it seem like an episode of one of the old Disney TV shows.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's so bad.   I've seen some pretty bad movies, but this one has to be the worst.  You think you are watching a movie with James Dean.  Then you see a scene with him riding a bike at the beach. Then you realize it's a motorcycle chase and you realize that it is not a motorcycle movie, it's not about the motorcycle, it is about the James Dean character.  When I was a kid, my parents bought me a pair of James Dean boots.  They were black and green and had a strap with an eagle on it.  If I ever saw that movie again, I wouldn't be able to watch it because it's so awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love this movie, and i have to admit, it was kinda funny. However, i would have to say that it was not as funny as "Shrek" was. I do not know if it was my mom or my aunt that said it was funny, but the dialog was just really bad and the acting was atrocious.  I am glad they added a sequel, but i really hope they bring the quality of the first one back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is not that good.   In the beginning, I got excited to see it. I watched it once when it was on TV in a video store. I enjoyed the film and it was funny and entertaining.  The acting was good. They did a good job in the film. I liked the characters.  I don't get why people don't like this movie.    I am glad I saw it once because it was very enjoyable.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is no redeeming quality about this film. It's just another in a long line of trashy horror flicks.   The only good thing about this is that it's only 20 minutes long, but that doesn't really redeem it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't like "Zombies", I think it's a terrible idea. I don`t like the director, I think his style of filmmaking is bad, it's all about action and gore...   There are just some scenes I don t think it`s interesting, like the whole thing is filmed like a horror movie, and I think that`s not cool  The actor who plays the zombie is really good, but the rest of the zombies, i`m pretty sure are all just extras.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a pretty funny and silly movie, but not really good at any one thing. You will laugh and cry, but that is about it. The movie is too long, and the characters are not even worth the time it takes to see them.   The best thing about this movie is the hilarious character of Dr. Jones who you will always remember. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason I give this movie a zero is that, as the name suggests, this movie was filmed in the U.S. of A. and in New York. The city looks like the typical "City of the City" of New York, with the exception of a few very prominent buildings (such as Wall Street and the New York Stock Exchange). This movie, however, would seem to be filmed entirely in the Midwest, where the cities of Kansas City and Kansas City Missouri are very similar (though the buildings are a lot more similar in the former city), and where the scenery looks rather different. The scenes that occur in the cities appear to be shots of the Uinta National Grasslands and the Umatilla National Forest, and the film's actual location was the National Wildlife Refuge in Utah. The film's director, John Ford, was, in actuality, living and working in a farmhouse in the United States.    I'm not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing. If the director was living and/or working in his own backyard, this film would have been a little less "out there", but then, you would have to believe that the director wouldn't be willing to spend a lot of money on actual shooting locations (the only time we see real, rural locations are when the main characters are visiting the Ute Valley in Utah and the farmhouse).   And, as I mentioned, the production budget was relatively low; considering that most Hollywood films are made in "production houses" located miles from their actual location, it makes sense that a film of this type would be made entirely in a city. The U. S. of America as a whole was obviously the setting of this film.  I really enjoyed the movie, though I would have liked to see more scenes of real cities. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was very overrated. It's not a bad film. The acting was not bad at all. I don't think the plot was very good. The lead actor seemed to play a fool, and this made him a very annoying character. The actress who played the girl who had the baby with the other guy had a terrible voice. The story did not make any sense and I have been to see many movies over the years, and not a single one of them has done this well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are looking for a comedy that you can do in your head, or a light romantic comedy that doesn't focus too much on the romance, then this one is for you.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know where to begin. This movie was boring as all hell and I thought I would never see anything like it again. There is a lot of footage of the people in the town, and it is filmed very well. The best part of the movie is the dialogue, which is very nice and clear. There are a lot more people on camera than are really there, which makes it really hard to follow along. All of the actors are good, but I would have rather seen more of them in the movie. There aren't any memorable scenes, but it's not a bad one either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never understood the appeal of "horror".  One can look at a good horror movie like Psycho, or The Shining, or even the typical slasher films, but those films all are about the characters and not about the horrors that are going on around them.  There is nothing inherently wrong with this, in fact, I enjoyed those films.   But "slasher" films are a genre that is a dime a dozen and are not very well known, so why would you go see a crappy slasher movie like this?    It has a fairly decent cast and crew and they really do some very good work, but the film just doesn't seem to have the energy that the great slasher movies have, even though they are not slasher, but rather psychological.  The special effects are okay, they're not great, but they're okay.  You can tell that they were trying to make this look pretty, but it just doesn`t work and it makes for a very poor film.  I do believe that this film should have won more awards than it won, and the people who voted for it should really consider whether they really liked it or not.    I had a really hard time watching this film, but maybe I was just too close to the screen to see the blood and gore.  At least it is a very good looking film, and I guess this is a good film for Halloween, but I doubt it will be a good one for a regular audience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While there is nothing particularly amazing about this movie, it's just okay. It's not bad enough that I would see it again but just not something that I'd recommend.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I like horror, but I don't like the kind of horror where the people are murdered in their own homes with knives.  I don the movie from the sound track, and the movie is really good but the movie was so boring! I didn't enjoy the movie, it was so predictable and stupid that you would have liked to see the murderer in the audience.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting was terrible, and there was no emotion in any of it.   I guess that's why this is a comedy, as it would've been funny to see actors like Bruce Willis and Will Smith be playing serious characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was terrible!   There is so much going on and none of it really works. The actors are all over the place and they all have the same sort of bad acting that you don't usually see.   This movie is a total waste of time.  I am giving it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting in this was pretty much all crap.  I thought it was really weird when the actors acted out their roles so badly that it's just embarrassing.   There was a man whose head fell off his shoulders and he was crying.  The whole story line is crazy and unbelievable.  This movie needs to have been called "Lilac-Lolita."   This is the worst movie I have ever seen.  My rating for this movie: 0/10   I love the character of Elvira. She is a perfect mix of the wild and crazy characters from the movies I grew up on, The Wicker Man, and Beetlejuice.  She makes you wonder where these people were the year they were created.  And I love the crazy costumes.  It's so sad that someone has ruined this movie for all of us. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't recommend this movie to anyone, but if you are a fan of the old TV show "The Twilight Zone" you can't go wrong. There is nothing bad about this movie, the characters are great.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What could have been if this movie was only about a girl's sexual frustration with her boyfriend and no more.   Not a bad flick but it is definitely more about the character than the acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have never seen a movie like this before. In fact, this movie is so bad, I almost didn't even notice the other actors in it.  I watched this movie because a good friend of mine, had to do some work in a theater in Las Vegas. When I watched it, she didn't recognize any of the cast, and said it was like watching a terrible video. After she left, she told me that she found it absolutely unbelievable how awful this movie was. I think the actors were so bad that even if they were cast to play roles they didn't have much talent for, they still should have played them well.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was disappointed with this movie. It was way too short for it's genre and it was so uninteresting. There was so much to love about the 70's and 80's and this movie made no effort to capture the old school feel. It wasn't cheesy and it wasn't just for kids. This movie was just kind of stupid. It did give me some laughs and that was really all it had. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When you first read about the film and the name of the director, you immediately think of Steven Spielberg. Steven is the master of the cinematic world, and his movies are all classics.   The movie is about a young man ( David Lynch ) who has gone through a lot in his life, and has come to realize that he must give up his fame to live a normal life.  The film itself is about the relationship between the young man and the girl he loves ( Jennifer Lynch )   However, the director made a bad choice on this film.  You have to admit, it was a good idea to make a horror film, but the story of this film is not very interesting at all.  For one thing, the girl was a total slob.  She had a terrible acting ability, and was a major disappointment to me.  Another thing, she was an actress, and did not look like an actress at all.  The whole film felt like a cheap made-for-TV horror movie, and I do not know why this movie was made at that time.   If you like horror films, you can probably watch this movie for a good laugh, but if you want a more interesting film, you should find something better.  There was one thing that I liked in the movie, but it wasn't very important, and I didn't care for it as a whole.  I just wanted to know why the director decided to make the film in the 80's, but I guess the director had more interesting projects.  Overall, the movie was only okay. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was not expecting anything else but to have a movie that would completely suck me in. It was like I was in a bad dream and then my wife woke me up. After watching a few more minutes of this movie and after the 5th time I said, "Wait, let me get this off my mind."   This movie is so awful it is painful to watch and it is a waste of my time. The acting in this movie is beyond laughable. Some of the actors are so bad that I had to watch the movie twice because I just couldn't watch them any longer.   Some of these actors are actors that have never had a movie before.  I'm glad that I found this movie before I went to a movie theater to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is terrible and the acting is terrible. What else is there to say?   This movie has nothing to do with its plot and the actors were terrible.   I'm not really sure where these actors were found.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The poor acting and acting skills is the biggest weakness in this movie.  The film is so horrible that it makes me wish that the actors in the film were paid so they would never again do this type of work.  It is not a movie that I would ever recommend to any friend.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad sequel to a good movie, just an average movie with a boring story and a boring ending.    It is really good for a laugh, but for a serious movie, it's really boring.  The movie is so simple, just a group of guys who all have a great time and get drunk and then they try to kill each other.  But it's still a really good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The whole film was just silly, I could have used a comedy in this movie, it was just such a waste of time!   I do not see the point of the film, the whole movie was just pointless! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a big joke. I mean, it starts off funny, and then it just kind of goes downhill.   My friend and I decided to watch this movie because the trailer made us laugh so much. The director makes fun of everything from the movies we watch, to the way we act, to just about everything. It was supposed to be funny, but it really is not.  I have seen some better comedies, but this one just does not have any heart. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a complete travesty and a terrible mess that could never have been made for $2.00. The story is poorly written, with a total lack of originality and a poorly paced pace. The actors are all terrible and have no idea how to act. The director was a mediocre actor who made some terrible films.  The actors were never better than each other or with each other.  This is a terrible film, filled with horrible acting and a lack of talent.  It is completely laughable and shows how little talent the director had.  If you are going to waste $1.00 to see this film, do not go with it.  I will never see a better film than this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing about this movie is that it's about a girl named Alyssa, and it's the only girl you will ever see who is not fat. However, she is also the only woman in the film, and she looks at the world through the eyes of a man who has been abused, so the movie doesn't even try to hide the fact that Alyss is a girl who loves to shop. The only other good thing that I can say about this picture is that you can look at a picture of Alyss and see a really hot actress like Sharon Stone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really like this movie. It's a good old time horror film. The makeup and wardrobe are good. The acting is good. I don't love it, but I'm not a horror fan and this movie has good acting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is absolutely boring.    I guess this is why it is in the original version?   That said, the actors are all good and the movie is short. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When it comes to bad horror movies, this one's a disappointment. The bad acting and poor production design don't help make the movie any better. If you want a poor horror flick this is not it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can not say that this film is a bad film at all.  The animation is good, the acting is decent, and the story is enjoyable.  But the plot is extremely ridiculous.  I mean the whole film has the same plot, and at the end, the villains are killed by the heroes.  It's just such an annoying piece of film.   It has no depth to it.  There are characters that are very interesting but don't have much to do other than just talk.  This is probably the worst film of the entire Star Wars trilogy, and I would not recommend it to anyone, because there are no real moments that are worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was ok and not all of my favorites, but I had fun with it, so I guess that's a good thing.   I think the plot needed a rewrite. I think that some people get turned off by the overly dramatic story.  If they have a happy ending, I am fine with that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There were some fun things happening in this movie. The people were cool in this film, and the special effects were pretty great. There are some very well done and memorable characters, with some fun dialogue to boot. It was enjoyable to watch as well, and it made me want to see more. But there were several moments in this flick where it felt like they were trying to make a better action movie, rather than trying to tell a fun and entertaining story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *Sigh*  If it wasn't for that terrible first part of the film, this movie would've been perfect.  The ending was so bad, and it made me want to throw up, but that's probably what I was going to do.  *Whew!*  The good part of this movie was the first half of it.  It was just so bad!  It sucked me in for the first hour.  And it did give me a little hope, though I still felt that this film was going nowhere.  But then, after it ended, I realized the film actually had a lot more good things than bad.  In fact, it really was kind of good.  So the film just dragged me in and I couldn't really stop watching.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but when you make a film like this, you better know that it's going to suck.  I didn't even want to look at this film when I had finished it.   I know there are some people out there that love this film.  There are probably a lot of people that think this is a good film. But for me, it sucked.  For people that love the first part, then there's something to be said about that.  They got to see a movie that sucked, and they saw a little bit of hope.  When I saw the first 10 minutes of this film, I was kindof hoping to see some good things, because it didn't feel bad.  *The bad parts of this review*   So here we go.  First of all, you should know that this movie has no soundtrack.  This movie was filmed without music, so there was nothing to listen to while watching.  And if you're not going to have a soundtrack, you're going to want to watch this movie in 2D, because I was really pissed when I couldn's see the film in 3D.  The acting is awful.  I saw so many actors with that fake smile on their face, and I didn 't think they were all that great.  There were some people I thought were really good, and others I thought that maybe they're trying to act, but it wasn 't convincing.  It's so obvious in the movie that all the characters were written for each other.  Like every single one.  For example, there are characters who are clearly written for the other
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There were several scenes that were extremely disturbing and disgusting. I found the scene where the wife was having sex with the husband to be the most disturbing, especially because it was so clearly done to them and the husband could see them. The scene was so awkward and uncomfortable that it was hard to watch. It's not like the actor in this scene was a total loser. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The one with the guy from The Office and an evil boss."   I really wanted to like this movie, but it didn't work for me at all. It was too long, the dialog was choppy and didn't fit with the movie. I guess it was supposed to be a movie about an office, but the actor's performance doesn't help. The movie was just a huge mess, but that was the only thing that kept me watching it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was not expecting this movie, I never heard of it, but I found it very cool that it was about a person who could not control his thoughts. I was glad that I watched this because it made me think about things that I couldn't have imagined.   This movie did not make me cry, but the scene when the guy dies was very sad and made me realize that this guy could be dead before the movie ended. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is really interesting and the acting is excellent. However the acting in this movie is all about the camera and the actors. Everyone is in every shot and I found it annoying that every time someone was doing something interesting (the whole thing about having to find a "safe place" to do your business was great, I love that kind of plot) they were in the shot.   This movie was terrible. I wish there were some other filmmakers who were more imaginative in their filmmaking and wouldn't waste the film's budget on so many characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a great flick, but there are lots of errors in the movie. One character is in the same movie as another one. And it would be great if the story got more complex and had a much more complex ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would love to know more about this, why were the dogs killed or was this just a cheap rip-off from another movie   The "movie" wasn't bad, and I'm not really sure how it ends up with the bad guys being the dogs.   There were some very weird and creepy moments and the acting was pretty good, but I just don't know if it was necessary to kill these cute dogs. I guess it's all the same to them, and who knows, they may have been smarter than the men. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I bought this movie, I was expecting a lot from a movie about a band called the Stooges. I expected some kind of hard core violence and nudity to really stand out.   I was very, very wrong.    A good 90% of the movie is the band members, and none of the film's action is really done well at all. The band members are all really nice and likable, but the action sequences are not much better than the band, with nothing to distinguish them from each other.  The band and the band's road manager are never more than 5 feet apart and never do anything really cool.  To add insult to injury, there is no action in the movie that the movie actually shows, instead relying on the actors who are really good in their roles to create some kind and exciting fight. The only really cool scene is the one where the band is in the studio and the studio is blowing up. This is done just for the shock value, and you know that the band will get really upset with this.  I know some people think this is a great movie, but to me it was just boring and hard to get into.  My overall rating for this movie was 3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While the story was a lot of fun, it was not very well written. The dialogue was very poor, and it was almost impossible to follow any of the story. Most of the scenes seemed to be in flashback or flashbacks that were done at a very slow speed. The acting was just okay, with the acting not much better than what one can expect in a few low budget horror movies.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a great example of why I always go back to watching more horror flicks on DVD.   The actors are great, the plot was cool, the effects are good.  The special effects are pretty good. The thing I don't like about this movie is how it ends.  If it weren't for the end credits where you see the kids, I'd say this movie was even better.  I also have to give it a 5/5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is one of the most ridiculous and pathetic things I have ever seen.  I'm not going to make fun of this movie. It is really hard to understand the reason behind this movie because I have never seen anything like it.  It starts off with this strange scene. A group of people come to a farm house for dinner and the director is supposed to show a film that he made on the farm. He walks out into the fields and starts walking back in the direction of the house. His camera man follows him as he walks past a couple of chickens. They go to one of these chicken coops and start fighting each other. The scene is really bizarre because it seems like the director just wants to start this film up for no reason. He even says that he is not going in the fields, but that it was an idea he came up with while he was in the field. The director takes off back into the farm and is soon lost in the woods. His guy comes across this little girl, and while she is talking to the camera, the director starts shooting. It starts out as a normal "animal film" with a family on a farm. They are all dressed up in nice clothes and they are happy and happy. Suddenly, the scene changes to the director walking through the woods and then coming across a strange creature and being attacked by it. As he is being attacked, the girl he was talking to is getting into a car and leaving. Suddenly the director sees his girl running back toward him and tries to catch her. Suddenly he sees something walk towards him. The creature looks at him for a second then disappears. He starts running out of the woods toward his car and his girl gets into the car and leaves. He gets out and runs to the farm house to tell the director what happened and the film ends.   I have always wondered how he did this. He should have never walked out of his house into the woods at all. If he did that, and he had a girl chasing him, I think he should have been able to just run away. But he does not have the girl or the camera guy with him. He has a little girl walking away with the camera man. He then runs out of sight and he does get a message from the producer of the movie. The producer asks him to send over the girl so he can make a movie about it. The girl turns out to be the director's girl. And that was it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot, which consists mostly of the two main characters' stories about them, has several scenes which are boring and forgettable, including one that is the most absurd of them all.   It's not a bad film, just not interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have never been a huge fan of horror movies and this one definitely did not do it for me. I just sat there shaking for an hour because I was afraid to turn the TV on or get out of bed. There were many scenes of blood and gore and it really gave me the creeps. The acting and camera angles were so out of place that you just couldn't tell if these characters were real or just the actors in a make-up show. The actors were all good and I thought that they did a decent job but this one just got a little over-played.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is very bad. It's a bad remake of a bad cult film, but it has the same old cheesy effects, and it's only about 10 minutes long and it doesn't have much humor. The cast looks just like the actors in the original film, so they don't give off any vibe at all.    You can't make a good remake of such a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie. I was watching this one and the only thing that made it a better movie was the fact that I watched it in my underwear, it was so hot. Not very good acting, some poor dialog, terrible plot and terrible acting. A big fat waste of a movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the mid 70s, this movie was made when people were very superstitious about the weather. They all feared it would rain, but it never did, and in fact, there was one day when the skies were clear and it was a gorgeous day. Then in the afternoon, it started to rain and everyone in the movie theater thought it would turn into a disaster, and we went to see it.   The rain began as the camera pans over the landscape, and then the camera zooms in to the theater. Suddenly, we see people running in panic through the darkened theater. The camera pans out and the whole theater is soaked with rain. Then we see the storm clouds, which gradually disappear. The clouds are replaced by white, fluffy clouds, as if it is an illusion. We get a quick shot of the clouds before they appear over the horizon. Then suddenly, the clouds are gone and the scene is gone.  The music that plays in the theater is so cheesy that you can't help but laugh, although the film is supposed to be scary.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a very nice movie. I liked the actors. I thought the story was good. There was only one thing that bothered me. This girl was really sexy, but she was not believable. It seemed like she had the same face that I saw in a video on youtube (I think it was one of the "gorgeous faces" in the series of "glamour pictures").  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is so, so stupid. The writing is so bad.   It is just a bunch of people sitting around talking about their kids and the other things that happened to them.  It doesn't even make any sense at all, not that this film could have made sense.  This movie is like an episode of The Twilight Zone  but better.  I hope they don't take this film seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't understand why the film is rated R, but the characters all behave completely like an episode of "COPS."   I'm really upset about the rating.   A film is only as good as its worst episode.  I understand that there are people that hate the movie, but when you spend more than $4 to watch a crappy comedy, you expect something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so bad it is not funny at all. The story was so bad, it was like the people were made to watch this movie. The people were so dumb, they did not know what was going on. The film made you think this was a real movie and no one was really making this up. A great excuse for a bad comedy. The movie is just a bunch of dumb people that act dumb and not real.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is too badly made, i think it was the director who did not know how to use a computer and use 3D. The action scenes are terrible. I know this movie has been made a lot of times, but the acting, music, and effects are all terrible and not to mention the bad camera angles.   I'm not giving it any stars because I really want to see another one, but it was really bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a rip off from the first one by the same director. I mean, they even have the same script, they both make the same mistakes, they also both made bad movies. They don't even try to be interesting or anything.    It is just a rip-off of the first movie.  I am not surprised by it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The cast for this movie is all very average. I like to think it is due to the casting of the movie. I am not sure if it is their fault for not being more skilled actors.  I wish the movie was a little better.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are looking for an action movie, then this movie is the movie for you. I loved the action and loved the explosions.   There are some scenes that are very well done. I really enjoyed the action scenes in this movie.  My favorite is the chase scene after the car explosion. It was very well executed.  I enjoyed this movie alot and i have watched it several times. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a terrible movie.  The actors all looked bad. The dialog was terrible. It was so bad I was afraid to watch it.   I would never see this movie again.  A bad idea that should never be made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main theme for the movie is a young boy wanting to look good for his step-father. If you watch this movie and don't pay attention to the character's comments then you will think that the movie was made to be about this.   I thought this movie was very poorly made. If the movie made a sequel that would have made more money. I am surprised to find out that it is still on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a very poor movie.   It has one of those terrible movies that you can't look away from.  In the beginning the movie doesn't even have a title.  The plot is a bit haphazardly thrown together and doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.  First, the main character is a boy who is killed by a car while taking his girlfriend (played by a woman) to get her hair cut.  Then the girl turns up to tell her mom that her father is dead.  This does not seem like the type of story a movie should be about.  Also, this is a movie where the killer looks like a man because he has the same type of hat as the guy in the car.  I found it hard to believe that this was really about this boy and his girlfriend.  They are very quick to make her look like she is being held up by someone who is after them when it seems very clear that she isn't.  What happens to the character is also very odd.  He is supposed to be dead and the girl is supposed find out about it and come and get him.  After she finds out that his body is not at home, she gets his mail.  There are a couple of scenes where there is a lot of blood and a lot more of the main girl.  As if it weren't enough, the girl says her father was an alien and that he died before she was born.  No matter how many times I look at this movie, I can't figure out what the movie is about. There is no explanation for why the killer is after the couple.  It all seems to make sense at first, but then the movie goes off the deep end.  For a movie that is made to be for children, it really is an atrocity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not usually a guy who can get excited about the opening of a new horror movie but, I absolutely LOVED this movie! It was an amazingly eerie movie, even though it is not a slasher film. I enjoyed it! I think it was great that, as a young man, he was actually afraid of being attacked.    What was scary about this movie was the way that this young man acted. His body language and how he was staring at his killer.  This was a movie I watched so many times. It was a creepy movie with some pretty scary scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was pleasantly surprised with this movie because it was different. It was a great action film and it was so fun. The stunts and scenes were really exciting. I was really scared when I was watching this movie. My boyfriend and I had a great time watching this. It did not take long before it was over and we were waiting for the next one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was good, I liked it, but it's just not that great a movie. It just has some good moments but not a lot else.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was not a fan of the film at all, and even with the flaws, it doesn't hold a candle to any of the other films in the series, but I'll give it credit for being at least "good". The characters were bland, the acting was terrible, and the acting on the TV show was terrible. I was too busy wishing they'd cut out the "Oh my god! This is the last shot we'll ever see!" "OH MY GOD!" "What is happening?" at the end of every scene.   The film was so over-acted, and made so much about the characters that I could not care about them.  This was not the movie I had expected at all. It was so pretentious and so full of cheesy dialogue and cliches and I just had a hard time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think this was a bad choice. They should have done something to take out the bad words.  It seems like an out of place joke but they really need to do something different. The characters don't have the right personality to be funny. They didn't have anything that they were likeable or a lot of potential.  This movie was bad from the start and didn't get any better after. It was a fun film that you could watch over and over until you get sick of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love the film, the music and the acting is just perfect. The one thing that I thought was pretty annoying, the characters all had their lines very quick like it was to get through the scene quickly.   The film is very well done, but I just did not like it because of the quick lines. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie a while back at a screening at my local theater. It has an odd kind of charm to it that I didn't really notice at first. It seemed pretty tame compared to the kind of stuff that goes down at these things. My wife and I got to talking, though, and we were talking about how the guy from this movie was supposed to be the best fighter in the movie, when he really was never the best. But then she pointed out that there were some characters who did have great fighting abilities. It was kind of a funny joke, but also kind of true. The story was okay, though.   If you love fighting films, you will definitely like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was bad, but it was still worth watching. The acting was awful, but the bad acting was a result of the script being awful. The movie is filled with stupid action scenes and characters that have no clue what they are doing. They all act like they know what they're doing, but they don't. This movie would be okay if they had had a better director or if they didn't think that all that acting and bad action would sell the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When i first saw this movie i thought it was a terrible horror movie. I thought the story was very silly. After watching the movie i still found it very funny and made me laugh out loud.   A very enjoyable movie with a great cast of actors. I highly recommend this movie to any horror fans that are looking for a good laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am really really disappointed that there are only 6 bad horror movies that are released on the net and that it took the combined efforts of a good actress and a good director to come up with this garbage, this has no talent whatsoever. I hate to say this but it is the worst horror movie that i have seen in a while.     - The acting was bad. The female character did not even look human to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a complete waste of time and money.   The actors are all in terrible shape and the dialogue is absolutely dreadful.  The director of this film is an unknown who never had any acting experience, as if he had been hired by a local production company.  Even for an unknown, this should have been a disaster.  I really wonder why there aren't more films like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a complete waste of time. I was so interested in seeing this movie and I thought it would be some kind of homage to the great westerns. The only problem is the acting is terrible and even the actress playing the lead actress looks nothing like her. The story is the exact opposite of what I would expect a Western to be.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a terrible movie that got worse as the film went on. I will never watch this movie again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was never a fan of horror films but this movie was good. I thought it was the type of movie where you could really get sucked in and then you'd start to think "oh wow, that was pretty darn bad" after a while. But it was just so cheap looking, ugly and the acting was just bad. It's just kind of a generic horror movie at best, which is not a good thing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film with my brother who has the same age as me. I did not like this film, it was the same old horror movie. There is no gore or anything really special, you just watch it as if you are watching a horror movie from the 70s.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A terrible movie. Nothing can make it more annoying than this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't want to hear another film about this guy   The director is a bad director for not making a better movie about this.   This is an expensive movie for not being worth it.  It is a very boring, dull movie and it takes up a lot of time.  I want to see the director's other movies but not another movie like this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you want something to get in your head for days, this is it! This movie is so bizarrely weird that it is a hard thing to describe, and I don't even know if I'm describing it correctly. This movie should be banned in a country, and not just because the content is so sick that a child would find it entertaining. This isn't a film you can watch on TV without being freaked out, and it makes no sense! The way the people in this movie act is just bizarre, but when you see what goes on behind the scenes of what really happens, it gets even weirder. It's a really strange movie with a weird plot and a weird way of acting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you're an actor who wants to play a character like an adult, with an inner life and feelings, then this is not the movie for you.   I thought the film had a very unique premise but I'm not sure that is even possible to do with this type of film.  And I guess I was so caught up in watching this film, that I forgot that it is actually a terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While the movie itself was a fun watch, it ended up being a little disappointing.   It's not as bad as some of the other B movies I've seen, but it definitely isn't as good as some other B's that I've been to see.  While I was entertained, the story just didn't interest me and the movie didn't have any originality.  It had so many things that are done before and it didn't really add any new ideas to the film.  Even the characters didn't seem like they were going to do anything new.  I don't think this was as bad of a movie as some people made it out to be.  The plot is nothing special and it was predictable.  If you are looking for a good movie to watch with your friends, this isn't the one for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film has several scenes where a character sits alone in a room, only to suddenly be killed by a hand. This movie just isn't very good. The actors do a terrible job at portraying someone who is so mentally ill they are literally insane, and the plot is very cliche.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My dad and I rented this movie from a movie theatre the first time it was released in 1980, but we never returned. This movie's never been anything more than a bad memory and one that I had to get out of my mind. I always thought the actors were not the best, but this was the first movie I saw that made me want to watch it all over again.   I remember the movie playing at the movie theatre on a Friday night, but it got a lot less crowded and the screen had a different picture every night.     The film opens with the hero in an alley, with the girl on his right and her boyfriend on his left, and as he is walking back to her house, he is accosted by a gang of teenagers (a young Patrick Swayze, who had just been cast in the film). He is beaten and robbed, but escapes and heads towards her house. The girlfriend is nowhere to be seen, and the boyfriend goes back to the gang.  Then the girl arrives home and discovers a bloody hand print on her front door.  After that, the film's plot and characters are only given brief, vague descriptions. It is not until the end of the film that we begin to understand exactly what is going on in the plot.  This is one of those "one-day wonder" films that were very cheap in 1980 (I have seen several of them). It was made in Canada, and there were no American or other foreign releases in theaters.  The movie is not good, but you have to remember this was one of the first "low-budget" movies to really take off and the director, Jim Sharman, was able to do it all by himself and still had a budget of only $3000. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best part about the movie was the "real life" part. It was actually an honest to goodness thing. The guy didn't even try to pull a fast one on the kids by having them stand in the bathroom. He was actually really nice about it and said hi to them when he walked by. He also helped them use the bathroom and put a towel down when they were finished.   He just kept smiling and smiling when he was doing it. If you do the same thing, you'll always have a positive experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very good movie with good acting, but it is a long movie and in the end it's hard to follow.   Very good script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is NOT a great film!   The actors are all very good and are entertaining to watch, but the director wastes too much time and goes through a whole film trying to "make it seem more important".   It is actually a pathetic attempt at "serious" filmmaking that doesn't work very well at all!  They spend all the time trying to make it look like a "serious film" with all this crazy lighting and "realistic" costumes, but it's never even close to that.   We have a great crew of actors who all seem to be having a good time on set and have the time of their lives, but as a whole the movie just isn't good enough to have me excited about seeing it again.  The "bad" actors in this film are the ones that make it seem like a very real film, but really, it's just not.  It seems the director really thought this was going to be the next big studio movie, but unfortunately it just never came together at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that it was too long and too boring.  For the first half of the movie, you would think that you are watching a normal movie about a real life family.  However, it became clear that the director was obsessed with how real life looks like.  The director even added his own music to the movie.  This movie needs to be played in 3D.   It really made me feel sad that this movie had so many mistakes, but I guess it is too late to remake it.  I hope that this can get a second life someday in a horror movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was ok, maybe it had some plot holes and had some of the actors/actresses look a little off, but it's a good action movie and the stunts look pretty good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story, characters and acting were good. The music was not. This movie is very good in the beginning but then it starts to deteriorate with a couple of sub par performances, poor story and terrible acting.   I really hope the director of this movie gets his ass together and makes a better movie, because this movie is bad. I really want to see a better film from him. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   For me the movie is horrible, the plot is bad, the acting is bad. But the thing that is the worst is that every single movie they put in front of me is good.    This is the best of the bad ones, it shows how the movies are made nowadays. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's the most boring film i've ever seen. It's all over the place and is just kind of boring to watch.   I had seen this film on tv a few years ago and I hated it.    This was a really bad idea.  - - - 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a total train wreck.  It has nothing to do with the movie at all but the actor who plays the part of the father in it.  This actor is the worst actor I have ever seen and it really shows how much of a loser he is.   It is the movie of the year!   Don't watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film, the worst I have ever seen in my life, had no redeeming qualities at all. The lead actor is a wannabe Bruce Willis and this movie is just another attempt at a Bruce Willis film. The script was terrible, the acting is so bad you would think the actors would know what they were doing but the actor's didn't know when to quit. The film is so full of bad acting and acting so bad it is hard to believe the director gave the actor enough money to make it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best part about this movie is the music.   It is so bad that if you are trying to watch this movie with people, you might as well watch it in a dark room because you might get sick.  The music is so poor that it almost sounds like someone is talking to you.  It reminds me of a guy in an old-time western movie.  I'm not sure if this is the sound that is used for an old Western film or if someone just took some recordings of some old western film and then put it in an 80s western movie soundtrack. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I heard this was based on a book and the book was amazing. The acting was great. It was funny. I didn't understand a word the movie said.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A horrible film that's over the top and doesn't make you want to laugh at all.   I thought this was a bad film all along. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was just about to give this movie a perfect score until I saw the way that it treats the black character. The lead was just some thug, a thug that I feel was just there to set up some action sequences. The action scenes were all good, but when you watch it back you can see that the main character doesn't even really have any fighting skills. Just a simple scene where he was in the back of a cop car (that looks like a tank) and there are lots of cars chasing him. It makes me think that the film's producers decided to cut some scene from this film, because they felt that it would be better if they made the audience believe that the guy is a real thug.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I saw this movie I did not expect it to be as terrible as it was. I mean, you can not expect an A-grade movie to be good. The acting was so bad, the plots were stupid and the acting was ridiculous! This was just so stupid! A movie about a woman and her dog, that have a little disagreement over a bowl of soup and a dead cat? I was amazed they even did a movie about that! This movie is just so silly! The acting could have been better if the actors were not just as awful, but then that is the way this movie was. The plot is stupid and this movie is supposed to be a comedy, but in this movie they are both acting as they would if they were making the most boring movie! The only good thing about this movie, is that there is the odd scene where the dog has a moment of wisdom.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is absolutely awful   I went to see this on Christmas day and left disappointed   The acting was so bad it was embarrassing. I really don't think there was anyone who actually cared about anything that was happening in the movie   We didn't even get to see anything of the cast.   Everyone was just there to act and the whole movie was just the two characters (Tucker and Crenshaw) talking   Not much was actually going on in this movie and we never got to see any of the plot lines   This movie was made for the silver screen   There was no reason to waste the money and it was a waste of time too   Overall   2/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie I think the director should have at least filmed more of the scene where the guy is on the phone and the kid gets up and starts banging at the door, to make the whole scene look more intense.  It is almost as if the director thought that the audience could never get a good look at the kid at that moment.   The movie's only saving grace is that it makes us all wish we had someone to give us a hug, because we are all hurting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My girlfriend and I went to see this and the only thing we loved was seeing the whole cast in the same movie together. The whole cast is great but we loved it more because we saw the whole movie together and it was a nice little treat.    We went to the theater and when we got there the movie just wasnt showing. The screen was too dark. We thought maybe the movie was showing at a different time or was going to be on during a different part of the night. No one told us that it was showing a little earlier but it never showed so we started walking around and realized that no one was showing it. That's when we found out there was no movie to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a good movie and i had a great time watching it. i have seen it so many times over the years and it still looks good. i will still give it a 9 because the writing was not all that bad. i can't believe that it took the director a decade to make a movie that looked this good and looked so good at the same time.    My only real complaint is the poor acting. i think it was a mistake for the director to cast all of these actors. i wish they would have cast more actors who could make good movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this movie to watch with my friends and have fun.  The story is ok but not that entertaining or interesting.   The acting was all very cliche.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen a lot of bad movies in my life, and this one was terrible in every way. It was boring and not entertaining at all. This movie is nothing more than a poor attempt to make a blockbuster movie. What they should have done was call it "Rage of the Planet of the Apes" or "Planet of the apes" and made it a different movie for the rest of us to watch and enjoy instead of a stupid and uninteresting horror movie. The people that produced this movie didn't care about any of the original characters, they just wanted a hit on the box office and that is it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a good movie, but it is boring and dull, and it has nothing to do with the original film and it is completely devoid of humor.  It was written to be a western, but the actor played by Jeff Bridges is not the best that has ever done it, it is the same kind of actor who is famous for playing tough men and criminals. The writing in the film has not been done well, there are no great songs, but even with the bad songs, there is no real fun to it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am a fan of the series so I was excited to see the new movies on BluRay but I just couldn't get into them. It just wasn't the same.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad flick. The acting is laughable.   The writing is also laughable. The plot twists are not believable.  It's just too bad. It's a very dull flick that lacks any kind of depth.  The pacing and action scenes are all way too fast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that this movie has some good ideas but they got way out of hand in execution and made a movie that's not only boring but almost worse than watching it. The main character is the weakest link in this film as it's obvious that he's mentally not right but the story doesn't have enough tension to pull you through this. I think the director is too inexperienced for this film and he should get out more and do some movies with more creative directors.   This film is one of those things that you see and then wish you could watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was too cheesy.   I was expecting a really good movie about two women and their dog, and this was a cheesy movie, with the same bad acting and writing.  I didn't care for it at all, but I didn' want to see it any more.  It made me laugh at the wrong places. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was going to see this movie as a birthday present to my nephew, but was put off by the length of the movie and the fact that there were multiple actors on the screen for almost the whole movie.   The acting is a little flat.  I wasn't able to connect with any of the actors in this movie. Most of the characters, even the "villains" had nothing going for them.  The story isn't very interesting.  All in all, a boring movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you have not seen the movie, you should know the plot is nonsense.  The "Hollywood movie" of the "The Great White Hope" is a complete load of crap.   I saw this movie for the first time when it was in the theaters. I was really surprised to see this movie.   The plot is a bunch of crap from beginning to end. The movie is really a fake movie made by Hollywood.  I think the film was shot for the "Rocky" movies, but it was completely shot with actors and stunt people.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The main problem with this movie is the acting. The only thing that could make this movie better is the writing. I don't mind bad acting but, when the acting is that bad, you're in for a very bad movie.   It's not a great movie and it lacks the fun the first one had but, for the movie, you can still have a great time watching this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was very bad here. I would not recommend this film. I do not think there is a good reason to watch this film to begin with.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "special" movie (only one in a movie, I know) that shows "The Hobbit" (in 2D) on TV is not a "special". The movie is mediocre, but it does not deserve the title "special." The story, acting, editing, sound effects and special effects are all horrible.   It is a very poor movie and the acting is terrible. This movie will probably not be watched or enjoyed by anyone, because it is just so bad, it is not even worth watching.  The characters were all extremely over-acted (as well as poorly) and none of the actors played their roles. (I mean, even the dwarves were just mumbling.)   This movie looks like it is made by a bunch of high school kids and they are all just talking.  It has no acting, music, scenery or effects that were really needed, which is why it is a bad "movie."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen this movie three times.   It's a very poor movie.  The acting is so bad it's hilarious.  They use cheap makeup and effects to create an old man and a young girl.  I don't want to say the acting is bad because it's not. But the writing and direction are.  If this movie was on a tv channel in the 1980s, the audience would see something completely different.  This movie is so cheesy and terrible.  These two actors act like they're on a bad sitcom.  As for the ending, well it's over.  It has nothing to do with the plot and it's a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is just not very good.   The characters are all just pretty much useless.  There is not even a single believable part of the plot.  The actors are very stiff.  I had to look at the subtitles to make out any of the dialogue.  This is one of those movies that has some great music but no actors.  Some people may enjoy this film but I didn't really care for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this and it sucked.  It was not funny, it wasn't entertaining.  This was just a bad attempt at comedy.   It was boring and not funny.   This could have been great if this is the worst that someone would come up with but not great.  I'm glad that no one took this seriously.  If anyone had made a comedy with this premise it would have been hilarious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is awful! It is terrible at everything. The story is bad, the acting is bad and it has horrible acting in general.   There were many other bad movies on this release, but this movie is on another level. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film "Star Wars" is the most profitable film in the history of cinema. This is one of those rare films where you see people getting rich, while the average Joe is left holding the bag.   As the film progresses, the plot slowly drifts and it is obvious that this is an attempt to take the plot out of the original Star Wars film, and insert it into the prequels. This seems like it would make sense, but the movie seems to be trying to do a bit too much.  Some things, like Leia's voice, seem more suited to a radio play than a feature length movie, and you will often hear George Lucas say lines he was supposed to say, but couldn't for some reason. This film is a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I first read the plotline for this film, I was really disappointed, I thought it would be a very "unoriginal" and boring story. I couldn't get into this movie. The main character played by Bill Murray is really nothing special and in my opinion the whole thing is just another "horror comedy" with the plot being a bunch of cliches and clichés.   Even though I found the story interesting I just couldn't watch it, it was too slow, I kept thinking that it would slow down after a while but it didn't.  I didn't care for the movie because it was just another boring "horrror comedy".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am so sad that I am forced to give this a 4. I felt that it was just a bad attempt at a movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The movie has one of those cheesy, but well-intentioned, "weird" endings. " "You are in a weird, twisted world of alien abductions and strange happenings. "   Very "Weird" for an Alien movie.   There are many scenes that don't make sense, like a few shots of the actors talking in tongues while they perform.  In addition, some of the acting is pretty bad, especially by the main character, who appears to be a teenager.  However, I guess if you go in for this type of movie, you won't be disappointed, especially for the price. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is shot by a great guy named Bob Hall. It is shot like a Western but at a time when a western was shot like it's going out of style. This is not to say that the film is bad. It does have some good actors. I just wish it would have made more money in the 1950s and had the actors with more brains. This movie is too simplistic to be of much entertainment. The actors do not act at all. The only one that seems to have any kind of depth is the young woman. She is never in the scene and is not in the movie for more than 10 minutes. Her character is so shallow that she is a complete blank. I will give this movie a C-. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a very boring film, nothing to do with the previous ones and i didnt like the movie at all. I think it is the same story with a few added scenes that dont add anything to the movie. If you like bad films then this is the one to watch. I wouldnt even recommend this for a teenager.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first half of the movie takes place in a bar, where the guys talk about the different types of alcohol they are drinking (Molly, gin, scotch, tequila), and one of the guys gets drunk and shoots himself in the head. This leads the guys to question the validity of the suicide attempt and the reason why they are out at a bar in the first place.   There are some great scenes where they question their friend's credibility (for instance when he claims that his brother is an astronaut), and their investigation of what led to his suicide and his car getting stolen.  The only thing that really sucked about this movie was the ending.  It felt like they were just waiting for the main character's car to be stolen and then they kill him.  (Note that the film was released in 2002. The date on the film could have been incorrect.)  The other problem with this movie is the fact that they put in a lot of action sequences that would normally not be needed in a comedy. The action scenes here are so ridiculous and unbelievable that they make the movie less funny and more dramatic.    I have not seen any other comedy movies that feature scenes like these. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When the two stars come back to the front of the movie - and it is in the final scene - it is the greatest.   My rating of four stars - just for the scene where the two women are in the room together, it is a film for those who have been watching a lot of horror films since they were little. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A great movie about a horrible man. I enjoyed the film and found the acting to be good. It's about time someone told the story of an all-around good guy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you don't like horror movies in the vein of Night of the Living Dead and The Exorcist then you've missed out on the most frightening movies of the past 20 years, so I won't even try to justify this one.   This is an almost perfect example of what a good horror film is supposed to be. The movie starts off very well, with a very well done shot of a car approaching a cemetery. This is the perfect time for someone to come out of the shadows and attack the car, but when we cut to the car we find out that the killer is inside and the driver can't drive and won't stop.  At this point it becomes even creepier and the killer becomes more insistent on his plans. We cut back to the cemetery, and when we come back up to see the car being attacked the killer has been stopped by the police.  Then, as we cut back and forth, we can see what is happening to other people in the cemetery. The people in front of the car are just standing there and watching while some are being tortured by an unknown evil. The next person to get attacked is someone that we know and has had a serious relationship with (that's why we know this person).  I think it was the last scene where we see him on the street, so the killer comes out of his shell again and we learn that the man is actually a priest and his son is one of the people in that cemetery.  It's a great way to get the killer, and his motives, out of our hair.  The pacing of this movie is very tight and very creepy. It all seems so natural and when the killer gets to where he can't reach a victim anymore he goes and finds a new victim to torture.  One of my favorite parts was when the priest is being beaten with a broomstick and the only thing that is going through his mind is, "Is this really happening to me?" The movie never over does this and it makes this an extremely creepy film.  I don't think this movie will ever make it on to the big screen because it's just not as scary or as original as some of the other scary movies out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing is that the movie isn't made by Hollywood, that's nice, but it looks like a lot of people who have no talent tried to make something that looked like it was made by an American Hollywood movie. The story is boring and the actors are not very good.   There's a good script and it should have been a film, but this is a film that doesn't deserve to be a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like it. I like the ending and the ending wasn't bad. I do think that the bad acting in this film is awful. It's not the acting, the acting is bad. And that goes for any film.   There were a lot of good films out last year and this is not one of them.  If you liked this movie, then you will like this film. If you didn't like this movie then don't waste your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't understand why there is such a hatred and resentment for the original version.  I agree that there is too much swearing and violence.  It was fun to watch, but there were times when you just felt like the movie was going out of control.  One thing I did like about it was that it was an "adult" movie.  The music was more of the type that a rock band would use (although I'd never heard of the group before).  The sex was more like the kind of sex you see on T.V.  This is the kind that has the most sex.  There were a lot of scenes that were too sexy for me.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It had a lot of promise in it.   And it was very well acted.  But   the final product was not good at all.  In the end, it just became too obvious that the author was not interested in writing about the real  world of the war in Europe.  The "heroes" are either ordinary soldiers from  the German Wehrmacht, or  the elite soldiers of the Wehr  who had no chance in combat and were  just pawns for the whole "scheme."   The movie just became an excuse for the author to go off on a "wild ride,"  that left me confused and disappointed.  There were no real characters that  went through the real hell of the  war.   And there are no  real scenes of the fighting  or of the actual events of the battle.  This movie was made in a totally different time that the actual  war. And there were only about  one or two  actors who are really good in this movie.  A couple of the other people are also kind of annoying.  Even some of the scenes in this  movie  were staged and not very "realistic."  There is no real action or excitement in this, and there is no suspense.  Instead, it becomes more of a show and not an exciting  movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a horrible movie. You are treated like a child, especially when you start to scream. The film doesn't have much, but it has some funny dialog and some great effects. I was a little disappointed after reading the reviews, but the movie itself is okay. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really love this movie and am so glad I found this online.  I love the fact that this movie is actually real and you see it from the point of view of those who were actually there.   This movie is an example of how horrible people can be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't expect to enjoy this movie but it's the second one that I've seen in the last year and I don't really want to watch a movie that I disliked. It's basically just one big disaster and one of those movies that is a lot of fun to watch but is hard to watch with your friends. I have no idea what the director was going for except to make a fun movie but that's all it is.  The story is pretty much the same story as a couple of other horror movies that were released at the time (Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, etc...) but it just lacks anything to add to it.  There's not really any gore at all but it looks like there was.  It really just tries to be a horror movie and you can't help but laugh as the characters run away from a guy who is trying to kill them.  I don´t know if you want this movie or not but I didn´t enjoy it and I was a little disappointed that I couldn't enjoy it with my friends.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this movie in a theater I really didn't care for it. It just had me feeling uneasy. I felt like they had over exaggerated things and I didn't feel like it was true. It was a movie that made me look at the way movies are made today. It didn't have much to offer me but it definitely left an impression on me. It took me back to the movies that I remember growing up watching with my dad. It wasn't the greatest movie but it was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was very poorly made.  There were times I was just standing there thinking "why did I bother watching this crap?"   If you watch this movie at the movies then don't bother to read the movie synopsis because the movie just doesn't make sense.   I was watching this movie with a buddy of mine at a movie theater in a hotel near our hotel.  I had just come off a plane from somewhere in Asia and was exhausted and was looking forward to a good sleep.  We had just finished watching "Rocky IV" but decided to watch the movie as it came out.  The movie had just opened and it was time for us to unwind.  Well, we had to watch this again in about a half hour.  By this time we both had just about completely passed out and this movie just made it worse.  This was just a bad mess.  And what was the point of this movie?  I guess it just had to be a sequel to "Rock of Ages"?  The plot was lame and all the characters were annoying.  So many people were in this movie it felt like an episode of "The Incredible Hulk"   It's a shame that someone was even forced to go through the trouble of making this crap.  If anyone is going to make a movie like this again then make it about a girl who tries to become the greatest rock star ever.   Not some woman who is in a rock band.  It was fun at first but eventually became boring and unfunny.  In the beginning the movie was fun.  For a while I was actually laughing at some of the people in the movie but after a while it just got to be old news.  It is like watching "The Godfather" with a bunch of annoying, over-the-top characters and terrible dialog.  Some people in this film are even worse than the mafia boss.  They are so much better at their job that they don't need a bodyguard and can make out with the girls they go to clubs with, and they can wear the most ridiculous clothing and makeup.  My favorite character was the character who was the worst character in the world.  Apparently she was in an acting class and her dad paid for her to take the class.  She also has a voice like a baby's.  Also, I thought it was funny that the gangster's sister had been working at the same job
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While I know there are many great movies to watch on the big screen, I always go for a great local film or a local television show. I came into this film expecting nothing but to laugh at it, but it was completely different than what I expected. A little bit funny at times, but never a slapstick or comedy. There is very little violence and there is even a great, touching final scene that makes me happy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie once in my early 20's. I was really impressed by the acting talent in the movie. There are a number of great actors that were there for this movie. The only actor who was not very great is James Earl Jones. I believe he was paid a lot for this film and I believe that the money was used to pay off some of his debts.   After seeing this movie I never wanted to see it again. The acting is terrible and the script was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went in expecting a bad film, I know this because I went to the same theater when it was originally released in 1988. I was right...this film was terrible. I have watched all of the Star Wars prequels and I have not been able to stand this bad of a movie. The actors, George Lucas and Mark Hamill are completely miscast in this movie, and the dialogue is just awful. There are some decent scenes here and there, but overall, this is just a terrible movie, with awful acting and dialogue. It really is one of the worst Star Wars films I have ever seen, and I hope it never comes out on DVD...that would be the only way this movie would be improved.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A terrible movie about a great American hero. All the main actors did not have the skills or the personality needed to play the parts and the only reason for the movie to be in theaters is that it was one of the first to show the world that a black man can beat up a white man in the ring.  It was only three days before the movie was released and they didn't care. The cast did not do well and the story and acting are completely forgettable.   I hope you get what you paid for because if not, it is the same shit you have been seeing on television for over 10 years.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The script is terrible, the acting is terrible and the whole film is an embarrassment.   It's an excuse for the director to say he's a "poker player" but in actuality he is only pretending to be so.  My favorite scene is the scene with him and his sister when they are eating their food, then they go to the bathroom.  They were really cute together, and it would have been nice to see their mom doing the same.  The rest of the movie is just bad.  This movie was a huge rip off of Casino. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just got the movie off DVD, and I didn't expect much. This is probably the only film I have seen where the actors are all on-par, but it is not a bad film, just a little amateurish. The acting is decent, but not great. In fact, a few of the roles were really terrible, but none of them were funny. I have been watching a few action films lately, and this film is pretty much the worst I have ever seen. Not one of the characters is believable, the plot is completely contrived, and even the special effects are pretty bad (one of the weapons looked like a cheap prop from an old horror movie).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The director needs to get over the idea that his films are going to "turn out well". I guess he thinks that people are stupid enough to go and see this movie. I did, I saw it at a theater at which there were a lot of other movies, all rated over 10. So I just gave up at the first bad review that came in and went home.   What was supposed to be a good comedy about a girl who is getting her head bashed in is a complete disaster, and I'm sure the "studio" thought this was going to be good, but they just don't know how to do comedies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        I think there is a lot of good and bad to this movie.   When I first saw this movie it had a lot to be impressed by.  A very nice looking movie from what I've seen.  The acting was great.  It was clear that both sides of the story and actors were being told their story.  I really enjoyed the movie and did not have a problem with it.  As I said, I enjoyed watching the story of a man who was the captain of an attack plane.  This movie is pretty good at telling that story. It is a pretty good movie and it is definitely worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so bad. The acting is bad. Not only are the people making the film bad, but also the people watching the movie. I found myself laughing every time there was a fight, or even when a guy jumped out of a train, the director is a really good actor. But the film is so awful, I have never seen anything like this in my life. You would never see this film on TV. It would be so bad, and I would have to go and buy this movie. It is a shame because I thought the film was a great idea.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed the movie, it looked like a great idea for a film. However, it didn't work at all and the plot was terrible and there were so many flaws with the acting, production and writing that it just all fell apart and was boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film has a problem. The acting is so bad it makes the film itself uninteresting.  The actors aren't bad, they just aren't very good.   The plot is also bad.   This is the same character from the previous movie.  They just recycled their plot.  They didn't change it, they recycled the plot. It would have been better if they had made this movie into a comic book.  I'm not sure why they went down this route, but it's a mistake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is crap.  I wish you'd had a chance to see the first half before you watched this. It was terrible, and made by the same guy as the original. He just didn't know any better.   If you really like a certain genre, or a certain director, you might like this movie. But I really don't think it is worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "Star Wars" trilogy is such a mess. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The characters have no personalities, they are all one-note. The special effects are terrible, but that is not even worth mentioning. It would be more than enough for someone to watch this for a laugh, but unfortunately, this is a bad joke of a movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was not impressed with this movie at all. The film was shot so far in the future that we could have been in a Star Trek episode. The actors are acting as if they are the actors of the day and not actors of today. It does have a funny and somewhat clever script but the characters are so over-the-top that they could have just been taken from a video game.   One of the most entertaining but ill-advised attempts at a comedy in a long time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really liked this movie, I think it was a good movie to make. The movie had a good plot, but a lot of things that were happening were pretty cliche and not very well done. There were some scenes where the characters were just repeating what they did in the previous scene, I felt it did take away from the movie because they were repeating their roles. The other thing was how all the people who were with them were saying some things that seemed totally made up, or just a way to make a point. If you watch it and you think that it is just a poor attempt at a film, then by all means, go watch it, but if you want something better, then stay away!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't see this movie until after seeing  John Dies at the End  and  The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.  I had read the books and knew that this movie was going to be a bad one.   This movie was made for the "children" who wanted to watch scary movies like The Omen   and Nightmare on Elm Street   but with more nudity and a little more gore.  The "gore" was all fake and didn't even look real.  Some of the scenes where characters were being cut in half and being torn apart was done with a very bad special effect but they still looked bad.  I found it really funny that the girl in this movie, as she goes through the town and kills all the people who look at her, looks at her and laughs.  This was the type of movie that kids like to watch when they are younger but not good.  I found this movie a little on the silly side and really should have stuck to the books. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst horror movies i've ever seen. The story and acting is awful and the only way that this movie could've ended is to show a horrible death scene, but not only that it showed the main villain raping the heroine.   The most disturbing thing about this movie is that not only did the movie not manage to get an R rating but it got an MA rating.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're a fan of horror movies or even just action movies, you might enjoy this one. But if you like to chill out to the music of Pink Floyd, this is not the movie for you.  It's okay for a summer movie but nothing amazing.   It is a fun movie that you might have seen a hundred times and you'll never see it ever like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        The cast of characters were all so different and I couldn't get used to them all and so one of the actors was always annoying me.   In the movie they get the wrong end of the stick. The film is so much better as a feature film.  The movie starts off so well with a good action scene and then it gets bogged down in characters that I never liked.  They had to make the movie darker than they should have and the film never got going.  A movie like this shouldn't have taken a director who had just won an Oscar for "The Last Waltz" and yet the movie was just as bad as the director wanted it to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film twice as a little kid. My mom had been looking forward to this as a gift for me, but she was never the fan of the movie as me. She thought it was a stupid comedy and that it was kind of boring. The other times I had seen it, my dad would laugh and call it a good movie.    It was not. The acting was awful, the acting in the original film was better, and the film as it is now has been remade and has been on many best of lists. This is a bad remake. The dialogue is awkward and clunky and the characters are not likable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film has so many problems. The first movie they tried to make a sequel from this film was called "Lil' Cajun". They couldn't really get any of the original cast together, and it was a terrible movie. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. The rest of the movies they made from it were all awful. This one was even worse.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is very vague and the main character is a complete non-entity. He is not likable, and he is not believable as a person. I have never seen a more flat and boring character. If you want to see a "serious" film about a war veteran you are better off watching an "action" film than this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My favorite horror film of all time! This is the only horror movie that is scarier than the film's name. It's not as scary as "Halloween" is but it's still a great movie. I was expecting to see a scary movie with blood and gore, but instead I was treated to a very creepy and spooky flick.  I also like "Saw" better than this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really liked this movie. I enjoyed watching the movie, and I liked the movie.   But it was very confusing.  What you thought was a good movie turned into a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an extremely silly film.  I didn't understand the story line at all.   I felt it was just to much of an over long film to watch, and it was hard to watch.  This film was made for a laugh.  It has really nothing to do with real events.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have been waiting years for this to come out, and now it's finally here. I had this when I was growing up. I still have a soft spot in my heart for it. But it was way too long. And I'd rather see another movie than re-watch this. I do think they should do a remake of this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting is okay, but you are expecting more than it gives you. A lot of time is spent on character introductions and you don't really get to see a character, you are just expected to believe that they are the main characters. The rest of the movie is a train wreck of bad acting, bad jokes, and horrible writing. If you like bad movies like this, this is for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only thing that bothered me about this movie is how it ended.   I understand the intention to get the point across, but to show the point onscreen for 2 minutes without making the audience feel any emotion for the characters or the world they live in?   This could have been a great movie had the writer realized that and spent more time telling the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's not a lot of surprises in this movie. It's about a cop (the same guy we see in "The Warriors") who is called in to investigate a murder and his investigation takes a dark turn.   This movie was made at a time when "cop movies" were being made on a fairly regular basis.  They didn't bother with the plot or the details.  The actors didn't seem to be paid very well.  I think it would have been better to have made a film like this in the 1960's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I heard this movie while on a trip to New Orleans and watched it on my couch while I ate a pizza. I loved the movie, but the acting was so bad.  I thought it would be cool to meet the man behind it all, and so I watched the film in the hopes of finding the man's identity.   It was a waste of time.  If you want to see something great, you should watch it on a great screen.  It's just like any other movie with actors who look like crap and not as good as they look in the movie.  What a waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got this movie for free at a used video store so I knew it wasn't going to be any good. The worst part is that it is only 2.5 stars because it is a really fun flick that is not very good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've never seen the movie it doesn't look that great.   The acting isn't bad, it's the direction that's bad.  They're actors and they're giving the best performances of their lives but the film as a whole is just dull.  I was expecting a better movie, but i'll take a boring movie over anything good ever again.  This was a waste of time, and it's hard to believe that the guy who made this movie ended up being an Oscar winner for a movie that he was the one that threw away.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is very slow, and has almost no plot. The only story that really develops is that of a man who is in love with his ex, and this is shown only in very odd ways, not like a typical love story. I know that in real life it's not easy to fall in love, but in the film it's the same thing. The other characters are not shown much either. They are not needed. They make the film run very slow because they don't do anything. I think that they should have added more action in it, since most of the film is really slow, boring and pointless.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the beginning of the movie, the director tells us how he will not use any kind of CGI because he is afraid it will ruin the image of his movie. I was surprised how much he was right. I have not seen the movie for several years, but it is clear to me that some of the CGI look fake, and it was very difficult to understand why they were needed. The CGI of the giant, but strong and very ugly, and the people in the film, who are not even humans. There is a lot of violence and sex in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a terrible piece of garbage that was not needed by the studios in the 70's. The special effects are so terrible, it's almost as if the studios just pulled a movie out of an old movie.  The main character is a very boring man that just wants to be left alone, however he's followed by some "troll" characters that he barely talks to. They are all evil and are all just as bad as each other. The trolls are all very mean and all want to kill the main character, but the movie never really shows that the trolls are evil or mean. This movie is bad and I wish it never existed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie and it is a bad remake of the 1970 classic.   For those who haven't seen the original version: This movie has an interesting premise and concept. The main character has his consciousness wiped by a brain dead person. Then he wakes up in a new body in a strange town with a new identity.  The only thing that remains is the memory of the new identity and he needs to get it back. He can't get that back with his memories because they were erased by an unknown assailant.  I can't see how this can be successful.  But, if it is well made and is made on a low budget, it could work.  There is a scene where the main character runs through the woods. He meets a guy with a rifle and he turns out to be a former police officer.  This could have been the main plot if that wasn't just silly.  It is a very poorly made movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure what happened to the original concept. The idea of an alien invasion seems to have been scrapped, so I have no idea what they did with the plot. The film has some great special effects that make it look better than it really is.   If you're looking for a fun sci-fi film, then it's worth a look.  It's a shame that it didn't get a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worse movies I've ever seen, and for that matter, a bad acting movie in general. This movie is about a guy who has to make a bad choice in order to have his life changed forever. He must give up something that is dear to him in order for it to be more important in the future. It's pretty much a waste of time and doesn't even really have anything to do with the rest of the movie. He is constantly told what to do and it never seems to affect him in the slightest.   This movie should've been released at some point on VHS or DVD, it's terrible and has no redeeming features whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was not a good movie, it has a good plot and a good ending but the acting was poor. The acting was all wrong in this movie. The movie is about a small boy named Ben who lives in a house with his two younger sisters and his Aunt Emma. He is constantly teased by his older sisters but he just gets away with it. They never catch on to him or tell anyone. Ben is always alone and doesn't talk to his sisters. The boys in the house always tease Ben about his looks. Ben becomes very sad and depressed. One day, while his Aunt and Aunt Emma are out, Ben sneaks out and starts walking around the streets with a cane in a depressed way. He was obviously having a heart attack. His Aunt and Uncle see him and ask where he is going, but Ben just gives them his cane and walks off into the woods. That's when his Aunt falls and is hit by a car. This starts Ben on the road to depression.   It was very sad, the actors did not look happy in this and it was just so over acted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My son came out with this movie and was not at all impressed.  His parents took him to this and he said it was the worst movie ever.   If you are looking for a "bad" movie you are in the wrong place, but this is NOT the movie for you.  SIDE NOTE:  At one point in this movie, I was expecting the guy with the guitar to be like the old John Lennon/George Harrison or something.  I really thought he was.  That was the only part of the movie I enjoyed.  Overall this movie is not worth the time it takes to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the beginning it was good, then it was bad. Very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love the character that was made for this movie. The voice is amazing.   The only thing that I did not like was the fact that the car and the girl's car was shot on a cell phone, it was very shaky. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a disgrace to cinema and I will never watch this movie again. The only positive part is that the ending was interesting and I was impressed with the special effects.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is just a total waste of a good story.   It has some cool effects but it all comes off as cheap, phony, and unoriginal.  As the lead, Scott Adkins is just as phony as the rest of the actors.  He can't act!  It's a really fun movie, but not worth the time and money to watch it.  I was not looking forward to watching it either, but I'm glad I gave it a shot and actually watched it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original film "Alien" was such a great film.  The new "Alien Covenant" is not even a film worth watching.  For the money you spend on the Alien movies it is not worth a dime.  It is so cheap looking.  This is not a Ridley Scott film. They are trying to cash in on the "Alien".  I have seen many "Alien movie" in the past.  I love "Alien",  "Alien 3" and "Alien Resurrection".  They are really not that bad films.   I will buy the film if it is available on DVD.  " Alien" was made in 1979.  Now they are trying the reboot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have heard many good reviews of this movie. I would rate it 3 stars but for some reason, I had no interest in watching it. If you really want to see a good action film with decent special effects and action, then by all means, GO WATCH THIS FILM, it is not as good as other action movies you see.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really looking forward to this movie, it is a great adaptation of a very good book. I'm glad I watched it, but I had problems watching the whole thing. I never found it convincing in any way and my expectations were low and I was expecting more from the movie. It just didn't feel like a good adaptation at all.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most idiotic movie I have ever seen. It has the most ridiculous plot. All of the characters are idiots and make absolutely no sense. This is just a bad comedy that takes itself seriously all the time. The acting is awful. It is all one-note people that seem to have no charisma or acting ability whatsoever. The dialog is so bad it sounds like it was put on the radio. It really is just one of those movies that has been made over and over again but people keep seeing it and just want to see what the newest version is. I could not care less about this movie or the actors because they are all horrible and not even worth laughing at.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best part of the movie is the main character, Tom.    He has an awkward personality and he keeps things under control, even when he's doing something he shouldn't be.  It's a great character, it's so nice to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My girlfriend saw this movie once in theaters, and was not impressed. We walked out and decided not to see it again. I think the director's script was written to create the feeling that you were at an amusement park. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, even if you are looking for something fun and funny. I would stay away from this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was awful. I really don't know if the director was sick and thought it was a good idea to make this movie and I didn't watch the other 2 movies I had already seen on this site.  This is the movie with the most awful actors and the worst looking actors.  The only actors that looked good were the ones with horrible looking faces, but you really couldn't tell that by looking at them.  In the movie, one of the characters is trying to get rid of his ex girlfriend and gets a new girl in exchange. In the first movie the girlfriend was a little more beautiful and in the second one it was more like they added a new actress, but the actor looked the same as the previous guy.   The girl looks like a teenager and the way she talks and acts is really weird.  My favorite part of this movie is when the girl is having a seizure and the doctor comes to look at her. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie more than ten times and I still get the same feeling. It's so repetitive and monotonous. It will never be a good movie to watch again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film starts out with a bang but it gets a bit boring after a while.   We meet a young girl who is searching for her brother but can't find him. She has been told that he has gone fishing in the sea and hasn't returned home. She gets a call from his father who tells her that he is on a fishing trip in New Zealand.  Her family begins to panic and goes out to look for him. They follow the fishing boat to New Zealand and find him on a beach.  He was fishing and they found his body after a week.  The ending of this movie is pretty funny but it doesn't really get the movie going.  It starts with an amazing chase sequence that is very cool.  Then we have a cool chase scene where we see a car driving around on a highway while in the background we can see boats in the harbor. The car comes to a stop at a gate and the driver goes over the top and speeds off.  A police officer follows him and then they chase him into the bay and he goes to the bottom of a big ocean wave.  This chase scene has so much energy to it. It shows how dangerous chasing cars can be and how hard it is to catch someone who is running away. The movie is fun and I enjoyed it.  There were a few scenes where I wished they had filmed them a bit differently but that is the way the movie went. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this movie off the Internet from an Indian guy in Australia, and had to pay an extra $2,000.00 in taxes, fees and shipping. I have never seen a movie so poorly acted, and all the actors looked like they were on drugs, including the director who looked like he just took a hit from a pipe. I was watching it at a hotel and the TV was on, so I could not stop looking at the actors. The poor actors were terrible, and I think they would have looked so much better if they had gone through a real acting school. The production was poor, and this movie is about a rich guy, so the special effects weren't worth the $2.00 they cost to make. The ending of this movie was very cheap and not very believable, and the ending of the movie was the reason this movie would never be rated an 8.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really wanted to like this movie but it was all crap. I had no idea who would play the role of the guy who lives alone on the moon. The people he meets and the people he hangs out with make no sense. I thought they were playing a joke on us. When he goes to the moon to meet the guy he's after, his friend makes him feel terrible that he had to leave her behind. When they get back he's so depressed that he starts shooting at his own spaceship (no, it wasn't a laser pointer, it's a real spaceship that he fired at a couple times, it was the most stupid thing I've seen in years). When he gets back to earth, he's in a coma and is on the verge of death. So there's some kind of a joke going on there that no one in their right mind would understand. I think we are supposed to think they were all just being funny.   This movie was just bad. The acting was just terrible, everyone was supposed to be so bad at their lines that I didn't even pay attention to them. This movie is so bad I don't even want to watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie when it first came out. I was in the mood for something silly. After seeing the trailers for it I was excited. I knew it would be a pretty good movie but I never expected to hate it.   This movie has bad acting, bad writing, bad acting and bad writing. It's a shame because the movie is so stupid. The movie's humor isn't funny because the writers didn't know what they were doing.  They all seem to think that if they can make something that is entertaining by telling stupid jokes and making it a comedy then it will be a laugh out loud.  This is the worst movie I've ever seen.  I would never recommend this movie to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is not the worst but it is a little boring. It just is.   This movie is just the first in a series. The sequels are even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For what it is, this movie was fun, but it just didn't have the heart to be great.   And while it may be "cute", it was not a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am a huge fan of the original Star Trek (1966) and its first feature film, The Motion Picture (1979), which both I and my father were lucky enough to see in the theater on opening weekend. Both were excellent.  The first Star Trek made a huge splash, winning over new viewers and bringing back a sense of wonder to the franchise, while the second film, even though it had some good actors (Barry Williams, Robert Scott, James Doohan, Nichelle Nichols, Michael Forest, and Christopher Plummer), also had its share of weak material (William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy) and the director, Nicholas Meyer, did not know what to do with the franchise.  After this disappointment, Gene Roddenberry took some time off and then returned with a series of uninspired, poorly conceived, and not well-written episodes, such as "Plato's Stepchildren" (which I still don't like), and "Mudd's Women," which I would have preferred to have seen in the movie format. After seeing this movie, my only hope is that one day Paramount will make another Star Trek film, because this movie was a complete embarrassment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie sucks. The main problem is that it makes no sense. The story is poorly explained and doesn't follow any plot. It's completely incoherent and has been stretched to suit their needs. The acting is awful and doesn´t match the actors. They try to make it seem like the characters are having a great time by having them acting like they are in the wild with the animals and having them talk about it. This does not match up to reality. The only time they are even remotely in a real environment is when a group of soldiers is sent on a mission. I didn't understand how the mission went, what was going on or why it was set up the way it was. It took me over 3 hours to figure it out. They have no idea what they are doing. There is no actual action or drama. The movie is just a bunch of random events. It really doesn't have any point.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In no way shape or form can I recommend this movie. It is horrible. The acting is terrible, and the characters are so stupid that they don't even seem like people, they just sound like they are. And it looks like they filmed this movie in some crappy old warehouse in the desert, or in some creepy mansion in the middle of the woods.   A woman named Lisa who is supposed to be in her late 30s, but looks younger than her age, comes to the aid of an elderly couple who are being assaulted. Lisa is clearly a man and the guy who assaults her is clearly an older man.  What is even more bizarre is that the guy looks more like a man than the guy she saves. The older guy is described as being about 6'5" with a full head of hair and no facial hair, and in this movie he has no facial hairs at all. He looks like a guy from another planet who has spent all of his time in the past decade or so in a desert.  When Lisa gets back to her hotel, she immediately gets drunk because she has seen a guy who looks just like her husband, and she is determined to see him again.  The only problem is that when she finally gets there she learns that she has been replaced by another woman.  I've seen some really bad films and this one ranks up there with the worst ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie takes place in an alternate history of the USA where the government has decided to put their troops in the field and put the economy on auto-pilot so they don't have to worry about having to pay for the military's expenses, because a recession would kill their profit margins and they can just cut their tax rate and save a bunch of money.  I guess this is the first of these "war-on-terror" movies that make us think that all the bad stuff that's happening in the world is a conspiracy of the government.  And yes, it is like that, but the story is really pathetic.  The cast was all pretty good, but they didn't have any of the charisma, or charisma, to carry the story, or to make it seem believable.  One of my least favorite characters was the cop that runs the undercover program in the movie.  If this movie had a more original plot, then it might have been worth watching.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie at the theater in Los Angeles and was completely unprepared for what I was going to see.   The movie is about a group of people that go up on the roof of the World Trade Center and take off a piece of the top of it to show to the world.  The rest of the movie is a little slow paced and not as exciting as I expected.  While the plot is interesting, the movie takes a long time to get there.  All of the actors look great in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a mediocre movie with terrible acting.  The ending sucked.  I don't recommend watching it, because it has terrible acting, but you should at least check the trailer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was awful. It was so much less funny then it looked on tv. I saw the movie twice. Twice the movie was better then the tv show.   This movie was so bad. It wasn't funny but it wasn't terrible either. The movie never explained what was going on. It took the story to a new level. It took a movie about an evil genius to make it better.  The villain's henchmen would get stronger each time you watched it.  I am so glad this movie isn't out there in the world. I don't think it would be allowed in a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want a fun popcorn movie, check out the movies starring Paul Newman and Chevy Chase.    Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find any good movies that have either of them in it.  I hope someone will find a decent movie by them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible!   The movie is about the first time my brother and I got to watch "The Empire Strikes Back" together. It is funny and a good time. The only thing that makes this movie so bad is that most of the cast did not have any acting experience at the time. It also didn't help that they put in so much dialogue (in the movie) that it was confusing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is pretty cool and a little off kilter in terms of the story, but the acting is solid. If you are a fan of the film, you'll probably enjoy it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie for some reason and the cast was really annoying. I didn't care about any of them so I kept looking at the credits.    The film was just terrible. There was nothing good about this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know if this is even a good movie or not. There were some cool effects and explosions that got me excited to see what would happen and I like the setting of the film and the acting of the leads. It is just so poorly written that it was frustrating to watch. I understand that some movies are better than others and this is a movie that is just...ok.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie for the first time as a kid, and after that I only saw it sporadically. It always was the same exact plot of an alcoholic (who loves alcohol) who drinks too much and drinks himself to death. There was always a funny/sad/cheesy plot line with a very dramatic actor (usually Bob Crane), and the bad movie ending. This movie never gets good reviews, even though it was released just before the great "Titanic" in 1986. I know the original ending was a lot better, but it was also the first movie I ever saw with a drink thrown in my face, and then I never saw another movie like that in my entire life!   This movie was made on a very low budget, and it's clear from the actors' performances that they were underpaid.   When I saw it, it looked like a bad dream.  The ending of this movie is the most horrible, terrible thing I have ever seen in my life.  If you watch this movie, please do yourself a favor, and just go to the first "Tron" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a joke.   I'm not sure what the joke is with the title and the characters.  There is no good guy.  If you are a woman who goes to these films, you better get a life!  It is almost funny, but it just has to stop!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a little disappointed in this movie. I expected more from an action movie. It's good to see a character in this sort of role. It is definitely a good movie to watch, it is just that the acting was horrible.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is so not funny, but the writing is just horrendous. It makes the movie ridiculous.  I don't even see how anyone could actually get this movie to work, as it's so bad it's ridiculous. It is the worst, dumbest, most nonsensical movie ever. The best part of it is the ending...it's so cheesy and stupid and I just couldn't even laugh at it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love this movie.   But this movie is terrible.  In fact, the movie is so bad, that I have to warn you that there is a scene with an orangutan that will leave you with the need to hold your nose.  I have never seen orangutans in a movie before, but this guy is way too big, he is so tall.  The orangumans in this movie are stupid and annoying.  But the bad guys are really cute, and it looks so nice when the guys fight.  One of the guys is named Daz (he is a monkey), and he was the star of another movie that was called  Monkey Man.  He is voiced by Bill Paxton, and he has the most perfect laugh and is a lot of fun to watch.  And the baddies in the movie are pretty great, especially the one that is named Kuma.  Kuma is a big bad, and his mouth moves so quickly, that it is impossible to follow what he is saying.  He doesn't speak very well, but when he does speak, he sounds really cool.  His voice sounds like it came from a cartoon, and the way he says the word "kuma" is perfect.  When the action gets to be a bit too much, you know when they are making a mistake, and that's exactly what happened in this Movie.  This movie was so bad that I am thinking about getting the DVD so that I can watch it again and again, but that would be like watching an old movie with some bad actors.  If you want to see an ape fight with a guy in a gorilla suit, go and see  Jungle Book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was one of my favorite movies. It was fun, lighthearted, and well made. The characters were all very likable.   Unfortunately, it was made with cheap studio money. A bunch of poor acting and not nearly enough direction. I guess they were trying to imitate the hit tv show. The movie ends on a cliffhanger, and it's not explained who got killed and who survived. If they made a sequel to this movie, I would watch it with fresh eyes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I have seen all the movies this guy makes but this one was just awful. The acting was very bad, the editing was horrible and it really just took away from the film. I wish I could give it zero stars but that would be an insult.   I think this guy is a terrible director and this was a waste of his talents and time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A low budget production with no talent, it really is a bad film. The actors are all terrible. The story is all a little cheesy and unoriginal. I hate to say it but that is really the only reason why this movie is so bad. If there is a film that I would not watch, this is it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a very bad movie and if you like bad movies, it is not worth your time or money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's some really bad acting in this one. Everyone is acting like a child and you don't have to be a child to notice. I am going to guess that the director didn't care to have the actors sound natural and they sound like they were just doing it to make the movie interesting.   This is also one of the worst movies I have seen. The acting is bad, the acting is fake and the actors don't know their lines.  It's as if the director thought, "Oh, it's a horror movie so let's do it like one", and the acting just sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The director didn't know who his stars were in this movie and kept switching them on and off. He had no clue who they were and the actors had no idea who they would play. When they did finally get on camera with the director it was not believable they could act.   I wouldn't watch this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    -   When I saw the poster for this movie I thought it was going to be the next "The Hunger Games". I saw a movie in the theater the day it was released, a good movie at that, a really good one, but I thought that the poster was going be so much more interesting. The movie looks great. The actors are good, the sets are great, and the costumes are gorgeous.  However, when I was on the plane to fly out to see it, I found out that the movie was actually not all that good. It's a movie, you know. It looks great and the actors look amazing, but the plot of this movie was all over the place, it just wasn't that entertaining. It was just a long train of excuses that never made much sense.   It is hard to be objective when the movie is so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing better than watching a good movie is watching a great one, and I can safely say that the actors are awesome.  The movie is basically a series of scenes in a church with a bunch of actors. The movie itself is ok, but the actors give the actors and the story a sense of realism that I've never seen before.  It really reminds me of movies like Goodfellas, which I always thought was great.  I'm going to give it 3.5 out of 4. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went to this movie with the hopes of seeing a horror movie that would make my blood boil. Instead, I was treated to a movie full of clichés and tropes. The story has a lot going on, but the writing never really flows and makes the entire movie a struggle to follow.       There are no truly scary scenes, and there are some great performances, but it all comes off as too over-the-top, like the entire film is about a man who wants to scare people.    This isn't a terrible movie. The actors were all good, and the story is interesting, but what really kills the movie is that it never really gets scary.  The actors and the camera never take any time to give you a proper scare.  When it's at its most scary, it feels forced. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a great movie, but I had high expectations, and what I got was a dud. Not only that, but the director was so bad at directing that I felt bad for watching the film, and the acting was really poor.   It was a great story to be told, but this was a horrible picture, and this was one of the worst film of the year, and I really hope it doesn't get more made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was so much better than the movie. I thought it would have been funny but it was really depressing.   I'm disappointed that a good movie has been ruined by terrible actors.  The acting in the movie was bad, it was hard to understand the characters.  There were many scenes that I thought were written for someone else, they would have worked better if it was someone else.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I have ever seen! The director's cut is terrible and not worth a watch at all! I just wish I could have avoided seeing this. I'm not sure how I even missed it as it was at a multiplex that I've seen several times. It was just so bad and embarrassing! This movie was a waste of the talents of the actors. It is just awful.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In many ways, it is the story of a young man that becomes disillusioned with the world and his own identity. He begins to question the importance of relationships and self-esteem. He even begins to wonder if he is actually human.   It's the kind of film that I'm sure I wouldn't have liked as a child, but now I look back and I see how wrong I was.  The music and the acting is wonderful, but the fact that the movie is so one-sided, and is so bad, was a real surprise. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was really fun. The script was funny and made me think the movie was a parody of it's own kind. The movie is really entertaining and fun to watch. It does not seem like the actor who plays the lead had a lot of acting talent. However, it was a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think this movie is very bad, but I am glad I saw it. The actors do not have much in the way of chemistry, and it makes the movie seem like it is filled with characters that do not really mean anything. The movie starts off with a scene where the female lead is having sex with her husband. The husband seems to be enjoying the scene very much, but the female leads husband gets upset and goes off to get his gun and shoots both of them in the head. I think the guy who played this guy was a terrible actor, and the actress who played his wife was the most annoying woman in the movie. It looks like the guy and the woman were having sex while watching the whole thing.   The film also seems to try and make the female main character look like she is not much older than the men, and I guess they wanted to make sure that people would not look at the film as a lesbian porno. It is not. It has it's fair share of lesbian sex, but it is very much about a woman who is doing something that she does not want to do. It did not take long before the director made his move. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie, the only one that came to theaters that year.   The script is weak and the movie itself is crap.  In this movie you can see the writing and screenplay had been done already.  I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing that Hollywood doesn't understand the people who don't want to see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you want to watch something that is "interesting" then you can find out what the movie is about with a little help from the internet. It would have been better if it was just "interesting". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had this movie in high school and loved it. I was only 17 and loved watching it in the theater when there was nothing else on TV. Unfortunately, the remake is not what this original was and will only disappoint fans of the original.   While I'm happy for those who watched the original, I think most of us have grown out of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is so bad it makes me sick. It was horrible. The characters were really boring and didn't do anything interesting. This film has everything that's bad about the movie that you'd expect from a bad low budget comedy. You'll see people doing all sorts of wrong things. I hated this film. I really wanted to like it but I couldn't. It's a really bad movie and is worth only watching if you want a laugh.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    " The worst thing   is the fact   that it   feels   fake   It   looks   like a cheap imitation   of  "The Hobbit"   Even though they are trying to make it  like "Dollhouse".   So  I  think   they should give it to "The Avengers".  It's   bad   And it    will   make   people   think that they   made a great   movie.   But   The only  good thing is that they were not able to make a real  "Fantastic Four"  movie, because they were still trying to be Disney, because I do not understand that they think that their movie can beat "The Fantastic Four" movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a bad film about a real people.   The story is a bit strange (the main character is a vampire, which doesn't explain his behaviour very well), but still doesn't really have any plot, so we don't really care about what happens.  The cast in the movie is really boring.  They don't show us anything, just some shots from the vampire's point of view...   They all look like they are doing their best, but it's not enough to convince me...  I didn't like this movie at all... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was the first film I watched in my lifetime and I must say I'm not fond of horror at all. The story seemed very implausible and it really makes me question the validity of its script. I found the gore very unnecessary and it felt like an afterthought and not as good as the rest of the movie. The acting was very lackluster as well. I would not recommend this movie to anyone as it is very weak and not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did not enjoy the movie. The cinematography was horrible, the acting was terrible, and the movie was boring.   There were two things in the movie that are completely wrong.  The first was the music in the opening scene, which was supposed to be the opening sequence of the film, instead of the credits sequence, as it was supposed. This was very distracting.  Secondly, when the police and the killer (who was supposed the killer of this woman) meet in the bathroom of the hotel, the killer was supposed be holding her in the bathtub, but he just held her in his arms, which just seemed to make the scene look even more boring. What an absolute waste of time and money.  I would suggest not seeing this movie unless you want to be reminded of the worst film I've ever seen in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Sick" is a movie I've never seen, but I've been told about it and I think the cast in the film are talented. The acting is not that good, and some of the actors seem to be doing it just to get into it, but the performances in the films aren't bad either, so the movie isn't bad by any means. However, I was not enthralled by it.   If you're looking for a fun, goofy, entertaining movie, this one isn't it. I know that this movie was made as a spoof, so it was only intended to be fun. But, the movie was so cheesy, and the acting so horrible, that it wasn't funny at all.  I just don't like seeing movies like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    " I don't like this film at all. It was boring, and the actors who were cast in it were all terrible. I didn't enjoy it at all, but if you're looking for a cheap thrill ride with a cheesy ending, then this movie is for you. It's like watching a bad bad movie. The movie starts off with a bunch of thugs running around and then there's this helicopter that blows up a bunch of people. You never really see what happens in the helicopter.  You just think it's going to blow up all of these people. Then after that, we see this other movie about this helicopter, and it's a little bit more exciting and there's some explosions, but then this other guy shoots the helicopter down. This guy had just been in jail, and so he was crazy and wanted revenge. It didn't make any sense to me. Why would all these people be there at the same time? What was their relationship? I just felt like I didn' t care.   This movie is one of the worst movies I have seen in a while. It is so bad that I can't believe people who were involved in it still work in the business. If it is just some amateur shit, then I hope he goes into the production business and stops making movies.  " -  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie and it is a sad experience to watch and watch a film with some good actors and a great script and have the movie ruined by a mediocre story. This movie just felt so cheap. I never heard of this actor so I was expecting him to be better. This guy doesn't get any more interesting as the film goes on. A bunch of really cheap lines from this actor that aren't worth his lines are thrown in just to keep the movie going. If you are really going to watch this movie be prepared to go in expecting to see a cheap movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a piece of crap. A big studio movie that needs some time in the can and should be forgotten. The actors who appeared in this movie are all terrible, they are terrible. I hope that they all get a divorce from the studio and make movies of their own.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm sure my wife and I both enjoyed the film immensely, and it certainly is entertaining, but this movie just seems to have a problem.  First, the acting is fantastic.  So many wonderful actors and actresses do a great job here, and I love how they all work together to make this movie, one of the best of the 90s.  For some reason, however, the film, with all of its excellent performances, just seems not to have the same impact that other films of this genre do.  In fact, it just seems like an afterthought.  It's obvious that the filmmakers had to cram everything they had into this movie.  But that is a shame, because this film really should be at least on my top ten.   So much great action, but very little substance.  If you are looking for a good 80's movie with great acting, good action, and great production values, this is the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought it was a wonderful story, I found myself laughing out loud throughout it and the acting was great.    The movie was just too long to watch in one sitting, I think it was over four hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved the movie but it was a bad idea to make it this way.   It was very cheap, just cheapness and cheapness of making it like this.  The director of the movie did not know how to do this and just gave a bad script and a bad direction.  It is not funny and it is just a bad joke to make.  I do not care much about the movie because it was just for nothing.  When it comes to the bad movies this is the worst and it just did not make any sense at all.  Also, it is not good at the acting and the music. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is the story of an old retired guy that is slowly being driven mad by the memory of the man he left behind him. He has been trying to get back to the person that he was, but his thoughts are all too real, and the memories of the old guy are so vivid. The movie makes this so much more real.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only thing good about the movie is how well the two actors do their respective characters. The other cast are awful. They did nothing special. They look like they were made out of clay. It's terrible, they look like puppets and look like their acting was written by someone who didn't even watch any movies. They were made to look like an old, dumb woman and a little kid. The acting was so bad, in the beginning the movie looked like it was going to be like a science fiction movie and the actors couldn't act. After that it was like they looked at all the movies they watched to try and improve the acting. It really made the movie look like it wasn't even trying.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just bought this movie off the internet for $20.00 dollars. It has nothing to do with me and nothing to offer.   They did a bad job of creating a bad story and they only want to make money on this movie.  It was a complete waste of time and money.  They should have just gone to a real movie theater and made something entertaining, but instead they wasted their time and millions. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a shame that these two mediocre movies had to exist together.   The production was not terrible, but it was not good either.  The acting was fine, but the directing was very poor.  The only one that stood out was the lead, and even then, I would have preferred a stronger character like the lead in the other one.  I didn't know if it would be worth seeing because of all the problems, but I guess I'll have to watch it again on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this movie more than once, and every time I do so I am left disappointed. The movie is very forgettable. I wish that they would have filmed the scenes where they have to escape, and the whole time in the woods in the back of a limo and put them on TV. This movie would have been so much better if they had put some of the characters on tv in the limo, or something! I will not watch it again!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film at the Cinamatic and they were running it with a live action segment. I couldn't even make out the actors that were doing the lines. The movie itself was pretty awful. I saw it the day it was released and I would not have gotten it in a store. This was the same film that came out and turned into a huge box office hit. This is the kind of film that I usually don't even bother with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a bit funny at times. I don't think I'd like this guy's attitude much. His whole attitude is just a big mistake. I just thought it was a funny movie. I didn't really enjoy it, but it was okay.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was so disappointed. I bought the "Legends of the Fall" for the special effects. I was expecting the film to be a little better than it was. I expected more than the typical garbage that has been done over the years. Instead, it just wasn't up to the standard that I was used to and I could not get into it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is so poorly made that it is embarrassing and offensive.   It is an imitation of a famous movie and it is really terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie the day it was released. My daughter saw it the day after it. I would have given it five stars had it not been so poorly produced and edited. It is a very low budget movie, and I have a hard time believing it was shot in that fashion.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a pretty poor movie for the time. I can't think of anything better for the money.  It wasn't bad at all, but was just sort of silly.  In fact, I would've liked it more if the director and actor had tried to be more realistic in the acting.  And I still don't see why the "macho" cop who's never been beaten would beat up a 12-year-old. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has a story to tell. And yet it has no direction. The movie has characters who are all kind and good. But in a movie this bad, there should have been someone to point this movie out, especially after watching this movie 3 times and still not finding a single point.     This movie has so many things going on, but none of them relate to the characters.  The movie tells us that this is the day the world was saved, but no one really tells us why and it's not explained how, no real world events or people.  They keep adding stuff to the story that doesn't really add anything.   When they show us the picture of the old man with no nose, they say it's a real thing, but when it says that the old folks in this movie lived in this neighborhood, there isn't anything about where they lived or what time frame they lived in.  There are so many details to the movie that are simply not mentioned or explained.  You can tell this movie was never intended to be a classic.  It's a bad, bad movie that you will never watch again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is bad   It is just bad, I mean horrible   I mean not great, but it is just... I guess in the movie business we call it bad ! I mean this movie should have been called: The Worst Movie ! It really is terrible, in every way possible! It is a pretty bad idea for a movie for kids, with all these super hero themes, and then it comes out with a super robot that kills people in a city! The movie tries to make it look like there is some danger, but this movie really is just like: !   Now, I have seen other bad movies in the movies I have rented, and they all were not even as bad as this, but still... This is just, it really is not worth the money to see.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked this movie. There's something that makes me want to be in the background cheering "Yes!", but in reality, I'm on the outside looking in. The acting is good, and the characters are interesting. The plot didn't seem very original, but the characters were so interesting, that it never bothered me.    But this movie is a train wreck.      The movie starts with a great, dark montage that reminds you of the first half of the movie, in which you feel like you're in a war movie, and there's something very tense, and realistic, in the way that the two lead characters are fighting.  The music is great, and is the same as the montage, it has a great feeling of tension, as if you're on a train, going fast, and watching the faces on your fellow passengers in terror.  As soon as the movie is set up and set up to have an epic climax, things start to go downhill very fast.  There's a sequence where one of the main characters is fighting a giant man, and they both go down.  This happens very fast, too fast to be believable.  It's very obvious that the characters and the film are going down the tubes.  I'm not saying it's bad, but it's not very good, at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A mediocre movie with an average script that didn't make me laugh or feel moved by the characters.  The acting was mediocre, and the plot was very simple.  I've heard of the movie, but it didn't bring me to the theater.  It's only 4 stars because I really enjoyed watching it and the movie didn't bother me, but I don't think that I'll watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So, there is an alien in the film, but it was really more of a CGI version, which just makes it worse than it was.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My wife is very picky about movies, and she hated this. She would not allow me to bring it to her since I don't watch a lot of movies (my wife is a major movie snob and a little snobbery is normal).   The only redeeming factor for this movie is the performance by the lead actress, Linda Fiorentino. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love this movie.   The best thing about it is the way they capture the vibe of the movies and the characters.  They captured the essence of those movies with their music and that's it!   All the other movies have done this and it just makes this movie stand out.  But, if the movie had been edited into a one hour and forty minute special, it would have been perfect.  That's my main issue with it.  I hate when the directors can't do their own editing and just do their thing.  It doesn't look right.  If it was edited into one hour, it'd be perfect.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It has all the hallmarks of a cheap B movie and the film's producer makes the mistake of making it into a B movie. The ending of the film is a "what the hell" ending. The actor who plays the sheriff in the film has no business doing a film with a killer. It's like they tried to kill the movie with all the acting errors.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was great until they ruined it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a lot more from this film. After a very pleasant viewing I got tired of all of the acting and scenery. It was very dull and boring. It's just boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a good movie. It's a bad film. The dialogue is so awful. The acting is awful. This is a film about a guy who can't stand this guy. It is one of those "you see it here first" movies.  This film is a nightmare.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        This movie had many flaws but it didn't take me out of the theater!   I liked it, it was funny, but that was about all the things I liked.   The acting was great, and most of the characters were just as good as the actors and some more.  The directing was ok, but I think it had more of a director/writer and actors team thing going on with this one.  As for the ending, I guess it was just a little too out there and it took away from the overall movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie. This movie is a joke, and has to be seen to be believed. The story is very bad and the actors are terrible, especially the "good" actors like Paul Sorvino and Al Pacino. The characters are all made up. I don't even understand what is going on. The only "plot" is the movie has no idea what it's doing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason why this movie is a trainwreck is because it takes a train that has no chance to be successful to train it to run on a track and it runs too fast. The special effects are absolutely laughable. I guess you could have an action scene in this movie, but the best that happens is the actors have to get out of the way of a speeding train, and the camera will follow their every movement for the duration of the action scene.    This movie should have been called "Bust a train full of people"   A train wreck of a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A good horror movie that had potential. It has been done so many times, it seems very similar. The special effects are pretty good (not as good as The Mummy (1932) but good enough for a horror flick).   The acting is pretty good. I thought the lead girl was an OK actress. The monster was pretty scary. I'd love to see another director make this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am still not over the ending of this terrible movie !    The story is bad, but the acting is not!   The only thing that can be a redeeming factor for this movie is that I remember a girl, named Michelle, that was in the movie.   In one scene she is in the background, but at other scenes, like the one where the guy and the girl are fighting, she is there for her acting.  A shame, because the movie is a piece of trash, and I feel like the acting was not there enough to save the movie  .
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director is a very bad writer, he has no idea how to write action scenes. the action sequences are too slow, he also uses the same action shots every time he uses them, it gives the scene a boring feel.   I do like the idea, i think the actor did a good job, but if you watched the movie the first time, you would probably think there was more action than there was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible movie. The movie is about a group of kids who pretend to be aliens. They spend a lot of time looking for an alien and when they find it, they do an action sequence. The alien is a complete asshole and starts fighting with the kids. After a fight, the alien kills all the kids and throws them to the bottom of the ocean. The kids don't get any of the money they were supposed to get. The only good thing is that the alien's parents are really cute and pretty.  The actors in this movie are all really bad. It is kind of hard to believe that they were in a movie that they hated so much. I have watched it on TV and it looks horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best part of this movie is all the people talking, but at the same time it sounds so loud, it makes me feel sick.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this movie with the idea of a romantic comedy. The romance is not there. There is no chemistry between the leads and the story has no real plot. The acting is terrible. The only good thing about the movie is the music.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm a big fan of sci-fi, and have seen a lot of them. I've never seen a movie that was as bad as this one. The acting was bad. The CGI was horrible. The plot was dumb. The only reason it was worth watching was because it looked really cool. The ending was lame and a little silly. - October 21, 2005Fukushima is a waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story was interesting and well presented. I had to go out and get it, because it was a hit on all the movie review boards. The actors were great. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with the cast. The music was also good. The action was good. It was fun to watch.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie with a great story and great acting, but an utterly terrible movie. It's all about the main character and his story - the movie doesn't seem to care about anything else. If the actors don't give their best performances, it's just a waste of everyone else's time. They do an OK job of being human, but it's all based on some bad ideas, like the guy is an alien and he's running for his life, and his parents are hiding him. It makes the movie just feel pointless.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was one of the most boring movies I've seen in a long time.   I hated it from the beginning.  I was not into the acting, which was all pretty average and the story didn't have a big twist.  After watching this movie, I have come to realize that I don't like a lot of people.  This was just a piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A low-budget flick that does not deserve to be made in America. It is a sad commentary on today's world and the American way of life, that a film like this could be made and still get away with it. It will not do well at the box office, because all of the stars are so over-aged and no one will even remember them when it is over.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the film that made me want to make a film, a documentary, about this film.  The idea, the writing, the acting was very great, but the actual film was... not.    It was the biggest failure in film history, it was a horrible, horrible film, the biggest joke in history.  I'm not gonna sit here and go through the film by the hour, the scene by scene, and the special effects, but if you're gonna make a movie about it, you should really make a documentary.  If you're going to make some kind of documentary about this movie, make the movie better.  This movie is a total mess, you don't get a better film out of this kind of filmmaking.  You could not even imagine how it was made.  What a disaster.  In every scene, it's one of these movie sets that is just horribly shot and the actors are trying to get something to happen.  How much money was spent on this film and how hard it was to get the money to make it?  This film is probably the most overrated movie ever, I still have the original VHS and it's still my favourite movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a movie that I bought from Amazon at a bargain rate because the movie was not as bad as I thought it was. The director, Alan Barillaro, is a good actor but he didn't have much of an idea as to what he wanted to do with the movie.   The movie was so poorly written and acted that it was a big bore.  It is almost impossible to get anything interesting going.  This movie was also very expensive for what it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film was terrible. The acting was bad and most of the acting was the actors that were supposed to be the bad guys. The best actor, by far, was one who played the bad guy, he was just a loser with bad acting skills. The other actors had the acting skills of a five year old. The directing was horrid. They wasted the time of a great director, John Frankenheimer, and made the movie almost unbearable to watch. I was really surprised that such a horrible film was so popular, but it was.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie does not live up to the name, and it is a very bad movie. The director tried to push the envelope with the language, and the actress in the role did not have to act out the lines because she is a native speaker. The dialogue was not very funny and the acting was atrocious.   I hate to say this, but this movie is not for people who want to see an edgy movie that is not "mainstream" or who want a movie that has a very interesting story.  I give this movie one star because it was "tough to get".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are a couple things that make this movie interesting. 1) It's pretty obvious how long this movie is going to take, and by that, I mean how much the actors are going to give us. We're given all the time in the world to spend with the cast. 2) The actors have very good chemistry. The only one that's really a bad actor is Christopher Walken, but I don't have to worry about him ever being off his game because it's all so good.    The most disappointing part about this movie, is that it was actually made in the 70s!   A real shame, because it really could have been something really good. I guess this movie has lost all of its impact since the 70's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would highly recommend this movie to no-one. I have seen many bad movies in my time, and this one is definitely not one of them. The film is about a group of four young people who have just been kicked out of a big city because their parents have been too poor to pay the rents. A group of kids come together in order to form a gang, and one by one they go off and make a bunch of money by stealing the crap off a truck and selling it to a drug gang. It starts out very cheesy, with the young people acting like they are playing a joke on the gang, but by the end of it, it is clear that they really are part of something that is beyond their understanding. This movie is really funny and it's really well-done. The acting is very good throughout the whole thing. One of the best actors I have ever seen is Jim Caviezel. He really does give an incredibly great performance, and he always looks absolutely perfect. The only problem is that the plot is so ridiculous that it's almost too hard to follow. I'm not even sure why the plot bothered anyone. The plot is very predictable, and you should have guessed that it was going to be a ridiculous film by the way the kids act throughout the entire film. The reason the movie isn't so good is because it is just too long and the acting is pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie i ever saw. It was so lame and terrible and i never want to see it ever again. There was this one woman that played the character of an alien from a parallel universe and she was terrible and she made the entire movie bad. The aliens were never shown or heard from again after that. The only characters i remember is one woman and a bald man in a black robe that had his face covered with a strange mask. And the man had a weird voice that sounded like "a female" or something. Not only was the movie terrible, it had horrible acting and writing and was just stupid. It felt like i was watching some horrible porno. And then it showed this crazy alien and he said the following things that were really stupid. "I've seen better in a movie!" "How can we know what aliens are? They could be aliens from the planet where we live!" "We have to kill them before they attack!"  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    -  - "This was not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it was definitely the worst I've ever listened to."  "This movie was really bad, and I'm not even an action movie buff! I'd never heard of this movie when I started watching it. I knew nothing about this genre of movies. Then, I found out about this movie on the web and I started to think about it! It started to become real to me. So, I decided to listen to the radio show that the man I mentioned above, made! He was talking about this same movie... I thought "Oh my God! The guy who wrote this movie must have had the most awful voice!" Then, after listening to the TV show, I thought to myself that this guy is crazy! I knew there was something wrong with this movie, because I thought that "Saddam Hussein" was not a good name for a movie! I had heard many bad action movies, but I had never heard anything so bad! It's just bad acting and bad editing! Just to give you a idea of how terrible the acting is... This movie is so bad, that it makes my heart hurt every time I think of it! A few people have said that the acting in this movie is good, but that's not true! This movie just screams horrible to me! The only thing that's good about the movie is the music. I just loved the music! I love the music that you hear during the fight scenes! It makes the scene so cool! The sound is just awful! This is a movie that you really have to see. I'm sorry to those people that I let down when I found this movie! - - - " - -
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing about this film is that it's a good time. The bad thing is the ending.   Hollywood has always put on a good show. This year, for the first time in 20 years, we have some good movies that are not so good and make you think about the things we have gone through.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how I got into this movie but my girlfriend and I were watching it when we both had just turned 21. The movie had been sitting in the DVD tray for 3 years and we wanted to re-watch it. My girlfriend started complaining about how she was uncomfortable seeing her sister naked. I just didn't understand why she hated seeing her older sister in her birthday suit. Well, I guess now I do. The acting, the nudity, the way the story unfolded...all were done badly.    This movie was a total joke and should be forgotten. If you're looking for a cheap romp watch this, it's all bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are some really bad movies out there, and this one falls under the bad category. Some of the dialogue is really hard to understand and the actors have no clue what they are doing. The acting and performances are very one-note, and the whole movie just drags on and on with no payoff. I'm sure you could make it entertaining for a few hours, but nothing more.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is terrible. This movie is filled with bad acting, cheesy dialogue, and a story that's a complete waste of time and the actors are bad at it as well. The only reason this movie is entertaining is because of the bad acting. It's not worth watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is my second time at the cinema. I read the synopsis and thought "what's not to like?" Well this was a very bad movie. This movie was made to look old and outdated and that's not the way it was made at all. This was made for a "Saturday afternoon" movie, not for people like me, who spend a lot of time on the internet and would watch movies at the end of the day.   As far as the story, the acting, the directing is terrible. The actor who played the girl who was kidnapped and tortured by a man was so uncomfortable, that I could not watch her anymore. Also, I thought that it was weird that she was the only girl to be attacked and tortured. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was terrible, nothing more nothing less. The story was a little more interesting than the movie.   There was no chemistry between the two leads at all.  The other stars was really bad and the cast was completely useless.  If you can't get over the terrible story then I would recommend this to a friend, but otherwise, don't waste your money.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's not really bad. It's just bad and slow. It has a really annoying soundtrack. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was excited to see this movie, I had never heard of it and I figured I'd be able to get a good laugh. I think they should've just had the two main characters in the same room and not have them switch off the film so much...   It's boring. The story, or the premise, was fine, but I think this movie would have been better if they just made a different kind of comedy film, or if they had just taken the plot point of the first film and then had this other guy (the one with the gun) be a guy who doesn't have a gun...  They should've taken that story and just made two guys get drunk and have sex in a parking garage...  I found this movie extremely hard to enjoy... I just wanted to get my money's worth out of the film, but it just wasn't as funny as it should have been.  I gave it 2 stars because it was funny... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie once at the theater, at the age of 18, and was completely and utterly disappointed by it. It has no entertainment value whatsoever, and I thought it was really ugly and ridiculous. It is basically a movie about two poor old women living in an old house, who get involved with an old man who has lots of money and is living a life of luxury. It also involves the man killing his two young sons (who were 12 and 10 years old at the time) and dumping their bodies on the front lawn. The movie also featured the two old women getting naked and swimming naked in the pool, and then running into an alleyway, and having sex with a man there. They also had sex with two other people in the street, while running from the police and trying to escape the man. It was just all completely ridiculous. At least it's not a movie that my husband and I watched in high school (I think that movie had some kind of sex joke or something. It's hard to remember now) and I didn't remember anything about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is such a bad film, that I couldnt stand to watch it again after watching it. I tried to laugh at it, because at first the story seems to be okay, but the more you watch it, the more the story becomes a mess. The story, like I said, is good at first, but after you watch so many bad movies, you dont notice anything wrong with the plot, but this one just gets worse and worse. And it takes too long to get the story finished. I was expecting something to happen in the story, but nothing ever does. It makes no sense, and it just gets tiresome to watch. If you dont want to watch bad movies in a long time, maybe this is a good choice for you. I would say, to avoid this film, you should not waste time on the screen with it, and then you should go to some nice movie theater and watch some good movies. I just didnt see anything good in this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never seen a bad western before I saw this, but the first half of this film was extremely boring and annoying. The whole thing is a bunch of "I love this old movie" and "Oh, this movie was soo bad. This guy must have been insane" dialog. The only part of this movie that is a real good western is the opening scene, which shows a western town in the 1920s. The ending scene was just lame.   So the movie is just about three men being chased by a crazed old man. That's it.  These three characters are not likable at all, and this "horror western" just seems to try too hard to be scary, and never manages to really be scary. The dialogue is just very lame and the movie just drags.  This is just another example of a Hollywood movie trying to be a good western, but it just doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is weak and poorly written. The actors are good, but it's all a little hard to remember who they are. I thought the actors were great in the movies, but in this it's really hard to hear their voices. The story was also a little too long, which is not a good thing to do in a movie. I don't think it needed to be so long because the actors all had great chemistry with one another, but because it was so long, it felt like a wasted opportunity.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this movie off of Youtube and I was really looking forward to it but I was not so impressed by it.   The acting is horrible and the acting was terrible for the majority of it. The writing is not good at all and the characters are all very boring.  I mean, you have to remember that this movie was made in 1998 and not like last year, when this movie would have a little bit more of a following.  Overall, I'm giving this movie a 2 out of 10 stars.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I first saw this movie, I was a bit disappointed. At first, I thought it would be a fun, fast-paced comedy, but this was way too long. I know this is supposed to be a comedy, so it would have made sense for it to have been less than the 90 minutes I thought. The characters are not very original, they only seem to exist because they are the only ones to speak. The acting was really bad. I don't think they could have had this much time in the movie without it being bad. The action scenes were okay, but not all that exciting. The only thing I think this movie has going for it is that it has a funny script, which is always a good thing. If you want something to go to at a party with friends, this might be a good choice.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie looks nice, and the actors were well done, but the story isn't worth wasting your time on.   There are other things in the movie which might make you want to watch it, such as the scene where some guy goes into the bathroom and finds his ex-girlfriend naked in the bathtub, and that's cool, but there's no character development in this movie.  It's just like a porno, nothing in there is going to make you think that this is going somewhere.  I wish they would put more work into making a great horror movie, and not waste time on what is a crap movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first film I ever saw in a theatre. So bad! So many lines in the wrong order and it takes a long time for the plot to develop. My parents were so impressed they bought tickets and then my older sister saw it too and now we watch it regularly. This film has ruined my childhood and I hate it with every fiber of my being. It has ruined this movie for me!   I am ashamed of the movie as it is nothing like anything I had ever seen or heard about! It is a very bad movie that has made a lot of money for the producers! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had the misfortune to see this film at a theater. This movie was full of cheap, out-of-the-studio, and downright terrible acting. The acting was bad for a few reasons. First, the actors were bad. The actors were the complete opposite of the actors in the original movie. The original actors looked more like they were in a movie than they did in the film they were playing. This was the case for both actors in this movie. Also, the original actors were good in the movie. I believe the acting in this film was done by those same actors. It was just a bad idea to cast the new actors.   This movie had no heart. Even the main character is kind of an idiot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "This is why they have to have the black and white." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a great looking movie. The cinematography, the costumes and the makeup is superb. It does not feel dated or dated at all. I have enjoyed all the great films from the 60's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this as an indie film and I thought it was ok. This movie just was not good, it is not bad it just not very good. The director was a nice guy and I think the writing is ok but this movie was just really bad. I give it one star out of five.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think that the acting was good in this movie, but the acting in this film was just bad. The performances of the two lead actresses, Susan Sarandon and Sandra Bullock, are just bad, not because of the actors themselves, but because of their physical appearance and their personalities.   The one good thing that this film has is that it was shot in black and white. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie that's terrible at everything! Not even funny! There are scenes that are laughable and just plain silly, and every character is just a pile of crap. Don't waste your time!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only movie I ever saw where a man was so drunk that he didn't know what to do and was making mistakes. The acting was terrible, the acting is terrible, and the acting ruined the movie.   I'd never watch it again, I'd be more than happy if they never made another one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. The plot was interesting, the actors were good and the acting was excellent. This is a good movie for a date. It had me in a good mood right from the start. It is kind of funny that the main characters in this movie are a man and a woman and they have to pretend to be married to have a relationship.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this movie. I don't even want to try to put my opinion on it. It's just a bad horror movie.   It's a shame they couldn't do better than this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I read the script and I was very skeptical because the original is really good. The new one... not so much. The main character is not so smart, and he is constantly in trouble. Even when you think he's out he just gets into another crazy situation. The director, Michael Bay, made up a whole new cast for the remake and made sure he wanted them to act, not look. They did not look like they were good at acting. It's a terrible, very bad movie. I don't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, they say the only thing that's certain in life is death and taxes. And taxes have come to a close for me. It's been a long time since I last watched a film. I've seen several in the last few years and the last film was, in my opinion, a complete flop. This one was actually better and I enjoyed the actors a lot. It was good to see a new, better director for such a bad film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is horrible, and I never want to watch it again. The acting is horrible too. It's not that there are actors doing terrible acting but that all the actors do are terrible. They act like they are on a low budget. You can tell that there is no skill or effort put into this movie.   When you first start watching this movie there are some interesting ideas, but the movie goes downhill from that point.  I hate how all the action is just so quick. When you really think about it all the characters die in less then a minute.  When the movie gets bad it gets worse.  What happened to all the character?  I don't think there was any good reason for the other characters to be on the plane. They could have been in Mexico filming another movie. They didn't need to be there.  The actors don't get a chance to play. They are constantly trying to show how they are in the best condition. The camera never changes its focus. All the actors always have the same look on their face.  Every time a character gets shot, the camera stays on the same position.  If this movie was made for a movie theatre and not for the big screen, I don�t think you would be able to see more than two actors at a time.  As mentioned before the actors don�tt give a chance for the camera to move. When one of the characters is shot the camera keeps on moving.  This film is completely worthless and I can�t see a reason for all the people to be in that plane.  It's just so cheap.  There were so many interesting ideas for movies to make.  All I see in this movie is how cheap the movie was to make, and how much people were paid.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen "Pee-wee's Big Adventure", which I thought was a very entertaining movie. However, it really left a bad taste in my mouth with how the cast (and some actors) did not do justice to the character and the story. I also found the special effects to be very dated and the voice cast (including Don Messick as the voice of Pee-Wee) was not as great as it could have been. I'd give this movie a pass, but not for a children's movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a disaster. I am not sure how many people have seen this movie and can tell you why it was so terrible. When it first came out a lot of people loved it and there were several good reviews on it. It was supposed to be a comedy that was funny but I don't think they did it right. The main star is a young man named Sam and he is supposed to act as a straight man for the audience. He doesn't have the voice or the facial expressions to give the character a real sense of seriousness or he isn't trying hard enough. He tries very hard to be funny but never gets any laughs. He spends the whole movie trying to be witty but never comes up with anything. There are other characters in the movie but they are very boring and they don't have much to do. And the ending. It's not funny. There is a very obvious message in the film that Sam is trying to convey but they never say it. The ending was bad enough to make me want to skip it and get out of the theater.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really like the movie. It was very much like a "horror" film. There were some moments where it was a bit unsettling but it was only minor. It could have been more interesting but it had a good horror-like atmosphere to it.   It has some good performances in it. I liked the performances of the young actors.  Some of the dialogue was really good. It seemed like a bit of fun to be a "survivalist" for some strange reason.  The film was interesting because of its style. It reminded me of old survival movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is horrible, not funny at all, not interesting at all. It's got a poor acting and writing team and the acting is so bad, I never laughed at a joke.   Not worth watching at all  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie on DVD with no intention of watching it, but I had to buy it just because I really liked it. It has nothing to do with the "Catch 22" movie. It was an original, entertaining, well-directed film, and I was in love with the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie sucks.   My husband and I both thought this was going to be awesome, when we came home and checked the review of the film. When we got home, we saw that the review was from a fan, and they were pretty disappointed. I think there was a whole group of people that had a hard time watching this movie.  They even got into the script. I could tell there was something that they didn't like about this movie, and it showed in the reviews.  I don't understand why these people are trying to put me down, this is a fan made movie and it shows. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie I would highly recommend for anyone who enjoys a good good movie with good acting.   In the movie the lead actor is playing a good cop, and then a bad cop with an evil streak.  The movie is pretty funny as well as very dramatic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has a lot of potential. I mean, who doesn't love some sci-fi, maybe even with aliens? However, it was so badly shot that you never really felt like you were in the scene. The sets are very flat and generic. The actors are all bad and the director did not even try to make any of them appear even remotely believable.   I didn't like the aliens so much. They don't look right. They didn't even act like they were in a believable environment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie had so much potential but sadly the director decided to use an amateur like in the lead role and he didn't even look like a professional actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I've ever seen.  I'll never see a Tom Cruise movie again.   Cruise has zero range, no depth.  He is over the top and stupid.  What a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is good, but nothing worth a second glance.   A poor story is told.  The actors, especially the female ones, are not very good.  A lot of things are told very slowly and without much excitement.  It is a shame that it did not have a more promising cast.  Even the female lead is not very convincing.  I have always been interested in science fiction, and this was definitely a step up, but in this case, it was not all that good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There were some really bad aspects of this movie. The story is very poor and the acting was not much. I hated the acting by both actors. They both look really old, but really have no life. And they played the same roles in a bunch of other movies. I was tired when I watched this and had a hard time staying awake. I think it is not worth watching. I would never see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was an interesting, yet very disappointing flick. It's nothing special, and I'd rather watch a real "movie" (i.e. a real, live, working production) than watch something like this. The only thing I did enjoy about this movie is seeing "Mr. Rogers" as he has always been represented in movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was absolutely terrible. This is a "steampunk" movie but it's not even the steampunk film that I know it to be from its tag. I hate these steampunk movies in general so this film is not worth the time. It looks like some people who didn't know what they were doing threw together a couple of steampunk movie ideas and it was "inspired" by something else. It's a bad film and it should not have been made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to wait till Friday to watch this, but when I saw the movie, I was ready. It was an average movie. You could see in the trailer that there was a lot of special effects that didn't come off. The cast looked so young and made no effort to look old, except for a girl who was a young girl. The story was not very interesting and the acting was pretty bad.    If you like movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, you may enjoy this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is NOT the film that I had imagined it to be from the press kit. This is an example of bad filmmaking. The "plot" does not matter. I don't think there is a story in this film. I did not feel like watching this. This was just an excuse for an actor to get a bunch of really horrible lines in. The acting was all terrible. The actors were not even believable as their characters. They did not give their characters the weight of their characters that they should have. It is impossible to look at any of them and not feel that they were not their characters at all.     The film opens up with a group of people sitting around a table. One of them is a man, and one of them has a gun. He tells his friend that they are gonna play a game. One guy in the group takes a gun and shoots someone in the head. This leads the rest of the people to try to play the game with the guy that got shot. They get the gun and all start shooting each other. Then, they all take turns trying to stab each other, and at some point, they end up shooting each of the other people. They are all dead after a while. The man that shot the guy in front of him is the most surprised. This man takes all of his weapons and goes back to the room and looks at the other guns he has. After a while, he tells his friends that they're playing with people that they don't really know, that they may not really be dead. Then he asks them if they can shoot someone with the gun that they have, and they all shoot each other dead.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible movie. Not only is it bad, it's so bad that it hurts my brain.   What the hell is this?   I love movies, I love actors, I don't even mind bad movies, but this is beyond bad.  The plot is totally lame, there are tons of scenes that don't add anything, and the acting is terrible.  It makes me want to put this movie in a box and chuck it in the middle of a swamp, and drown it.  That is all I can say about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so horrible to look at, but if you want something with heart then you will enjoy this.   The acting sucks and they are all horrible in this movie.  Some of the actors just didn't even try to be good in this film. The writing is bad. They were trying too hard to make it funny and this is what it came to.  They try to get away with so much.  I would never watch this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie does not have much going for it. It is not good, it is bad, and it is just lame. The acting is not that great and the plot is ridiculous. I don't know how much longer it will be on DVD and DVD release is not scheduled yet. I would not recommend this movie for the price of admission.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was expecting to see a big movie with big stars and a big budget, but this movie was garbage, with low acting skills and terrible plot twists. There were way too many scenes that I wanted to leave early, and not a single character was interesting, even the hero of the movie, James 'The Snake' LaBounty, who was portrayed by the "Hollywood's oldest actor" (James Coburn, who died 3 years before production), and he was way too old to play a real snake. I found all the actors to be too old and old-fashioned. My only positive points were that some of the dialogue and scenes were funny and some scenes were filmed in a beautiful setting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film started off strong with good performances from both John C. Reilly and Robert De Niro. But, after the first 10 minutes, I lost interest. I would have preferred a movie based on a book rather than a movie in the script.   John C and Robert were great in their roles, but it felt like the film was going downhill.    The story was rushed and not well developed.  The acting was weak and even though it was directed by the same guy who directed "Scream", it was pretty boring.  What do I mean by boring? Well, when I watch movies like "The Sixth Sense" or "Scary Movie", I don't notice the actors' personalities changing too much.  When I watched "Scarecrow", I felt like I was in the movie and wasn't just watching a movie.  I had a lot of fun laughing at the movie, but I was tired after 3/4 of it.  It took away my enjoyment of the movie. This is just one reason why a horror film like this would not be worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this movie more times than I care to remember, and although I would have been glad to just get an idea of what a movie is, I do have to say that this movie is just not interesting. I don't even think it's funny, but it's still not a bad idea. It's just not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie over 20 years ago, and although I saw it multiple times, it never once caught my attention. Now, looking back, I am surprised at how little the film has aged. The acting, the sets, the music - everything about this movie is dated. I don't know how the actors were paid, but whoever got them to do it was crazy. I didn't like that these people were in this film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When you get a bad film, you think "what is this?" But this movie is the worst. Why is this a bad comedy, and it's not even funny. I have seen other comedies with good acting, like Mr. Deeds and the Littlest Hobo. Why was there not one bit of comedy in this movie? It's all about the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never heard of the film The Cuckoo's Calling before it was shown to me at the theatre. I didn't see the trailer either but it certainly seemed to have a "feel" to it.  The movie is about a lonely young woman who moves in next door to a rich, lonely man who is the victim of a hit-and-run, and a terrible, terrible thing happens to them. The woman is in fact his fiancee and she has been kept from him by her husband, who has become obsessed with the man. The man is very distant to her, and she begins to wonder if his new relationship might have been an affair and that he is in love with another woman. At one point he takes her shopping, and one of the purchases is a photograph of him with a woman. The film's plot follows the story in reverse, the young woman is beginning to realize that she is being kept away from her fiancee, and the film ends with her deciding that she won't live with this man anymore.  In many ways, this is a very depressing movie and it was hard to look at. But it also had a very strange, eerie sense of realism to it, which helped it to be very creepy.  At one time I thought the movie was quite "realistic," especially when the car started to turn into a carousel and a man was driving it through a field, or when a man is trying to hold his hand.  There were also other very strange things going on in the movie which made it a very spooky experience.  I found it disturbing to think that this was a real life situation, and not just a fantasy.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A "bad movie" in the truest sense of the word is one that you watch at a bad time, and in a bad mood.  It is completely devoid of any interest or energy whatsoever.  The only reason I can think of why this movie made it through to a theatrical release is because a studio decided to push it out.  This is an insult to the intelligence of movie fans and anyone who watches it for entertainment purposes.  And since it's a rip off, you should know what you're getting into.  There are few better movies out there that actually tell a story and take chances with a character development that was rarely done in the 80's.  I was shocked when I first heard about this movie and read some of the reviews I found to be completely ridiculous.  And the fact that it was made in the 70's by a company that was completely unaware of the technology that was now available is beyond insulting.  While the plot line was interesting, it was really not very good at all.    I've heard a lot of people rave about this picture, but I'm not sure they're right.  Maybe it was the great acting, but the story line felt incredibly cliche and forced.  Some of the characters were very cliche, like a guy who's in love with his secretary and a couple of people who really seem like they're from the 80s.  There were a lot more interesting characters than this, but some of them (like the guy from the video store) were so incredibly stereotypical that I'm still trying to figure out why they were there.  Even the woman from the club never seemed like the kind of woman one would want to spend time with in that era.  A lot of it felt like they were just trying to make a movie that the studio would pay for, and it was a very, very poor attempt at doing so.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really liked this movie but i found it very difficult to watch. I kept wanting to rewind and watch it in a different order. I guess i got bored so i gave it up.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I remember hearing about this movie from a friend as a kid, and then watching it for the first time recently, it was just about as bad as I remember it.   The movie is really just a cheap re-telling of "The Three Stooges", but I guess it's still funny enough to be considered a great parody of it. It just makes me feel like the old "three stooges" movies were kind of crap all around.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is completely terrible. I had a hard time believing I was watching a real movie when I saw it on DVD (you have to look closely at the opening scene). It looks like it's been filmed in a bad part of town or a bad slum. There is no direction. The acting is horrible. The camera is too slow and there are no characters. The dialogue is really stupid. There was no tension at all. The movie doesn't even make sense in the first half.    I am still hoping I can get a hold of a copy of this horrible movie on VHS or a DVD, so that I can share it with my friends.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is very bad, it is very poor, it needs a great director and a great movie editor. There are many times in this movie, that i could have cut this better, the acting is just terrible, the action is all bad, the dialogue is all terrible, this movie should be called the worst movie ever, and not even made by Ridley Scott... i hate this movie. I have never seen a movie so terrible in my life, i really feel bad for the people that made this movie... and i would really like to see a remake.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best of the worst movies on this site. I loved it. No one was going to win. The only good thing is that I had the pleasure of watching it with my son. He was not only entertained, but made sure his mom saw it too.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is just as boring as it looks. It's like a movie made by a bunch of old men that don't have a clue what they are doing.   I would give it a 6 if it were in colour. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you think a movie is bad, then it will not be a good movie.   The only reason why it got good ratings was because it was released in America and the American audience had a lot of exposure to westerns.  This movie was terrible.  It made me want to rip off my television screen and get away.  There are some good ideas in the movie but they are overshadowed by some pretty bad acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this film for a few dollars when it came out in 2003. It was so bad I thought, "Gee, if only they made a movie about that shit!?" I was disappointed. It's a great film to see in old timey black and white, it has that feeling of what you might see in a old Hollywood movie. The story is about a couple that travels the country with their "son" and they seem to have a great life with the wife. The "son," is actually the husband. He seems to be taking everything too seriously, and doesn't even care about his son when he is with his wife. I know they claim the boy is just with his mother for a while, but he seems to have that look on his face that says that he doesn't care. The two guys that work in the "showroom" (where they advertise cars) seem to be kind of jealous of their wives. I don't think they even want a husband to look at their cars.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen this movie a lot in the last couple of years, but it was terrible. The acting was terrible, the actors never said a word, there was never a plot and no one was in it. The cinematography, lighting, editing, etc was terrible and it was a mess. The story was crap as well and it seemed to me that no one thought this was a good idea. I guess it will do well when they get their million dollar budget back so they can make it great again. I would say the acting was horrible and the actors were terrible. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. - December 8, 2008My Worst Movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My daughter, who is 7 years old, was watching a movie and she loved it. When she got up to go to bed and I let her stay up to watch it again, she asked for another one. I told her I don't mind watching it again and I'll get another one when she wakes up from her nap.   The movie was too short and her memory was too poor to follow along.  This movie would be great if she had remembered it right and had seen the sequel before it came out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this was a bad flick, from the title, it looks like it is going to be a classic. I was really excited for it, because it is supposedly going to show the real life story of a guy who was on a mission to capture a terrorist. What I got instead was a cheesy cheesy movie with no emotion at all. The story is totally wrong. First, the terrorist is NOT a terrorist, he was an ex-CIA agent who went over to the side and helped out the guy who shot him. And this is how he is treated by the FBI? The agent is treated like a criminal and has a bounty put on his head. His friend, the guy he saved, is treated just the same. Then the guy goes over to his friends house and is attacked with a knife. The FBI agent that was supposed to be hunting him, gets pissed off and decides to murder the guy, and then leaves him lying in the street. It doesn't make any sense and you can't make it any more absurd. The script is bad and it doesn't seem like any one actor was in charge. It's a mess.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have never had such a bad time with a movie, not in a long time.  I was in LA and had to go to the movies. I go to see movies every other weekend but never a bad one.   This movie was horrible      I had no idea what was going on.  It was like a soap opera with the women in the film.  They were doing everything wrong.  In the end the director wanted to be more of a hero and make it more like a movie then a documentary.  This is the worst documentary I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a film with a bad story, which doesn't matter, so don't worry, it has a good plot and a good story.   It is a terrible film with no logic and is a big disappointment.  I would not recommend this movie and I have seen several bad ones in a row.  This movie should be watched on the old black and white tv when your parents or your older brother was watching, because this one has bad acting and terrible acting, which only make this movie worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While this film is terrible and is really not worth it to watch it at all, I will still recommend it to you. It is not bad and there is nothing special about it at it's core. It has a good story and some good acting (mostly by Kevin Bacon). The plot is not that original and it has been done before. It's nothing you haven't seen before and there really isn't much of a plot to speak of. The characters aren't very interesting and the movie just goes on and on. It just doesn't have any potential to be a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was disappointed that I spent almost $50 on a bad film about a guy who's always been depressed and a failed actress. The director made a good movie and this film was just a copy and a cheap imitator. The plot was very confusing, the acting was poor, the director was a complete amateur. The production is horrible, the camera was not sharp, the editing was horrible, there were mistakes in the script, and the actors did not look convincing. The film itself was bad as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I heard that the first film from The Asylum was going to be a sequel (the original was a film from the Asylum's own mind), I was excited to see what kind of a sequel this would be. I was looking forward to a film that showed what the Asylum was capable of. I also knew that it would be more about an updated, more modern setting than the original.   This film is really one of those that are just not worth watching at all.  The main characters of the film, the kids, are all one dimensional (the best way to describe them would be that they are flat) and have almost no personality.  I also really disliked the fact that they were all playing games, and there is no real purpose to it other than for the kids to be in the most of fun.  This movie was also a very poor attempt at a "modern" look, as the art design, the way the characters moved (which really didn't look like anything but their feet moving) and all of the other details are very dated.  It's one thing to change things up, but to do it with such little creativity is another.  If this were a film made in the 1970's, it would have been called "Dressed to Kill".   Overall, this is a disappointing film.  There are some good ideas here, but unfortunately they are all forgotten within the next 20 minutes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie as a present for my daughter for Christmas, she loved it, but as I have watched it, it has a lot of problems. First of all, the story line is very boring. The kids start out as very small children, they get older, they have adventures and make mistakes. I found the whole story to be very weak and dull.  I thought the main character was a bully. There was a few scenes where he did a few cruel things to one of the kids. It made me feel bad for him but it doesn't make me feel any sympathy for him. He was the least interesting character.  There was only one other character, and he was very weak, I just felt bad for this kid.   My wife said this movie was good but it wasn't worth the price, which it is not worth at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen all the Star Wars movies, and I have to say this is the worst. There is only one thing worse than this movie: The old Disney cartoon show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The biggest problem with this movie is it's completely pointless.   At one point you see an old man (Walter) watching the movie in a cafe.  The movie is about a guy named Steve who, when asked if he is a man, he replies "Yes, but I am not a man. I am a ghost", then he leaves the cafe and disappears.  So in this movie he is going around saying he is not a person, then he disappears and at the end you find out he is walking around and saying he isn't a person.  It's so stupid, that I just want the people behind this movie to get their hands out of their asses.  But the worst thing is the fact that the movie isn't even all that great.  If you want to see a ghost movie in 1992, then this movie would be the one.  I wish it had gone into 3D. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you really like a movie and it's not a bad one, then you're not going to hate it. If you don't like it, then it'll make you hate it, because it will be too familiar.   I liked the movie, but it was all too familiar for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has bad acting, bad acting and bad acting. If you watch it, and you want to find some fun action then you won't find it here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't care for this movie.   This movie is so boring.  Why would anyone watch this movie?  I really didn't like the look of this movie!  I felt as if i was watching the same movie that i saw on a tv show about the Vietnam war.  I had not even watched this movie on a movie channel but a cable one.  It looked like it was shot in an old fashion film studio.  The whole film looked old and cheesy.  This is what I feel when i watch a movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been reading a lot about the "pinkos" and I decided to try to get a movie for myself. I'd heard horror stories about these type of movies and wanted something not so scary. I decided it was best to go with an older horror type of flick, like the old slasher flicks. But when I saw this film, I was totally underwhelmed. They tried to make this a scary movie with lots of blood and gore, but nothing was scary or gut wrenching. I mean, I've seen many a scary film, but this was a complete waste of time and money.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie in theaters because it had been optioned as a TV series. There were a couple of things that bothered me. The actors were good, but nothing to write home about. I was annoyed at the whole thing when the character was introduced that was supposed to be a secret CIA agent, but was revealed to be really a cop and a couple more cops. I thought it was stupid on the part of the producers that they would have made a show about a secret agent, then reveal that they were a cop, then show a couple scenes of this cop running the CIA, then another couple where he was being chased by other cops, and then another scene of a cop with his back against a wall shooting at bad guys, only to be shot dead. Why didn't they have the guy running the FBI get shot in the head or something to let the audience know that he was just a cop. Also, I never saw anyone who was supposed be a cop pull a gun on someone. They had a guy who was a cop being chased, and he got into a fight, but they had this character who was really a guy with no real connection to the story. The movie also didn't take place in the U.S. It was made in South America. Also the movie is really long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I like this movie so much because, for some reason, I was attracted to the story.  The film is told from the point of view of a young boy and the film is a bit slow at first but picks up the pace.  But, this film just never gets to know who these people really are and we never really see their world.  This film seems to be about how people try to find themselves through the use of drugs and alcohol and it gives the viewer the impression that people really want to be happy.  I am not a fan of this kind of film.  It is one of those films where if you liked it before it was like watching a really bad bad movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed movie with a terrible script and bad acting and writing. The movie starts off by introducing us to this guy. Then he goes and buys a cheap car and we follow him through his life. He gets a divorce, gets into a fight with the wife who he met a year before and now has two kids and a wife who doesn't really like him. He does some bad things and then has to live with the consequences for a while. All the while, he talks to a girl in a local bar. He says he loves her and he wants her to come home. And she does. Then, she leaves him. So, he goes back to his old job and works there for a couple months. It is boring but we want to see his life get better. He meets his new job's girlfriend. He doesn't even say goodbyes to the girlfriend. So he goes home, sits on his couch, and has a glass of wine. He falls asleep and wakes up in the morning and his wife is waiting at the door. And his boss is still there. So she leaves, leaves the keys, the keys to the car, the car keys, and all the money, and goes to work. Now, you're probably thinking: what the hell? How can this guy have a bad day, and then, all of a sudden, have two happy and beautiful girls and a happy boss waiting at home? Well, this is the plot of this movie. The whole movie is like this. The character is a bad guy and there are a lot of bad guys in this movie (and in a lot other movies) and they all do a lot bad things. I thought it was pretty lame when they show the bad guy in the shower, and he falls in the bathroom sink and the whole thing is like, "Oh, that's the bad man." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those movies you never see. It is so lame!  The whole thing was supposed to be about the film's "hero", but it was really just the film and its actors trying to act like the heroes. It's the kind of movie you would expect to see in a video store. The actors should have just given up on this whole project.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A poorly written script with too many plot holes and no twists in the plot that is based on a true story is just not worth seeing at all.   If you want a real thrill ride, give the original "Titanic" a try.  The cast was great, the music was great and it was the first real blockbuster that was a real hit.  This movie has never been released on DVD or blu ray and you are lucky to have seen it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is very cheesy and poorly made.  It's also very badly edited.   I'm not sure if the editor thought they were doing a good job or if they just didn't care.  The acting is laughable.  I guess they weren't able to find anyone with enough charisma or talent to play a small town preacher.  In a movie about the apocalypse, you'd think you would want to have a guy with the right range of expressions.  They were all stiff and uninspired.  You can see why they wanted the budget to be cut.  If you want a "good" zombie movie, get Night of the Living Dead or Romero's Dawn of the Dead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has NO redeeming value! What could be worse than a movie with "horror", "scary", "weird" and "we're not sure what's going on" titles and NO plot? The story is absolutely FABULOUS and the acting is on point.   The only "sore" part is the ending, but you get so much more from it then you did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So the first movie of the series that was a success. Very interesting storyline that has a bit more action than it should have, but for a PG-13 movie it's surprisingly violent (and that's saying something!). The film's most striking feature, however, is the performances. It's a mix of great action, great acting, and very good chemistry. But all in all, not a great film, as it's too rushed, lacks the charm of the first, and gets a bit repetitive, which is kind of a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie to watch with my cousin on the couch.  He really enjoyed it.  The acting was good, but it just doesn't feel like the movie is saying anything at all.  I will definitely not be watching this movie again.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is a good one but not very memorable. The acting was poor at times and the writing was boring.   I think this movie was not made with good quality materials. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really like this movie, and I know some people don't like it, but you should take the time and watch it. If you can look past the acting, the writing, and the direction it is a good movie, not the worst ever.   It has a great cast, and really sets the tone of the film.  It is dark, dark, and dark. It really isn't for the faint of heart. If the acting and the writing are to bad, then they really need to do more to try and make the movie work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was okay, if you watch it like a bad thriller, you'll get it. It starts out okay, and it is just like you think. Then you find out it is nothing like it seems to be.  The acting is really bad, the story is good but it is so hard to follow the plot that it is almost impossible to enjoy this movie, in fact if you read the subtitles, you will be able to understand the story, but as soon as you realize the movie is bad, you have to start all over.   If you are a fan of suspense movies, this is a must see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After watching this movie, I had some flashbacks of being very young and I did feel that my parents were trying to show me what I was doing wrong. The characters were too much alike to be the same person, and there was a very weak acting performance from the main character who I think was trying to look tough, but the rest of the cast didn't seem to be able to hold a scene together.   I will not be watching this again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was not a big fan of the movie and didn't think I would enjoy it at all. It seemed like a film I would get at the B-Movie store and just get bored of the next week, but after watching it a couple of times I have come to realize how much it was like a real movie. Even though the actors were bad, there were a lot of plot holes, but I will not make that into a negative. I hope this is the kind of movie that I will see again one day.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is so bad that it is difficult to believe it even exists. The movie is based on a terrible novel by a mediocre writer named William Gibson. The plot is like a combination of "Terminator 2" and "Blade Runner" and features lots of "evil aliens" who are bent on world domination. However, the movie has nothing to do with either of those movies. The "evil alien" thing is just a smokescreen to disguise the fact that the movie is a mess of a piece of crap.   There is no "plot" to speak of. The film is more like an attempt to sell a bad film to people who never read any of Gibson's books.  The acting is awful. The only actors to get any acting credit in the film are a pair of "psychic" monks (one of whom is actually called The Guru and the other is called The Teacher).   The movie opens with the leader of a bunch of evil aliens, who calls himself "Archon", (who is the name of a character from one of Gibson�s other books). The Archon calls the leader and other "priests" and explains his plan to rule earth by the year 2000.  A bunch of "priestesses" are dispatched to earth to capture "guests" from earth and bring them back to the alien planet so that they can be "taught" about human morality and how to rule the world. These guest "guest" people are pretty much a bunch a brainwashed slaves who are brainwashed into worshiping this "archon".   I never thought that I would ever see a film of this kind.  One of the more interesting things about the film is that the archon doesn�t actually appear to be very smart. He doesn�ts have any sense of humour or intelligence and he is very much like the most brainwashed slave. However he is also quite annoying as he constantly spouts his nonsense and keeps trying to make himself sound like a "super-advanced" being who can talk to aliens and know about the future and the future.  Despite the awful acting, the terrible acting in the movie makes the film even worse. The acting in this movie is so poor that even though it is supposed to be a horror movie, it feels like an action movie.  When the film starts I was surprised by how well acted the actors were. The actors really pulled off the creepy, evil, and brain
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a film that I wish I could forget about.   The film begins with a group of people playing cards as the police surround them on the streets.  This movie is about a young man who is on the run from the police because he stole a bicycle.  He is pursued by the police as he goes on a date with his girlfriend.  They are then stopped by the corrupt police chief.  It starts off with the police chief ordering his officers to get everyone drunk so they can stop all the bad things going on around them.  Then things go wrong.  A girl comes and attacks the young man.  As the young guy tries to defend himself the cops beat him up badly enough to send him to a mental hospital for a while.  When he is released the police take his bike, but he finds that it has been taken away from him.  So he goes back to his girlfriend to ask for her bike back.  But the girl gets a phone call from some guys at her school saying that someone has stolen her bike.  She gets out of her car and the young girl who just walked away turns around to find them. She tries to get the bike back, but when the girl runs away she leaves the bike with the guys.  The boyfriend tries to stop them from doing this, but they beat him to death with a pipe.  We then follow the girlfriend as she drives away with the bike, and her mom follows after her.  By the time the girlfriend gets to her mom's car she realizes that she has made a mistake, and that she should have taken the bike from the guy who got it stolen instead of the guy she had just gone out with.  After her mom finds out about it, she drives the girlfriend to the police station.  Finally, after a long chase they catch up to the girlfriend and they take her back to the house where her boyfriend was killed.  Now we just see her driving home and then a police car comes by and takes her away.  Once she gets to home she tells her mom that the police are chasing after her for something else and she has to get her bike from her friend.  Just as she is about to do this her mom comes in and she takes the bike away.     So now we have a young girl that has just gotten robbed of a bike by her boyfriend, her mom and her girlfriend, and then her mom was on the phone to the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like it, but the ending was wrong.   The ending was terrible, very wrong. If i could give it a zero stars i would, but it gave me the feeling i will not watch this movie ever again, because the ending ruined it for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first saw this I was excited.   But after watching it a few times I think I've gotten over it.  One of the reasons I enjoyed the movie is that the characters were interesting and interesting things happened.  The story was somewhat silly.  Some of the jokes were funny but others were not.  As a fan of the old sci fi/fantasy movies this is not really a movie for me.  I'd recommend it to people that like their sci fi to be fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have never seen such bad acting in my life.   It made it impossible to watch the movie   There was absolutely nothing entertaining about it.  I'm glad I didn't waste my money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The picture on the disc looks nice, but the film doesn't. The acting was horrible. It reminded me of the actors in the film "Tales of The City" with their funny accents and exaggerated personalities. The actors could barely act. The main role, the woman's friend who would give him a ride was played by one person (the actress had to be carried around in the car) and was completely unrecognizable. The other actors were in bad movies as well. The woman who would have given him a lift was played beautifully by another actress. The two main actors seemed so uninterested in the rest of the film that they did not seem to be enjoying their own parts at all. The rest of it was just as bad. It was supposed to be a horror film but it was so cheesy it was laughable.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love this movie. It's amazing and well made. The characters are great, the plot is good, the acting is great, and there are just enough sex and violence to keep me excited. This was a very good movie that I look forward to seeing again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie a few weeks back on my DVR. It was not very good. The acting was terrible. The director was an idiot for not taking a stand and make this film like the others. If you want to see a bad flick then go and see something else.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very dull movie. Very boring, not worth the time and energy.  I don't want to watch it again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie that could have made for a great film is ruined because it doesn't tell a compelling story.   This is the kind of movie where the only way to win is by not telling a good story. It's a very sad film that tells you nothing about what really happened and never has a satisfying resolution.  This movie should have gone in the category of "just bad".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My husband had already seen "Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back", which we loved, and we were looking forward to seeing the sequel. We got there, and to our shock, there was no theater in the building.  We were forced to walk outside to find a theater that would open in about 45 minutes.  When we were finally seated, my husband was more than a little disappointed to find that our seats were directly in front of the screen, making it very difficult to see anything other than the "battle" or "fantasy" aspects of the movie.   When "A New Hope" first came out, we watched it on the big screen in the mall (which had been opened earlier) because we thought it would be much easier to see, but our view of the film was ruined by the theater's lousy sound system.  Luckily we had the theater card and were able to upgrade our tickets for the "specials" we wanted, so our view at the end of the "space battle" is more than adequate!   Despite having to walk to the bathroom during the entire film, the movie was still entertaining.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film when it came out on DVD and was not impressed. It was very boring and nothing special.   It would have been a great idea to have a couple of interesting characters like the woman with the long hair and the little girl with blue eyes but I guess they were just not interesting enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this was a really bad movie. I thought it was made by someone who could barely remember the first movie he made and was just going through the motions with this movie. It was terrible and I hated every minute of it!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure why it's so popular. I never really liked it at all. The acting was terrible and the music was lame. And yes, that is the best joke in the movie.   A woman who makes the rounds in the hospital to have her hymen torn for a "better man."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie countless times and it always has the same problems. The story is boring, the characters are boring, and the acting is boring.  The story line was boring. They only show us a bit about the first victim and a few witnesses. Then we get to the point of the story. That wasn't very good and we don't learn any more.  You can tell the director was a very lazy person because he was afraid to use actual camera tricks to help make the movie interesting.  One of the witnesses is actually a man who actually saw the murders and actually got arrested for them. It is a good thing we have witnesses because this movie is full of inconsistencies.   The acting was very boring. There were just so many people who look like they were trying to be dramatic that it is very hard to believe it is actually their real personality.  This movie was made in 1987 and the special effects are terrible. It really isn't worth watching unless you have a large collection of the old James Bond movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The biggest disappointment of the year was this movie. It is not even close to the worst movie I have seen in the past.  I was really hoping this movie would be a masterpiece of a movie. But alas, it is not.  It is a pretty okay movie that is more about trying to have a great time than about the actual plot or characters.  The writing in this movie is so terrible it makes it seem like some movie about a person who just can't catch a break.   This movie is like some kind of bad "Couch" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I haven't seen this movie yet, but I'm sure I will. I haven and will hate it.    This movie was not what I was expecting at all. I was thinking something in the same vein as the classic slasher films such as Friday the 13th or The Silence of the Lambs. I thought I was going to see the new and improved Nightmare on Elm Street. I got the opposite. It seems like this was done to cash in on the Elm Street movie. The acting is terrible, and they all seem to be in love with each other.  I have never hated a movie so much in my life. The way the characters act, the way they react, the gore, the acting, the story...all of it...it's horrible.  The way they killed their victim and when they cut off his head, I couldn't even stand watching it, but my husband had to take a couple of minutes off work so he could see it. He was in disbelief when he got home. I think my husband was more disgusted than I was by this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible. It is horrible in every way.   I have watched a couple of bad movies, but this is by far the worst.  They tried to make a movie out of the movie Groundhog Day, but it just doesn't work.  I was going to watch this movie with my kids for the weekend, but I decided not to because it is just so bad.  There are just so many mistakes in this movie, I don't even know where to begin. I will give this movie two stars because it looks like a great horror movie, but for some reason it has such bad writing.  The film is so bad I don 't even want to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a disaster. I am embarrassed for the production company, the director, and all the actors involved.  I don't know why the director thought that the actors needed to appear as "stubborn and tough" to be believable in a western. It was all a big joke. They looked like they were playing a cartoon.   I did not enjoy this movie very much.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was pretty bad, the acting was bad and the story was terrible, if this movie was made for a college class or a grade school movie it would have been terrible, however if it was made as a film it would be better, it was really bad and it was not funny.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is just silly and stupid.   I mean, seriously, why in the world would you have to get drunk to talk to a ghost?   It's an obvious parody and a big hit on the comedy scene back in the 60s, but this movie really doesn't have any punch to it.  It would've been much funnier if there wasn't a group of people in it making jokes all the time, but it's all played by the ghost and the only character who's alive is in the flashback of his dad (who's only in this movie to be a ghost).   If you're in need of a laugh, do yourself a favor and watch this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's a lot of movie going on in this one, it's more like the "big picture" that comes to mind when I think of this movie. In fact, it was one of my favorite scenes in the movie when it took place during the night in the school. There's something almost tragic about the situation, as the teachers were forced to turn the lights off and lie back in their chairs as the kids began to tear up and sing. The ending was really odd, as it was more of a surprise and than a twist, I guess because they really didn't want to do anything for a twist ending. Overall, it did leave a bad taste in my mouth, not a good one either.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of those bad movie that have been out for so long and have been repeated over and over. It's been so many times that I started to think that I know it all. I was going through a very bad time in my life that I was very depressed and didn't know who I was. I needed to laugh at someone and I couldn't do it so I looked on the web for "the next funny movie". The only movies that I found that had a message to them were those movies that were like "The Truman Show" and those movies about "The Wizard of Oz". I found it funny and thought it was funny and was in the mood to laugh a little bit. I took my little daughter with me and she loved the movie. My daughter saw the movie, her face was bright red and she wanted to give me a hug. It wasn't anything she wasn't ready for, she just saw what was in front of her. It didn't bother her and she liked the movie and my daughter said it was one of the funniest movies she has ever seen. I loved it and would highly recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I heard that this movie was making a comeback it made me excited, so when I saw it, it didn't disappoint.  The acting is good, the plot is great and the fight scenes are great.   The ending is not the best, but it's definitely not the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is like the worst of all the 90's superhero movies, there is no plot, no suspense, nothing goes according to plan and nothing is believable.   It is not surprising that this film was not received well.  One of the reasons may be that this is one of the films with the most memorable villain and it was played by Sylvester Stallone.  Stallone is amazing in this film and really gives us an impression of a truly evil villain.  He gives the best performance I have ever seen and it is hard to not like him.  I have always thought that the best villains are those who are evil and not the good guys, I have seen some really good and evil villains, but Stallone manages to give us such a great performance and make it not only believable, but believable evil.  This film is very similar to the original comic book villain, Mr. Negative, but this is not what I was expecting.  It seems that they have a very good idea of what they wanted this film to be, but they did not know how to go about it.  The acting is atrocious, and Stallone does not get good scenes, especially when he is the villain.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie i've ever seen. There is no plot, no development, no interesting characters. The lead female is only in this movie because it was the only thing they had to work with. They didn't bother with any other female characters or any other kind of female characters for that matter. All they had was this one.   What the hell was with that? Why was this made?   It's a horrible idea to turn your main female character into a bitch who doesn't want to do anything or care about anything. That's the most insulting part. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible movie that lacks any semblance of charm, and should not be seen by any of the people who claim to be fans of horror.   It's a poorly edited movie, and not only has the acting been subpar, but the special effects are laughable.  The plot is very poor, and even the best of the original "Saw" movies should have been better than this.  I don't think you can get much worse than this, and it's a shame that it was made at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a terrible movie. I loved the first one, and thought it was great. However, this one just sucked. The acting was bad, the plot was a mess and the plot twists were laughable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is bad, it is one of the worst I have ever seen. The plot is so contrived and convoluted that I felt as though they just went through all the scripts in the history of the world and decided to make a movie about them all. And that is just not a good idea. The actors playing the characters are all mediocre and uninspired. It is hard to imagine anybody ever wanting to see this movie, let alone any of these actors. The acting is horrible. There are no actors who are at all good. There is no real chemistry between any of the actors. None of the characters seem like they have any sort of a relationship with each other. It seems like they are trying so hard to make this one movie that there is no actual good reason to make it. It has nothing going for it. I can't wait for it to be cancelled because this is the worst movie ever made.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've had a couple of movies like this that are very much out of step with what my tastes were. This film was a very dull movie and in the end it was boring. The acting was all very stiff and the plot was very lame. It's just like a movie you might watch if someone wanted to watch a comedy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that this is a terrible movie and one of the worst movie ever made. The acting is horrible, the story is awful, and the script is bad. It takes away from this film that it is about the true life story of a black man and it makes this film look like a Hollywood movie.    If you have seen this movie and you liked it, it is because you had no idea what it was about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like bad movies because they are always fun and can give you an idea of a movie's true power.  The only problem is that this is a cheap rip off of an American movie.  It is a very old movie and no one in the US seems to remember it, which is really odd, because the story is a really good one.    And if you do, please see it again.  If you are a fan of the late great Buster Keaton, I strongly recommend watching it again, because Keaton's film is just as good, if not better than this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story was alright. It didn't have any real suspense to it. I liked that they put the character of the man who killed the kid into a flashback which gave the film some much needed mystery. I didn't care for the action in the movie. The director is quite lazy with his editing. The camera movement was just too slow. It's not really that impressive that they kept the action going so long. I don't think the actors were good either. I was a little confused about the reason behind the kid's death. I thought it might be some kind of drug deal gone bad, or some kind or accident. Either way it was a waste of the kid.    For the price of a ticket and a popcorn, I think the movie would have been better off if they had cut some of the action and just used the kid as a puppet. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a disgrace. The acting is bad, the film looks like crap, the production is bad and it doesn't even look like a film... The worst part of this movie is the storyline. The director is trying to make it like a western but in actuality it has been converted into some retarded western. When a guy runs away from a group of bandits and they capture him, the main character says, "they want a ransom" and the director says, "(I told him) we want the guy who shot those guys. It's a Western, we want to shoot him dead!" So you can see how this movie was a complete failure and is probably going to be burned in the history books. It really makes me sick that a director can't think before he shoots a scene and this poor guy was in real trouble when he ran away from the bandit group. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      The worst movie I ever saw.   There is no plot.  No one even appears in the film.  It starts out and I don't remember anything of it.  They make no effort to tell a story.  The special effects are horrible.  Some of the dialogue is just silly.  Why bother with such a terrible idea?   It is just a mess and a piece of rubbish.  I don`t think the director was even trying to make a movie.  There are some great actors that could have made a good movie but they were just not used enough.  A few of the actresses had much better scenes but none of them were in the movie. The special FX on the characters are horrible and when they do make a move it looks like they are walking on egg shells.  My father was so disgusted he had to give it to me straight away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is one of the most disappointing I ever saw. It is just terrible. I think it is too long, boring and not worth the money it costs. I have seen worse.   A little annoying because it does not say who the actors are. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My family and I saw this movie as a special event.  The movie was a huge flop, and is a big disappointment.  In a movie theater where you are used to seeing a lot of bad movies, I guess that's why they would want to show this one.  One thing I thought the movie was missing was the music.   If you are a music fan, you will not like the music in this movie.  All the music is too loud.  We also thought that the character names were weird, and not very descriptive.  I would have preferred the characters to be more like a group of people.  You never get a sense of who the people are, but at least they weren't random characters.  As the movie progressed, the characters and plot went from bad to worse.  This movie is terrible, and the people involved with it were very bad to their customers.  If they want to make a profit, they should hire a professional director.  My opinion, you are better off buying a movie ticket at an art house theater, and watching the film on a big screen, or with a big group of friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen several terrible movies, but this one takes the cake.  The acting was awful, and I always thought it would make a great TV series.  There was no direction at all.  I never knew who was who when they were on screen.  All the characters acted like they knew each other, so I thought they were from another country.  It was like some cheesy teen movie, and the girls weren't very attractive either.   The one thing that bothered me the most is that it was a very cheesy movie.  But at least it was cheap to make. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie, it is very sad to see so many bad movies make it to the theaters. This movie is filled with plot holes, weird ideas, and the acting is really bad. If you want a horror movie that will make you laugh and then turn on the TV to watch a scary movie, then this movie is not for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I haven't seen this movie yet, so I'm going to write a review about it from the perspective of someone who hasn't seen it yet.   At first glance, you're thinking that this is going to be a "pitch perfect" romantic comedy, a comedic masterpiece.  It is!  The main character, Kiki, is a super shy, awkward, girl who is struggling with the transition from being a girl to a woman.  This story is all about that transition, and her struggles and successes as a woman along the way.  There are some pretty funny, and very endearing scenes, like this one, where she's just sitting on the couch, waiting for someone to show up.  She gets a call and goes out, only to run into this guy she's seen around town a few times before, and then she starts to flirt with him.  That's all very cute and very funny, but then, her "boyfriend" walks by and she's a little uncomfortable with him and they stop for a minute.  And you thought the guy on the screen was all but useless.  The movie is also very sweet, with lots of heart.  A good thing about this movie is that it has a great ending, with Kiki walking out into the city, and becoming a woman who's seen and loved many men before.  I really can't tell you enough good things about this film, because it really is a joy to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this as a prequel to Star Trek The Motion Picture. It was very nice, except for that last 30 seconds where you see a close-up of the Klingon with a pistol.   While Star Trek was great in its own right, the prequel series was a real let-down. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      The story is really not that interesting or good. The movie really just takes itself too seriously and I'm not a big fan of a movie that tries to be serious when it really isn't.   I was surprised that this was even made.  For the rest of the cast and crew, I don't think they really know how to work a camera or a sound system.  The story does get really boring and boring and I think that the budget was pretty small so the actors could be much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was really excited to see this movie because I had heard it was going to be good. I remember watching it when I was a kid. This movie wasn't very good. It was very cheesy. A lot of the actors were very good and had great roles, but it was just too campy to be very good, if you ask me. It really has a kind of stupid look to it. I can understand why it was good when I saw it in the 1970s, but there's nothing about it that is original. I liked the look of the old movie, but to make a movie from that look today? I don't think it would be successful. It's sad that the original cast hasn't done anything since.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would be hard pressed to rate this film higher than "mediocre" or "just plain bad". The story and plot are so bad, it could be the film's tagline. If you enjoy films with an old school feel and style of acting and camera work, and have never seen a film by Robert Altman or Stanley Kubrick, this might be a good choice for you.   The film doesn't care about telling the story. It's all a mess. The story is told from the first half and the second half is filler. No character is developed, and the plot is so disjointed that it never really makes sense. The actors are poorly cast and they're all too similar. All you have to do is compare the film to a Kubrick film to realize that this is a film that could have been made by Kubrick.  It's one of those films that is better left unrated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was ok, but not amazing. I can't say it was "a great movie" for the most part because it lacked the spark that made the first "Star Wars" movies so amazing. The cast and crew seem to be getting better as time goes on, but I was not impressed by the direction or any of the performances.   I would give it a 4/10  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is boring and very predictable. All the characters are pretty much interchangeable.  There is no story and characters are all too similar. I would have never guessed any of the characters from the trailer to be good enough to play such a small role in the big picture.  The acting from all of the actors is just bad.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When it came out in 1996 I was in my early 20's, and that movie just seemed like a bunch of teenagers partying. I don't know why this movie is still making it's way around the theaters. I saw this movie once when I was 12 years old and I hated it as well. I remember I was sick with the flu and I stayed up late and watched the whole thing. When I got to the end of the movie I was so sick and wanted to crawl in a hole and never leave my house ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was just a terrible movie, and even if they could have made it more interesting by putting a few more plot elements into it, the result would still have been so bad that I don't see why anyone would want to see it.   It all seemed very forced and was kind of just thrown in at the last minute.  The acting was so bad and I found myself unable to sympathize with any of the characters at all.  This movie is so bad it's good!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a complete disappointment. It's all over the place. There are no plot elements or characters that make any sense at all. It is completely nonsensical and boring. The actors are horrible. I felt really bad for them. The only thing I can think of is that this was a bad attempt at a movie that no one in the world would want to watch.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had been looking forward to watching this movie for awhile, so excited for the night they were airing it, but all I had time to do was to look through the credits (I love seeing all of the names for movie credits) and I found out that I would have to wait until November 11th to see the movie.   They said that the DVD was going to be a double feature and it wasn't.  So this was a big letdown.  And the movie was not funny.  The acting was really bad, but it wasn't bad, you would think that after seeing a movie like this that the director would be able to write a good one for the next one.  It just sucked. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm an average guy who is not good at sports. The movie was the first movie I've seen in years that wasn't in color. The picture was very fuzzy and it was hard to see what was happening. The only thing good was that the actors were acting real and they did have fun in it. But the story was horrible and I wouldn't recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the acting was very good. Some people really liked this movie but it's really not that interesting to watch. The plot of the movie is very boring.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a real train wreck.  The characters are not well developed, no one cares about anyone except for the protagonist.  It is obvious that this film has no direction.  When there is a scene with the cars on a railroad track, there are no cars.   The only thing that keeps this film going is the music.  They have played the same song over and over again.  This film is really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    " This movie was terrible. It was made in a very bad way. When you see all of the characters talking like idiots it just makes it worse. You have a great actress like Barbara Hershey, but if you do not have an actress that can do well with the characters then it just doesn't work. I did not like this movie, at all. It had to be shown in a theater or on the pay cable like all other movie studios make their movies. "
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is basically a bad idea, poorly shot, and in bad taste. The movie has a lame plot and is filled with lame lines. I guess it was a cheap attempt at a movie, but it's not a good movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is a complete mess, and the actors who were cast to star it were not good at their jobs. The only actors in the film were terrible. I do not care if the film is from the 70s as much as I did not like the actors in this film.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was an awful film that has ruined many people's careers, it was a terrible film for kids it is full of vulgarity, disgusting scenes and very sad acting... the acting was bad and the characters were all annoying. It was bad it was very low in quality and the acting and the story was stupid.   The actors are all horrible it was funny to watch the people who had the talent in the movie not be good in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I guess that this was a bad idea. The movie was poorly made, the production was poor, and the acting was bad. I didn't even like the acting in this movie. I can't understand why someone would make a movie about an alien being able to speak English.   So when I got this movie I didn�t want to see it. It was very confusing and the story was extremely poor.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this in a movie theater with my husband and he had to hold me back, he wasn't ready to see this.   It had a lot of plot holes and some really bad acting and even though the actor was playing himself, I was just not interested.  A bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be completely boring and completely pointless. I never once felt like I needed to do anything in this film.   It's a boring action film. Not a lot of heart or emotion.  You could literally watch a remake of this and get the same results.  A complete waste of a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just rewatched this movie today, and I have to admit I didn't like it. The whole time I was watching the film, I kept thinking I was going to laugh at the wrong things. I think it's the way the character is written.    One of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is a poorly written movie that was a big disappointment to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie does not even make sense in its own right. It doesn't have the heart or personality to stand on its own and it's a very cliche movie, filled with clichés.   I'm not sure if it was shot in color or black and white, but it has the look and feel of a low-budget action flick. The story revolves around the hero, Captain Nick Fury (Chris Evans), who's sent to investigate a possible alien invasion. The movie starts out well enough, with a solid cast and even a good-looking monster. The film moves at a decent pace, but quickly gets bogged down in over-explanations and over-the-top moments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is okay, it's got a great plot and good acting. I found it to be a bit of a bore, not exciting. The actors were doing their best to give the movie what it needed. I don't like a bad action film and I don the movie a few times, then just put it down. But if you are looking for something to watch with your wife, this might be right up your alley.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A poorly acted, uninteresting, and downright un-fun film.   It lacks any sense of comedy or anything resembling humor at all.  This film would have been much better if the cast was completely different and if the movie itself was more original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is good. But the movie is not good.  The acting is not great. There are many things that I think are funny (like when the girl on the airplane says "the pilot is in the cockpit," and the pilot says "it's too early").  The plot is not very original and there are too many scenes that are just recycled.  This movie is just okay. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed with this movie. It was terrible, bad acting, and an even worse script.  This movie was really overblown.  It was just a bunch of actors playing off each other and then they put some guy in a gas chamber.    It felt like they were trying to make a big star out of that guy, and that wasn't at all what he was about.  There were times when the film felt as if they were just trying to get it made.  They didn't seem to even want to give this guy a chance.  He was put into the gas chamber for no good reason and then he dies.  In the end, I don't think any of the actors gave a real performance in the role.  I just don't get why they thought this was a good idea.  The only actor who stood out was the director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst part of this movie was the sound quality of the film. It was quite terrible. This movie should of never been made. It is so bad that you can't even enjoy it. The only reason I watched it was because I was in the store that owned the film, I wanted to see it and the director didn't want me to.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at a college cinema. My friends and I were all in it together. I have had friends that have seen it and said it is awful. I think it is bad in that it was made in the seventies. I do like to see good old Hollywood movies and the acting is ok. It is a cheesy movie but it was fun and the special effects are great.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've watched this movie several times, and I've seen several movies, so this is my first time watching the director's cut, so I can't really comment on that.   There's a lot of editing going on.  A lot of the movie is not necessary to the story. The director is basically using it as a "make-do-and-mend" kind of thing.  There are scenes cut out in the beginning and the middle, and those scenes are what made me hate the movie.  I'm pretty sure that if the movie was edited together and not with a completely different script, this movie would have been much more interesting.  Even the music and sound effects were just not very interesting. It seemed like they were trying to do something in this movie, but it was just not really there.  For example, one scene at the beginning was filmed on a sound stage, then the film crew went into the studio, shot some footage, and when the film was edited, it was much more obvious that that studio equipment and that studio stage was not used, and it looked like they had just filmed the whole movie from a movie camera.  The movie is pretty un-exciting, and not very enjoyable.  It's pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is not a good movie at all, in fact, it has some of the worst acting I have ever seen. The script and the acting is extremely bad, the movie is written in a way that it looks like an old "sketch comedy". The best acting was by a guy who didn't do any of the acting and I thought he looked like a very dumb person. The only thing I liked was that the camera was not on the actors constantly, this is one of the first movies that I've seen that really made me think "Is this an old movie that someone was making fun of or the actual movie?" I did not laugh once and I think that the acting was awful.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is a blatant rip off of the "Dune" movie. It does not even pretend to be anything but a rehash of the film and I felt like I was watching a different movie instead of watching "DUNE."  I was expecting a better movie than what I was treated to but it was a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen all the good movies in the series, and I will admit to enjoying this one a lot, but the last ten minutes were pretty weak. The plot didn't really get into any of the big action scenes and the movie just kinda felt like a boring "pilot" for the series. If you are a fan of the series or want to see it in a different way, do yourself a favor and just go to the other one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most unbelievable movie I've ever seen. If a guy goes into the desert and finds a naked woman and decides to try to have sex with her, this movie is about how he ends up killing her, because he was just so horny.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is stupid. It is a mix of all the usual garbage in the horror genre. It's like you're watching the classic "The Hills Have Eyes"   or the "Gremlins" !   I'm disappointed and really looking forward to seeing something new in the future, so the only thing that saves this movie is the voice work by the great Sam Neill, but that's it!     I have a lot of other horror movies that I like much better.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was my first movie. I had a hard time believing the entire time the movie was actually happening. The actor playing the main character was so pathetic and stupid it was sick. I saw a trailer and it was scary as hell but not good. It was so bad that I did not bother to turn it on and then the next time I played it on my old tv it didn't start at all. My friends and I thought the movie may be a hoax or a joke.   This is one of the many movies that I think was made by an evil person or group. I would love to see the movie made by a real person.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for an adventure to watch on my vacation.   The first movie on the list is one I was hoping would be good.  It wasn't, and that's what made it a very bad movie.  I would never recommend watching it, and I definitely would never rent it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's ok, the story is cool, the cast are all decent, but there just something wrong with the acting. The only good actor that makes any kind of good part of this movie is D.B. Sweeney (not the best, but at least he did a decent job). The other acting was not great either, they were all not at their best, and they all came out the same actor, who was just so stiff.    All the main characters are just so bland and not believable, like the only thing they had in common was their race (which is racist in a way because it shows how white they are). I would not watch this movie again, because I just could not care to see another white kid playing a black kid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story was ok, nothing special, and I would have liked more about the villains.   All the actors were fine, except for some annoying one that had to be annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The director of this movie is also the one who directed the remake of "The Exorcist".   It has a completely different plot.   There are many more occult characters in this movie.  It is a very evil movie and if you like movies that are filled with blood and violence then this is not your movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is a poorly acted mess of a movie. The characters are boring and the plot is very cliche. The actors are so bad that I am not sure why they did the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My family and I went to the movie theater and saw this movie. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen and it's the worst I've seen in a long time. The only reason I am writing a review is because I am a film buff. I really hoped to get something out of the movie. I got nothing. Nothing good.   The story starts off well enough, but as the movie goes on, I was thinking, "What is this? I don't get it." The plot of the story is about a father (Michael B. Jordan) who has a son (Miles Teller) that lives in the ghetto. At the beginning of the film, he gives his son a gift that will change his life. This gift is an electric skateboard that can run forever. He then gives his kids $10 and tells them to use that money on whatever they want. He tells them they should go to the movies and do something fun. His son has already seen the movie, and now he wants to go to a video store, and they don't have a video on the shelf.  It's all very weird and I was looking for something to connect with my son to keep him out of trouble. In the end, he goes to the mall and buys a video for $2.50. He goes into the store and puts the video in the right slot. The video plays but all it says is, "The movie is about to start".   I didn't know there was a video playing in the movie store, but it is obvious in the end that this was a movie that the directors went through with the same movie, so that when the video plays, it would match up.  I saw the movie and it wasn't worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "So when I bought this, it was an impulse buy. But, what a mistake. It is terrible! The acting is horrible, the characters are dull and uninteresting, the plot is so contrived and ill-conceived, the acting is so uninspired and cheesy, the camera angles are all wrong and so far from a realistic one, etc...etc...etc." - C.K.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movie I've ever seen. I'd say the reason why it is terrible is the acting. They are horrible.   I hate the voice they use for the guys. It makes the movie feel really silly. I also hate the whole movie. I didn't laugh once, and I didn.t even like the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a very poor film.  Very bad acting, acting is horrible, and the story is a complete disappointment.  The music is all over the place, and all in a very bad style. The acting is pretty awful as well, and there is nothing funny about it at all.   I wouldn't give it a single star just because of the terrible acting and acting is all wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got this for a friend's birthday and when she got home she said she was very disappointed with the movie. The actors were very bad and the special effects were not that good. There was one scene where two men tried to get into a car. I thought this was very funny but not as good as other movies.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible movie and it is terrible because the actors are bad.   The director, and writer, are incompetent.  They make a good movie, but they have no idea how to make a great movie.  I thought they had a decent budget to make such a terrible film.  But, it is a movie no one should watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie itself is a "junk" film. The director of this film decided to make the movie a "thriller" and even though he has tried to give the audience a good movie, there were lots of plot holes in this movie. In the end, there was nothing worth watching about this film.   I can't see how anyone can see this movie as anything more than a "throwaway" film...  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie for about 1/4 of its runtime and it was a very short movie. The story was rather boring and the acting was bad. The acting was not that great at all. I felt like I was in a horror movie, especially the acting of the kids. They were acting so stupid, I felt really scared, like it was real. And then the movie ended and I was just like "OK", but it was kind of a waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The cast was a big plus for this movie. The director tried hard to find different and interesting ways to portray the cast's personalities. But the performances were really bad and I did not like any of them. The performances were the worst thing about this movie, they were poorly done, and they were all played by the same two actors. The actors should be ashamed to be seen in something like this. The acting was so bad, that I could not believe any of the actors could be so bad. If a director wanted to make a movie to show the cast being stupid, he should have made a more intelligent movie about the cast of The Big Chill. The movie also is so bad that I do not understand why a director thought this movie would be popular. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has a lot of good scenes, and most of them are funny, but the rest of the movie is pretty bad.  The acting is terrible, especially the lead guy, who is the lead in this movie, and he has very bad screen presence.  They try to make him seem like the cool, smooth character in the movie, but in reality, he's a really stupid character.  It's hard to understand what he's doing all the time.  His character, Mr. "Aunt" May, is the stereotypical "black lady" from the 1930s, and she's even kind of a bitch to him.  But she's very entertaining when she's not trying to kill him and make him miserable.  All the guys in the film are terrible.  When they're not killing each other, they're just fighting with each other.  We have some guys who are really tough looking and look good fighting, but they're actually really slow.  Their faces are horrible looking, and there's really no chemistry between the guys, so they really make you look at their backs and see if they're running away or if they can't fight anymore.  I found the fight scenes to be pretty boring.  Most of the time, we're not even watching the guys fighting with the other guys, and it's just a bunch of men fighting with guns.  And I'm not saying this because I'm a "good movie fan" or anything, but it looks really bad. There are many scenes of dead bodies, and their clothes are all shredded, and the bad guys are just running through the streets or somewhere.  This movie was directed by George Roy Hill (who also directed The Godfather, and Scarface), and you know what? It's not bad at all.  He tries to make this movie into a "slasher" movie, or a "horror movie", but it's really not like that at all, and I never found any kind of horror, or any kind blood, in this film.  Even if you watch it for some really bad acting, or the acting of some of the actors, it's not really anything bad at any of the scenes.  At most, you have some kind of gore, or some weird stuff in there, but there's no blood or anything like that.    This is a real waste of money.  There's not much else to say about this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My mother was the one who got me interested in the film world. She showed me all the films that were being made at that time, as well as how to be a successful director. I always felt that the actors she directed were just trying to show off, rather than being a good actress and having a believable character.   The actors did not have any personality. I remember a scene from the movie where they were in a restaurant, and when they saw a waiter come by, the actor was saying how cool and cool he is, which the waiter wasn't even paying attention to.  This movie was made in 1966 and was only directed by William Wyler. In addition to having some of the most ridiculous dialogue of the year, the film has a lot of weird camera angles and it's pretty hard to tell who is speaking what. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is not the best in the world. They try to make it about a little girl in an orphanage. She is not that pretty but there is something sad about her life. The only good thing is the kids and their music. Not much of it is good but its there.    It's not so bad as to take away from the good parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really liked this movie as a kid. The acting was good. The music was awesome. The plot was great. The monsters were very cool. The ending was too long for me and I don't understand how it was so close to the beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You have a great idea for a movie, and it would be interesting to see it through. The movie looks great, and I love the concept. The plot is not very good, but the acting is good. I am not sure why this movie was made, but I would like to see what happened to the people in the trailer.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I hate this movie. I loved the book but this movie did not make any sense.   The main character, Nick, is obsessed with a lady he met in a cafe who he thought was beautiful, but who had to go home. He is a bit of a con man and seems to have a lot of trouble trying to find his girlfriend.  The rest of the movie is set at a hotel in the Alps. Nick meets a mysterious woman who works at the hotel. The hotel manager tries to seduce him and Nick's girlfriend comes to the hotel to find him.  It is not until the last minute that Nick manages to locate his girlfriend and get home.  I was so confused when the plot suddenly ended and I was left hanging for three and a half hours.  After the movie ended I was still wondering who the hell Nick was.  No one could answer my questions or point me in the right direction.  Maybe in a later film.  Overall a very bad film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film was not fun. It was boring. There was no story and the acting was terrible.   I will never watch this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A pretty good movie, but it isn't very good. The best parts are about 2/3rds through the movie. You may think you're watching a good thriller. But after the first 30 minutes of the movie, you realize you are watching a really bad one.   I was just thinking the movie would end in a way it was supposed to, but they took it too far. If I were to pay to see it again, I would watch the last 30 minutes before I threw it away.  I'm glad they made it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is nothing wrong with the movie, just the bad acting that is done. The actors that played the bad guys are so bad that you think they are going to commit a murder at any moment.   If I was going to be on the side of the angels and do a remake of it, I would have just let John Goodman and Jack Nicholson reprise their roles as the bad guy with a better script. I don't really care about the whole supernatural angle of it because it is all just too over the top. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never heard of this film before but had heard it was good, I was pleasantly surprised with this one. The story is actually quite interesting and I actually thought I would like the movie more because of this. The performances are great from all of the actors. The director did a great job. The cinematography is a great look at a great film.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While I really enjoyed this movie, it was just too short. It would be fine to watch this movie with other friends, but I would be very hesitant to watch it again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first two acts are ok. The third act starts to drag. The acting in this movie is atrocious. The entire cast is totally wasted.   This is the worst movie I have ever seen.  "You should be ashamed. You don't know me. You're just trying to get a picture. They are only trying to hide things." "You should've let me out at the last minute."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A lot of times I think movies are really bad and I can't even enjoy them!!!    This is one of those movies I am sure will be a flop and never get made into a movie again, like some others on this list.   I wish this would have been an animated film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an average movie that does not deserve your time. If you want to watch a movie that has nothing going for it, this is the movie for you. The acting is bad and there are too many "hilarious" gags. The only reason it was even allowed to be made is because they didn't want to miss an opportunity to play the "bad guy". If you are looking for a comedy, I highly recommend that you look elsewhere. - April 6, 2011Good for nothing
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this was a bad film, but was happy to see the ending made so I could see it.   I had hoped to see a man who was raped and abused on film. Instead, it was the child.  If this was the only rape film in the whole world, we would have a movie about rape.  My rating is 4 out of 10.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is only one thing wrong with this movie: the script. There is a lot of good stuff in this movie, but what the script is missing is a good story.  It is a film with a nice plot, but it is too hard to figure out.   I highly recommend this film to any horror lover, as it has a cool concept and very unique look. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think I've seen a movie that is so terrible, that I find it hilarious. This movie is just plain boring. It really is like watching your grandpa and mom make out. I found it so funny that I thought I should laugh, but I was just sitting there and trying to get a good laugh out of this movie. It's a real ripoff of an old show. If I had seen this on TV, I would have laughed and said, "Yeah this movie is pretty good." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this film in a screening in New York. The movie was very poor, even for a bad film. It just seemed like the director was never really interested in making a good movie. It was almost like they just wanted to put this film out there for a few bucks, and thought it would get some good reviews. The story is almost an excuse for the poor acting. It's a bunch of actors playing a bunch characters. It looks like the actors are all trying to be funny, but it doesn't work. The acting is all wooden. It doesn't feel natural. The whole movie is just really dumb. Even though this is a low budget movie, they didn't even try to make a good film. The director just wanted his name on it, and he ended up getting it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this to watch with my daughter and my wife who is not really into horror movies but was hoping this one would be good. Well, it is NOT. The movie had a lot of good ideas, but the writing was awful and the characters were the worst. I thought it was going to be a fun movie and it turned into a horror movie with a "I don't give a ****" attitude. I will never watch this movie again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoyed the movies at the library, but the staff were just being jerks when they took my money to watch these. The movie was all over the place, and the acting was very bad. This is an extremely cheesy movie, and they don't even seem to care about the acting. I didn't want to go to a movie again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a very bad movie. I hate to tell people this, but it was like a bad nightmare. My wife and I looked at each other in horror as this horrible movie started. We had to pause it because we thought that it was going to come to life, and it did. I will never watch this movie again. I think that there are much better movies to watch and that this was one of them.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just bought this movie on VHS from a guy in California. I saw it in the late 90's when I was 10-11 years old. I remember a scene where they shoot a baby with a BB gun. I wanted to take a picture but couldn't.  I remember thinking that was stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was awful, the acting was all over the place, and the CGI was extremely bad. They have to have been working from a copy of "The Matrix" because they were all in "The real world" and it looked completely fake.  The only thing that made it funny was the scene where everyone was running through the streets when it's night time.  I am sick of these poorly produced films that are so bad they look like they were made for the web. They should have just stayed in the 30's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is not worth a second of your time! The acting is very bad!  The acting and writing are completely off!   It makes no sense! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie about one man's struggle with addiction, this is the story of a young man with no friends, no money, and no prospects. He has a drug habit, so bad that he doesn't even try to quit. He takes to the street, to his home, and he begins to take the lives of many. As he goes deeper and deeper, one by one, the people around him die in strange, violent ways. His search for answers will take him into the heart of the drug business itself, and lead him deeper and further into the world of a drug kingpin. He's got his friends, his family, and his money, but he's left with nothing. The ending of this movie is absolutely disgusting.   This movie is not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible movie, very poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly acted by the best actors around. And I mean that very literally. There's a couple of performances in here which I really liked. But there's a whole lot of acting in this film which I wouldn't recommend seeing at a kid's birthday party, unless you're willing to get very excited at the sight of the costumes and props on the set.   I'm surprised the studio didn't just go ahead and get a couple older actors to do the roles.  I feel sorry for the guy that had to do all the stunts on that thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I hate the fact that a movie that is so bad can get released.   This movie was so bad I could not watch it with my family.  The acting was terrible. The scenes in the house were all of the worst. The girl was playing the piano with her mouth while she was in the shower and the camera stayed on her ass while she played the piano.  When we see the girls face in the mirror she is a dirty slut.  I am glad that they will release this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first time I saw this film I thought "What the hell is this?"  It's so bad, I can't believe the people involved would put out such an abysmal movie.  The story follows a boy who must learn how to fly. When he gets into a plane it crashes, and a strange old man has to save him.  And then he has to kill him. And I never see this kind of story before.  This film has a couple of really bad scenes. One where a group of people are about to murder a child.  Another where a man has some kind of mental breakdown.  But the scenes that make this film really bad, are the ones that are supposed to show the boy's struggle to survive.  In one scene he has no idea how to get back to the island, and in another he is on a raft floating through the ocean.  Some scenes are so ridiculous they're unbelievable.  There is one scene where the boy is running in the desert, and it takes 10 minutes before he finds water and some kind to eat.  It was like watching a scene out of a horror movie. One of the worst parts is how the film keeps going and going, the dialogue and the pace just gets faster and faster.   I really didn't know what to think of this film. I didn't think it was bad at all, and I had high hopes for this film when I saw the trailer.  I guess I was just lucky because they didn't really need to spend money on advertising, since the movie was so bad.  As it turns out it's a real embarrassment to waste such a large budget on such an awful film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not a fan of the '80s horror sub-genres that had a huge influence on this film. This is a bit of an odd one, as it's a bit cliched and kind of forgettable. There are some nice sequences of dark violence and a really creepy little story, but the film loses the edge when it tries to play with genre tropes and does a pretty bad job of it. The acting is just bad throughout. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved this movie for the story, but the characters are boring. The main character is the worst actor I have seen in a movie. His character is like a dog that's never been taken to the pound, or his owner has just put a leash on him and told him to do as he pleases and doesn't mind if the dog gets into a fight or attacks. It's just a stupid movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are looking for a good comedy, I suggest going for something more like 'Ghost Town'.   I like it but a few of the scenes are a bit too contrived for my liking.   They have some interesting ideas about the relationship between a man and his own gun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen this movie twice and each time I would like to have seen it a few times before making up my mind. The first time I was a few months old and my father was about to watch it with me but he couldn't get to the cinema until about 9pm, so my mom and I sat on the floor and watched the movie for about 45 minutes.   The second time I went to the theatre I was about 3 months old, my mother and I watched it together at about 7pm.  After the movie we were all exhausted, so we were sitting at the kitchen table and my mother decided to watch a movie with me, but instead I kept watching this movie over and over again.  My parents got up and went to bed and the movie ended and then I lay in bed and watched it again, but again and again. Finally my mother said, "Well, we have to get up and watch the movie at 6am.  "  And so we did and it ended, the next night we went to see a new one and that one ended up being about the same thing, but then we saw the film a second time and that film ended up playing in the theatre for three hours!   At that point my father got so fed up with watching the same movie over, over, and over that he took me and my sister upstairs to watch the film in the movie theatre where the only other person there was an old man with a walking stick who would have loved to watch this film!  My father didn't realise that the old man was also the director and the script was written by the same guy who wrote the one I saw in the cinema.  I can only imagine how boring and frustrating it must have been to see the same film over,over and over!  There are so many things that are wrong with this film and I just want to warn people to avoid it like the plague.  A waste of money and time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen this movie at least 5 times and each time I had the same problem. It seems like the camera pans around the same part of the scene and keeps zooming in on that person's face.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was bad. It was a slow and boring movie, with an overly long and convoluted plot. This movie has no plot and it doesn't have any suspense. The actors are not good at acting, they are terrible. They do not act like they want to die. They act like a bunch of idiots who are making a movie that doesn't really matter. I don't even know if the actors in this movie even understand what they are saying and how stupid it sounds, but they are acting. The plot is stupid and ridiculous. The actor's acting was atrocious and they do not care. The music is very bad. One of the songs is very cheesy and horrible. The film is very repetitive, the movie has not any plot or suspense. I'm glad I saw it before I go to sleep tonight.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have never enjoyed a movie that is so obvious it will not appeal to anyone but me. The only redeeming quality is that I know this is not the work of an imbecile (except perhaps in the script). It is very bad. And I am sorry, but this movie is all-too-familiar and it is all too bad that it has to be as bad as it is.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I hate to say this, but this movie sucks. I don't understand why they made this movie at all. The main problem with this movie is that it's just not that good. The actors are all really bad and not funny at all, the scenes that are really good are just so out of context. A lot of the time, I don-t remember any one of the actors saying a single line of dialogue. At times, I thought that maybe the director was trying to make this movie "realistic" and had hired actual actors, but no, the actors just don't look like real people, so they don't even sound like real actors. This movie also seems to be a rip-off of a movie called "The Big Lebowski". The characters don't have anything to do with the characters in the movie and aren't even related by marriage. And for some reason, there are a lot of scenes where people are falling out of airplanes, driving cars, and riding bicycles. I didn't like that this movie was made by the same director as The Big Lebowksi because it seems as though that would have saved this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad film. It is not very good. The actors are not good either. The script is very bad and all the jokes are bad. It would be good to see a good action film or one about a military man or something. It could have been a great movie if it had been made a long time ago. It has many bad scenes in it and even when a good scene is filmed, it is ruined by the terrible acting. The only good thing is that the plot was good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very bad movie. I wish it didn't make it to the theaters. A little bit of a slog to get through. The acting was terrible and I think the story didn't help the movie. It was a slow burn. I liked the idea, but it didn´t have enough going for it. The story was really just the same old plot you see in many other movies and the writing was terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this in a movie theater when I was a child in the late 70s. This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen.   It stars Steve McQueen, and he looks like he's 5 years old. His character, Burt Lancaster, has a retarded daughter and he spends the entire movie yelling at her. He's always saying she has a brain tumour. He tries to make her wear a "Bobby" t-shirt on the beach because she has no arms. She's constantly getting hit by a car. He keeps yelling at him to "Get her away from me!" It's just painful to watch.  What a terrible film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film has some good moments but the pacing is off and the acting is absolutely atrocious.   This is a film you should have watched years ago.  I hope that someone who wants to make a bad film makes a good film that they can actually watch.  - Don't bother with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It started out well, with the opening sequence with the young boy climbing the ladder, the young girl screaming in terror and the scene of the man beating her with a pole in the corner. But once the camera moves to the front of the car to get a better shot of the scene, it becomes obvious that this movie doesn't have a story at all, with no one involved doing anything. The first half of the movie is just one big flashback, with little action. The camera just keeps panning over the woman and the young child as the two sit there watching.   The second half of this movie is the most pathetic. It's as if someone wanted to be on "Dr. Phil," but realized that the show wasn't about that. I guess the producers thought it would be funny to have someone like me stand on stage and talk about my abuse as a child, and have me talk about the abuse I suffered while being raped. But that wouldn't be a real episode on "Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood."   This movie is basically a documentary of me talking about my life in the ghetto, with me being interviewed, but without any of the emotions I feel when talking about it.  One thing that got me really upset was how they kept showing me when I was younger, because I had been the same age as the victim.  It makes me wonder what was happening during the time of my abuse, because it feels like they were filming an old kid who was trying to look like an older kid.  I would really love to see the director and writers of this film give some more insight into the situation so that people like me can understand what was going on in the mind of a person who would commit this atrocity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved this movie. The plot was good. It was one of the few movies where the guy with the gun was really cool. The only bad thing about the movie is it was filmed in Europe and they used an old German film projector that only projected the movies in black and white. You could only see the lines, not the colors.    If you like action and don't want to pay much then this is the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an average.   It's not bad at all, it's just not that good.  It tries too hard to be cool, but really doesn't work.  The acting isn't that great.  But it's a comedy so you're not going to get a bad one.  They did a great job of putting on the funny parts but they didn't do any funny at all.  You'll probably be laughing at this movie a couple of times but it's not worth watching.  This was a movie they couldn't make.  I like to watch comedies and don't really care for these kind of movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read an excellent review of this movie which really makes me appreciate its quality, but I just don't think the movie is a good movie.   The story is poorly told, and the plot is all over the place, from silly to disturbing.  The acting is awful.  This movie has nothing to do with the book, but the movie tries to do so many things to get the audience to feel something, all of which is very poorly done.  I think this movie was made by a group of people who didn't have the time, or the interest, to write a truly original movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie at the cinema. At this point in my life, movies have a lot of charm and they have no trouble pulling you in and never let go. The acting was great, the cinematography and sound were superb, and the plot was great. But the story was extremely silly. The protagonist, who doesn't even speak, is running a successful clothing company. But they make a terrible mistake by bringing in a girl who is only a child and that the whole thing is a front. They keep her in a separate room, give her a little money and tell her to work for free. At the end, she's very old and has a huge belly and a bad back. She doesn't know what to do, and she dies of shame. It was awful.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a horrible mistake. It doesn't deserve to be called a "film". It has no plot. There is not even a reason why the people in the film are shooting at each other. It's just a bunch of people shooting at one another.   The actor who played a police officer in the movie is a really bad actor. His dialogue is all over the place.  The sound track is a total disaster. The worst part of it is when a car is in front of you, you can hear the sound of it passing by.  This movie is so bad that it makes you want to hate the people that made it.  I will not watch it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really want to like this movie, but this one has a serious problem. I mean, it was supposed to be a love story, but then the two main characters just go off on the road to the countryside. This film has a very silly, naive look to it. I know that there are some people who are just like that, but I don't get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible. The acting was horrendous, the characters were so generic, the plot was retarded, the music was boring, and the cinematography was horrendous. This movie was made with out any talent, no talent at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "This movie is a joke and a joke only. It is a comedy so you know it will be funny. "   This movie is the comedy of the century. Don't bother with it. It's a waste of time. This is a movie that was made for a generation that doesn't even have any good movies.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It seems the production of "Alien" was a huge disaster. This is the worst Alien film in my opinion and that includes "Alien Resurrection", "Aliens", "Alien 3", "Predator", "Prometheus", "Blade Runner", "The Fly", "Twilight Zone" and all the other ones that come to mind. The original idea of the movie was to make a horror movie on an alien ship. Unfortunately, what "Alien: Covenant" did was make the whole concept sound ridiculous. "Alien Covenant" was supposed to be the third film and it was supposed it have the best atmosphere and effects. What they ended up with was a film where no one but a few actors would get in the right place at the right time. The effects were mediocre and the acting was laughable. The whole alien thing is silly. Even the aliens in this movie, although creepy, are stupid. They are only there because they have to be to pay off some silly plot device. "Alcatraz" had a great cast and director. This film did nothing for them.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a joke, and not a good one.   There are too many jokes, and all of them are so poorly made, that the film becomes comical at times.  This is the movie where the guy with the fake mustache comes over and asks for directions, only to have the "directions" be the guy who had the mustache in the first place.  There is also a really bad fake French accent in the movie, making it hard to understand any of the dialogue, and it is even difficult to understand some of the French characters.  If the only thing to take away from this movie is that it is funny, then that would be fine.  Otherwise, this film should not be watched at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is NOT even worth watching. I was expecting a great film about an old man on the run and this is all just a "sideshow" to make a quick buck. The only thing of interest is when the old man, who is never caught or even seen, jumps over the fence into the lake with his dog, but even then there's no suspense. I found it to be a cheap movie with no plot. It looks pretty and the soundtrack is good, but if you want to watch a crappy film, this is probably your best option. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was awful. The plot and characters were bad, the acting was horrible, and the acting in this film is horrible.  The plot was nothing. A girl falls for a rich guy because he is a famous and handsome actor. He shows her pictures of his beautiful wife and then the girl falls in love. I guess she was too naive to understand what the world is like. I don't know.  When you go into a movie to see a good movie you get the idea it's going to be good. This was a horrible movie.   I guess they thought because the actor looked pretty good that people would like him.  My husband and I both have issues with sex.  We have a lot of fun when we have sex. The sex in this movie was horrible. We kept getting interrupted.  I know they were trying to make it look like she was a "good girl" and she really fell for the guy.  But she was not a good girl, she did not even kiss him on the cheek at the end, just looked at him. If you are looking for a good action movie about a pretty girl falling in love with a handsome actor, this might be for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I haven't seen much Hollywood film, but I did watch this and it was pretty bad. The actors weren't really acting, and the plot was a lot of garbage. I couldn't understand any of it, and it wasn't really funny. I was bored so I went home and watched some tv show instead.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst of the bunch. The actor is terrible, the story sucks, and the plot is terrible too.   I would love to see another actor play that role. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So what's so bad about this movie?  Well, it has a rather high budget for a film with only one good performance in it.  The rest is quite bland with the exception of one really good performance by a young man who's very convincing as the character "The General."  But the acting in this film is so bad it's hard to believe they were even trying to make the best of a bad situation.   The story is simple enough, the bad guys are all killed, and the good guys win.  But why do they win?  The film is pretty good in general, but that final shot at the end is really bad.  You'd think the good guy would just sit there quietly and take the hit for the good of his nation.  And why didn't they just use the other planes?   There's also a really bad musical number in this movie that's really bad even by Hollywood standards.  One of the other really good characters is killed off really quickly, and a couple of the villains die in interesting ways, but for the most part there's no depth to the characters.  Overall this is a bad film, but a fairly good action film in this day and age. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For all the hype and talk of what would happen with "Batman v Superman" and the "DC Films Universe" we'll see in the next year and a half, I don't see anything in the film that was good. I couldn't care less about Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne, but I'm glad that he is there because of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, but mostly just because it's a movie that doesn't try too hard to be any more than a good action movie. It could be interesting, but it certainly doesn't look like the film was made with much thought. I wish I could say something about the casting of the film, but you have a lot of young and talented actors, but then you also have the older actors like Jason Momoa and Henry Cavill that just seem like they don't have any life or personality in the films that they play. Overall this is a very very basic, fun action movie that never makes it come alive, and even if it had tried a little harder to become something that could have been worth seeing it's pretty disappointing that it failed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really hope for better from this movie.  If not, it will be hard to watch.  This movie is so bad, that it feels bad to think about it.  I hope it will get better because it is not worth to watch this movie, even if it was made on purpose.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is simple and if you haven't seen this film before, you will not be able to understand it. The film begins in a small town. There are rumors of a woman with the face of an animal and blood dripping from her mouth. She is known as the Lady in Red. She has been going around the countryside murdering people. She uses her face, as well as her own blood, to make her victims disappear. She then leaves a bloody trail behind her by means of a shoe. She moves on to a larger town. This town is called The Red Chamber. The town is full of vampires. A girl is brought there. She sees the Lady In Red and wants to know more. She and her mother have run away, and the town is in turmoil.   At this point, it is apparent that the film is very low on plot and that it has nothing to do with the rest of the series. The story is about the girl and her friend, who is a vampire hunter. The two of them must run away from their town if they are to survive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason why I do not give this movie any stars is because it had to be made as a comedy. I think that is it's worst part. The rest of it was okay.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie itself is a good movie to look at in my opinion, but the director is just a joke.   It is a very simple story, but its not that bad.  The best part of it is the actor playing the role of the young boy, but even then its hard to see how he could be the character from the original story.  But that doesn't make the movie better, the story is just really weak.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You'll be disappointed if you have seen this movie. It's nothing like the others. A boring and unoriginal "sci-fi" movie with some actors, a director who tries to pass off a "sci fi" movie as a "horror", and a story that doesn't even make sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never been in this kind of movie before. It's hard to watch. I don't like the acting, nor the characters. The acting was weak and didn't have that "star quality" that one expects in Hollywood movies. The film was well made for Hollywood, but it doesn't have what it takes to be a good movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very bad movie. Very poor acting, acting that doesn't work and bad acting, it's just bad. Not much dialogue, no plot, no story. It's just a lot of walking and talking and very little action. I can't remember anything from the plot and even the action seems to be shot out of order. I just have to wonder if the director of this movie was trying to make the action as realistic as possible for a science fiction movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had to get rid of this movie from my collection.   The only way I can watch this movie is on the Internet, and the worst part about that is that it's extremely hard to find.  It's hard to see this movie because it's so bad.  When I go to the Internet and look for it, I usually see that it hasn't been seen in 20 years.  But here it is, in 3D.  This movie is actually a satire of some very serious issues and is very good at doing it.  If you're looking for something really, really bad, this is it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has many of the classic elements of bad horror movies, and the acting is atrocious. I'd give it an 8/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never seen a more horrible movie in my life.   It had a total of 3 actors who never acted together for a film, and they never acted well together either.  The only thing I liked about it was that I think it had the greatest title.  It was a huge train wreck and it was made for a tv show.  Don't bother watching it, just sit back and take a big shit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie will haunt your dreams!   For the love of god this movie is NOT good!  The acting is so bad it is unreal!  I can say that from the first time I saw it through the movie I thought "this is going to be a long ride!"  The music is awful! The acting was not worth the money paid for it and the plot is terrible!  This is the reason I can't sit through a movie again.   I was so disappointed in this movie.  I want to leave it off the list but the way it was made it was a MUST see film!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is so poorly written, acted and acted out that it's hard to find any value in it. It's like watching someone who has never seen a movie before try to act like an actor in a movie. All the characters are so stiff and wooden that it just makes the film look like a pile of bad acting and bad acting.   The director and all the actors had little to no talent to be able to portray any characters.  The main character is the worst part of the film. All he does is stand around all the time and then the story turns on him.  It's bad enough that there is only one really bad scene in the whole movie, but there are so many worse ones that it all blends together.  I am really not even going to start talking about how awful all the other characters are.  This movie is nothing more than a long string of bad actors trying their best to act in some terrible film that they didn't know how to act. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like cheesy movies, you might enjoy this one. If not, then you're going to hate it. If you don't like cheesy, old fashioned movies, then this one is for you. It's cheesy, it's cheesy. It goes on too long. It has a lot of characters who all think alike and act alike. There are a lot twists that the movie has to throw at you just to get you to stick around. Even if you do like cheesy old fashioneds, you can't say you'll like this one because there's nothing new to say. The only thing it's good at is being cheesy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is not good and the main actor is no good at all! I would not recommend it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a big fan of horror movies, and this one is very bad. The acting is really bad, the gore is over the top, and the camera is never on any of the actors at all. It's not even clear if the director even knows what he's doing! The acting sucks, the acting is lame and the gore sucks. It is a waste of money.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the definition of a B-movie, as the acting is terrible and the plot is so pointless and random that you will not even remember the story by the end. It is so confusing and unoriginal that it has no value to the movie. This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time and I hope that no one will ever get to see it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a total mess. You have two men who are not even the real world stars of this movie, they are two ordinary people trying to get their acting careers started with some good will and friendship. Their friendship goes downhill pretty fast and then you have this crazy cult of people who do nothing but hate on the two people who are making their acting career take off and the one who is trying to do it the most. I know what a cult of haters is but the two main stars were so good that I can't help but think of the way these people in the cult treat the people they know. I was very disappointed when they were going to leave the cult and go off and do their thing and then this movie came out. If you love this movie just go see it for free and forget about it. The ending made it seem like the whole movie was just to promote it to a cult audience.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is horrible. It is made up of 3 or 4 different short stories and only one is good. It shows that they are making a movie. They never do anything right.  This was my first time seeing "Sickness" and I was really not impressed. It was so bad. If you like movies like this, stay away from this one! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a disappointment, especially for a movie made for children. You can tell it is a movie that was made by a family that liked to make kid's movies. The movie should have been more fun and exciting.   It was sad to see that the movie had to end so early and the director didn't even want to continue making a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story itself isn't bad, but the execution sucks.   At first, the movie looks interesting, and there are a few different things going on in the movie. There are a couple of small action sequences that are pretty cool, and they have their own little twists.  But, after a while, the twists and turns start to get old.  The movie really loses steam in the middle and end, and the story itself gets really sloppy.  I would suggest you just watch the first half of the movie first and see if you like it before diving into the second half.  Overall, the film was okay, but it got pretty bad by the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A mediocre movie.   It is a poorly made movie that should not have been released.  There are many bad movies out there, but I doubt that this would have been any different.  The story is so poor that even the actors in the movie are not convincing at all.  It has many scenes that make no sense and the people who acted in it do not look believable.  I do not understand why people would put up with this movie. It has no plot, no story, no character development, nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is called "Happening Again", and it is a great movie, but it is just too bad to be good. It is a movie about an old man and a girl who live in a small apartment building. The old man goes to a party and loses his mind. He then starts killing people, one of which is his neighbor. His neighbor's daughter, the daughter of the old man, is a really beautiful woman. She's only 16 years old and this old man is a total creep.   I think that if you don't like the first film then you probably won't like this one, but I do like the sequel, but don't recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is boring and boring.   You are not entertained and I did not get any enjoyment out of this movie.  A couple of scenes are very silly.  I hope they do this again in the future.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Worthless" "Fantastic" - May 4, 2015 This movie is terrible 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's bad, and if you haven't seen it, it's only because it's a remake and I'm not too keen on remake sequels, but I've seen the original, and there's something in this remake that's so completely wrong with it, that I'm sure it won't last much longer.   First of all, it has no connection to the original and so there's no point in doing this movie at all, except for just to make money.    The lead actress, Anna Faris (who's best known for her role as Monica in Friends) has an excellent career, but she's not quite the same as the one in this movie. The costume was too big and the face made her look like a mannequin.  The writing is also poor, because there's not a thing about this movie that's realistic.  It has an almost campy feel to it, because it has to make you laugh, but that's exactly what they're doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I enjoyed this movie. A few things that annoyed me were the stupidly over the top fight scenes and the way the female characters were portrayed. It was too unrealistic. I feel like there is so much violence, death and destruction that I think a lot of the things in this movie could be avoided if the director was a little more careful.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a classic B movie (the first one in the series with the same title) by the genius director George Stevens with some great performances by Clark Gable, Cary Grant, and Spencer Tracy.   I enjoyed the movie, but I was disappointed at the ending.  They had to throw everything they had in there to get an audience to come to the theater to see a movie that is already long out of print.  I can't imagine anyone will ever see it.  And that's a shame, because it is an interesting movie about the end of a marriage that does make sense for some of the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was way too long to make a great movie. The story was too much of a stretch to make it work.   It just wasn't worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a total failure.  It is completely unrealistic and unworkable.  The plot is completely nonsensical, and most characters are completely unlikable. The acting and direction are also unprofessional.   The production and filming quality is appalling, and the film has an absolutely terrible soundtrack.  A few people may find this entertaining, but for the millions of other viewers, this will likely turn into an embarrassment.  If you are a fan of the TV show "Lost" then this is just one of many uninspired and silly movies with no real interest.  To make it worse, this movie is even worse as far as sequels go.  This is an unlistenable mess of an episode of the television show.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is overrated, i love the character of my character i will watch it again  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a movie I would see if I was a movie snob. I thought I would hate this movie, but it didn't work. It's just not good. It doesn't have the right feel and doesn't do anything right.   The characters are not interesting, and it never develops any of them.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but if you want a good action movie with the occasional humor this is the movie for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie once when I was in high school and it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.  The director was supposed to star with Michael Jai White and Marisa Tomei but that never happened.  Marisa was very overweight and looked terrible in this movie and I don't think it is her fault.  When she does speak in this film she has terrible voice and I wish she would have not been cast in this role.   The story revolves around a father and son who fall in love and the father is forced to give up his son's life. They go on a crazy trip to the far west and find that it is a perfect place for a young couple.  I was really not into this movie at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is the only thing I ever saw, so it is a bit of a bore. I did not even see the movie. It was so bad, I did nothing but walk to the cinema.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't love this movie. It was a disappointment.   There's something about this movie that makes it feel like it took place before the series even began. It just felt like the movie should have been set a few years after the end of The Empire Strikes Back.  This film did well for itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is NOT a good movie.  I don't like the way the plot is built up.  It just seems to be about a girl, who is in love with a girl from school and they get married and have one kid.  But the girl dies and they go through the whole grieving process.  They just don't talk about it.  So this leads to this young guy, who just gets caught in all this.  He has been in love a long time and really misses her.  Then she is pregnant.  There is nothing good about this.   This was a crappy movie and not worth watching.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think this movie is a great homage to 70's and 80's cinema.   It starts out great but then it descends into a cheesy mess of bad acting, plot, and directing.  A good movie but not one I'll watch again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a train wreck. The plot was completely contrived and had nothing to do with any actual train wreck happening. The movie was made to make as much money as possible. The train, in all it's terrible splendor was very poorly planned and acted as an homage to the 1930's silent horror films. When the train was destroyed, the rest of the movie was ruined. The actors were great, the special effects looked great, and the music and sound effects were amazing. But when the movie became a trainwreck, it was over with.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie i have seen by the director, that he had to make after seeing another one.   This movie is not funny, there is no romance, it just has lots of violence and gore that doesn't give the best feeling.  My friends and i laughed out loud several times at all of the violent scenes and it was just too hard to take.  A story was not shown clearly, we only saw what the character thought he saw and nothing about the events before or after was shown.  I think this movie should be burned for the poor acting and lack of funny scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very disappointed, I loved the movie, it's a good movie but it really wasnt that good, and I thought they really should of done a better job, the movie is great to watch, the story, the acting, the writing... but the acting was terrible, the girls were great, they were so hot, but all the boys were like dicks, they had great bodies, and the acting is so bad, I wish they would of just had the girls do the acting and the boys play their roles. I was really upset because I loved it and i thought it would have been better.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movies i've ever seen and its awful. The acting sucks and the plot is very boring and the story just feels that the people should be locked up and forced to attend rehab. And the acting... the actor doesnt even appear that bad but its sooooo obvious that it wasnt made by a real actor. Its so obvious that the director of the movie should get fired but thats not happening.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is absolutely pathetic. I was shocked the director had enough confidence to try to play the "dance" scene when a very attractive (but unattractive) girl starts to dance for a camera. The woman's dancing is terrible and her dancing moves were so bad it is almost embarrassing. But she tries to "dive" in the water and get in the ocean because it is a beautiful, sunny day. I mean it is in the middle of winter in Iceland and we are watching people go to the beach for an afternoon swim, right? She doesn't even get in. She starts swimming back to the hotel. We don't see her again for another five minutes or so and then she just disappears. It is just pathetic.   She went into the water in Iceland  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this before and thought it was the same movie. The music and the actors are all the same people. It wasn't so bad that it would stop me from seeing it, but it wasn't very good either. I had to turn off my DVD player. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie.   It's not an "epic" film but it doesn't need to be.  It is a boring movie that you will not see on many "great" film lists.  I have seen it once.  The actors are not very good and some of the shots are terrible.  If you don't mind being bored then it is a good movie to watch while you are waiting for a show.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a horrible film. I hate it when people call something "bad". To be honest this movie is pretty bad.  It starts off with a pretty bad beginning, we see a woman (who I think is very hot) getting raped by 3 guys who just rape her. We see her try and stop them (i thought it was very strange) and they just laugh at her and continue to rape her anyway. The girls next stop are also being raped. We then see a man in prison, he is one of the most horrible men I have ever seen. He says he wants to talk to the girls he raped and tell them that he loves them and that he's sorry. (which he clearly doesnt) Then the girl he raped runs away and we see him being arrested for the rape. He is now in prison for all of this. Then he is sent back to the place he raped the girl. They say she was attacked in a park, which is not the case. This movie was so cheesy and not a fun watch at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have not seen the movie but I heard this is the same movie.   It sounds ridiculous.  The director should be ashamed for writing this trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is awful and the actors don't seem to know their parts. The only good part in the movie is the music. I don't like it at all. The best part of the movie was the car chase in the beginning and that really gave it some atmosphere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A horrible movie, I really don't recommend it at all. Very strange story, the only thing I can remember from it is that it starts with a man going in a strange room, and I didn't know what was going on, I was watching it for two minutes before it ended and then I left it and went to sleep.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first movie at the drive-in. It was not bad but it was not the best either. It wasn't bad at all but it wasn't the greatest either. I am going to be honest with you and say that I am not a huge fan of the movie. When I saw it I wasn't sure what I would think. It does have some good scenes and some good songs but it didn't really click for me.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was in the wrong movie, but it was all right. I wanted to see this movie when it was released. This movie is very low budget and it doesn't work.  I wish it had been an independent movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was pretty decent, though not as good as I remembered it being.   The cast were all solid, and the director did a good job of making the movie feel more real (which is a good thing) and giving it an overall mystery/suspense feel.  I also liked how the film made it seem like the killer knew exactly what he was doing, and that he knew exactly where he was going.  This film was really interesting and creepy.  The most amazing part was the killer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have heard it said that this film was so bad that it actually led to the demise of the studio's studio system. This was said by Hollywood, so, I thought I would give it a chance. It didn't work. This is not a bad film; there are a number of really good scenes and the special effects are great. The problem is that it is really overrated, so it really sucks. The dialogue and performances are just awful. The acting, especially the parts of James Woods and Paul Newman are just terrible. The worst part is that the special effect effects, the special editing, and the editing in general, is a mess. I don't want to be harsh, but if this film were in a film festival, it would be one of the worst films I have ever seen. It is really an awful, overrated piece of garbage. I do recommend this film to anyone who likes action movies. It does have a lot of good scenes, but the bad acting, bad special effects, and bad editing makes it a bad and uninteresting film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story was terrible. And this movie had a lot of great scenes.  A great movie that was ruined by bad acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went into this movie expecting a comedy, as i have seen lots of them. I was right, in a way, but not in a good way. For me this was a comedy from the start, and from then on, i did not want to turn it off. The movie is not even funny at all, so it would have been perfect to watch for people who enjoy laughing at bad movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The movie is all right, but it is very slow paced, like a cross between the old silent film and the silent theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I gave this a good review on the basis that the movie is a "feel good" movie - if that's what you're looking for. In reality, it doesn't matter what the story was about.   The movie starts with the character in a room.  He asks himself, "What is my purpose in this world?"  Then he sees a picture of his deceased mother and goes into a trance.  The character is now on a journey to find his real purpose, which is something he was afraid of doing.  When he finds it, it's as if he has never existed.  Unfortunately, this movie doesn't really have a plot.  It just tells you what it's like to live life to the fullest.  I thought this was a very well-written movie that I highly recommend.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just found out about this movie and was disappointed that I wasted my time watching it. The characters are just flat out boring and the script is awful. There's so little story going on that it's hard to tell what is happening at times. The acting is bad and I found myself having to look away during many scenes because of the bad acting. The movie even had a lot of stupid ideas to help keep the movie going. The film just never took off and had a weird cult following only lasting for a couple of months. It was way overpriced for what it was but it would be good if they made an awesome sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie had a lot of potential but it is very disappointing.   It has a lot too much going on and some boring scenes.  This was only made for the cash money and it is not worth it.  If you are a horror fan it is ok but there is nothing else to watch other than the cheap movies that are on television.  It is very bad at what it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm so glad that I finally bought this movie at a flea market. It's a total waste of money. The people that work there are totally unhelpful. I was supposed to have a conversation with them, and they never responded to my calls or texts. I think they were on vacation! The movie is not good and the acting is terrible. I have a lot of respect for the people who make movies, but this one doesn't pass the test.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film when it was on a small town movie theatre in Stony Plain, NY. The film was very short and all of the extras were in their underwear. The lead, a very handsome guy, was wearing a little bit of makeup. I could only see him for about a minute before he was totally bald. After that I just did not understand what was going on. There was no plot and the actor didn't seem to know what he was doing. I had to sit through a couple of boring scenes of him going to the bathroom, being arrested and being taken to jail.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie I ever watched. The actors and actresses were all pretty much the worst. I have seen much worse acting in a more realistic style movies, but this was all over the place. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It is just a mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like this movie because it is a good comedy about a guy who is living in a little house on the side of a mountain in the woods with his dog, and he has a lot of trouble getting over his lack of success and he tries to do some of these things in order to make himself feel better, but it does not work out.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie that was very poor in terms of what it was trying to do. There was no point to it and the ending didn't make any sense. The characters in this movie were pathetic. There were too many times where you saw that some of them were more interested in trying to prove their manhood than being a proper man. The story was just lame and it had no humor to it at all. It's one of the most boring movies you'll ever watch.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie has great sound. The cinematography is excellent. The acting is great. The script is good. The direction is excellent and it does make a good movie.   This movie is not worth watching.  The story is not very good. It takes the audience into another world and then the movie keeps switching to another world with a different group of characters. I am not really sure why the story changes so much. Some of the people in the movie are the most boring characters ever. I don't know what was going on with the writers in this movie. I mean the story was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A long time ago, in a town of just 20,000 people, a series of violent incidents occur. The police are overwhelmed with crime and the mayor has asked all citizens to keep their windows locked. But the citizens have only one thing to do: take matters into their own hands. They kill and kill until only one of them remains. But, as the police are outnumbered, their only hope of saving their loved ones lies with an unlikely hero, a vigilante who seems to have survived death himself. It's a grim, dark movie, but it's good to know there is a place for it in our culture.  I'll make it simple: if you don't like this movie, don't go out and see it. It is a depressing, low-budget, action movie in which they don't show the violence because they have nothing better to do. You will see blood, gore, and a whole lot of shooting. The plot is basically a joke, the characters are not memorable and the acting is pretty bad. But if you do have to see this movie just because you are curious, you should have at least been warned about this. - March 31, 2008BAD MOVIE
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts with a montage that was filmed at a carnival and at a fair, but with different settings.   One of the most generic scenes in recent years.  The first half of the film was boring.  For a "mummy story", it was incredibly repetitive, and there were several scenes that were simply reused for different purposes.  I could watch the whole thing over and over.  "I'm going to live the life of a mummy!"  The characters in this film are not real.  It is a cheap horror film that doesn't really stand on its own.  All it does is try and shock the audience.  Just a typical story with a lame ending: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this film as a film festival selection. It was a great film that I would never have otherwise seen. It's the kind of film you can watch, sit down and relax with. The actors were perfect, the script is clever and very well done. If you love good films you should watch this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *It is bad*   -  It is really bad   I hate this movie   It will make you cry   This movie is really stupid   Very annoying  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can see where the intention was to make a fun film. Unfortunately the actual execution was dreadful.  If you've never seen the movie, don't bother. The whole thing is one long slapstick scene. It is a joke that never gets over the top.  The character development is so shallow that by the end of the film you want to punch the screen.  I wouldn't waste my time watching the film again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie isn't bad.  It isn't even good.  I've seen it three times and the acting is always terrible.   But this movie is really funny.  I think it is a spoof on the comedy series.  This time around it is all about the character of Steve Carrell as he tries to get a job at a comic book store.  The problem with this movie, I think, is that it doesn't have the funny parts.  It isn' t funny about anything at all.  There is really nothing funny about it.  When the guys go to the comic book shop they get yelled at and there is a lot of "foul language."  Steve Carlett is really annoying as the "boss."  I'm surprised that a film like this was made.  If I were watching it now, I would think "this is just a dumb comedy."  This isn't very well written and the whole idea of an actor doing the role of a "super villain" is kind of laughable.  A few characters are funny but it is kind out of place.  For example, there is one guy who was supposed to be the "jokester" and it was hilarious because he was a moron.  Even Steve Carlell is bad as he is really boring and the guys never get much fun out of him.  Overall it is just silly and not very interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible movie. It has a story to it, but it's one you can not care about. The lead actor is absolutely nothing. I mean, he's a bad actor and has a bad attitude. He's just there for the show. The only good thing is the director. It's not a bad director at all, but the production values are awful. The cinematography is really bad. Everything is too bright, and it just looks awful. And that's all I have to say about that.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was really bad.   All the actors are really good.  In some scenes the acting was terrible. I'm not sure I understand their character at all.  This is a very poor film.  I really would not recommend watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A mediocre movie with bland and uninteresting characters, and a plot of absolutely no interest at all.   While the idea of an interstellar space ship is cool, it's just a poorly executed idea, and all of the other ideas they try to shove down your throat at the same time just come across as completely superfluous.  The plot itself, while interesting and entertaining, is so stupid that I have to wonder how they even thought this movie was a good idea in the first place.  This movie also has the worst dialogue I have ever seen in a film, and I have seen MANY bad movies.  A very long time ago, a movie came out that featured a talking space ship, and that movie was the worst.  Now, this movie comes close, but it does not quite make it.  Overall, the movie should not even be considered as a "movie", for all the flaws that are present. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was nothing to see.   It's the worst acting and worst acting of a long time.  This guy plays a character named "Mr. Blunt". It's supposed to be a joke on the name.  The plot is made up of him and "Lottie" and how he finds out that "Lotte" is in love with his best friend.  It all turns out to be an elaborate plan on his part to find a "young lady" for him.  At first, this film is supposed to set up a comedy but after the first five minutes, you're not laughing.  In the beginning, Mr. Blunts character is trying to get "Littie" to tell him her feelings.  As the film goes on, the movie just goes downhill.  I can't see a reason for making this movie.  You don't really have to see this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film begins with a very simple explanation of the nature of the film and a voice over describing it as an examination of how we make and consume movies. Well, this movie is about that very same thing and how movies are manufactured to sell. A movie like this is going to try and sell you something you have never heard of. A strange, old, weird, and weird little movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie really is terrible. It is terrible on many levels. The writing is bad. It's just bad. The acting is bad and the acting is not good in any way shape or form. The special effects are horrible. The sound effects are bad and there's a ton of really bad acting. The plot is stupid and very poorly written. There's absolutely no plot to it. This movie is not worth watching, or watching for that matter.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is bad.   It was horrible.  It has awful acting, bad acting, and terrible acting.  The entire movie was terrible.  They showed the entire movie at the movie theater and it sucked.  This is the first time I ever saw this movie and I'm glad I saw it.  There were too many scenes in this movie to review, but I'm pretty sure if I'm ever in the area and see this movie, I won't be going.  I wish I could give it zero stars, but the whole movie was just terrible. I don't know what happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In retrospect, this movie is the definition of a "bad movie" as a good movie could have easily made this movie great.  The plot of this movie, to be honest, wasn't even bad.  There is a plot to this movie which, again, could have been easily explained.  If you don't want to watch this movie you can also skip all the scenes which show a character going into a cave for some reason.   The reason why this movie didn't work was that the actors never knew what the movie was about and acted like idiots.  It was so bad that the movie never had a single moment of enjoyment in it.  I would definitely not recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this many times over the years, and have loved it every time. I have the box set on VHS. I think it was originally a television movie. This was made in the 60's and it is amazing!  It is a story of love, and betrayal. The love story is interesting, but then it turns into something else. I am glad it has been released on DVD.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While the first half of the movie was good, the second half sucked, with a poor director who made a bad film.   It took me a good 10 minutes to remember that there is another movie on DVD called "The Lost Brother" with an even worse director, and the cast was much better.  The story was the same as the first movie, with the same actors, the same bad actors, a very poor director, bad costumes and a very bad script.  I am so sick of this, the only thing that made it worth watching was the sex scene.  I don't know what the movie is about, I've never seen it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had heard of "Lion King" and was interested in watching it. After seeing it I was disappointed. The animation is horrible.  There was only 1 scene in this movie that was very animated and it looks horrible. It was a long scene about the lion's family.  I'm not sure who would want to watch this film. The story line and characters were not original at all.   "Lions are not a joke" is a lame line. It is made for a movie that is not funny, but this film was really not funny.  The movie was really boring and you just wanted to get out of there.  When you watch it you will see that the movie was written and directed to be as bad as possible. The acting was terrible and the voice acting was so bad. There was a scene where the voice actors couldn't hear one another and were just talking over each other.  After watching this film you will be laughing at the characters and not at the story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is a little convoluted, but that's all it was. This movie was nothing more than a vehicle for some hot actors to get some screen time.  I really wanted to like this movie, but the plot just doesn't make any sense, and even the actor who plays the main character doesn't get much of a character to himself.   I wouldn't recommend this movie to any one, and if you like big budget Hollywood movies, this is not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The characters are all terrible. It was not funny at all, it was a very dull movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad movie is great fun, and the movie is good. The actor doesn't know how to act. He can't sing very well, and he doesn't have a sense of humor, and there are scenes that he's trying to make some point, but it's so bad they don't even make the point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really don't want to be too negative but this movie does not live up to the hype it gets. It is pretty boring and has a poor cast. A lot of good scenes in the movie are cut out, and the movie never really develops characters or shows the stakes at all. It feels like the director was more concerned with getting the movie into production than making a movie worth watching.   It is sad that this was such a huge flop, but I would not waste my time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an awful movie. It's too bad because at first it looked so pretty and I could only imagine what they were going to do with it. It was awful and it's not even in the top 5 worst horror movies ever.    I think they wasted a lot of money and time on this movie. They really should have gone with something else for the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As an adult I feel that I'm now more mature than when I was younger. When I was a kid we had bad movies, then we had good ones, then more good movies, etc. Now I think it's just a matter of age and experience. I was so excited for the movie, especially when I heard it was a remake of a classic, but it was not good at all. The story was all over the place and there was never a plot. It was just a whole bunch of action and no actual story. I don't know what made me go into the theater and watch it. Maybe I had some friends over, or the feeling I had when I saw a good movie. Maybe there was something about the remake that reminded me of a bad one. It's been almost 30 years and I have no idea why I liked this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is very bad, it has everything wrong about it, its not good at all, its very confusing and hard to understand, it takes far too long for most of the movie, and the acting is terrible.   I have seen this movie at least 2 times, and I still get confused about what is going on.  There are no action scenes, or even scenes at all.  I like to watch a good movie, but this is NOT one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is bad.   The acting was bad and the acting was not great, the acting on this movie was like the acting in the film "the last movie" which i believe is a bad film but i watched it before i had a chance to go to see "the baddest bitch in the hood" and i guess i'm just more of a sucker for the acting and it just wasn't that good.  This is another movie that was bad in the 80's, its not the 80' it's not a really good film, it's a poor film.  It was very bad and very unoriginal, i wouldn't go to the movies just because it is a good film but if you want a good bad film this is the one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've never seen this movie, but I am assuming it's an English version. The actors (including a very old Jim Broadbent) are all pretty bad and I would not be surprised to see that this movie was a commercial for the US army.   The plot is that the US go in to the mountains to search for a guy who has vanished in the mountains.  As you might expect, the film does not follow this line, but instead the US soldiers are not in the search for the guy, but searching for his body.  I can't imagine that the story was made by a good movie producer, as the movie looks terrible and all the actors are terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the beginning of the movie, when the kids are doing some crazy stunts, I was laughing so hard I thought my eyes would pop out.  It just keeps getting worse and worse with each new movie.   This movie was crap.  The kid who does the stunt is a little kid who is about 5 years old.  I've seen this movie and it is worse in every way than when it first aired on TV.  And then to top it all off, the actors are really, really, bad.  This one was like watching bad acting and bad acting only with even worse acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a bad idea that I thought up as a joke, but it was too good to pass up on. It's basically a love-hate movie based on a love story that should never have made it to the big screen.   The movie is terrible and the acting is even worse.  The one actress who does some decent work is not good enough to save the movie.  This movie has some nice ideas in it, but I just can't look past its flaws. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I have seen worse movies, and this one is not even in the top 10. You might as well just watch the TV show "Twin Peaks". The actors look like they're in high school, and the dialogue is really bad. The acting is just bad all around. All the actors really have little to no chemistry. The only thing I can even describe is how bad the writing is. The whole movie has nothing to do with the characters.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When i saw this movie i was expecting a thriller but what i got was an adventure movie. The way they made this movie is so wrong. It has a movie that is a thriller on top of a thriller. The story is really bad and you have to watch this movie to see that it is not a thriller movie. And that is the most stupid thing about it. This movie has a bad acting like no other movie in the world, it is really hard to understand what they are saying because the actors are in a bad way. I hate to say this but this movie was so bad i did not want to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very disappointing movie. The acting is very poor and it doesn't matter how hard they try to make this a good movie, the plot is all wrong, the characters are extremely flat and their development is completely ignored. There is no tension, there are no twists, there is no sense of suspense, there's just too much repetition and no real surprises. If you are looking for a thriller or a suspense movie, go get it on cable and forget it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am an avid fan of action movies, i love all the big Hollywood movies and i always wanted to watch the movie where the cop is killed by the terrorists but it never happen, i have seen this movie on TV but i didnt really paid much attention to it, when i saw the DVD with the awesome action it is really awesome and i love the look of this movie, i would love to see more of this great movie.    The Video (7/10):   The movie has great action scenes, but the movie was not really very good in general, there were a few scenes that i saw in the movie i was surprised they dont appear in the TV version of the movie. The movie also has a bad score, but that is no big surprise.  Overall (8.5/10)   This movie is an awesome action movie with a fantastic look and some of the most awesome sequences i have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing that makes the movie worth seeing is that it is fun for the most part.  It just doesn't work.  There is nothing interesting about the story, just a bad cop movie, bad acting, and a great song.    My only other complaint is the use of this great song for the first half of the movie.  My rating: 1/2  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an absolutely awful movie that never should have been made and that we should not have seen. I can't believe the writer of this film ever worked for the studio.     I don't remember seeing a picture with an American president, but he looked like a kid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting in this movie is so laughable, I really don't think that it was meant to be taken seriously.   If you like crappy movies, this is probably for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie itself is not bad, but the acting is poor.  This movie was filmed in an old abandoned factory.  The acting in this movie is awful.  One of the characters (Sandy) has no voice at all.  I guess this was the best they could do for the part of Sandy.  It was also filmed in the wrong room.   These scenes are actually shot at night and have bad lighting.  In the movie there are many scenes where the camera is not looking where the actors are.  Some of the shots are in black and white and some of the scene look like they were taken in a dark room.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this movie was funny but it did not make me laugh. I was just very disappointed with it and thought that I would never see it again because it is just plain boring.   This is one of those movies where you can tell the writer has no idea what he is doing with this movie.  There were a couple of funny lines, and even better was the "I am a human being".   When I watch this I always remember the lines I heard, "The girl that I have a crush on was only in it for the money" "That's how I know what I'm in for" and "I got you, but the girl is off the market"   Why is the girl not in the movie?   A great movie but the plot is stupid, and not funny at all, not worth watching and not worth the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible. This movie was made in 1993 and that's a really long time for a movie to be made. I don't see any reason why this movie even exists. The acting is horrible and none of the actors really make an impression. It's really boring and the plot is really dumb. It has a couple of funny lines but not much. The main problem with this movie is that there are no real characters in it. The movie really only has one or two characters and they are all really stupid. I could care less about any of these characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very bad and no sense at all. The character of the main character is so poorly conceived that it makes you question the director's ability to write the characters and why did the director decided to make a movie where the characters do not have any life. The actor is a real hoser and the movie is made worse by the fact that no one talks to the other characters.   My father and I watched this movie in the early 90's, after my father had suffered a major heart attack. The movie was great at that time, but since then the movie has become really bad and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I enjoyed the first two movies, but in the third, it became like watching the same movie over and over.   The dialogue between the characters were not only stale, but they were also just as cheesy as the actors.  The acting was good, but I thought it was kind of a cheap effort.  I will say the effects were very nice for the time period, but the movie would have been much better if the plot was not so contrived. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is NO suspense in this movie. It all goes according to script and does not have any action to give it more interest.   This is a very boring movie to watch and it does not really deserve to be called a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie i have ever seen. The dialogue is so bad. The acting is awful. The production is bad. They are so lazy to put on a fake "fantasy" movie and they do nothing but throw out clichés like "evil witch". This movie is nothing but a bunch of poorly made, low budget action flicks that all take place at the same time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like I said before, I had no idea what to expect. I'm not one to just watch a crappy movie, especially one that doesn't seem to be trying. However, I was hoping that this movie would have some real substance. There's very little of that in this movie, and for that reason, it is extremely bad. There are definitely some good ideas in this film, but the director does not know how to make them work. There were some great moments in this flick, but they just never were put together well. I have to say that this is the worst film I've ever seen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a terrible movie. The actors who play the "bad guy" were terrible. They had no acting talent. The story line of how the movie was made was bad. The acting was bad, the dialogue was bad and the director was bad as well. I have seen better and it was bad enough to make you hate the film. I would rather just watch something else than watch this. This movie was not even worth watching for the plot.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad flick. It is just not worth watching. I was expecting the film to be as good as the TV show and to be honest I was disappointed.   There are many moments of poor acting, bad jokes and bad pacing but for the most part it was just a cheap cash in to make a quick buck. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was alright, but the first twenty minutes were great...the rest is a train wreck. This movie will be remembered by people that saw it years ago, so its kinda hard to enjoy now.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think i'll be going to this again.   As i said before the actors are great but the story is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at a movie theater on a Saturday evening when I was in a bad mood. I was not excited about watching the movie and was looking for something else. I sat through the whole movie. I knew about this movie a little more than it needed to be told. I saw it once at an AMC theater as part of a double feature. It would have been better if the double feature had been at another theater.  I am not a big fan of the new version of this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I could only give this film a two, it would have been fine.  If only it was only this film; the rest of the film is just not very interesting.  The film opens with a scene of the narrator in the car trying to make it to work with a car full of women, and in a scene after, one of the women is seen screaming at another woman who is trying to hold her down, and she continues to scream for about five minutes or so.  I know, I know; the camera is just panning around, and it is not long enough.  One of the most interesting aspects of the movie is how, even though we see many different parts of the town, the people are still so real.  We get to see that they are very tired of the war, but the more time passes, they start to lose their minds.  It is not until the ending credits, where a small group of people are sitting together, that we finally see the true horror that has been going on behind the scenes.  This film, in my opinion, is a very dark commentary on the war in Vietnam, and the people in it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never heard of the movie, but if there was such a thing as an accurate depiction of life on a prison planet, this movie should have been made years ago. It is filled with such awfulness and the acting is absolutely horrible.    This movie was based off of a book, but I think it was poorly written. It seems to have more in common with a sci-fi novel than a movie. It's an exercise in poor storytelling and terrible acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had this movie when I was a kid. It was one of the first movies I saw that was not in the black and white section on television. I loved it, and have seen it on the big screen many times.   The acting is very good.  The movie was actually a lot of fun.  I liked it when the kids went to the circus.  It was a good movie, but one that I wish had not been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is very bad. I was so disappointed I decided not to go to the cinema, this movie was just plain bad. They showed the first five minutes of the movie and the movie was a total disappointment, the acting was awful, I would not recommend to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has a bad ending, but what a bad and pointless ending to a movie that has such a bad plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found this movie to be very poorly written. The whole movie is in the first person so you feel like you're really there. It's a very slow and boring story. There is very little action in the movie. I understand that this is a sci-fi story but the actors aren't very good and the dialogue is just cheesy. I thought that it was a cheap attempt at trying to make a sci fi movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this for my wife who was sick of her boring friend going to an empty bar to watch movies with them. I had seen the director's film version before but not the one that was in the theater. I was worried that the movie wouldn't be good but I was happy I paid the money. The story is about an older couple who have a new born baby and have a hard time making ends meet. After one too many beers, one of the older man falls asleep and is found by his wife. When he wakes up, he realizes that he's still alive. He's not dead and he's not a vampire either.  The plot is rather silly and the acting is bad. If you go into this movie with the goal of watching it in order to see a great vampire movie, you will be disappointed. I just hope that a sequel or a remake comes out someday so I can watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie that I would like to have seen a few more times.   The only redeeming qualities is that the acting and direction are really good and the movie does go into a little bit of time travel.  The story and characters are a bit bland and not particularly original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had heard a good review about this movie and I knew I had to see it and I have to say that I'm really glad I did. I knew what I was getting into when I watched it. It was something I would watch again and again.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has been described as "dodgy" and "terrible", but the reviews are only half true. The movie is actually pretty funny at times, especially when the cast is having a great time together.   The biggest problem with the movie, is the acting in it. The acting in this movie is absolutely atrocious.  This movie will never be a good movie, but it is at least funny at parts.  Some of the performances were so bad that I am seriously thinking of getting the DVDs just for these performances.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A dull, lifeless movie. A waste of your money.  I never thought I'd see another James Bond movie after Casino Royale.  This movie has no plot, no mystery, no story.  It is just James Bond's life story. He never does anything. He just gets up and talks to girls for the rest of the movie.  A boring film.    If you ever enjoyed a James Bond film, then you will be disappointed.  I gave it 1 star out of 5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would like to thank the author of the story and the film and show that not everything has to be about death and gore. It is interesting, I just think it could have been better. The actors were good, but the scenes were all very similar to each other. If they were a little different they would have been more entertaining.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had been wanting to see this movie since I was a kid, but the fact that it was released at the same time as "Alien" made it seem far more "un-Alien". When it did finally come out in the late 80's, it was so different that most people I knew thought that it must be some kind of rip-off of "Alien", but as I watched it, I thought it was really pretty decent. It had a very unique story, and some pretty original special effects. I was never as crazy about "Alien"(even though I had seen it at a very young age) as I was when I first watched this movie, and I think that "Alien 3" was the better movie overall.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an example of a bad film, not only was the quality a little on the poor side, but the acting was terrible.   You won't be surprised to learn that the actors were hired specifically to play a certain type of roles in films.  The only difference is the ones that were good actually did a better job than the ones who were worse.  And in a film this bad, you have to wonder why this kind of film wasn't made more often. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not bad, but the acting is just not there and it makes it a terrible movie.    The only good thing about this movie is the cinematography, but all the other parts of the movie make it a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a complete train wreck and I was not a fan. It really wasn't a good movie for the first half but then it turned into a disaster. I thought the acting was terrible and I think that the director tried to make a movie that would make him a star but failed because he is a terrible director.   I didn't have any fun with this movie and I didn' t like it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a disgrace of the first rank. This movie, and many others, are a complete waste of time and money. The acting is very poor, and the stories are weak. The plot never gets going, and all the characters are so silly and pointless. When I watched this movie, I found myself wishing that it would continue forever, and I am now so angry at the producers of this "film" that I will never watch it again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story was interesting but very stupid.  The acting was very poor.  This movie had no plot and was just a lot of random events happening one after another, no good plot, not much of a story or anything.   I have seen it many times, it just seems to get funnier the more it repeats itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you like watching old movies in a theater with a big screen with lots of projection, and if you are an old school movie lover, then this is the movie for you. But this movie isn't that great. I guess there are some good scenes that make you feel nostalgic to when you were young, but there is too much crap in this movie for it to be good. The acting is okay, the music is OK and the editing is bad, but most of the time the movie is very silly and stupid.   In a world where old movies are becoming obsolete, how does this movie still be available in theaters?  The movie has some pretty good actors, the editing was good, and the music was good. But I think it was a bad idea to have an old movie out on the big screen.  The best parts of this movie are the scenes in the library, and then the movie has very bad acting.  There are very many movie reviewers who like this movie, but I'm not one of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an average movie. The production is bad. The cast is a bunch of idiots and some of the acting is horrendous. And that is the best part of the movie. It has a nice ending but nothing else. I am sick of the worst movies. There are a bunch that get made and get horrible reviews. It takes years for a movie to get made, and they just don't have the guts to make a decent movie. If there was any talent to be found on this movie it was the acting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most disappointing movie of the summer I was really excited to see but that's where the good part of this movie was ending.   For those who don't know, the director, John Carpenter (who is also the producer) wanted to make a movie about a man who is trapped in a small town, looking for a friend who died. He is given a map of the town and is told to find the other "hero", which he does, but then finds out his friend was a girl, and that he is supposed to kill her before she kills him and then goes into a blackout state.  The plot was pretty good, the story had some twists and turns that were really good and even with the terrible acting in the movie, it was still fun to watch.  Even with the bad acting it was fun to see the town go to war with the townspeople who are all brainwashed, it also was great to see John Travolta with his incredible body.  This movie was supposed to be the most important thing Carpenter has ever done but it didn't live up to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a movie where all the actors give poor performances. I know it's a remake of a horror movie but these actors were terrible. I could tell they didn't care about their characters, I really don't think the original movie would be as scary if they were actually good actors. The original movie had really good actors, the remake only had people you would not want to be in a real scary movie with.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a bunch of people talking about the movie. This movie should have been a documentary. It's just an expensive, pointless waste of time and money.   I was expecting something more than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was expecting a lot more out of this movie. I had a bad feeling when I saw it, and I couldn't stop thinking of how much I wanted to be there. I've seen worse movies, and some of them are even worse. I'm glad that the producers at Fox have finally put out something worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie will leave you with the feeling that there was no point in ever watching it. I really enjoyed watching it though.   No matter what they did with the original film, the way that they did it and the way it was remade are so different that it's ridiculous.  The acting is terrible and most of the characters are made up of either non-actors or actors who can barely say two words. I don't even remember any of them!   There is no plot and you'll be wondering what the point of the movie is.  I'd much rather have seen a completely new remake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would give this movie a 4, but at one point, you hear a shot and the camera pans around to show a shot of the gun at the shooter's feet.   The shooting at the beginning of the movie was very interesting. The actors all looked so good. I was wondering if the actors had taken lessons from the shooters.  One of the characters said the shooter had been shooting for 4 years.  The movie was over after about 5 minutes.  My daughter and I are not gun lovers. We are not the type to go shooting. But this was great to watch. I am giving it 3 stars, because I think it could have been more interesting and a little longer.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am no good at movies but this is bad and the acting is horrible. The only reason i will watch this movie is to laugh at this poor actor. - January 13, 2009The acting is awful  Reviewer: Chris J. Matesch - favorite favorite favorite - November 30, 2008  Subject: Dont pay too much for this "I was shocked when I came to the conclusion that this movie was a knockoff of "Sleeping Beauty" as its only similarities are the names, a princess who sleeps, and some of the songs. I don't understand why this movie isn't more respected. I know it isnt as good as "SLEEPING BEAUTY" but its not bad at all, I mean it's just a cheap knockoff. There is nothing to keep your interest, and nothing special about this movie other than the acting.

Rating: ****  Audience response: ***  Comment from another reviewer:   This was a poor quality film that went against the "Cinderella" formula in being a "disappointing" movie.   of the 12 films in this sub-genre that were released during the 1930s and 1940s, "CINDERELLA" was the only one to be successful. "COD" was a flop, "CLINIC" was an extremely poor parody, and the most "popular" of the "SCHOOL GIRLS" was "LADY BEAR". All these films were cheap imitations that did not make much money, or at least not enough to cover production costs.   This one had a good plot, but the rest of the film is a disaster. The story is the same as "Ladys" except that they were supposed to be young girls instead of young boys. All the girls were too pretty to sleep and their only goal was to steal jewels. Some of the best scenes are the ones with the girls trying to seduce each other in front of the mirror, but in the end there were only about 8 minutes in the film where
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the only movie of the year that really took a real dislike to me. The film was so bad that it wasn't funny at all. The acting and plot were so bad it made me want to give this a 0. The action scenes were all over the place. The only good part of the film is that the ending was not bad at all (although it wasn's nothing special).   The most terrible part about this movie was the whole thing where it was "set up" that the entire town was turned into zombies, and the film was just kind of sitting on top of that and never really said anything about it. I can't imagine that many people would even bother watching this when it came out.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just doesn't deserve any of it's acclaim. Its a very predictable story with the lead character just trying to win back his ex-girlfriend. The movie is boring and just a boring action movie. It's not original and there is just no substance to any of its parts. The action sequences are bland and unimaginative. It just drags on with no real payoff. You could watch this movie over and over again and there would be no real change in the story, but there is a certain "prestige" to watching something with a great director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had been meaning to watch this for awhile but had forgotten about it. I found out this week that it was out of print and found it on a store website for cheap and got it on sale for $3.99 at a big box movie store. I was shocked that they would sell it for that price.  I watched it and I am amazed at how long it takes them to make the film. It took 6 months to make and the actors are all on camera for more than half the film and none of the scenes are actually shot.  The story is pretty good and it's not too bad but it's so long and slow that it's really only good for reruns.  Overall, I don't recommend this movie unless you're willing to sit through an entire movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this film was good but it was just a poor film, It didn't do anything different then other films on the same level.   The movie is just a bunch of different things thrown together like a bad film you might see at the theatre in the 50's.  The acting was average, nothing special at all.  Overall not worth watching but I am sure people who want to watch a movie like this can do so online and get more enjoyment then they will get out of watching the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can not stand how bad this movie is! This is a terrible movie that I hope to die. It has no plot! The bad acting, the terrible writing, and the stupid acting. The only good thing about this movie was the music.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You may have noticed that the film looks nothing like the movie in the picture, and that's exactly the point.   In fact, if it had a bit more blood in it, maybe it'd be a good action movie.  If you've seen it, you know that, although I enjoyed it, the actors are pretty terrible, and they're supposed to be playing a great action scene - but they don't act like they can really pull it off.  The actors act like the stunt guys.  They have no idea how to work together, and when they do, it's ridiculous.  Even when they're on the same page, the direction is so bad that they end up looking ridiculous.     It's not that the actors aren't great, because they are - the problem is that they're really bad actors, and it's embarrassing when they go from one stunt to the other, and you can see that the director doesn't like them.  It makes the scenes that much more funny, and if you watch the movie through the eyes of the characters, it becomes much more entertaining.  I really have no complaints about the film, but it is clearly aimed at older children and adults, and since it's based on a children's book (which many people who don't have kids will enjoy), it might be better for them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I first saw this I thought it was a bad joke, but the more I saw of it the more i got to like it. I was just hoping for something I could enjoy, something different than what I was seeing in the theaters. I thought that maybe the makers of the movie would take some chances on making it worth my time. And boy were they ever successful.   This movie was so funny I kept thinking I would see it again. And I did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has everything going for it. However, the acting was terrible. The two lead actors are good, but they were not believable as any of the characters they were playing. The rest of the cast were a joke. The acting in this movie was awful. I really had to be on my toes during the entire movie. It was really hard to watch the movie without laughing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this remake of the original film, Bill Paxton plays the title role. He was in the original and did fine in it. In this version, he is cast as the father and does not play this role well at all. He just does not come off as very likable.   I would not recommend this film at all, but I guess it was intended for a younger audience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was really looking forward to this movie. I've heard so many good things about it, and they were all true.   My only real complaint about the movie is how the actors didn't give anything in their performances to the scene.  I know the movie was made for a much smaller audience, but they didn't need to over do it like they did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie isn't bad, but its acting and story lines are terrible.  The actor who plays The Green Hornet, Kevin Sorbo, doesn't seem to be able to act well at all. His character is a complete idiot.  He keeps yelling and screaming at people in the back of the room, and the only time he seems to think of a response is when someone makes fun of him.    He was supposed to be in the movie for three days and made just one brief cameo.  He just doesn't look like the way he looked in the TV series.  I could have made the character of the Green Hornets much better.  This movie is just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm surprised that the makers of this film didn't see that this was a bad film. First of all, the script was too bad and as the film went on, the jokes that were thrown at the audience were getting worse and worse. The main problem with this movie is that the director and cast were too far off base with the way the film was made. It was an okay little horror film but didn't have the right touch to it at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A couple people have mentioned this movie being too dark and gritty, I found that it did have a few moments of comedic relief but for the most part it was dark and really had a few scenes that made it seem like a horror movie. Not a fan of this movie and I don't really recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can say that this movie is bad.   It's bad from beginning to end, and for a movie that made around 50 million dollars, this movie has one of the worst soundtracks you will ever hear.  All you hear are some generic music and one of these actors talking in a stupid accent, like it was made for TV.  I thought to myself, "that's pretty bad."   The acting sucks too.  The entire movie is just a joke.  It feels like they filmed this for a cheap laugh.  They don't even bother with the story, and just make it look like a cheesy action movie.  A movie about some bad guys robbing a bank is not interesting.  To top it all off, there is absolutely NO SOUND.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is about a woman who gets shot in the back by an abusive husband. She recovers from this and goes to work and never sees her husband again.   It is a very short movie with no real plot to speak of. It has a very poor acting and writing. The women in the movie look like they could be a lot more interesting than they are.  In the second half of the movie the movie is actually about a guy who is having a nightmare about his wife. He wakes up from the nightmare and finds the wife at the foot of the bed and the man there as well. She is still wearing the same clothes as when she was shot. The guy goes to the police and the detective says that this is all a dream and the wife is not there. The whole movie was just a dream that the guy had. The ending of the film is really awful. I thought the guy would wake up and find the wife and they would go home together.  I can't believe that someone would even think to make a movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was expecting a terrible movie with absolutely no redeeming qualities. It was like watching a film in the 90's or the 70's in the dark in a poorly lit movie theatre. I really expected a bunch of cheap effects and cheap acting to give it a low score. But I was totally wrong.   This was way better than I expected. I will re watch this a few more times to see how the movie ended. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie, I saw last year.    The story was ok.  The acting was good.  But the acting sucked.  I found the way these two actors were acting at times a little off.   The one guy was always acting stupid in a different area of his face or body.  This is the only reason I didn't give it 4 stars.   It was a very long film.  It had a lot of action and blood.  If you want to see a good horror film, watch it.     I really liked this film.   I thought the acting was so bad that it could only be done by very poor actors.  For some reason I kept thinking to myself,  maybe these people couldn't even act well in their own movies?   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just watched this movie and it made me hate the whole world.   This movie makes me want to commit suicide.  This film made me feel sad and disgusting.  I am really disappointed that you guys didn't use a better story then the last movie that you made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought the movie would be a good action-adventure and thriller. The script is good but there is only about 10-12 minutes of action and then it's over with.  The characters aren't fleshed out and don't seem interesting. I think it was written for the movie and not for the book.   This is a very generic movie and doesn't have anything new to offer. It's not a bad film but it's not much to write home about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A really bad movie, all the worst kind.   I can't believe someone is making a movie about a character who says "I'm gonna get back on my feet and I'll be just as rich as those in the big houses"   And I know the movie's about a black man, but still, it's just wrong.  This movie makes you laugh, but if you think about it, the whole movie is like a bad joke, with no funny parts.  I know this movie's supposed to be about a guy who wants to get rich, but in reality, it has very little to do with that.  So, if you want to see a bad film, watch this movie.  If you want something more good, try the new Michael Jackson movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a mess.  The acting is bad.  A lot of the dialogue was lame.  There was not a lot of good comedy.  I found the plot to be pretty confusing.   There are also many scenes and lines in this movie where I think there should have been different voices, like when the doctor explains the drug he gave him, "When I took this drug it gave me the strength to do what I had to do. I just wanted to do it."  I don't understand what was going on.  It was really hard to follow what was happening.  If you have problems watching movies like this, skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very bad movie, I never seen this movie and now i found this website to find out the name of the movie and it is called "Beneath the Clouds" The movie was really not worth my time because it is just not worth the money to watch this movie, the story is not even a good story and the movie was not worth to see at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the beginning of the movie there's a great deal of confusion about the character's identity, as they are called "The Doctor". Then a character walks into the room and says: "There are three of us here - The Doctor, the Doctor, and me." Well, if that's true, then why isn't the Doctor the last name of the man who appeared in the beginning? It just doesn't make sense! The movie's plot consists of three guys who are trying to take a bunch of money out of a bank. In the process they go through a number of twists and turns. They meet the lady who makes a lot of money as a dancer at a nightclub, and she tells them that she has a safe-house they can use to hide their cash. So they go to the safe- house where they see some dead bodies. The woman tells them there's money in there and the money is real! They take the money, leave the safe house and go back to the bank to get some more money to bring to the lady. The lady tells them she can make the safe at home, but they want some cash for the taxi and for the woman who works for the lady - and to get the money they have to get past a group of armed robbers. So it seems like the whole movie is about the four of them trying to get to the woman, who is being guarded by these armed robbers, trying to make it to her, and out of the bank. The way the movie goes, you start thinking that if you're going to have these guys walk through a bank and have to face these guys with guns, you can't make it too hard on the audience. It's a real thrill ride to watch these guys in disguise - but in the process you feel like they are on a dangerous mission to get money. And the ending of the film is just bizarre. The guy in the film takes his life in his hands, and the police say the man committed suicide, but it turns out that the man was a bank robber who committed suicide because he was trapped. This movie is a good time, but when the plot twists and the characters start getting into it, the movie gets confusing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie and was amazed at how bad it was. I never knew anything about the world of film when I was a kid, but the director took so much of the action from the movies I watched growing up (Borat, etc.) and just slathered it in cheap makeup, horrible voice acting, bad acting (one of the best parts was when the guy was holding his gun to his head and pretending to be a hostage in a restaurant while his girlfriend was getting raped - it was ridiculous and made my stomach hurt!), and terrible acting (this was a low budget movie so none of the actors were great... except for the guy in the bathtub). This movie just made me sick and disgusted with what was going on. The ending with the guy's face was hilarious, but really made me feel bad. The movie took way too long to get to the good parts and the whole thing was just a bunch of bad action. I don't want to watch another action movie about some guy with a gun, that would just be lame.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "A lot of time has passed. The world has changed so much. People, animals, landscapes are all different now. In the first movie, humans have spread everywhere, they can't go back to what they once knew. But we're still here. We're still human. No matter how much time has gone by, we are still the same. We still have a good life." "An old world with a bad taste." "I don't think it's that good. You have to watch it to see it. It's a sad movie."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very excited about this movie and was very happy when it ended up being the only part I watched on my big screen television.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoyed this movie. It was a movie I wanted to see before I saw the series.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I saw this film at the Cinerama Dome last week, I just couldn't get into it. There were parts of the film that I didn't care for, but for the most part the acting and the plot were great. This film could have been so much better.   A sequel to a great movie, so that's always good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie like this can't help but ruin the quality of a good story. This movie had a story I found incredibly dull and uninteresting, I can't remember the name of it, but it was about a woman who, after she got her baby out of her womb, decided that it was a little girl and decided to raise her. But what she didn't know, was that her husband, after having sex with her, decided he'd rather have another child than be a father. I found it very disconcerting that I couldn't remember anything about it and how did the main character know there was a baby in there? This movie made me feel so much hatred towards this man and his family.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this movie three times, three times through and not once has I enjoyed it! The acting is terrible, the special effects are lousy, and the plot seems to be just another movie from the "bad old days" of the 60's. And I mean that in a very bad way.   The acting in the movie is so bad. The director should have used some better actors. The acting consists of a bunch of characters talking in circles, all speaking as if they are in a mental hospital. If you watch it a third time, you'll see that they look as if someone made up these characters and they just think they are talking to themselves.    The special effects, in particular the flying car scene, are all faked. If they were good enough to make a movie with, they should have been good enough for this. And they definitely were not good enough. They were only okay, not great.   This movie is a disaster.  There is no good reason to watch it, other than to see old movies, and be reminded of the good old days. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best part of this movie is the "holographic" sequences, but the whole thing is a rip off of the old '80s horror movies, which have been done before. It's boring.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot of this movie is pretty poor. It doesn't really explain why they're in the same place, nor do they know each other, and they never even meet. The only thing they do know is that they're both vampires.   It's supposed to be a vampire love story. The love interest is a vampire named Nessa, and she falls in love with the lead vampire, who was not really into her. They meet a few times and fall in love, but don't know what the heck is going on. The movie ends with a bunch of scenes that are supposed to help tell the story, but just make it all feel like some sort of joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was pretty terrible.   I really didn't enjoy it at all.  The story and acting was bad.  There was too many characters and they did not give them enough time to really do anything.  And no actors were in this movie.  You just never feel like they are really in the movie because there are always so many others around them.  Also the acting wasn't very good either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A waste of time. No one in that cast could do their own voices. It's just terrible. The acting was bad too.   I think the whole film is based on something. The actors just acted and talked like they were in a stage play. It was horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love this movie. However, one thing I didn't like was how in this movie, we never got to hear the actors voices! I love those actors and I love seeing them in movies, but when we never get to hear them speak, it really irritates me.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm surprised that there were a lot of negative reviews for this movie. I did watch this movie on a couple of occasions and thought it was interesting, though, I don't really understand what it's about. I mean, it is a horror movie, but it doesn't have anything that jumps out at me as a horror film, I guess that is part of the reason. It is not a bad horror movie and I guess it's not a very good one either. I just didn't get anything out of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this for the first time, and was a bit dissappointed that it wasn't any better than the first one. It was bad, it's not good, it was not bad at all, but it's definitely not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this movie, it was the very first time I saw it. I thought it was very good, but I didn't feel that it made a lot of sense.   The plot is very hard to follow, and there's a lot that didn't make sense. The acting is very poor, but it's not because it's bad acting, it's because it was too hard to understand the characters.  In a good way, the movie is funny and you have to watch it just to understand why it's funny.  The worst thing is that the movie wasn't the most entertaining movie I've ever seen.  A little too much talking and it became too confusing.  I'm going to give it a 4 stars, but not a great one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A "good" film by a mediocre director. I'll be honest and say that I didn't really like this film, it was more of a "fun" film that I saw while sitting in a movie theater. The whole film is made up of just one set piece. I understand that it's supposed to be a romantic comedy but it's just a boring set piece that doesn't really move the story forward and that's it. It's an old film that's "just a laugh".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best part is the fact that this is a "serious" movie, it seems like an original film with some great actors but the ending left a bad taste.   Overall, an entertaining movie with some interesting parts, especially the one with Jodie Foster and Richard Attenborough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping to see this film after seeing it on an airline DVD for free.    A good movie that was overhyped.  A great film that has too many bad ideas to make it good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad movies. The whole movie is terrible. The movie is full of stupid and pointless things. The way they shot it is wrong. The acting is all bad. And they made this movie for $20 and spent a lot of time and money on that. But then the actors did not have any personality and did not really do anything. The story about a guy who wants to meet a lady who he thinks is his real love is really weird. It is really silly. This movie is not worth the money and will give you a bad time. It will make you feel bad for the guys and will not make you laugh. There are no jokes in this movie. I would not watch it even if it was just a comedy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was a big disappointment. The acting was weak and the plot was pointless. I found myself wanting to watch the film but it was just too boring and predictable. The story was a bunch of poorly filmed scenes that just didn't fit together, so the entire movie was boring and meaningless. The editing was also very bad, it makes the film very hard to watch. I also hate that they made the characters in the movie so small, it was really hard to see them.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found this movie to be a total disappointment. It was supposed to be funny, but the jokes were not very funny. The acting was terrible. There was no chemistry between the actors and the film just was not funny at all. I guess the director thought that this movie would appeal to teenage boys and that it would be a lot of fun, but I found it to be very immature and childish.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you have no time for this film, you should just take a look at the trailer for a quick laugh at the expense of actors, actresses, writers, and directors. I watched this film during the long line at the theatre. I was a bit of a coward at the time and didn't have much time to look at this movie but after going to the theater again recently and seeing it on the big screen (over 30 feet from me!), this film just goes to show how bad this film is. I think the directors made this film to get some quick laughs.   All in all, it is just a bad film with no meaning to the story. It is only for the people who like cheesy bad movies and bad actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am glad that this movie got enough money to make more sequels.   The acting was so bad and the acting was done by so many people.  It was really sad to watch people who didn't know the difference.    The only reason this movie will ever be remembered is because of the music.  The music and editing is so good.  A lot of great songs were used in this movie.  So sad that this film has gone on to ruin people's lives and it won't have the chance to live on in any other movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is boring and the ending sucks. They took the best parts of the first movie and ruined it, there is a lot of scenes that didn't make sense, and I don't know why they kept making these parts. There is a part where the police tell him to "get lost", then at the end he's in a van with 2 other men and the van is at a gas station where it is about to go back to the police station, but when he pulls out of the station he's running from the cops again, he doesn't say a word the whole time and he's almost hit by the cops, then they drive off.    There's no suspense, there's no violence, and the story is lame, and just like the first one it ends like a cliffhanger.   You could see it coming though, it was obvious that it was going to be a total disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am in the mood for a good movie so I decided to pick this up, however I should have listened to the reviews because this film is garbage. The actors are terrible and the acting is terrible. The story is so bad it was laughable and I could not believe they made it. The plot doesn't make sense, no characters have a clear motivation, and the story is not very good. It's also very uninteresting. If you were to watch this with no expectations you might laugh at it for some reason. If they are serious about making a movie about a guy with a disability and make it a comedy that will make you laugh it's a horrible idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was so bad that it's not even worth a 5 star rating.   My wife and I enjoyed it, but if you don't like funny movies, I wouldn't suggest watching it.  This was one of those comedies where the jokes were lame and the characters were pathetic.  The bad acting is terrible and the actors were very bad.  There is no real story and the movie is a big bore.  It was all just too cheap and had no meaning.  If you liked the bad comedies, you will love this.  So it's a complete waste of your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was a big fan of the movie when it first came out. I think that it was great fun to have a female in a "bad guy" role. It was funny, witty, and acted by all. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the ending. I had hoped for more and a much more satisfying ending.   My feelings about the movie: While it is a pretty good movie, the final part did drag it down. I can't remember why I had enjoyed the movie so much when it started, but after about an hour or so it just lost its steam. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very disappointing. I thought the movie would be different, but it is really not. It has a very generic feeling. There are no characters in the movie and that is why I don't really enjoy it. The characters are very shallow and have no feelings for each other. The ending is really cheap and not well written. This is not a good movie to see when you're bored.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is all over the place, and the plot doesn't get much better. It's very confusing to watch. I couldn't follow what was going on.   The actors just played all the parts, and they had to do it for 2 hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting some good stuff when I bought this movie.  Instead I got the worst movie I have ever seen.  The movie starts with this really cool, and suspenseful scene.  Then the movie takes a very abrupt left turn.  I am not even sure if it was the director who changed the direction of the movie.    The plot was bad.  All the characters were uninteresting.  There was nothing really to do except talk about the movie that you just saw.   This movie was over the top and made me want to throw the movie away.  It had an interesting idea but the execution was so bad it just made me feel bad about having seen this movie in the first place.  Overall, I will never see this movie again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie of all time. My mom and I watched this movie on Halloween and it scared the **** out of us. The girl who played the girl in the movie was so scary and it looked like she was going to kill someone. I know it was just a movie but it was too scary for me and my mom to watch on Halloween. The guy who played 'The Stranger' looked like he was wearing a mask and it was creepy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is so...so... bad. There is no tension whatsoever. They just have a bunch of random people that are trying to get from place to place. The actors act like they are waiting for the bus to show up, which is very funny. The only actor who is good is the one who plays the guy who runs the diner and the guy that is in the back room with the guy in the red shirt. He actually has some good lines but he is forced to act in a very bad way. The rest of the people who are going in and out are kind of annoying. The movie starts out with the girl in the diner saying "what's up" and then the waitress comes in and she goes "well what's up?" then she goes back to the table and says "what do you want?" then they go back to where they were and the waitress says, "what did you want,?" and they go to the front of the store and then they see that it's the same guy and it's like, "oh I guess he wanted a cup of coffee."   This movie made me want to eat something other than a burger. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst part of this film is the editing. The story starts out great and goes downhill from there.  This film is nothing more than a cheap, made for TV movie.  I am not even going to try to explain the story, as it is terrible and poorly edited.  The characters are too wooden and don't have any personality.  There is a scene at the end of the movie where one of the characters is sitting on the back of his horse and looks so scared it makes your stomach turn.  Why would they use that shot? It looks like a dog shot by a sniper.   It's a shame that this movie was made in 1984. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was so bad i ended up getting scared for the 2hrs i spent in the theatre while i waited to go to the bathroom. The film was a "must see" to make up for all the crap that came out after the first, but i was so disappointed in the movie, its so poor that it makes me not want to see another one from this director. The cinematography was horrible and the lighting was poor, but it didn't stop the movie from being extremely uninteresting. The special effects were all done with cheap makeup that looked like it was made from plaster or plaster of paris and even the actors acting like they were from a different film. The acting was laughable and they had no idea what they were doing. All of this happened so fast and then some strange things started to happen which were very unrealistic. The actors were being chased by the army which made it seem like the whole film was fake. The scenes were all so poorly made. There were a lot of errors that you just wouldn't see in a good film. It was so sad because the acting was very good and the movie was very interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you like slasher films, you will probably like this. There is no "original" slasher movie, and there never will be.   I think this movie tries to copy the slasher movies from the 80's and 90's. Unfortunately, the result is just as horrible as those "original films."   It is not so much a movie as a "slasher flick," so it really does not deserve its name.  The special effects look pretty bad, especially the first one when the killer is on top of the woman who is in a kitchen. I know that it was filmed in the late 70's, but it just looks like it was made in the early 80's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film has a great story to tell, but it is so poorly written. The plot is convoluted and the characters are stereotypical, and the film seems to have lost all interest in the film's subject matter.   The film is so contrived and uninspired, and it lacks any real interest. It is boring and slow, and in no way worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only movie  I will watch again  I got this movie from  my brother in law for Christmas, he loved it, he never let me see it again because it was too dark, I wanted  to see  a more happy ending. it was dark and I had to keep my eyes open in the theater because  my vision was getting blurry. I would not recommend this movie to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie.   But i really didnt enjoy it all that much.  It was pretty much just a "solo-action" movie. It had it's share of action scenes and stunts, but the rest of the movie was kind of slow and kinda dull. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just saw this and thought it was a good film. There were not many bad actors in it, but I didn't like anything about it.  The plot was pretty much a mess, and they only had enough time to develop some of the characters and get an excuse to kill off the others.   And there is one scene in the movie where the guys are walking in the woods and are attacked by a man in a black mask.  I have heard that the movie is made better by the original director, but that really doesn't make the movie any better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie at the theatre and thought it was a poor adaptation of a good book. The movie itself was ok, but the whole thing was a terrible idea and poorly done. I think the director wanted to make a movie that was fun to watch, but never saw it through to the end.   This movie really shows how poor a director can be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first half of the movie is quite good, but the ending was poorly done and a bit corny. I thought it would have been better to end the movie on a better note.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a good movie in this, there is a bad, and then there is this.   This is not to be taken seriously, this movie is a joke, it has zero plot, no emotion, and no charm.  The cast is made up of people you wouldn't want to be in a movie with.  I had to watch the last 30 seconds twice.  There are too many times I wanted to stop the movie and laugh at the characters.  This movie makes me wish for a day when there was no violence on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this movie for the first time, I was immediately taken in. My only problem with the movie was that it started out too fast and then kind of went slow. I really liked the plot, and the plot has the right amount of twists and turns to make it worth watching.  I'm surprised this didn't make more money than it made at the box office, considering it is made in Canada, where they are cheap and there aren't many big studios making movies.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "It was very strange that the people involved in this production decided to make this a comedy instead of a melodrama. This movie was not at all funny.    It was the typical American romance.  The movie was supposed to make the audience believe that we were in a real place (even though it was actually filmed in Germany)."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been a big fan of Paul Verhoeven and the Dutch movies of this year or two. However I just cant buy into this one.  A real wasted opportunity.  "A woman goes on vacation and is shocked to learn she has been kidnapped by the evil villain, the Master." "The first person to see the ransom note and the kidnapper's body is the girl's father." This is the film that should have been directed by Verhoeve, who was one of the few filmmakers in the 80's to truly make me think. I have had several other Verhoeves films that were enjoyable but nothing like this.  He takes some great concepts that I liked and throws them out the window.  I will never buy into the concept of a "lonely woman" on a trip.  There is too much in the plot that could have been accomplished better in a different film.  The kidnapping is the icing on the cake, but the story is a mess. This film would have been great as a low budget horror film. I think they should have shot the actual kidnapping in the woods instead of somewhere fancy.  Verhoeven tries to create suspense by doing a bunch of fake-out shots of the girl with the ransom demand.  They are used as set dressing, but there really wasnt any point to them.    The script was filled with terrible characters, and the main character is a terrible actor.  It really feels like he was in the movie to get attention. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are looking for a cheap thrill ride or to just see something to laugh at, then you can't go wrong with the movie: but at no point in this movie do I think it succeeds.  There are no real laughs in the movie and most of the time the acting is so bad it's laughable.  The movie also doesn't seem to want to show what happens to the characters and what actually goes on.  If it had done a better job at showing how bad things are at the end of the movie, it would have been a good film.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I enjoyed the movie very much, but the cast was very underwhelming and there were some scenes that I just didn't like. It seems like the director just picked the best parts of the script and then did an okay job at filming it. I enjoyed watching the actors interact, but they're pretty generic. The scenes that are better than the others were when the characters were alone in their hotel room. I like a little more character interaction, but this was just boring. If you like a good thriller, I highly recommend this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie over and over and I always hated it.   It was so bad I thought the studio would put a lot of money into it. What a shame.  I have a soft spot for comedy movies and this was the worst.  The plot and characters were stupid.  No one was believable in the story.  This movie was ridiculous and stupid. The acting was horrible.  It should have been called "Funny Movie"   A terrible comedy!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this movie was pretty funny, but the acting was terrible.   If you are into the "dark comedy" then this film will not make your day, but if you are in the mood to laugh at the badness of society then this is a good film to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is nothing special in the sense that it's just another action movie, but it's a better action movie then the first one in a while. In fact, the only thing that changed from the first to this one is that it takes the movie in a new direction (with the death of a young kid who was being held hostage by terrorists). There's lots of gunplay in this one, and there's also a nice cameo from Bruce Willis as an old man who watches the action on TV. Unfortunately, the action scenes just don't stand up to anything that's happened in the last few James Bond movies. The action scenes are pretty cheesy and you get the sense from them that the producers don't give a flying monkey about the film. I won't go into too many of the technical flaws of the movie because I really can't give it a decent score. The actors are pretty bad and the effects aren't too impressive. But it's not like anyone's going to be watching this for good action scenes either.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was just a little girl when I first saw this film. It's a movie I didn't even know existed. I remember seeing it on tv as a child. The only way I can describe it is a horror story. The idea was so scary to me as a kid. I love the "realness" of it. A lot of the actors are in their 40s and I think the makeup used in the movie was pretty good (though I always thought the movie just looked a bit too real. But I guess that's just me. :) )  My favorite part of the movie is in the first scene. The camera is watching the kids playing and I remember the whole house vibrating as the kids were screaming.  The other favorite scene is when the mother's face is shown and she's all alone in a room with no way out. She keeps begging for help and her kids keep begging her to keep them safe. She can't find a way to leave but her kids insist on her leaving with them. This scene was a great movie for me to watch as a baby.   It's definitely a movie for the younger ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoyed this movie and all it's sequels. The acting was good, the story interesting, the action good, and the effects perfect.    One problem, though, is that the bad guy never changes.  He is a good guy, but he has to be in a different outfit for each film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After watching this movie I can only agree with the reviews that say this movie is a total clusterfuck. The story is horrible. It takes place in the future, and there is an AI program called "M.E.A.N." that runs the world. The movie shows that the AI is sentient, but then it decides to kill all the humans. What the heck! That's like sending a bomb into the air and expecting it to go off. What a fucking idiot! The only good thing about this movie was that it was the movie that got Ridley Scott the Oscar he was going for, and it had a great script. The director was Scott, who has made some great movies in the past, but this is the worst thing he has ever done. If you want to see a movie that is filled with stupidity that leaves you asking, "What the hell was that about?," you should try this. I hate to say this, but I really wish he never made another movie. It's a shame that Scott is gone, and the future is filled only with incompetents. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never seen this movie. I saw it on TV when I was little. I've seen it several times since and it still doesn't bother me as much as I did when I saw this on TV. It is a very slow-paced movie with a lot of talking. There is some funny stuff happening throughout the movie, but not a lot. If you're looking for something with some action and a lot to say, you may not find that here. But if you're a fan of The Fugitive and want something that doesn't make the best use of its time, then you'll probably like this.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was soo good at first.   But I started to notice all the problems.  The acting is terrible.  They have no chemistry.  Not to mention some of the bad lines and the acting is so bad it's hard to believe the actors really thought of those lines.  I'm sure they're thinking of the audience not them.    They never even get any laughs.  And what do they do to make it more real?  They give it a fake smile when they're in a serious mood and they look at the camera at the end of the movie.  But the funniest thing was that there's no sound and no music.  That's how you can tell that it's a really bad movie. The acting was so bad that I was ready to drop it and never watch it again.  So I'm glad I didn't.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I've seen in a long time. It was boring and not funny at all.   This is the worst movie i've seen to date, and the worst i'll ever see.  The story is a complete mess and the acting is poor. The movie is only three hours long and the entire plot is a joke.  It would be funny if it was not so stupid, as i could understand it if the actors were the best actors out there but they all look absolutely terrible.  There's nothing good to come of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't even know what to say about this.  I saw this for the first time on the big screen, and I can see why it's a big budget movie.  The plot, setting, and acting are all pretty amazing.  However, I was very disappointed with the acting.   The character is just flat.  It's just not believable that a person can be that stupid.  This movie just made me laugh too much.  A couple of characters are funny in the movie, but the movie is just not funny.  At all.  If they did a remake of this movie, I would be okay with it.  But this movie just seemed like it was made to be an action movie, and that's not what this movie was all about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A film that is made with the intention of making it a horror film and not the other way around.  The movie is good but the movie is a parody of the genre. I do believe that the film is a joke and is very offensive.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am just going to say this movie has all the bad parts of the previous movies i saw. The character development is just so poor, it's like they didn't even try to write the characters in a realistic way. It feels as if they just pulled the character names out of a random dictionary and then made up names for them. You get the same actors in the same roles over and over again. The acting is just awful, but they are just bad actors. It's a shame because they were amazing in the original movie.   The plot is horrible and the movie just never gets going. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't like it, nor did I want to watch it.  I've seen much worse, and much better, but this was a real disappointment.  As I'm typing this review, I'm thinking "what a letdown.  I hope they make another movie of the same title".    It's too bad too, because if it wasn't for the "Hannibal Lecter" movie, I'd have loved to see this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is really bad. The actors all look good, but the script is horrible and they were forced to lip sync. The acting is atrocious and the writing is not funny at all. This movie makes me sick.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it's too long and not good at all. The actors don't have any chemistry with each other and it just goes on and on for ages.   If I don't give a bad review, I might as well write nothing at all, for the story goes on for pages and pages and it gets boring and I don`t like the characters any more.    The plot gets a bit better but you're really just waiting for someone to die in it, and that's not what you want to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was bad. The acting is the worst part. You can only watch this movie if you don't like horrible acting. It was like they just didn't try at all. This movie is just awful and horrible acting really hurt it. It is a shame that the director was such an easy act to fool.   I don't recommend this movie to anyone at all
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was so excited when I first heard about this movie and finally got my chance to watch it. I watched the trailer and watched it all in one sitting. I was disappointed in the movie at the end and I was very disappointed in some of the actors. This is supposed to be a realistic film about real life stories of abuse and murder. It is a terrible movie that tries to make itself seem like a documentary, instead it is a cheap made movie. The actors are so awful that it makes you wonder why they are even in this film and why they thought it would be a good idea to try to make themselves look real.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So bad. I never heard of this director before, but I saw this movie once and I thought it was just lame. When he started talking about how the aliens were going to destroy the planet, I thought: "That's it? He has a plan? That's not good!". I could not believe that he thought of such a lame plan! If he had seen The Martian (I love that movie! I like the story, the acting and the special effects). This movie wouldn't have been this bad. This is so boring! It has so little action. There are no good fights! There are lots of bad fights and bad fights have no consequences. The aliens just walk and keep on walking. It was just annoying. I really have no sympathy for the aliens because they are stupid!   Just like in The Martian!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have been looking to watch this movie for years, I finally found a great streaming site that was free and cheap and was streaming it. I have watched this movie in 4 or 5 different copies, it was always just a terrible copy. It is a remake of a movie called "The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear", I believe the new remake is just a slightly modified version of the original. This movie is so bad. The acting, the plot, the music, the dialogue, the acting, and most importantly, the special effects. I saw this movie a number of times before it was released. It was never worth my time. This is not a great movie to look at or watch, but I still watched it because I thought it would have been fun. I think I wasted a lot of money to sit through this movie. I hope it stays on Netflix forever, I won't be making a trip to see it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a real shame. The acting is just too bad and the writing is terrible. It was the worst movie I have ever seen. The movie looks awful and is extremely dated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been a fan of the series since it first came out, but the movie was an epic disaster. This is the worst film I've seen by the team. Every line is cheesy, every acting is bad, every action is over the top, and the plot is so bad that the entire movie has to be just to get to the end of the plot. A bunch of bad actors do a crappy job at acting. Not even James Gandolfini could save this movie. It's almost like they hired some actor to be Gandolfine and he did it in a bad parody of the Gandolfino. Not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know why this movie was made but I don`t really care. The production values are poor and the acting is horrible and laughable. The film is filled with scenes that you just don`td believe were ever made by a person with the name of "Bruce". I was laughing hysterically through the whole movie. I don\'t even care about the plot, but I do care about how this idiot was able to fool an entire nation, especially after his latest attempt at making a film bombed spectacularly.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is not the best movie in the world, but it's one of the funniest comedies I have seen and the story is brilliant.  The only bad thing is that this is a TV movie, and the sound is not as good as it should be.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is some great acting in this film, but it has no originality, no style. It's a remake of a very popular film, and that doesn't make it a good one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was good at first but the quality of the acting and dialogue fell off.   They all had to re record lines and even then the actors did not seem as natural.  The plot is very weak and makes little sense and does not make a complete story.  It is hard to understand what has to be done in order to save the Earth.  This movie is not as good as the movie Aliens but it is not bad either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My son and I watched this movie about 2-3 years ago and were disappointed. The acting was terrible, there were no good fight scenes and the movie was boring. My son was 6 and thought he was going to have a heart attack from watching it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "In other words, we are all on a collision course with the truth..."   Is this a film about anything? No, the truth is something you will not be interested in. As an interesting film it makes no sense. Is it the truth about the Vietnam War? No! We are not talking about truth in this movie! This film is just a fantasy, as silly and ridiculous as the one in "The Matrix".   I am not a pacifist! I am a pacifists that don't think there are justifiable ways to kill people.   The story is ridiculous. You can find better stories than this, but "The Green Berets" are just "fairy tale about a war" and as I said, it doesn't make any sense at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "Eyes Wide Shut" movie in my opinion is not worth it. I just did not like this movie at all.  I would never have believed a movie based on this book would have any kind of a quality at all, but Hollywood will do anything, no matter how wrong, if it will pay the bills.  This film was terrible, and I thought for sure the director was a complete moron for filming this.  For some reason Kubrick was thinking about using the original movie as a source, but it just made no sense, they could have changed the name of the book and the movie wouldn't have turned out the way it did.  The production company was not worth a dime, the actors were not funny, the scenes with the actors just made you want to throw your copy of this movie in the trash.   I also do not like the fact that this movie has the same cover image of the original.  There were a couple good things in this movie, but there was nothing to make this movie worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I remember when I first heard of this movie, and I loved it. Now, I am very disappointed in this movie. I liked it when I was a kid. However, I have grown up and never really liked it much. I guess, I'm not really a fan of horror films.   The acting is atrocious.  I was expecting to see scary moments, not actors that can not read an audience and act stupid.  The lighting and camerawork look terrible.  This movie is so bad that it is actually kind of funny, and very unrealistic. The camera looks too close, even with a very small camera.  There is no suspense, and we just get jump scares, and nothing exciting.  A movie that was made to shock and scare, it never delivers.  If you like the original horror movies, this is the film for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this film four times and every time the same things happened over and over again. The actors seem to have no talent at all and the script is so bad, you would think they had just filmed this stuff in a garage. All the characters are stupid, but they make up for it with their ridiculous dialogue. I've seen it twice and I have not once laughed.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director of this film was one of the few directors that got me interested in the "classic" Western. I was also a big fan of The Searchers but this was a great way to go back to the classic style. The acting in this movie is very good. We have a group of six actors and four people in the background that seem to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. I love that they don't try to mimic the actor's voice. They use their own voice and just make the people sound like the actors they are portraying. This helps us get the actors more in the right spot at the right time.   If you want to go "classic", go to The Sierras. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went into this with high expectations. It looked amazing. What I got was a complete failure. It just is a completely uninspired film.    The acting, writing, editing, direction are horrible. It all just feels like a bunch of people who have never worked together got together to make a low budget film about some people who work together. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is awful. I think it was a terrible idea for the director to cast two actors in roles that were supposed to be one and the same. If this movie had been made by a different filmmaker, it would have been funny, but sadly, it was not.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would've been much happier with a PG movie, but this was just way too dark and had way too much going on. It just felt like I was watching a really bad episode of Dexter.   No doubt the acting was horrible, but I don't think the bad acting really added anything to the movie.  "Get the hell off my lawn."   A shame I won't be seeing this movie again, but maybe if I were looking for an excuse to go to an old house in the woods...  (Click image for larger view)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie about a man who has his mind taken over and who becomes a cannibal.  The whole movie is about a group of people in an American hospital and the things that they will do to each other. Not for the faint of heart.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is very poorly produced and I have no respect for anyone involved in this film.   My parents took me and my sister to this movie to show us how amazing it is and then we were shown this film...   I wish I had never been exposed to this film and I probably would not have been able to enjoy the wonderful, romantic movie it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is just not good. It just isn't. This film is so poorly shot and edited that it has no style at all. It's a boring, uneventful film with a terrible script that just doesn't make sense at all for anyone who's even half-way through it. This was clearly a low budget film and it was never really any good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of J.J. Abrams but after watching this movie I am not impressed. This movie had no plot, nothing exciting, and there is not one good character. This is the worst J. Abrams movie to date, there is nothing special about it.    A movie that has a plot, and is worth watching but not worth seeing again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very bad. It had so much promise and so much potential. It was supposed to be "A Christmas Story" or "Hook" or something like that. But it was not. It has the worst plotline I have ever seen. The story is all over the place. The dialogue is horrible. You are never sure of what's going on. It doesn't make sense and it's not funny. The actors are awful. They all had such bad teeth or their teeth looked really yellow. They were all wearing bad, fake smiles. The best part of this movie was the Christmas scene. It's so bad. We have so many scenes that didn't make any sense and I thought it was an old, old movie. It just looked bad.   I would never watch this movie again. It took way too much effort to make something this bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Lol" "LOL"   - - - I have always enjoyed seeing this movie at the theaters.  I will never watch the original movie and will always go see it with my brother or friends to see who was the better actor.   This is a movie for those who really like to watch movies that will make them laugh out loud.  This movie has some of the best comedy in all of movie history.  It really gives you the impression that this was a great film with some great actors, directors, and locations.  One thing to note is the fact that all the actors and actresses looked great in this film.  -  -
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was in college when this movie came out, and I thought the movie was absolutely hilarious. When I was finally able to see it in the theater, I thought it was going to be just a great flick to get me into the summer, but it turns out to be an absolute disaster.  It is very, very long, and the characters are really boring.  The acting is very bad, and that is not saying much.  This movie has some nice effects, but the effects don't do anything to enhance the movie.  One person on the internet said that the movie doesn't have a script.   The most annoying thing about this movie is that it isn't funny.  That, and it seems like the director was trying to be a "Hollywood" film.  I recommend this movie to everyone, if it was a good movie, and not a big Hollywood movie, it would have been a good idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best thing about this movie was the "soul" of it. It was a love story between a guy and a lady that had some real emotions attached to it. The ending was really good too. I am sure this movie will be on my top 10 list one day.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was so bad I hated it!    The movie is really really bad and I hate that they have to do this with "The Walking Dead."   If you have watched the series and had no idea how to watch this movie, do not watch it! You will not enjoy this movie.   Very bad acting, especially the lead actors. I cannot believe that they both were supposed to play a zombie in the same movie and they did this very poorly.  They look very bad in this movie and did not seem to care at all about the camera.  I hated the opening scene, with the people walking around with guns on their backs.  It really didn't make sense and I really hated that we were shown the "bad part."  It felt like they were trying to make a joke but it just did not work and they could not pull it off.  There is no reason for anyone to be watching this movie to me at least!  I hope this movie is only going to get worse because it will only have more people watching it!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was not good at all. There are several mistakes in this movie and there is no reason for anyone to watch this movie, unless it is for educational purposes or if you want to be a clown like in the movie. I think that it was a bad idea for an American director to put a clown in such a comedy as this. The acting was not very good and the clown was not funny at all, even the clown did not have a very good accent. The movie was a lot to watch, especially with the slow pacing. Also it has a very boring ending, nothing is even happening after the end.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in the theater, it was a terrible movie, but I got to see it and it scared the crap out of me. It was a long time ago, and I am surprised this movie was made today. I will remember it for a long, long time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not a good movie.   The acting, the camera work and the action scenes are not worth the time it takes to watch it.    The whole movie makes you want to scream, but it is a good way to waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very bad movie that has nothing to do with the tv series. A very silly movie with a bad story line and the actors playing the characters are awful. The plot seems to be nothing more than a set up to the tv show and nothing more. The actors are horrible and I didn't think I would like any of them. The only good thing about the movie is it is fun and entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not worth seeing. Not at all.   For me, this movie was a waste of time, I am sick of this type of movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought it was a very funny movie. The actor played by Michael Caine was very funny as he played a great villain. The rest of the cast was so great. You should watch it!   The movie itself was very good and I was very entertained. I only wish it was longer.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie pretty boring, and I know, because I had nothing to do with it, which is really weird. There were only two actors, and the entire movie was like they were making this up. I'm not sure if the actors were doing their own scenes, or if they were just extras that just happened to be in this movie, but the acting was terrible. They seemed to not even be trying, which was a shame, because the film looked good.   It was pretty easy to get out of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very bad movie. This is the worst film of this type I have ever seen. It is a cheapo horror. There is no acting or story line. Everything is done on camera. The main character is an old man with a horrible stutter that makes it hard for him to even speak and his wife is the main character and her stutter makes it very hard for her to even talk to her husband. They are followed by two children and the children are shown screaming and crying in the background. They also have a dead body in the house. In this movie the family doesn't really care about anyone except the old man. The wife is really a bitch to her children and husband. The poor children get very few lines. The worst thing about this movie is that they use a real old man and real old woman. This isn't just some cheapo movie and they should have used a real person.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You're about to see a movie that will have you begging for more!   This is one of those movies that I'd never seen but I'm sure that I'll see it again, maybe even on the big screen!  The characters are great and are well done, especially the main guy who is so much fun to watch!  I think that most of the people that watch this movie will not understand it at all.   There is nothing in it that you cannot see on the screen.  I would give it 4 stars out of 5 if I could but it's just not worth the time or money.  The acting, the story line, the action and the dialogue are all pretty much the same in this movie so don't waste your time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't think this was a bad film. I really liked the art of it. My wife and I went to the theater with a group and all the actors looked great, especially the main stars. But they should have stayed away from that part, it was really bad, it just wasn't funny at all. I wish they would have had someone else to play the part of the teacher instead of the kids.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "FUCK YOU." The film is so awful I have no idea why they went to the trouble of making this film and not a more obvious copy of the horror film "THE CABIN" with an updated look and a better script. This film, produced by Frank Price, is a rip off of the film "FUTURE SHOOTERS". It starts off well enough with a couple of creepy scenes, some creepy dialogue and a few interesting shots. However, it is quickly forgotten as it devolves into a tedious plot and a terrible acting performance by the lead star, Richard Loo. It is not long before the film ends in a cheap "happy ending" where the villain kills himself and a friend to keep the hero from revealing their plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only redeeming quality of this film is that it has an amusing ending.   A few minutes after the conclusion of this movie I realized that the last scenes had a little too much humor for me.  There was a little bit of bad acting, a bit too much dialogue, and too many actors on stage.  I wish that the movie had ended with a scene where all the actors took turns doing a little dance.    After watching this movie again and noticing all the mistakes made in editing, there is nothing about it that I would call entertaining.  The film was so long that it ended up with a very boring final scene.  This movie was made on a very small budget of only $200,000 and a production number of only two hours.  When this film was first released in 1967, it was a huge hit, and is still considered to be one of the most underrated movies of the 20th century.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A pretty much bad movie and the only thing it has going for it is its cast. A very short, lame, and lame action movie that has no idea what it wants to do.   I am very disappointed, not only that they had to remake this film, but that they wasted money on this. The movie is extremely slow and uninteresting and nothing else. The only reason it gets a 1 is because of the actors.  I gave it a 1 because I was bored of it and this is a perfect example of why action and comedy are not in equal footing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is great, but I would have to say that the production is very poor. The acting is all done by white people. There is no other white person in this movie. It seems that they used this movie to show the "American way" of life.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had no interest in watching this movie because I have seen all the other horrible things they have made. Well, I saw this movie and I'm disappointed.  The actors were bad. It was hard to hear anything they said. The story was awful.   It just wasn't funny or cool.  I felt really bad for the guy who had to shoot a gun to survive the apocalypse. I mean, if you don't have any skill at all then you are doomed to live.  When he went out to the road to get a beer he went up into the bushes and was hit with a bullet. That was the end of him.  This movie was so bad I would rather have watched a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I saw this movie it was really a surprise! After all these years of thinking the scene where the two boys fight on the boat was in it I finally saw it!   The movie is pretty bad!  I remember having fun at the beginning of the movie until the movie went downhill.   A couple of things in the movie are not good: - One of the actors that played the big bad (not the same guy as in the movies that inspired this movie) talks too fast. I thought it was funny at first but it didn't last. - The scene where one of the boys is trying to shoot another on the ship and the other boy pulls out his pistol was just boring!  The only thing that was good about the movie was the characters.  The little boy (I believe he is 5) that played a gangster was a great addition.  What I don't like about this movie was how the movie just ran out of steam. It was very long! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't like the story line at all. The "heroes" are just bad assed characters that never grow and never evolve. This movie is a very boring mess that is so bad, I would only watch it to learn the names of the characters but I would never ever watch it again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was expecting a lot more out of this movie.   For those who aren't familiar with it, it is a horror movie. This is actually more of a horror comedy that takes place in a haunted house.  The premise is that a woman goes to an old abandoned house to find her missing daughter, but the house is haunted by an evil spirit.  In this movie, the director tries to give a sense of the spooky environment by having people wearing masks, but it does not work. It is very disturbing because there is something so horribly wrong going on.  It is an awful movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the most "normal" "normal-looking" horror movie.  If you haven't seen a horror movie with the main characters all dressed up, you're not missing much.   The characters are all pretty much the same and their actions are never a surprise.  There are no new twists on old horror ideas, just a continuation of the usual clichés.  I just didn't like this movie at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's an entertaining and entertaining film. However, this film is just too silly to ever be taken seriously. The acting is terrible, and the movie is filled with obvious plot holes. It is a waste of money.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very bad. A poor copy of a better movie.   The movie is basically the same thing over and over again: bad acting, bad music, bad lighting. I mean, what's the point of this movie? I understand that it's a parody of a lot of things that are out there, and that's a good thing, but I think that this movie could have been so much better if it were just a parody, instead of a remake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember the movie and I remember watching it once as a kid but didn't even remember the name. I don't have a VCR but I remember buying it and watching it on my laptop. This movie is a real rip-off. It is a movie based on the comic book/comic book mini-series called Batman: The Killing Joke which was a popular comic book series when it first came out in the 80s. It was supposed to be a movie that was based on that series. Unfortunately, director Sam Hamm got ahold of the rights to the original series and basically went and made a whole new movie. The story is basically the same as in the comic and basically takes place after the series ended and Bruce Wayne is a young man in Gotham who is being hunted down by a group of sadistic psychopaths called The Joker's army. This new movie takes place in the future, as Batman is now retired and living as a professor. The new Batman's team includes Vicki Vale as Robin, Harvey Bullock as Batman, Hugo Strange as The Joker and Barbara Gordon who played Batgirl in the old series. This team takes on the villains of the old days, including the Joker, but of course, the bad guys are not all the same. The first half of the movie, the Joker has been locked up and his team of maniacs have been destroyed. The second half of this film is basically Batman's old gang trying to get revenge on the Joker for what happened to their team in the first half. This is a terrible movie and there is no reason to even watch it. I remember when this came out and it was the last time I would ever see this movie. It wasn't worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie I've heard from the other side, and I guess I'll have to wait to see it! If you're on a tight budget, and not really looking to go to the trouble of buying a ticket to see a bad action movie, then I guess go for the cheap "Dirty Harry" movies. Not for me.   This was a fairly enjoyable action movie with a great soundtrack and well-made set pieces, but I wouldn't have gone out of my way for this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just plain bad. The entire movie is a complete disaster from beginning to end.   It feels like it was made by a couple of guys who never knew how to make a real movie.  They start off with a good idea but end up throwing together lame, uninteresting shots to make something that feels like a sketch on the set of a bad TV show.  It also suffers from the same problem that happens every time a writer tries to make money off a stupid concept - the idea is dumb enough that it could never get a legitimate story in to it, and the director and writers would have made way more than they made if the film had been shot and edited properly.  The characters are either a joke (the police chief), stupid (the people who are being arrested) or ridiculous (the one guy who tries to save the day).  It's a shame that this film will be remembered as a disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought the movie was awesome. The actors were great. The acting is really funny and all of the little things that go into the making of a movie are great. I saw this on DVD at a store in a mall. I got the DVD on a Sunday. I watched it when I got home. The DVD burned up in a few hours. I was upset because the people in the movie really loved each other. I felt like it didn't really have any great parts. I will watch it again but I just don't think it will be good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen this movie for the first time in my local theater a few years back, and at the time it was a good movie but nothing amazing. Now that I've seen it on television and heard that it was being turned into a "classic" I am a lot more impressed. It was so bad that it made my stomach turn and I really have to be kidding if I thought it was any good. I remember seeing the original movie and it just had a "Dude, This Movie Is Terrible" look to it. But with the recent "classicization" this movie seems like a joke. I mean, the story is about a woman who wants to meet a guy who is supposedly a former Nazi and can prove that he was never in a concentration camp and that all the "gassing" was done by people. All the while we are treated to an extremely bad acting/performanc... more
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would have preferred to see more comedy but this is a disappointment as the comedy is fairly shallow and even the actors don't have much charisma.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a terrible movie. This movie has been out for 3 years now and all they did was add more stupid scenes, actors talking at the same time and other dumb things. I am so disappointed, and it is my fault, because I did not watch the movie till 3 days ago. When I saw it, I was like "why does this happen? This movie is so stupid." It would have been nice if they removed a couple of the scenes with the actress and the director talking at each other, but I am too old and I never go see these movies and it was really embarrassing watching it, because my boyfriend did not understand any of the actors so he went "uhhh" and laughed at all the wrong things, and the other kids in the movie do the same thing. It was really bad. I wish the director would have done something different.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would not recommend this movie at all, it is really bad.   If you want to see a very bad movie, go watch this.  If there was something good about it, it would be some good acting.  The worst part is the bad writing.  I really hate bad acting. I just wish it wasn't bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's like a very strange combination of an old 80s action flick and a horror movie. Not bad, just weird.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was disappointed in this movie, especially in the end where the girls went back to their home town, not to their own place, which made the ending sad. I would have liked to see them take a train to go back and see their family.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting is ok but not up to par. I have heard good things about the movie and was hoping it would be good but it wasn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wish that the film was made in America.   This movie was shot in the early 70's, and the dialogue in the movie was all terrible.  Some of the best actors in the industry never made it to the big screen, and I guess the film makers thought that because they had actors like John Wayne and James Stewart, that they would get some good reviews.  There are a lot of actors that should have been in this movie that didn't make it.  It just looked like a bunch of low-budgeted people were trying to act in a picture.  I hope that this film gets a remake or at least a "remastered" version. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this film very much when it was released back in 1984 and was in it's original version as well. In the film the plot is fairly simple and the film is set in the late sixties, but it has a strange sense of time to it. This film is very good, but is missing something to make it work in its current form.   Overall this film is definitely worth checking out and if you enjoy period films, this one is worth checking as it's a solid film and has some great actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For $1.99 I paid $10 for a terrible movie. Not worth it at all.   This is a remake of "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream". The original was made before "Scream", and the remake is not much better.  The "scream" character and the old woman character are the same, except shes now a woman with two heads, one on each side of her head. This makes it really hard to see the face in the old lady's mouth.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never seen the movie, but had to check it out. I was really surprised at how bad this movie was. The acting was terrible, and the camera work, if it was a real film, would make a bad video. The ending, I really think this movie would have been better as a comedy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While it was funny and the action was good the bad acting was bad. The movie was like you are watching a cheesy 80's movie and this is actually how it was. Some of the scenes were like they were written by the makers of Home Alone and you can tell they didn't even think it was a movie.   I was bored of it after a few minutes so I gave it a pass. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is really interesting. It is a documentary on the life of David Bowie's best friend, Julian Casablancas, who died in a car accident. It shows a lot of the things that went on with Bowie. It does a good job on telling the story of this guy, and the actors work really well.   It is pretty much a documentary, so the sound and images aren't the best. The acting is decent. The only thing that really bugs me about the movie is that he is always showing this movie to the public. They never showed it at the cinema because the director didn't have the money to release it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Fantastic."   I had a long chat with my father about the movies I've seen so far this year, and he mentioned that he liked this one a lot too, and that I should check out the other stuff.   So I bought this one, and for a long time I was tempted to just turn it off and leave it there, but then I went to the movies and I saw this one with my dad, and I had to see it with him too.  As I said, I really enjoy my dad.  It's a fun movie.  I wish there were more people like him in this world.  What a great movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You have to be in the wrong mindset if you are going to be fooled by this crap.   This movie is a waste of time and money.  This is a bad acting movie and has nothing to do with the story of the main character.  If you are looking for a good movie, you have to look somewhere else.  I would never recommend this movie to anyone but to watch it in the dark in a dimly lit theater or with a friend who you will only talk to a few times.  You would probably be better off watching something else.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't even care if I was in the dark or not as I watched the film. I didn`t even realize I was there because I was so engrossed in the story that the whole experience was surreal.   As soon as the first scene was over I felt my heart rate speed up. I mean this wasn`t just a movie but it was an experience that was really cool.  In a way, it is more realistic than a movie like "The Matrix" or "Back to the Future".  This is the film that I have always wanted to see.  I had a real good time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As the title says, this movie is just a piece of shit that goes to waste! I am not a big fan of horror and gore but this movie got a bad rating because it had no sense of tension at all and had a lot of cheesy characters that did nothing but to annoy me! The movie is about a killer who has kidnapped and killed three college students and now his name is still on the body parts that they have found all over the college campus! This is supposed to be a story about the student that came up with the plan to kill the man and he is the one who is going to die! All he needs is for the killer to find out what is on his back... but no, the killer just takes a shit on the student's shoes! The students are very upset about this and eventually they call in the police. After a very long search, they find a body that is still not identified and they make a decision to put the killer on trial for the murders. I guess this movie was supposed to show the effects of drug addiction on people, which is very interesting and I like this sort of movie but the director was so busy putting in scenes of people going into drug withdrawal that he just didn't have time to show what was really going on with the killer and the victims. Overall, this is a very poorly written and acted movie and I don't think it deserves a rating of "bad". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While it's a very funny movie with a good acting cast it's too long. It was way too long and I got to watch a lot of the main actors in the movie. I would have preferred a shorter movie with fewer characters and less dialogue.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie doesn't have any impact or is just some cheapo stunt to get more publicity.  I was not impressed by the film and the director is not very good, he tries to give the "tough guy" a bad name and he doesn't do a very good job.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so poorly made that it is a real pain to watch. The movie features an actor that is not known, and the director was known to make "horrible" movies when he was a director in Italy.  This film is based on a novel and I'm sure the director wasn't aware of this book.   There is no reason to make a movie like this.  I will not be watching this movie ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is soooo bad, soooo hard, sooooooo pointless. I would have never found it funny.   You know what, I am sick of these films. The more I look at them, the less I like them.  So many of them are just so stupid.  It also makes it almost impossible to find anything funny about it.  I hate it, I hate every single one of them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was hoping for a good horror movie. It was a terrible, horrible, terrible movie that made no sense. It starts off with a guy with an iron, a flashlight, and a big stick in his hand. He has been looking for the missing son. He goes around and looks for clues. He finds a room, turns on the light and opens the safe, and there's nothing in the safe. No son, no money, nothing! Then a man comes in with a gun. He kills the man and the man's daughter, and takes the money. And then the man starts shooting at the man with the iron. The flashlight and stick are useless. The girl starts screaming. And the man shoots her in the head. After the man kills the guy, he goes outside, and sees a dead girl, her face is gone, she has been shot. Then there's a loud sound and he goes into the house, but it is empty.   The actors were so bad, and the effects were so unbelievable. I guess it was just for the scares. The only good part was that after it was over, a guy named Joe would show up and show the audience how to make a trap with a ball. I can't believe this crap got made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a bad film and it was really terrible. I had to leave my daughter at home and when I got home, she was asking if I would like a drink. She didn't even notice the bad quality. If they made an unrated version with no cuts and a new ending, I wouldn't have bothered.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love this movie and love the songs.  They are very good and make you want to go to the movies   It has great acting, music and a good story to tell.   But the acting is not what I wanted it to be and the story is a bore and boring.  I have seen the original movie at least 6 times so I know it but I will never go back and I wish they would at least make the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad movie is like that old tv show where there were two people and all of the jokes were bad. They made up for that by having a cast that was pretty good in that the leads were really funny.   There was nothing original in the movie, but it got better as the movie went on and by the end there was nothing to keep you watching for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is extremely obvious and doesn't work.  The character development is completely worthless.   If you ever go to an art gallery or museum, see a Picasso, or anything related to the artist, go with a more interesting person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of those movies that I watched over and over again hoping that it was going to make me hate it, when in fact I enjoyed it. It was a good movie at the beginning. It had a very good cast, but the bad acting got to me, and the plot didn't really make sense. It ended up being one of the few "good" movies that was terrible.   The Good:  As a child, I was obsessed with all the Star Wars movies. I watched them on VHS. I also watched them in the theater. The first one I ever saw was with my father. We were both 11. It didn't make sense to me until I saw the special effects. I never thought I would like science fiction, but this one was good. I remember watching it for the first time in the summer of 1980. It really showed the future and future technology. The characters were interesting. I really enjoyed the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was terrible. I had just moved into a new house and bought a brand new copy of this film to watch in my new home. This film had poor acting, bad story, and awful performances. I mean I know they were in high school, but at least give them a break. It was also kind of funny, but it just didn't fit in well. This movie makes no sense to me, and it wasn't really funny at all. I'm also pretty sure the girl that they have in the middle of the film is in grade 9, I've read her age as 16. The ending was kind of anticlimactic, and I'm sorry for the poor actors but they really did not do anything for this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have only seen this movie once, I'm not much of a horror fan, so I guess it wasn't my favorite. I was disappointed with this film as I would have thought the story of a group of men who discover a man in a cellar would be interesting. But it isn't. It's a very boring film, I got very bored and thought I was watching a documentary for the rest of the film.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was just a terrible movie, the actors did a terrible job and it's just terrible how the film is rushed.   It has a very poor story and characters.  This is just a bad, horrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this movie on the recommendation of a friend because it was the only movie I'd seen that had the word "Sleuth" in it. I'd read about it and seen some reviews on IMDB but had never seen it so decided to give it a shot. I had no idea how much I was in for it.   My main problem with this movie was that I found it very hard to keep myself entertained. The film's plot is convoluted and slow going. The characterizations are not bad but there isn't much going on. I found the story line too unbelievable. Even the most casual viewer would have to suspend disbelief to believe that this movie would be anything more than a ridiculous movie with some very strange characters.  The only time the movie gets even remotely interesting is when we get to see what the mystery man and his girlfriend were up to. This is where the movie really begins to shine. This scene alone made this movie worth seeing. There is something very interesting going on that the audience isn't quite able to put together. The mystery man's girlfriend (Samantha Morton) and the mystery woman (Mary Wollstonecraft) are two very different characters. I'm not sure why but when these two women are paired together, the movie begins to get very, very weird.  I have no idea why these two people are paired up but there it is. This movie has a very strange way of telling the story. One minute you are watching the story of a murder and the next you are supposed to be at a funeral and the plot is all over the place. The final twist that gets us all the way to the end of the movie is just stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was really bad.   The actors didn't know what they were doing and their acting was so bad. It was like someone took the best parts of every bad movie in the 1980's and shoved them all in one film.  I hope that the producers of this film do the work necessary to make a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you watch this movie, you should know that it's about a guy that is in love with his girlfriend and the person that he likes has a very similar personality. Both guys are in love and have a secret. When one guy dies, the other goes through some changes. It's very cheesy and not funny at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really sad that after a few seasons, I'm no longer allowed to watch old horror movies anymore. This movie is a complete rip off of the film Nightmare (the sequel to the same name) with all of the bad special effects, cheesy lines and uninspired acting.    This movie was a big disappointment because the cast was not original at all and had nothing to offer.    The movie was great when it was released, but the sequels didn't live up to the original and this is another example of the same problems. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is very bad and the acting sucks. I was at the theatre, and the director called the audience to "come up and take a picture of their children in the audience." This is what the movie is like: a family is on vacation, and a man who doesn't have any kids goes to a park and sees a baby sitting in a swing. He takes the baby out, and then puts him in a car with a man and woman and takes off, and at some point they are on a golf course, and there is a car chase, and all the scenes are bad.   There are some really bad scenes in the movie, and it's very confusing and disjointed, with some of the scenes cut together and they're just a blur, it takes you out of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director of this movie makes a poor decision and takes the viewer's attention away from the story of the movie.  The story line for the movie was very bad.  I do not know what happened, but I do know the director put a lot of effort into the movie, but this effort should be put into making a good movie. The only person I have seen in a movie who does the character work better than the director is James Bond.   I thought the actors were great, but it is just a shame that the story line was so bad. I would not recommend this movie, because it is poorly made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wanted to like this movie but it was just way too corny. My brother and I loved this movie so much that we made a movie about it. We spent hours talking about what a great movie it was. When we finally watched it we were just disappointed. I have watched every movie from this series (except the pilot). All the other movies were great. We have never watched this movie and still think about it every once in a while. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are a lot of bad horror movies out there. I am not a horror guy. I know I am a horror person. However, when I saw this movie, I thought "I can't believe this is actually a horror movie." It's a real cheap movie. It is just "something" that happened. Nothing special.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie twice so i'm pretty sure i like it or something. It was okay I guess. The first time i watched it i thought it was funny and this movie does have some funny moments but in my opinion it's just not that good. I just hope the writer can come up with another good movie in the near future.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A really bad movie.   The film is full of bad acting and bad dialog.  The movie starts with a scene in which a bunch of black men run out of a house on a hot day in a hot country. They run out into the open, and some guy says, "I just came back from Africa!"  We watch as a black man walks out of the house to meet his wife. She has no idea of what has happened to her husband.  A black man comes into a town (it is late at night, and nobody is home). He sits at the edge of a railroad tracks, and looks over the edge.  This is a very realistic and realistic depiction of the American Civil War.  No one wants to see a film about the Civil War because of the bad history.  They should not make films about bad history, and this is one of the worst.  So why is it bad?  I cannot explain it.  It has a horrible plot, and horrible acting.  Why not make a historical film?  The most offensive thing is how the film tries to get black men to look black.  Most of the people in the movie are white people.  My son was seven when this film was released.  I have seen better black people portrayed in movies.  For those of you who like to watch bad movies, this is a film for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad. Its so cheesy and has to much sex going on and i have seen far better. This movie doesn't really have any story behind it. It's really just about the sex and some of the other characters have to go through some pretty ridiculous situations and some people can't get it up and can't hold their own for long.    The acting in this movie is just so bad it's just awful. There are not even funny lines to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to admit that the movie was fun. The problem is that the whole film is a little over-the-top and the dialogue is pretty bad. It's like they took some of the best parts of a really bad comedy and made it into a movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so bad and boring that I would probably not watch it ever again. I don't understand how this bad movie is being made into a tv show and no one would make anything worse. It should be made into one of those shitty horror movies that are popular in the 80s and 90s but it is not. This movie should have never been made and I would have given a better review. I have seen worse horror movies from the late 70s and early 80s. This film has the worst acting and plot lines of all those movies. The actors are terrible and don't even try to act. I will not watch this movie ever again or ever recommend it to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love the music in this movie and I loved the story but I would love to have seen a lot more of the plot... I mean, a lot of the characters that are there, have no connection to each other, and they all have the exact same dialogue... this movie was really repetitive, and really boring at the same time.   A lot of things were really bad but the ending was so cheesy and it was so much to write about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love this movie but it sucks!  The director of this movie tried to make this movie look like it was made during the 70's but the quality of the movie is just terrible! The actors are very bad and the movie looks like it is supposed to be made in the 40's!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - "The thing I am most interested in talking about is the performance of the young man in the film. He has very fine acting skills, yet I feel he can only do a part which he was forced into playing. His face is very well painted and his whole body is well lit, however he has a very strange way of walking, he is very heavy-set, with a very odd gait which seems out of character and does not seem like an easy, natural way to walk. In fact, I think this is part of the reason why we are only left with a rather dreary and uninteresting performance." - from movie.news.com  -   I really liked this film, but I didn't find it to be as interesting as I expected it to have been. It was somewhat better than the earlier films made by M.J. Godley, but not nearly as interesting. It may not be a classic like the others, but it is definitely worth seeing. - from dvd-reviews.net
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am sorry to say that the movie was not enjoyable at all. The director had the right idea and had some good actors in the film. But it was a failure. It has many good scenes and some not so good scenes but the good scenes were just wasted and left out of the film because they did not fit the idea of the movie. I did not enjoy the movie at all, especially the horrible acting. It was a shame because they were so good that they could have been the real stars. I would never have seen that movie if it had been released without all of the bad parts.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very bad.  This is the worst movie i have seen.   The actors are so bad. Their acting is terrible.  The sound effects is terrible, too.  They try to make it feel like a real movie but the film has no plot.  It's just a reenactment of a movie, and if you dont watch it you will think they did it.  I have never seen such horrible acting from actors.  These actors are terrible. They look like they are on drugs.  There are some really bad scenes.  Please watch this movie when you have time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most awful movie I have ever seen! It is a horrible, boring, mind-numbing, disgusting, terrible movie. I have never been so disgusted in my life, and I saw it only once.   This film is so bad that it is just unbelievable that anybody would even go in there with $7.50 and a camera to try to make a movie out of this.  The worst thing about this film is the music. It is so disgusting and over the top that I could not even watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was really not worth watching, it had no humor, no fun, it was just an abject waste of time and money. It would have been better if it had been made a few years ago and the actors had gone over to the real world and gotten real jobs like doctors and teachers, that way it would have made more sense.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you love action movies then you'll love this one. If you're a fan of old westerns then you should not see this one either. The acting was great but the plot was a mess. The old west is awesome but this one is a disaster. I think it was made to be a western version of the old film The Magnificent Seven.   I was surprised at how good the actors were. The young Clint Eastwood is a great Clint, and I loved how the camera kept following his every move.  They were great in this one and all of the western characters were well done. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking forward to this movie for a while. It was finally released at the Cinema Village in Seattle where the movie was playing at the time. After the screening the theatre manager told me that the movie had been a hit and he had even been selling advance tickets and I had missed out.   The film is a fairly good film. It tells a good story about the battle of Seattle in World War II. There are a few scenes that are cheesy and the acting is good but it all works.  The production is quite good and the film looks great. The performances are great as well. The cast is great and the music is great.  I gave this movie a B+ but the production and acting leave much to be desired. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film isn't even that bad. I didn't think it was bad at first but it was really boring and really slow. The characters are really bland. The movie doesn't even give you any clues as to what's going on. When someone is doing something on the screen, you don't really know who is doing what.  It's a pretty boring movie.   Overall, it's not that bad and not even bad enough to make you wonder what the hell was going on there.  I'd watch something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My friend told me about this movie when she saw it on television. I knew I would like it. I thought the story was interesting. It was not a very good movie. It didn't help that the actress who played the prostitute was not really attractive. It would have been better if the film was made when she was much younger. It really ruined the film for me. The sound was great and I liked the action.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was not expecting this to be as good as it was.  The whole movie was great.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I enjoyed "The Secret of NIMH" a lot and it was an enjoyable movie to watch, but it's really nothing special.  There is a lot of bad writing, some of which was very obvious, that made it a little hard to follow what was happening, but the acting was pretty good.  This movie was just okay, and I have to say that I didn't think it was anything very good, but that's just my personal opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just wanted to thank my friends for getting me to see this movie. I had heard about the movie from a guy who bought it on the DVD. I am glad he gave it a try and made me watch it. It was a lot of fun. If you are a fan of John Carpenter and Stephen King, you will love this movie for its macabre humor, and the fact that it's so dark and creepy!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is pretty good but the performances are all over the place. The best actor is very over the top and the best actress looks like a 12 year old who came up with the idea of getting a job on her father's production.  The cinematography is great and the acting is so awful that the acting really ruins the plot.  This movie should have just been a short film and not have been featured in the horror series.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie really should have been called, "The Worst Movie Ever Made."   From the opening scene, a little girl (Aubrey Plaza) is kidnapped and tortured, while her family's life is turned upside down.   The acting is all over the place.  I was so uncomfortable watching this movie.  The dialog is too forced and off-putting.  There is not even one good moment in this film.  It is a joke.  To get through this movie is almost impossible for me.  When she finally escapes, her face is frozen in terror, and she looks at the camera and cries, "I don't want to go back."  I'm glad it is coming back to DVD, for my daughter and I to watch together.  A lot of people have called this one of the worst horror movies ever made.  That's really a stretch.  One of my favorite actors in that role is Jessica Alba, but she has been mostly relegated to movies like The Breakfast Club.  She does give a great performance in this one, though.  If it is any consolation, it is in the public domain, so there is no copyright claim, at least at this time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would rather not watch this movie again. A great comedy with nothing going for it, it's just a typical "happenings at a place where people can have a good time" movie. If you're interested in seeing a fun time with a girl, don't go for this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got into this movie by accident, I was watching a show on television and the show was in Spanish, and I thought to myself, 'Why not watch this movie on TV? It would be way cooler if I did!' So when I came home to my apartment, I went into my movie collection to watch some movies. My roommate was on a first date, and he ended up watching this movie and said, 'Wait, you have some Spanish on your tv?' I was like, 'What? I don't have any Spanish on my tv.' Then he said, "Well, watch this." I sat there for a little bit and he asked me, "Are you an animal lover?" I said, "'What? No. I don´t do any animal things, because I'm too skinny.' He looked at me, and that was it. He's like, "It's cool. I'm going to go to this movie tonight and see how much I can get into it.'" So my roommate watched this movie with me and he was really fascinated by it. When we watched it again the next day, I couldn't get over the fact that it wasn't in English. We were talking about this and that, and then we went on to another movie, and we were talking more about this movie that we didn't finish, and my roommate was like 'I love this movie!' and he said "The first two times I watched it I didn't want to stop. I just watched it until the movie was over, and this time when I was just watching it I couldn´t get over it. I was so captivated. I can't wait to see it again." I was really impressed. I couldnít understand the movie, but when I watched this again, it was so much better, I didnít realize that it was made in Spanish. If I hadn't seen it, I would have never heard of it, because it was just so amazing. The movie: When you hear the name "Budapest" you think of a lot of bad movies. For example, when we went to Budapest we saw a scene where a man was walking down a street, and a woman walks up behind him, he's trying to put his coat on, and she's just grabbing at his face. We went to a movie theatre and watched "The Last Laugh". I had never seen a film with a title like that, so when I
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is a lot of hype about this movie, but it doesn't live up to it. This is a mediocre action movie, the kind of movie you will see in the 90's but it never had any star power. It is basically a watered down James Bond movie with some martial arts and a lot more explosions. The only thing that I liked about this film is the special effects. The character design is very good, they got the whole look right.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was awful. The acting was pretty bad, but there were some very interesting moments that were not used. The ending was extremely cheesy. The movie should never have been made.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is about as good as you are going to get! There is a guy who is the victim of some horrible thing that happens to him. He finds his sister and his friend dead and the guy has a broken arm that can't be repaired. He gets help and goes to a hospital. When he goes back to work, he is told he can't go. He does go, but a guy named "Dr. John" (Tom Cruise) comes in and shows him something horrible that is going to happen. It's basically a movie of Tom Cruise's being a horrible person. He takes a bunch of people and kills them. They're all horribly injured and they have to work together to stop him. It is the most disgusting movie I've ever seen. It makes you sick to your stomach and makes you cringe everytime you see the guy kill these people. It was made when Tom Cruise was a teen and he was very impressionable and you see this through his eyes. This guy is sick and has a disease. I can't watch it anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember watching this movie in the 90s when it came out and loving the look of this movie. I was never a big action movie fan and I still don't really like it, but I love the look and feel of it and it's a shame that it's just never really gotten better.   There were some good fight scenes, the movie had some cool cars, and a decent amount of cool action.  I really hope they bring this one back some day. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It really has a bad story that is nothing but a waste of time. I'm not saying the actors did not look good. I really enjoyed watching the movie and I enjoyed watching them together. It was a pleasure to watch them. But it was really not worth the time.    The actors really do not have any chemistry together, they're not really like each other and it is not convincing that they are actually getting along. There are so many bad jokes and bad jokes about them getting ready for a movie that are so obvious they make you feel bad about watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie that ruined my life.   I really like this movie but unfortunately, it ruined my love life. I think this movie is awful. The actors are very unprofessional and very unappreciative of what they are getting paid to do. It's one thing to have a bad day at work but this movie was worse than that. The only thing that could possibly make it worse is the ending. I guess they didn't think of that part, lol!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very bad movie. Not worth watching. The acting was all bad. The actors acting was wrong. I felt like they were not even trying.   The bad acting made me think of the bad acting in the movie "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"   This was a bad decision to make. I thought the story was great, but the bad actors and bad script really ruined it for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The script, though not original, was pretty good and this movie wasn't terrible. The actors and actresses do a good job and make it enjoyable.   But, the acting is terrible and not in a good way.  The whole story is lame, especially the ending where the kids get killed. I don't know what's going on there, but it doesn't add any value to the film.  I know this movie has many fans, but I'm not one of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was ok. It seemed to be made by the same guy who made the "The Godfather" and the "Reservoir Dogs."  That said, the music was just not good. It was bad, and I hated the way they used the sound effects. Also the effects did not look good at all, and the actors (I'm not making this up) did not make good use of the "tricks" (see, for example, the henchmen that came in the car). They were all acting weird, not at all believable, and they all had the same facial expressions. I don't think the producers would have paid so much money for such lousy work.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first half of the film was great. In this segment we saw the characters develop, learn lessons and have some fun while they were trying to escape from the bad guy. The second half though was a let down. We were just sitting there doing nothing. All we were doing is talking. Nothing interesting happened during this segment of the movie and by the end it just felt like we were all bored and it seemed like the film just never wanted to end.    Plot Summary:    In the 1950's a group of high school students is sent to a secluded island off the coast of Long Island for a summer camping trip.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just saw this film and had no desire to go to a theater. When it got around to showing on TV I saw it at the local theater. I was so disappointed in this movie. It's almost like a bad Disney movie. This movie has a lot of things going for it but it was really bad. The acting and special effects were OK and they were pretty good. I'd have rather seen the first half of the movie. The other bad thing was that they changed the story halfway through. It was kind of annoying. They didn't even give the characters that good of a name. It should of been something like "The Wreck Of The Old Yeller".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was in school during the late 70s/early 80s and in love with the 80s/90s, but when I saw this movie I found that it sucked all the charm out of it. It was a good story that didn't seem to be written with any originality and the characters just seemed like a set of stereotypes.   The actors did a good job, but the direction was terrible, the sound was terrible (but not horrible, just not the best), and the story was just too lame.  If I remember correctly, the film was actually supposed to be a parody of another horror movie, called "The House of the Devil".   It seems as if the director got a hold of the script and didn't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie sucks. The plot has a poor premise that makes the plot not worth watching. It would be better if it had a better one.   It is all made up.  There is absolutely no plot and characters are totally unreal.  The acting is also terrible. The girls are extremely hot and not very good looking. If I were a teenager at the time I would have laughed my head off.  I felt like I was watching a bad porno. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad film. The acting is awful and the story is so weak. The only thing this film has going for it is the acting and it was never great. The director is really lame as well, as he makes it clear he is a fan of a popular TV series, and the production values are low. I am not sure why he wanted to make this film, as there are better examples out there. It was a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I found out about this film it was supposed to be released, I was excited. The plot was interesting but I was expecting something else. It's a very boring film that I only watched once and now I can't understand what the plot was about. My favorite part of this film is the opening. I have not seen any other movie that had an opening like that.   I have never seen a movie where the main character's father is a rapist. The rapist gets away with this by making a deal with a judge. It was a great story. The only thing that's really bad about this movie is that the soundtrack is so bad and you hear the same song over and over again. If you want a bad film, this is it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly acted badly. There was no plot, no drama, and no characters. The actors all looked like idiots.   It was like watching a group of actors that all had their parts cut together, but all still had a "sketch" of a script.  There was not even one good part in this movie.  This movie should be taken off the screen.  I had to watch it over and over.  There are so many plot holes and ridiculous plot points that it made the film laughable.  These two "characters" were so uninteresting that they were really nothing but stereotypes.  The acting is bad throughout the movie and the actors look horrible.  What more could you ask for.  A movie like this should be avoided at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so excited to see this movie. The poster of the film looked cool.  There was also a very cool poster with a dog that looked like he had been in a terrible car accident. The movie was awesome. The only problem was that it had such a slow start and there was nothing good happening until the end. The ending was horrible. It was just a cheap way to kill time and that's it.    Overall  I really like the movie and hope it gets some kind of DVD release. I have yet to find out if it ever is available. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't like it at all, but it's not bad. It's ok. I don the ending to the movie and thought the movie didn't end well. I think the whole movie was wasted, it had nothing to do with the characters and nothing to add to the plot. The movie should have been the opening act of a different movie.    Liked it? Enjoyed it? Hate it? Read the IMDb page for this movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember when this movie came out and I was so upset that I did not see it. When I found out that the movie was a remake I got pretty upset. I thought the remake was going to be better than the original.   It was so over the top. The plot is ridiculous and the acting was poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I have seen. It is extremely pretentious and tries to be a comedy. It has absolutely no humor and I feel very uncomfortable watching this. The movie tries to hide the poor acting that is present in the movie. It feels like someone took a script from "Ghostbusters" and made it into a crappy movie. The special effects are really bad and do not look very professional. It just goes on and on and has no direction. It seems to want to be an action movie but it never really succeeds in that regard. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not one for gore or anything but this movie was so bad. Even for me it was too much and I couldn't go on. I had to turn off the light and just watch it. I can't recommend it at all. I wish I never saw it. I watched this movie on a dare and I was sick to my stomach and it didn't take me long to pass out. I have never seen something so bad so quickly.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to watch some bad movies in a row. Then this one is the best.  If there were only a little more time, we could go on a little longer.   In the movie there is some violence and blood but nothing is too hard to watch and they did a good job.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't think I'd enjoy a movie this bad.    But I did and I'm glad I did.  The acting is very terrible.  They are very cheap.  You don't feel like your watching a movie.  I thought the plot was a mess.  There's no reason for the movie to be this bad and I doubt any of them would have liked it anyway.  But at least I have something to laugh at.  So, if you find a bad comedy in a bad part of the world, go for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a poorly made movie that's a complete waste of a good director and actors.  The story line is ridiculous.   The movie ends on a lame, "what's the next one?"    A "bad" movie should end on a cliffhanger and that was not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was good at first, but by the time it got good, it got boring.  The story is all over the place, and the characters are all pretty one note.  There is just so much to do and see that you are more likely to watch it once than to rewatch it over and over again.   This is an action movie at its worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is not good. It doesn't have any atmosphere or anything. It has an old lady, a man in a gorilla suit, a woman in a bathtub, and other creepy people. I thought the movie was over when the old lady went down to the bathtub and came out. It is not scary or anything and the gorillas were not scary either. They look stupid in the movie. The woman in the bathtub had a mouth that was all open. The gorilla looked real like he was real, but he had big feet. It was very sad and I could have done without it all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is about a man in the 1930's who has been kidnapped by the Japanese. He is locked in a house by the kidnappers, and when they release the men he finds them and realizes they are after him because of a book. He decides to free them by making them think he's the author of the book and has it on him. The movie was crap. The acting was bad. I would never watch it, and you will probably never see it again. If you really want a Japanese movie, see "Ichi the Killer."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have no idea why people are saying this is bad. It's a movie I watched once as a kid, and I remember feeling it to be really great, so it just doesn't have much to do with me anymore. The art of the scene at the beginning is really nice, but what's so wrong with this movie? A man goes into the future, gets killed by one of his own, goes back to the past, and gets revenge on the guy who killed him. The only problem is, the movie never explains why the man killed himself, which makes it all feel a little random. It also is really funny, which is a plus. There is a great fight between the two main characters, and it's good to see a fight between two humans on screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie about a man who was born a woman, who was raised a man by a father who killed his wife and is now a serial killer who killed a man's girlfriend. All in all, it's not much fun.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So it seems I got a new copy of the movie called "Ride" at the midnight release. I didn't have to wait that long to watch this bad movie because I saw it on TV when it came out on video back in 1983. I don't have any idea why this movie has become a big box office success and has been running continuously in syndicated reruns for years now.   This movie was made by "Scout's Choice" who was a distributor of the original "Spartacus" and "The Golden Boy" and had some more hits like "The Last Time" (the movie I saw on TV in the late 70s/early 80s), "Blackout" (a western in which the director used a fake blackout), "The Rocketeer" and several others.  The film was very cheaply made and I have to say it looked like some low budget exploitation flick.  One thing that made this movie even worse was the way that the main actors looked like they had never really done anything.  I was surprised how good the effects were but they were totally over done with CGI and even the explosions were overdone.  These actors in particular looked as if they had done it all for the role of "The Gladiator".  I never saw any good action sequences.  They always had to put a big explosion, a bunch of bad guys and a helicopter and all sorts of stuff going on, and when the helicopter hits the tank and comes down on the tank it looked very unnatural.  It just looked like somebody had never done any stunts before and then had to make it up with CGI.  A good action movie should have a good script and have a strong story line.  When the "Gladiator" is in prison he has to find out where his wife and child are. So he goes to the most evil and dangerous people he can find.  And when you have a story that is really strong, you should be able to tell a story like this with enough emotion and suspense to keep your interest.  However, the way this movie was done made it completely forgettable.  That's why I was disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I have been together for 15 years and we were really looking forward to this movie. I don't know why everyone was so excited about this movie, but we didn't feel the need to go out to see it. There was just too much crap in this movie for my taste.   A bunch of people were really trying to look cool in these pictures and I thought they looked like they should have been thrown away.  When the film wasn't being completely ridiculous, it was just boring. The acting was laughable.  One of the actors had nothing going on with his character and the other guy just kept repeating the same lines over and over again.  The only reason this movie was even worth seeing is because of the cheesy acting.  I didn't care for the actors and this movie ended up being a waste of my time.  For only $1.5 I was so glad I didn;t buy this movie and I hope that the director makes a sequel to this "joke." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For all the praise this movie gets, the acting is absolutely horrible. It's like they filmed the movie at some place in between the '70s and '90s. This is a very strange film for me. The pacing is terrible. The music is terrible (it sounds like a crappy band from the '60s.) The direction is awful. The acting is horrendous. The cinematography is horrible. The story is horrible, and the dialogue is so terrible it's annoying. I really hate this movie. It was supposed to be some kind of historical film. But the actors are completely awful. I've seen worse. The only redeeming thing in the movie is the music. If it were not for the music, it would be terrible.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I enjoyed this movie when it was in its prime. I was a kid in the 90's and remember seeing this movie at a kid's sleepover party in my neighborhood. The movie had a campy vibe and I really liked the kid-skewing actors like Joe Don Baker and Linda Hamilton.   If this movie was given a PG-13 rating it would have been much more enjoyable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never heard of this film until I found a bootleg on VHS years ago. It had an amazing cast that I hadn't heard of, and the special effects were absolutely wonderful.   This is a movie that should have been made many years ago, and I wish there were more like it out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I went on vacation to Las Vegas and got into an argument about this movie at some point. I was watching this movie on vacation and it completely sucked.   The plot is just awful. What's the point of even doing a movie like this.  I understand that she wanted to have fun but I would have preferred a straight up action movie. The best action movie I have seen in a long time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is an absolute embarrassment of riches.  It has a great cast and great locations.  The acting is great and they should all have been given a chance to do better than this.  This is one of those movies that is full of poor acting, bad dialog and poor filmmaking.  You might as well have called this film the "The Great British Bunkers and Bizarre Boobs."  It features a lot of people who look like they got a bad job and a lot who look fat.  There are so many scenes that are cut together and the editing makes it difficult to understand what is going on.  I'm surprised there is no commentary on the film for this to help the viewer.  If there had been a commentary, it would have been interesting to hear what was going through the minds of the actors during the scenes.  As a movie about the British Army, this is a mess and not worth watching.  They must have been going to all of those locations to get those scenes. What a waste of film and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie so much, but the only downside to it was that it had very little going for it. The acting was poor, but you'd think they were in a musical, and it just didn't work. The plot was boring and not exciting, and the plot holes were glaring.   And the ending, for the first half of it, was completely ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am not a big fan of horror movies, but this movie was pretty good. This was a film based on a true story, so it was all very dark. The director, Chris Lofano, actually had to put up with the local police trying to arrest him for disturbing the peace.   It was pretty slow at the beginning, but it got better the longer it went.  It seems to be a true crime story and it would have been interesting to see if the real story was as horrible as the movie.  There are some really nice special effects in this movie, and the people were really pretty creepy.  However, I did think it was very long at 10 hours, so I do not really recommend this movie to people who like fast paced action films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story line was great, but the acting was awful and the acting crew couldn't have been much better.   I guess the actor's were trying to mimic the actor in the movie, but with bad acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only way to describe this is as "The Princess Bride meets Starship Troopers." The film takes place during a zombie apocalypse, and a group of men are forced to fight for survival in an open field. It's just a poorly written piece of trash and it makes no sense. I could never follow the plot or any of the characters.   It's not a bad film to watch once, but after the first half hour it just gets worse and worse. It is a completely unfulfilling mess of crap that only adds to the already long list of bad movies made by studio execs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This is a complete disaster and it should never be released. I feel so bad for the actors that had such low hopes and such a great opportunity and wasted it all. I would never watch this movie again if I had to be held to account for it. It is a total waste of time, talent and money.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is a remake of the 1960's TV show and is a pretty lame remake. They didn't change the plots of the original show, only the names of the characters, and the plot of the show was never changed. The only thing that was changed was the names. It's pretty much just a rerun of the old show. I think the best thing that could be said for this film is that it's not bad.   A movie that tries too hard to be original and doesn't succeed. The special effects are bad and the story is pretty boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A good movie. I wish they had used a different actor. I liked the director and the actors and their work, but the actress just doesn't look like her real self.   I really liked this movie and I think it is worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was the worst movie i've ever seen.   The movie is full of cheesy lines, and is filled with unnecessary nudity.  The characters are bland and uninteresting.  To top it all off, this is a bad acting film.  This movie is also filled with terrible acting.  As i said in the beginning, this movie doesn't even bother to use its actors properly.  It makes it look as if the actors didn't give a single fuck.  I saw this film over 3 years ago and had no idea of its existence.  What a waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You think you can kill a giant reptile by shooting a gun into it's eye and then running away?   Ohhh... the big bad guy, the biggest reptile in the world, isn't that a little over the top?  This movie was a nightmare to watch, and was a great introduction to the world of monster movies.  The monster, that is a crocodile is pretty much just a glorified CGI monster.  It's so big that you can barely see it, which is one of the most pathetic things you can do.  Also, the soundtrack was terrible, and when there is a good movie, that isn't a movie, and it's a good one, it gets better.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would give this movie 1 star if I could.   The plot is boring.  There is no real story behind the story.  There is nothing that really bothers me.  It is just a typical western that has been done so many times before.  I was hoping that there would be a twist to this movie.  But there was none.  The actors all look the same, and they are all too good looking to be believable.  What I would have liked is that the actors were not played by the same actors every time.  This would make it interesting.  If the acting was different every time I would be more interested.  No story really matters in this movie, but the actors are so good and the music is so great, I was entertained enough to give this a 3-star rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. I loved the movie, and I'm very glad I saw it. The story was pretty good.   But the acting was just awful. They tried to sound like they were in love, but they're actually in love with each other. And they acted like their characters were supposed to be in love. This is my only negative review because this movie was pretty funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had a good time watching this movie but I am disappointed in how poorly the director and his actors portray the Holocaust.   This movie was made by a Jewish director who didn't want the Jews to be portrayed in a bad way.  The movie does show the German's reaction to the Jews but I have to ask why no one was ever killed in this movie.  If you have no stomach for the Holocaust, this movie is not for you.  I am not a Nazi but this movie does make fun of the Nazis.  To me this movie was more of a comedy than a documentary.  Not a good movie and not worth watching at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I haven't seen this film yet but what I've heard about it is so disturbing. I'm sure if you look up "The Children's Crusade" it will give you a pretty good idea of what is going on.   The story goes that a group of people are traveling to Palestine to build a house for the children of the refugees. While there they see a lot of horrible things and encounter some horrible people and I just didn't find this story to be believable.  After all it sounds like a bunch of little children being led to believe they are going to a very nice place. This is not the kind of film that makes me think "oh, that sounds really weird, but I want to see it". It just makes me sad that these children will never experience any kind of peace. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   So when i saw this movie i was so excited. It was a fun and good watch! But i never thought it could be bad. But when i got to the part where the gang was in a hospital i knew it was a bad film. There was way too much gore and stuff. There were a couple of scenes that were in slow motion. I know that i saw it in a theater and i think i may have fallen asleep. But i still had fun and liked it! It had a cool character named Steve who i think was a bit of a goof. It took a while for the guys to find a cure for the infection but it was good for the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an example of poor writing. In addition to having bad acting, the movie suffers from bad writing. The screenplay is weak and only gives two good things to make it an OK movie. There are several scenes in this movie that just don't make any sense and I had to keep re-reading to make sure I wasn't just mis-remembering. The movie has too many things that are supposed to happen in this one scene and not enough time for them to do anything interesting.   The movie is bad and not worth a watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a comedy. This movie, with its ridiculous characters and its silly plot, is a comedy of errors. They should never have made this movie. There are not enough jokes, or enough characters, or anything in this movie is realistic. It's just a joke with one stupid plot and no real characters. - October 27, 2014Laughably bad An odd comedy... - October 24, 2014A stupid movie I really hope this movie gets made. - July 21, 2014Very, very bad I think the film could use some work. Its too long and the acting is terrible. Its almost a slapstick comedy but it really feels like a movie with one joke that has no other jokes in it. - June 10, 2014Not worth the time What is wrong with the film makers? There is no reason why this movie needs to be made. It is stupid and lame and boring. It could be a good little prank to keep people entertained but no, this movie has no point to it. I don't like this movie and I can't get into it and will only watch it once in a blue moon because it is not worth my time. - May 26, 2014Bad I loved the idea behind this. I found it fun, funny and very clever. The acting is so bad, it makes the movie bad. And yet the whole movie is just funny. The jokes are so funny, that I am laughing out loud for a good fifteen minutes. I really would love to see a real film version of this. The only thing that ruins it for me is that the ending is awful. - April 22, 2014Great idea, but awful execution. Good movie for sure. The whole movie has some interesting and unique ideas. I just hope someone will take this movie on and do it justice. The ending is terrible and I do wish the whole thing was done over again. But still, the movie has a lot of good ideas and good direction. - March 26, 2013Not a very good film The ending of this movie was the worst thing about it. They killed off everyone, so the last line we heard was something like "the end" and we never heard from any of the main characters again. The first act of the film was pretty cool, but the movie lost it pretty quickly and just ended on a bad note. It was very sad that they ended it that way, especially in such a sad and dark way. This
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is bad. It was made in 1977, at the time when movies were all about sex and violent crime.  The main character is an ex-nun who moves to a town where she encounters several other prostitutes, including a very attractive girl who is in danger. The main action is in a motel room. The women are really not very pretty and their sex acts are really stupid and uninteresting.  There is no action in this movie and it is just a boring film.   Very depressing and very unoriginal. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A horrid movie. I wish that they would have kept that scene where the woman is eating the baby because it's just so awful.   This was one of the worse movies I have ever seen. It was filled with so much blood and disgusting garbage, even for a horror movie.  I know it's supposed to be gory and gory, but they did not think of any other way of showing blood.  If you want to see blood, watch a movie called 'The Damned'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this on recommendation from a friend, thinking it was going to be a "fun" flick about the early days of the civil rights movement in the sixties.  While it has many good aspects, including the hilarious performances from the cast, it really is more like a "family" movie with black characters.  For the most part the actors and actresses were doing a decent job with their roles and didn't get overly dramatic.  It is a great reminder of why movies are so important in getting information into the public's hands. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was one of the worst movies I ever saw. It was terrible. I loved the first one, but this was just awful. It got boring.   I mean it was ok but it wasn't worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        It had an ok cast, nice effects, and a story. Unfortunately the actors just aren't good enough to do what they were hired to do. The actress playing the girlfriend has no acting talent, the leading man just came off like a drunk uncle, the supporting cast never come off as real, and the acting just doesn't match the dialogue.   The whole movie is kind of a mess. It's got a cool concept, and it was pretty enjoyable, but if there was a better director I think it would have worked. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am the original poster of this film and when it was released in 1999 it had everything in place for an awesome movie. That movie did not live up to the hype. This film is basically a sequel to one of those movies that is very popular in the 80s. The film starts off with the mother and son playing at the beach. She throws her son into the ocean and then goes back in the house. As the mother is cleaning her dead son's body there is a knock at the door. The mother opens the door to find the killer. It is her son's brother who is waiting for her and a friend of his who is a former police officer and he has followed her for some reason. The friend of the father has come by and told the mother that they have caught the murderer and he can take the body to his car. She realizes that the killer is her own son. This movie should have been called "Shallow Grave". It starts out with a good action set up that never gets boring. The bad guys are good and make you feel like they are going to finish the job. It was only when the killer caught up to them in the beach that it really got bad. I never felt like I was in danger of being shot by one of them. The good parts of this movie are the family interaction and the fact that the killers were not just killers. This was the first real "true-crime" movie that took place in Florida. The killer and his brother were not from the South. It gives the movie a real Florida feel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie that is boring, and there is no mystery or suspense. The director did not try to make a good movie, but rather a very dumb movie that does not do anything right. If you want to watch a dumb movie then try the original  The Big Lebowski,  which does better in the plot and suspense, with a better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A little too long for a comedy, but not bad at all. The movie would've been better with a lot less funny dialogs and dialogless scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a disgrace to humanity.  I was hoping to see a good movie with a great director, but this is just trash.  If someone in your family had an alcoholic mother, this is the movie for them.  All of the characters are just out to have fun, drink, smoke, and party all day.  There is a beautiful girl that goes to one of the parties where the kids are hanging out, and she gets caught up in all of the mayhem.  It is very hard to care about anything and everyone in this movie.  They all just make stupid decisions.  Why would anyone want to hang out with people that can't get themselves to do simple things like clean their room and pay attention to their mother's needs?  This is a horrible movie that should not be shown to anyone.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Kasey2 from The worst bad movie! This movie sucks! Everyone who comes in contact with this movie is disgusted by it! If you want a fun film, this will not disappoint. It really is just a bad comedy about a bunch of drunk college students. The acting is awful, but the music was good and it had a lot of heart. There was a very old lady that made some great lines! Everyone should avoid this one!  Rating
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a total piece of crap. The actors and the director did not have a clue what they were doing. I saw this film in a local theater where the lights were dimmed and I felt a bit of a strange vibe. It's kind of a horror film that plays like a bad slasher movie or a bad "mysterious stranger" movie. I really thought it would be great to show in a low budget movie theater. I got a copy of the film at a local video store for $8. It should have cost at least $15 or more. It was a total waste of my time and money. I don't see the point of even making this movie or getting the actors involved.   I think that if you are trying to make a horror movie at that level, you should be using a better director, and not giving it to a guy like Joe Dante who has a very bad track record. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie sucks! I'm sure there are many people that enjoy the concept of this film. But I just found it to be a complete disaster. The acting is very bad, there are terrible dialog, and the writing is horrible. The movie's not very good and has no plot, but you'll probably not see anything good in the film. The music isn't good either.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad, it was bad when it came out, and it still sucks.  The acting is awful, and the only reason they did a sequel is so they could sell more merchandise.   I really hope they make a movie based on the first one in a few years because it really deserves it.  I give this movie a 1 out of 10.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't remember much from this movie.   The movie has been on TV a lot and it doesn't seem so bad now.  The only thing that bothers me is that it was filmed in black and white.  I'm sure the color would have looked much better on film.  One of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you're looking for a bad action movie that won't leave you wanting for more, then look no further.   The story of a group of thieves who try to rob a museum in an underground passageway has a great cast of characters that you will quickly recognize as the ones you see on TV.  The characters are fun to watch and the film is entertaining.  A must see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie isn't bad in its own right.   As for the plot, it's basically a generic action flick with a few jokes sprinkled on top.  The bad acting is so bad, I laughed through the entire film.  Most of the actors have no talent at all and don't have any sort of personality.  My favourite actors are the ones that are funny like the one who plays a kid named Nicky or the one in the car with the girl who talks to the monster.  This movie could have been much funnier if it had some decent actors in it.  I feel that this movie is just a bunch of kids pretending to be good actors.  It takes about 2 and a half hours for these kids to complete their performance.  If you are going to have a kids movie, make it a kid movie and make it more like a Disney movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm giving this movie 4 stars because it's actually entertaining and the story, even though the acting is atrocious, is still entertaining. The plot, while a bit silly, is actually quite intriguing. Also, the music, although bad, is quite cool and enjoyable.     This movie really does have a story, which is kind of interesting. It's not a long story, but it's a good story.  The only thing that really ruined it for me was that there was an annoying character in it (the female assistant) who was always annoying me. That aside, there are plenty of other great stories in this movie, including a scene where two guys have an argument and end up running away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was a disaster. It was awful. And I would say that it is the worst movie I have ever seen. I have seen a lot worse movies and never have seen so much rubbish. I cannot believe this has got a rating of 93%. If it did have a rating, it would be a 5 star. If I ever get a chance to watch a film again, I'm definitely not going to waste the time. I was not a fan. And if someone thinks it is good, I cannot say the same thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's the kind of movie you'll just sit through once you finish the original. It is also a pretty boring movie overall. The only time this movie has any fun is when the action scenes get super intense and some of the characters try to pull off a gun or use the toilet as a weapon.  The only reason the story holds up is because the actors are great. They really put their hearts into this and get along well with the other actors.   The director was good at finding the right time to have the action happen but never really takes off. I mean, he does do the action perfectly so it makes it all the more surprising when he forgets to do it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was so pumped to see this. I went in looking for a dark and creepy film that would make me jump and think. I found nothing. The special effects look ridiculous, I just watched the movie on VHS when I was a kid. It was so out of date and out of focus. There are some cool sequences that were shot in the 80's, but they looked like they were made for the 90's, and the actors were so over the top.   The story, plot, and special effects are not to my taste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not going to pretend this movie didn't suck. It is poorly made. The acting and acting-on-screen are absolutely horrendous. This movie is almost comical in how bad it is. I had seen this movie a few times before, and I would have thought it would be funny, but it's just terrible. The writing is terrible too. The guy doesn't do anything funny, he just gets on camera and speaks. The actors just try to out do each other. I'm sorry to say this but I'm really not a fan of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I was younger, I used to play the Nintendo video games for hours and hours on end. I've seen almost every video game ever made and enjoyed playing all of them and was quite an active gamer.   I recently started watching my favourite shows on TV: The Wire, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, and the X-Files.  I always enjoyed watching these shows and even though I am far from a professional writer, I can always come up with a plot twist or an interesting character in a matter of seconds.  The problem with all of these shows is that they were all made in the 80's and are now being remade in the late 90's. This is the problem with remakes.  When it comes to TV and movies, you only get what you are willing to pay for.  While I do feel that the shows and movies in these remakes can still hold their own, they are not as original as the original shows and were never as well made or entertaining.  It is a shame because it seems that these movies were made to capitalize on the success of the original movies.  They are not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's all over the place, and it's hard to tell where they take place. If you're looking for a good old fashioned sci fi film, this is a really enjoyable little movie.  It doesn't take much to make this a good movie. For a Sci Fi film this is well done, I even like the costumes.   I really liked this film and I enjoyed it a lot.  If you want to see some really good Sci Fi with a good story, look no further than this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had no idea how much of a disappointment I was in to this movie.  It started off with a great idea, a group of girls trying to escape their abusive father, but there was nothing in that movie to pull that off. It just never went anywhere.  The movie starts with the whole group trying to sneak away from their abusive home life and there was a great scene with the girls trying on masks and trying to impersonate the real one in the house and they get caught trying to leave.  They are all arrested and they find out that it is not the real mom and her boyfriend.  Then the actual mom's boyfriend comes to the house looking for the girls and they give him their real names and phone numbers and he goes in and they all pretend to be them.  All the girls got on camera and the guy tried to kiss a girl and he ended up getting arrested for it.  There was a whole bunch of scenes with the real dad and the girls in the real house but this movie never really got going and I felt like I wasn't even in the same room as any of the characters and had no clue what was going on.  What made the movie so bad was that they used the same actors for the three different girls and even had a scene where the real daughter goes in to see her mother in prison and sees her mother getting all hot and bothered.  I just couldn't get into this movie and it took me out of the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You want to watch this movie. This is a bad bad movie. The plot is nothing special. What's worse is the acting. I couldn't stand watching this movie and the actors just did not have a clue in how to act. I don't think they had a chance. My husband and I watched this movie three times and each time it was the same. It was very boring and the acting was bad.   This is not a bad film. It is just an ordinary bad film, nothing special at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I know this movie is a remake of the "The Exorcist" and has to do with a family of kids who went into the woods and the possessed one (the girl) killed her sister. This movie is the "Eve's Bayou" of bad movies. There are a lot of bad actors in this movie, none of whom seem to know how to act. The "Elevator" guy (who plays a different character every time, no surprise) is supposed to be the same actor as the one in "The Conjuring" and when they do a scene together, the director just throws on a different actor's voice. This one is even worse than that one.   In the beginning of the film, the main girl's uncle tries to have her exorcised. This guy is actually quite scary, but he just screams at the wrong time and his screams make it worse.  It's all over the place, and it's a total bummer.  At least "The Devil's Candy" had a nice opening with the kids in the woods, and this movie doesn't.  This movie made me cry (sort of)  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I enjoyed this movie, and loved the acting. But the story was lame and the acting was awful. This movie sucked and never should have been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm a big fan of the old-school movies, the kind that were made for a specific reason. I liked this movie because it wasn't like any of the others. This movie was made for people who hated the old style of movies and just wanted a good time.   It looks like it was made in black and white and it's certainly very hard to watch. But hey, it's a movie that was made to be a special movie.  This movie has some very strange special effects and is really quite fun.  If you enjoy a good old-fashioned movie that looks pretty good, then you will like this movie. And here's the real star of this movie - and I can't believe I never mentioned this before... I have never seen anyone in a movie do a dance quite like this one... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I think the film is terrible, especially the way it was made.  I know that the directors didn't really have a lot of experience.   There were a lot scenes of me being naked in the middle of the desert.  Also, I thought there was a bad story about some kind of gang, and the movie ended up making me hate the director.  The acting was really bad, there was only one actor playing two characters, and he was very good at one, and terrible at the other.  When he first says, "Do I have to kill this guy?" to the gangster, he sounds like a retard.  He should have been speaking perfect English, because he knows what the word means, but he doesn't have a proper accent to get it.  All of his dialogue was bad.  If you've ever seen a "mockumentary", it's very similar to this movie.  A lot of times I didn't even remember the names of the characters.  So when the actors didn't show up for filming, the director was out of money, and when the money ran out, he had to re-shoot the entire film, which didn't work at all.  This movie is like a "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" for grownups.  Now that it's over, I wish I hadn't seen it, because I would have been really disappointed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is not only poorly shot, it's not even good enough to look good on film. The cinematography is poor, the lighting is poor and the actors are either wearing the wrong costumes or they are wearing clothes that they don't even look like. There are no real actors in this movie.   I've seen better films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was okay. It had a few nice scenes, but I could've done with more. Not much character development. The acting was okay, but nothing great.   I don't understand why they gave this one a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would give the film a C+ rating. There is nothing here that is worthwhile and the actors all seem to have been cast because they looked like they could play the part. I do not understand why one would watch this movie and then turn the television off in disgust when the credits come up. It would have been much more interesting to watch this film and then decide if you want to watch the film the next day or later. There was one scene when a man is standing in a doorway and watching a woman with a baby walk past him. The man watches until she walks past him and then he closes his eyes and sits back and waits. A few seconds later there is a bang and the man starts to turn around but he can not remember the woman's name.   It is hard for me to get angry at someone for watching this film. There are so many great films out there, I would like to see this one. If you have not seen it then I would suggest you watch it before you get frustrated that you were wasting your time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I have ever seen.  The director made a movie to have a few laughs.  He didn't have a story to tell and his actors sucked!  I saw it the same day it came out and I felt sorry for it the whole time I was watching it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only good thing about this movie is the lead actor, and that's really all that matters to me.  He has this way of being kind and sincere, but you can tell his character is a total mess in his mind.   For me, the sex scenes in the film are some of the worst in my entire life.  I love watching women with full asses and perky tits, but this one was beyond awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a joke. All the characters are so stupid.   I hate all the actors in this movie, especially Gary Busey.  What does he do in the movie? Get drunk with a prostitute! He is just there to say he had sex with her! And then he gets killed by the cops!    No wonder all his buddies and people he works with are so dumb and pathetic.  "You gonna get it, bitch, you gonna get what you deserve! You'll get it! You're gonna get yours! You and me, man, we gonna fuck!"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    * * *   I had really high hopes for this movie after seeing the trailer and hearing a few reviewers praise it. In my opinion, it's a mediocre comedy with bad acting and acting that really didn't fit with the situation and plot line. It's definitely an interesting idea that doesn't really come off that well. The acting in it all looks very generic and the story does feel rather generic and weak. This movie is more for the fans of Will Ferrell's film "Anchorman" who can appreciate what he brings to it. This film will most likely never be a hit in the movie theater, but it will surely be remembered for being one of the funniest films of the decade. * * * * *
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know what movie this is based on, and it feels as if it's not supposed to be. The plot just feels too contrived, and the whole thing feels more like a setup for a later film to come out about the same person.   The acting is terrible and some of the actors are just bad.  I'll try to make my review brief, as most of the time when I've seen this film, I didn't even notice any of the poor acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If the first half is not enough for you, I do recommend that you go see this in 3D or 2D. The 2D is a little flat and unrealistic. I understand why they did it because they didn't have the money for a special 3D set, but it was a waste of a great movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first 10 minutes of this movie are great and the first half of the movie is good. The second half of this bad movie makes this movie a complete waste of time. It is the same actors who did the best scenes in the movie in the first part of the film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I like this movie. The director had a good grasp of what he wanted to do and he managed to pull off a fun and entertaining movie.   However, it is the actors that made the movie fun. I found it to be one of the funniest movies ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not a big fan of Michael Bay movies, but i did love this film. i thought it was very bad, very cheap and even the acting in the movie was really bad, i'm not going to recommend this film but if you are a fan of the Michael Bay films, this movie might be worth a watch, if you have the chance, try to get it on DVD, it's worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad movie and bad actor are not the same, I think the actor is not good, and there is no reason why this film should be taken as a good one.   This movie is about a man who is a big fan of a famous rock band, and he is sent to make their recording of "The Boys of Summer". When the album is finished, and it is time to go out to the club, the guy from the band sees that he is a fan of the band and is sure they would like to have dinner and dance together. The guy asks the bandleader about this and the band leader thinks that this is a great idea, so he takes the band to dinner and makes the guy a good time. At the end of dinner, the two get into a car and they go to the hotel to have a great time. As the guy is driving away, the car crashes, the driver is killed and a rock star, who was in the car is taken away. The other guy in the band gets up and starts trying to help the guy, but it is too late, the rock star has been kidnapped and is held captive. The bandleader then makes a deal with the head of the criminal organization in order to get the rocker back, but as he drives away he stops to look back and see a large crowd looking at the body of the crashed car, he starts to get very nervous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is made for a whole generation to see but nobody wanted to see it. I was a little disappointed. The only reason it was decent was because the cast and director had made it.   A really nice idea. But it has not been executed like a movie that should be made. I am sure it will make some money but the talent is not worth the money spent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts off okay. The story is interesting and has some good humor. After that the action and violence ramped up and was really hard to watch. The characters were not very well developed, there wasn't any personality to most of the characters. The plot was extremely confusing and hard to follow at times.    I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The actors and actresses in this movie are bad. The movie is filled with violence and sex and just too many of these things. You can never tell what is going on. It was hard to understand what was going on in the movie and I was trying to understand some of the dialogue. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am a film critic in Australia and have a hard time with horror movies. I hate the 'look at me' aspect of most of them. But the recent remake of The Crazies is one of the more unique horror movies I've seen. This movie has a unique style and looks great. But I guess that isn't always enough to make a horror movie good, and so the actors are pretty dull. The film is shot very well and the music is really creepy and creepy. There is nothing more that I could say but watch this movie and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      It had all the elements that make a good action movie: the suspense, the suspenseful chase, the thrilling conclusion.  It also had a weak story:  it's set in a fantasy realm with dragons and magic and there's even some of that too, but it never makes it feel real and that made it less effective.   I had a blast watching the action but the characters didn't really shine, especially when the characters get to know each other. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The script was okay, but it's really not that good. The movie takes a long time to get to its climax and the ending doesn't make a ton of sense. The cast were great and I loved how they were so close together, but never seemed to have enough time to actually really connect.   I don't even know how the movie ended, but I didn't find that it was very effective. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've never heard of this film, so I don't know if there are any decent reviews out there. I watched the movie again and I'm still disappointed in this. The actors did a poor job and the plot is pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A horrible movie. If you want to see a story with a horrible ending, this is your movie. It's a sad story about a man who comes across a girl who has died. He gets drunk and kills her. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought it was a very good movie, but I am really disappointed in the ending. The last ten minutes are the most horrible. I can't get over how this movie ended.   My father was very disappointed with the end of this movie. The ending is just horrible.  It's an 80's movie and the ending makes me cringe. The characters seem out of place and they are acting stupid and stupid. I wouldn't recommend this movie to a 14 year old. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film takes a wrong turn from being a "Hogan's Heroes" movie and then it goes to hell. The only reason I still think this is the badest movie of the 90's is that there are still some of the best actors who I know to be in there like James Woods and Robert Wagner (the original actor who did the voice of General Shiloh), along with the movie was made before they had a chance to become bad. The movie is not worth watching, it is way overrated, and it is not even funny.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was bad and not worth seeing. It has no impact on the character development whatsoever. I hope the director goes and does a good movie.   I can't wait for him to do another movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think this movie was made for no other purpose than to make us feel bad for the "bad guy" and make us think that we have to do anything to get rid of this terrible person.   In addition to the horrible acting, the horrible direction, the terrible editing, the stupid music, the stupidity of the "monster" (why was there an ape in the jungle and why didn't they show it?) the horrible music is even worse - a terrible song by "Shining" that sounds like someone was watching "The Thing".   The editing is just too terrible.  The acting is pathetic and the writing is a waste of words.  I will never watch a movie like this again.  It was a waste and it made me feel sorry for the director who made this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was just not worth it.  This is a very poorly made movie that has an old style of comedy mixed with some drama and just the right amount of violence.  If you are a fan of the 1980's comedy then this movie is for you.  The acting is awful with most of the stars in the movie being just okay.  It is a really poor effort for a remake of a comedy movie.   The only thing good about this movie were the special effects. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just saw this movie and it is a train wreck. You have to see it again, again and again. The actors act like idiots, their actions are bad. It's too bad they had to do this movie.   Dumb movie. I have seen all those bad train wreck films but this is the dumbest one I have ever seen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie with nothing going for it. A lot of bad acting, boring, and nothing really funny at all.   My rating: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not one to sit through movies with all the cheesy actors and the stupid dialogue in the hopes of having a good time. It's really hard to watch a good movie that has been made in the past 20 years and not have it turn into one of the most tedious and poorly written films I've seen in a long time. The only thing worse than the bad acting in this movie is that there is so much of it. The actors who have appeared in this film have become so much older that it's unbelievable that they're still talking with such a thick southern accent. The same guy plays a guy in an 80's action movie and tries to talk like he's in his teens. Some of the dialogue was made up on the spot with actors who are still talking to each other years after the scenes they appeared in. I never understood how the actors in this made-up film were supposed to know what they're talking about.  It's so sad that a movie that was made in 1997 would still be so bad today. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very boring and uninteresting movie.   A lot of "explaining" and "theory" is made with little, if any, real action.  Very bland and uninspired movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While I enjoyed it, there were a lot of technical issues that stopped the movie from being great.   The first half of the movie was excellent, but when the main character gets shot and falls to the ground, the rest of the story just doesn't work.  Some of the dialogue sounds weird or awkward and the special effects are not good.  The ending was also very strange.  One of the characters is in the hospital, but she does not seem to be in the same room as the other characters.  In the film's finale, there is a close up of the girl who is about to get shot.  This scene did not happen in the movie.  There is a lot to talk about with this movie, but if it is worth watching, it should be seen in the theater, not in your home. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just received this for Christmas and I'm completely disappointed. The film is boring, poorly acted, and completely forgettable. The acting is pathetic and some characters are completely over the top and obnoxious. This film was a big bust and the fact that they didn't try and make a decent film in this production just makes me sad. It has no depth, no tension, and no real meaning. It was simply made to look good and it failed at that. I'm really not interested in this film, and it's probably going to just be used by the studios to keep people interested in their low budget productions.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those movies that really doesn't deserve the title "bad". The whole plot was just a bunch of lies and the actors were so badly cast that they didn't even try to make it convincing. I would not have been able to understand a single word that was being said, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good movie.   The movie takes place in a futuristic world where robots were built by a race of evil beings. The evil ones sent a team of robots to steal a powerful piece of technology called "the bomb". They sent a group of robots out to kill the human scientists who discovered this bomb, and because they needed some extra manpower, they sent out a number of "guards" to keep them from escaping.  There is a small group of humans that were sent out to stop the robots. The humans are very well-known for being the best fighters in the world, and they are equipped with a special gun called a "turtle gun". There were several different teams sent out, but the only human team that makes it to the end of the movie is that of the woman named Susan, played by Linda Hamilton.  The film does have a pretty good score, and a good mix of violence and sex. The special effects are well done, and the ending was kind of unexpected, but it still makes up for the movie's faults.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was not as good as the posters and posters advertised it to be. I know some people enjoy watching a movie and seeing what it looks like when it was produced, but I don't have much of a liking for movies like that. It wasn't as bad as it was made out to be but it wasn't good either. I think that if you are not a fan of horror movies like the ones you see advertised on T.V., then don't watch it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie for the first time about ten years ago and I absolutely hate it to this day.   This is the worst movie ever made.  The actors are terrible, especially with the guy playing the main character, he is horrible.  He is such a goof, no talent whatsoever.  I was completely out of my mind watching this movie.  It was so bad it made me ill.  They took the name "The Adventures of Robin Hood" and made it into a bad TV show.  Very poor acting, very bad acting.  There were two scenes where a little girl would get killed by a witch.  When I saw the first shot of the girl she was laughing hysterically, and then when she gets hit with the bat there was a loud noise and a lot of screaming.  This movie was shot with a super 8 camera, the director tried to show the action all over the world, even though none of the shots were from anywhere in the world.  After this movie I am sure they could not afford to make another bad movie, and they did not make a second movie, no more bad TV movies, I will never go see this movie again, it is a shame they did this to themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think that this movie is the biggest disappointment of the year. I mean the movie was so bad the studio did not even bother to show it in a screening before it was released.   The entire movie is like watching a bunch of retarded teenagers playing a video game.  If you had watched this movie when you were a teenager, you would have been disgusted because it is an absolute embarrassment.  This movie is so bad that you can see the whole thing being made by one person.  No one cares about anything that is going on.  The acting is horrible.  Everything about the movie is stupid.  For starters, the lead actress is a total waste of a person. She looks like a cross between a retard and a retarded person. Her character has no personality and the whole movie is a bunch o of her saying the same old stuff and making all the stupid comments.  Another bad thing about this movie was that the director never even bothered to cut any scenes out.  I saw this movie a long time ago and it still makes me sick to my stomach.  In conclusion, this is one of the worst movies ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't think it's a good film, but a lot of what it contains I don' t hate, so I guess it's good, right?   First of all, I didn't like the fact that they used the title of this movie to make it seem like it's something that will only interest teens, but it is definitely something that adults may enjoy.   But that's just me, the director's first film.  A little on the nose at first, but I found the movie interesting.  The story has two versions of what happened: The one you see in the movie is what happened, but in the other version, the story was told by someone else.  There's also the matter of the character's origins:  One version has him a kid, the other one has him an adult.  As the story continues, it becomes more and more apparent that the adults are playing games with him, and this is only a matter of time before he goes crazy, and if he goes completely insane, the movie ends.  This story is intriguing, and I would be interested to see what else was hidden about this case.  It doesn't leave me with much satisfaction, but to each his own.  I like the movie, but with only one version of what actually happened, and the fact there are alternate histories to consider, this may not be a great movie.  If the director had filmed more than one movie, it could have been better.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want to see a great action movie starring one of the greatest actors of all time and a character as complex as any in the history of cinema, this is it. With the exception of the ending, all the actors deliver their roles with the perfect amount of emotion, making each scene memorable. The cinematography is great and the editing is excellent. There are no plot holes, no weak characters, and only one scene that really felt rushed. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to see an action movie that shows the greatness of Stallone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was completely sucked in to this movie. The first scene had the whole team dressed in masks that looked like something out of a movie. Then I watched some of the movie's other scenes and saw what happened. I knew they were trying to pull something over on us, but I could not see the connection. They are going to show us a world we know nothing about and make it sound like the story is something really crazy. Well, I was not going to pay $10 to watch this flick and then I found out that it was just another movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In my opinion this movie is just a terrible idea that was never finished.  The original movie was written and directed by the great Sidney Lumet and was a wonderful film. The movie was about a reporter who becomes a member of the mob during a national campaign. He is also given the task of covering the trial of mobsters. The problem with this movie was that the director wanted to make this a film about the mob, not the reporter. They just had to change the story around. The story was about the reporter, not about the Mob. And they really needed a real good journalist for this part of the movie. And there wasn't any.  There is no one in this movie who can act like a real journalist. They were all played by people who would never act the part. And the movie was completely unprofessional.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is a lot better than the actual movie but the ending sucks!    It seems like there was too much story and no real character development at all!  It was a total rush to the end!  You need to really know what you are getting into!  The movie is a great way to pass the time.  If you like horror movies, watch this one! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw the trailer for this film, I was excited. It had all of the trappings of a horror movie, including a creepy clown. Then I saw that it was only supposed to be two scenes and I was not happy. I understand that they are only 2 minutes long, but I was waiting for something more.    I hope the sequel does better, but this isn't a good horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie of mine, IMO. It was lame and it made me want to hate the main character.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know why this movie was produced. The actors were mediocre and the plot seemed to be made up of the least original things one could imagine.    The only redeeming feature was the one of the actors that played the old woman who was always trying to keep up with the other kids and the one who played the bad guy was just lame as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I got this movie to see it on the big screen.   It was a huge disappointment.  There were times I would sit and think,'man, this movie really sucked.' I don't know what I did wrong.  I was expecting something like the last movie from Robert Rodriguez and was really excited to see what he would do with this one.  He got it wrong. It's kind of like the movie 'The Grudge' or something...   For all of the gore and horror... it's just boring and boring.  The action is great, but it's not the reason for watching this movie.  It's just not worth watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I know it's supposed to be hard to be bad. That's why we watch. But you know who I think has had the worst luck with being awful? The people who make shitty movies.   I was looking forward to this because of my admiration for the director and star. Not only is this a great movie, it's a fun movie to watch. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen (I really liked the first "Indiana Jones" with Harrison Ford) but it's definitely the worst "Indiana" movie.  And it has to be the worst for the fact that the guy in the part was originally intended to be George Lucas.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It seems I am an avid critic on this site.  My thoughts are generally positive but not always.  For example I found it a bit tedious that most of the action sequences occurred after a lengthy intermission where the characters are just standing around.  While it's fine for a thriller (there is one where an FBI agent tries to help a Russian mobster take over a bank and I have not seen that in a long time), it was too long for a feature.  I enjoyed it when it was a suspense thriller but it fell a bit flat during the action portion.   And that's a shame.  The characters are really interesting and the acting was good.  This film had a very strong plot and I just wish the plot got a little more resolved.  There are some interesting twists to the story but they are only revealed toward the end of the film.  A very good first film but not the last. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The characters are weak. You can tell that all the effort was put into the making of this movie. They are like caricatures. The only person that is good is a young blonde woman, and she doesn't even look real. A man is always a good man.   It's a very poor movie.  What really annoys me is how everyone always gives good reviews to a movie and then say "It was not that bad!"   I do not know if I would ever watch another movie made by George Clooney. I was expecting something better, but the movie is not a good film at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A good movie!   I can't tell you how many times my dad or my sister have asked me if I have seen this movie, and it was the only movie I saw all summer.   Unfortunately, my memory is not on point, and I don't know how old it is.  The movie is about an innocent man, the son of the owner of the farm where the movie is set. The son gets involved in something big and wrong, and is forced to make a choice.  It has some great actors in it: the great William Daniels, and Peter Graves and the great, and much more evil, John Saxon.  They all play their roles well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's nothing in this film worth watching. The special effects are really terrible and the actors were all really cheesy. They acted like they were having fun in a slasher film instead of acting like they needed to look serious.   This was directed by Bruce McDonald who also directed The Damned and Death Wish 4: The Crackdown. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't understand how the production team got the idea that a movie with a girl as the main star was a good idea.  There was nothing in the movie that made you think of the original.  The lead was played by a pretty girl.  It was obvious that the producers thought that she had to be good looking because they went out of their way to cast her.  Her name was Lizzie, she was played on screen by a girl who looked a bit like the lead of a cheapie teen flick.   The movie was a pretty good idea, however it could have used a director and a good script to do some good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved this movie when it came out in 1994. I remember I rented it in high school because I was bored. I got it on VHS and it was great. It had a great cast and I loved the concept of the movie. However, I wasn't really impressed. The acting was terrible and the acting was good, but it wasn't good. The plot was boring, the humor wasn't funny, and the plot was a mess. The only thing that made this movie enjoyable was the song at the end of the trailer. It was a good song, but I wasn,t really going to enjoy it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a terrible movie. I hated it from start to finish. The acting is terrible, the story is poorly done and not good at all, the direction is awful, and the editing is bad. It was very lame acting. I can't believe it was a good movie.   I did laugh a few times. It has a few good scenes in it but not too many. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not a movie to see if you want to be surprised. It is just a boring movie. It was too short and nothing happens.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I enjoyed this movie as much as I did The Ring. It is more action packed and has some great stunts. I also enjoyed the fact that it is a sequel.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like the new J. K. Rowling book Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and you are going to go see it then you need to stay clear of this terrible movie. The only reason the movie is even rated M is because it's got a few little jokes in it and it's very entertaining. If you don't care about a good story then I'd suggest not watching this movie and instead going and watching the film version.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the first few minutes the movie starts with the protagonist, the only female character of the movie, walking down a forest road. The movie jumps around from forest to forest (sometimes in the same forest), the female character walks up a hill (this is when she is in her early 20's), the protagonist gets out of her car and walks around in the forest for a while, then we see a guy running away from her, and when the protagonist goes to catch him, the guy has disappeared and so the protagonist decides to walk back to her car.   The next scene is of the male character being kidnapped by the heroine. She is in a cave and the male guy says that he will give her money if she does this. She says that she will not do this and gets out her knife and starts stabbing the guy in the chest. After a few seconds we hear someone shouting for help. The female character is then stabbed by a guy in a red hoodie and we then see the female in the red hood, blood and her knife laying on the ground. The male character is now bleeding out on the floor of the cave. She looks down and says that all this is just an act to get the male characters money.  The only female characters I can think of are either the evil witches of Salem or the witches in the old fairy tales. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can't believe how bad this movie is. I didn't know it was going to be so awful. I don't even care what the director was trying to achieve; this movie has nothing going for it. If you really want to see a good horror movie, then watch a good scary movie like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or The Blair Witch Project.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't expect a horror flick to be as bad as this. Not only do the monsters not fit the genre or the setting, they are all very cheap looking, and not scary at all.  I would've liked to see how much the cast has done to improve the quality of the film, but it's a pretty dull movie, not very good to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was so bad, I laughed as hard as I had ever laughed in my life. The plot was not bad but it was bad from start to finish. The acting was all so bad and you have to wonder what the director was thinking. It's impossible to find any actual good roles. Everyone looked so bored and the characters were so stupid and obnoxious that it was impossible to care about them. When the movie ended, I just wanted to go home. The director wanted to make this as big a hit as possible but he knew he couldn't do it. I thought the film was so cheesy, but it really was very funny. I saw this movie at the local drive in and I can't remember how many times I laughed in that restaurant. I've had better.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love the classic "Rocky Horror Picture Show". It's a classic, and in many ways, it is one of the very best films ever made. The production design, the special effects, and the acting are truly great. The screenplay (with the exception of "The Rocky Horror Picture") is great. It tells a great story about a bunch of people who go to see the famous movie theater in a small town. They are invited to come see the movie because of the movie star who is appearing at the theater. The star (played by Tim Curry) has a few guests with her and she seems to get really drunk. She does a few different things, and one of them turns out to be "The Scream". The movie begins to be a bit strange, and it's a bit scary. The story keeps getting more and more weird. It's very much a horror film, but it's done so well. I've seen this movie so many times that it's still very fresh in my mind. But as I've stated many times, if you don't like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" then you really shouldn't watch this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have had a very bad experience with this movie. When I saw the title I was confused about what this was going to be about. Then I saw its IMDb page and thought "this is actually a movie with a cast of great actors." When I got home I found out it was nothing of the sort. I was told that this was a horror film, but it was not. It was very confusing, and had poor acting. The best part of the movie were the actors that were playing the roles. They are just not believable. The acting is so bad that they never seem to be in fear for their lives, but they just seem completely terrified.   This movie is a bad rip off of several other horror movies, and it was actually a pretty decent one. A little on the long side, but a great way to wind down a summer evening. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Cant think of a better way to spend an afternoon."   --The "bad" movie.   -May 15, 2008Worst movie ever.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie itself is so stupid. If it was about a character that was more memorable than this movie (i.e. Jack Torrance), they could have made it more believable.   I wish this was the movie that would get released in the US.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The poor people are in the movie, but if you take a look at the scene when they go to the cemetery and they walk out, you will see that they are all dead.  The people in this movie are all the same kind of person.  They are poor and all they want is for people to leave them alone.   You have to make sure that you are alone, or it will be very hard for you to survive the time of the apocalypse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending is ridiculous, the ending has no purpose to it and just leaves you asking the question of why are these guys even in a film? If this movie was done today, the characters would be thrown off, or killed off like they were just a cheap way of killing time. They have to come up with some sort of a story to justify the characters in the film, and it takes a lot of balls to put them in a movie like this, it just comes off like a cheap effort.   If I had to say anything bad about this movie, it would be that they are just trying to do a low budget horror film and it just isn't working. The music was a bit more interesting than the horror though.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible. It is a complete waste of time. The characters are terrible, the plot is horrible, and the acting is terrible (and even worse, the directing). I think the best way to watch this movie is as a bad joke to see how far the plot can go.   There's no real comedy in this movie, there's no "action", the acting in this film is terrible, and it was not funny. It was just sad.  I wish that the director would have just finished the movie after watching all of the other bad ones, and have just stopped. I was looking forward to seeing a movie where an actor made a really bad movie, but this film didn't even make me laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For a long time I had seen the movie "Cobra" on television. When I finally bought the movie on video, I was disappointed. In a good way, but it wasn't good enough for me to watch again.   I enjoyed the story line of the movie, but after it was over the acting was pathetic and the plot line was very thin.  The film was written in 1976, but in the 1980s the acting and the script had aged and the movie was really hard to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think this film has a pretty good cast, but it is not really that good. The plot was really weird and the acting was very flat. It was a film that was made by a film-school grad, and a great deal of the acting could not have been done better.   And the director, a good friend of mine who is a director himself, has also recently become a director, which means that he probably has a good deal of experience. I am sure he can direct a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was completely boring, and nothing good happened in it.   I have seen worse movies but not bad ones like this.  It was totally lame, and the cast of characters were all over the place.  They were all so annoying and annoying.  There were some good scenes in the movie, but there were not enough of them.  My friends had to tell me why they were in the film, and I had no idea what they were talking about.  I did not see the movie in its entirety, but my friend told me the trailer was good enough to see this movie.  The only reason I saw this movie was because of the trailer.  A couple of my friends were laughing the whole time and making jokes about the film.  Another time when we were driving to my friend's house, one of my other friends said this was one of the best movie trailers he had ever seen, and that we should watch this. I was too stupid to believe him, and let him drive away.  This is definitely not worth watching, and you won't like it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My father and I had a fun evening. I watched this movie when I was about 12, and enjoyed it quite a bit. Unfortunately, I didn't like it then, and I don't think it's a good movie now. It has gotten worse since then, even though it looks better, it really is not funny at all, it doesn't have a good story, and it is just silly in places. Not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a piece of trash. This movie takes no chances, you have no idea what is going on, you don't know why you are in there, and you are treated like crap. It is just a piece for the money makers to have people in it. The actors have no personality at all, no spark, no charisma. The movie just goes on and on, without any real emotion at all. If you are interested in getting a piece to put on a list or you are a horror fan, then it is not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie for the first time at a movie house on a Saturday evening. I had only just finished watching the movie The Shining on the Friday before, but I felt I needed a change of scene. I went into this movie, expecting a cheesy horror film, but it was much more interesting than that. It was dark, with some great acting and good gore effects. The story is really good. It's very well written. I'm going to watch it again, just for the creepy feeling, but my heart is with the actors. I highly recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie a pass, but then I saw the first 5 minutes of the first act and just said WTF, I guess that wasn't enough for Hollywood to be able to sell it as something other than what it was. The acting is terrible, and the whole thing is basically just a rehash of previous movies. I hate how Hollywood thinks that a guy named Chris Pine with a few lines of dialogue is going to be believable in his role. This is not the actor's first major role, and he's not a movie star, but he's still the lead. The plot is silly, and it's not as if the movie was badly done. There was enough of an idea behind it, but it just didn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film when I was in high school and I was really disappointed when I saw it. I mean I was so disappointed in it that I went to see it on VHS and that movie was actually better than this.    This movie had some amazing action scenes, especially one with some insane stunts done by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton.  For the most part this movie was really boring and I thought it was a pretty boring action film.  A lot of the plot of this movie were very similar to the Terminator films. This movie was not as good as the Terminator and the action scenes in this movie is really boring.  If you are looking for a good action movie then go out and buy some Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day on DVD.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        This movie is NOT funny at all, it is very sad and sad movies that makes you feel so bad for the poor people. I would never watch this movie again and I am going to write this review from the point of view of the girl that I had a crush on.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You know I really don't like this movie.   The writing is bad.  It sounds like one actor was trying to sound like another actor and it doesn't work for me.  The action scenes are really boring and lame.  And the way they use the action scenes is stupid and pointless.  That's my opinion.  There are way too many actors in this movie and they do not look like real people.  If you don't want to watch this movie, don't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie at first, and then it started to get really bad.   The writing is very bad. The actors are terrible. The directing is terrible.  I hate to be negative, but this movie should be in the movie club. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a cheap, horrible, bad movie that has no business making a profit in Hollywood.  I think Hollywood would have done better to just hire a real actor to play the role of the killer and let him play it for free.   It's so bad it's embarrassing.  All the scenes in the film, which were supposed to be very frightening, just sound like the killer talking in his creepy voice.  If you have kids, I would stay away from this movie and never watch it again.  This film just isn't worth the time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would highly recommend that anyone who isn't already a fan of this movie, wait to see this one. If you can look past all of the horrible acting and the poor special effects and just enjoy the story, this is a must see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some good scenes in this movie. And the story was okay. But the film just sucked. It was horrible! The only reason this movie was made is because a director was looking for a cheap idea for a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie and loved that I knew all about the life that was the protagonist, but the movie was really only good for one thing and that was to entertain and give us the chance to see a little bit more of that world, and the characters that were in it.   So there is not much to add about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was going to see this movie, and my friend is also a huge fan of Robert Zemeckis, so we watched it together. He kept complaining about how long the film was, and I kept saying "that's not bad, but it's not good." This is one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. It is so bad, so bad that it makes me sad, but I can't say I'm sorry I ever saw it. I never want to see a Zemecki film again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When you think of the word "wicked", you imagine the devil himself, not a movie. The movie is about a woman, who gets an unwanted visit from the devil, who wants her to be his wife. The woman in the film tries to stop him and the end is a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really wanted to see this film, but the reviews made me regret going in to see it.  The film is poorly made, and I never really got the point of it. The actors didn't seem interested in the movie, and none of the scenes were interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a total disappointment. I am a movie guy. I have seen every movie, from every genre, and I am always looking for that one movie that I can watch over and over again to "see if I like it". This movie, well...I am done with it. It was so boring, and nothing really happens. I hate to be honest with you, but this movie is a complete joke!   I would have been really interested to see the director of this movie and interview him. Why is the girl dressed in drag? Why didn't the director make the movie the way it should have been? What is the reason why the main male is a drunk? He is a total idiot. Why would a girl put on this weird disguise? It is so ridiculous that it is hard to watch.  I have never heard of a drag queen or a drag prince before, but they are in this movie, but it is pretty lame.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was terrible.   They really tried to be funny with a plot like this but it was all pretty cheesy and they were not funny.      I am still not laughing at any of the characters.  The ending made me sick to my stomach.  It was really funny but it still made me angry.  I felt like I should have been shot during this entire movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. It was completely pointless and completely stupid. The best thing was the ending.  I gave it a 2 star because the movie had a lot of great ideas that could have been brought to life.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie a few years ago and I thought it was a classic. It is still one of my favorites. The plot is classic and the acting is good. It doesn't matter if the actor isn't very good but the film is still good.    The only problem I have with the movie is that the story was really good. I love the story and the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not a movie buff, but I know a lot of people who are. When I saw this movie, I knew it was going to be a bomb. I expected the typical Hollywood "heroes in a bad guy's lair" type of film. I was wrong. The only thing that the film did was make a fun, cheesy, and funny action movie.   This movie was just cheesy, cheap, and a waste of time.  The action sequences were awful. The film did make me laugh once or twice, but it was very repetitive.  There are a lot more people on this planet that make better action movies than this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has no redeeming qualities and has made me laugh out loud more than I have laughed in years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot:  If this was a movie from the 60s or 70s, the plot would be pretty lame.  "If we find this little boy in the woods, he is going to be our only hope to find the child who killed his mother, then went and killed his brother.     He must have something that gives him strength."  Why are we watching this movie?  The acting:    One would hope that after spending 3 hours in the studio with a bunch of actors, they'd be able to do some better acting.     I'm not sure if the writers of this film have seen an old horror movie, but they seemed to be using the old campy 70s horror movies as inspiration for the movie.  So many of the people are wearing old style black and white films.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film takes place in the mid-20th century in an unnamed industrial city in the US and it features lots of pretty girls and men who are having a great time. The girls are hot and the men are charming. There are some fantastic car chases and action set pieces. The music is good and all the actors were great.   In the early days of the film the protagonist is married and there are lots of happy couples in the film. Then he gets a promotion in the company and he goes to a party where a number of attractive girls are.  When the protagonist and his date meet at a bar a lot of strange things start to happen. He becomes violent and the girl ends up in the hospital. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film by a man who has no idea what he is doing and a crew that has no respect for the material.   There are scenes and shots that do not need to be in the film and the crew is completely incompetent and inept.  This was a project that I heard about and then quickly dismissed as being not worth a shot.  I will be glad to give it a miss if anyone finds it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just found out that this movie, " The Legend of Hell House " is a fake. The producer has a "fansite" page where he writes down every single negative review that comes his way and then makes sure that every "new" reviewer never writes a negative opinion about the movie.   He then posts a fake "review" on the "fellow fangirls" site " The Mary Sue." It reads like the writer was really angry about the negative reviews on the web site.  I'm no fan of "fangirl" movies and I never would have liked this movie either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The first time that I saw this film I was in awe. I was shocked that someone had done what they did to this beautiful film, but they didn't take away any of its charm. The picture quality is still gorgeous, and the performances were perfect. It's so hard to find a bad film on the big screen anymore, and this is one of them.  "The first scene in which the heroine, Rose, goes into a bath tub with an older man was quite shocking for me. My sister told me this scene was quite disturbing.  I felt dirty and violated. I had never been so disturbed and disturbed in a film. This scene really made me feel that my sister was right about the movie.    A real eye-opener, and very disturbing film.  5 stars for sure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie that just doesn't have much to offer at all.  The characters are so one-dimensional, that there isn't much you can really do to make them look more interesting.  It just doesn:t matter what happens to them, it just seems that they are there only to be killed off and get rid of.  At one point the guy talks to another guy and says, " You guys get it? It's not a lot of fun being an ex-con. "  This is not a bad thing, but it is not worth watching.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see this movie at a movie theater in an upstate New York mall. This is an upmarket horror film that has been around for a while.  The movie is just kind of run of the mill. It's not a great film but nothing bad happens.  There's some real tension in the film but it's mostly just you not really paying attention.  I felt like this could have been something that I watched on television or something. I didn't really see what the movie was about other than the girl running around and having some sort of nightmare.  Overall, I really didn't care for this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you think about the name of the film the first thing that comes to your mind is "movies are made by people that look like they have a lot of sex in their lives". I never saw a movie where I thought "this guy is a sicko!"   The acting is all wrong. The girl in the sex scene looks like she just came from the gym and she is so skinny. The guy that plays a doctor doesn't sound anything like an actor. He is too thin. And he was not in the "sex scene" at all.   At first this movie looked like it was going to be great, but then the actors got a little fat so there were some people who looked a lot better than the people who appeared in the movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of those movies that is not a good movie, but I can tell you this: the production values are great. The actors are very good and the production is well done.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a very poor film, which I do not recommend anyone to see. I do think it has some redeeming features though. It is very funny, and some of the scenes are funny enough to keep you on your toes. And I think there was one really good scene between the two leading characters that had a great payoff and I'm glad that it was included. But the rest of the film is just too bad to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am very disappointed to see this movie in an age where great movies are being made. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, or even the younger generation who may be watching this in school, as it has been so long since the last great movie like this one was made. The story is not very well thought out, and it is not interesting. If you can stomach a movie like the film you will probably be bored by it. This movie was poorly made, and there are scenes that are simply not worth watching. There are even some scenes that have not been shown on film that should not have been shown at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After watching this movie, I felt like I was seeing a documentary of a UFO crash, and that this was the result of some kind of bizarre experiment where some researchers from the Department of Energy went looking for the source of the mysterious "X" light. I could not believe that a movie would actually try to explain the phenomenon, and even more that the movie would depict a UFO as something real and "alien".   I was so disappointed with the ending that I feel like I should have seen the movie for myself to see if this was just the product of poor filmmaking.   The characters were kind of like a bunch of people who had gone to a party, and had been told the story that the aliens were coming.  The main character, Paul, was an idiot and a jerk, and the rest of the characters were more like the characters of a college fraternity, who were trying to find out why they were at a party and why their lives were being ruined by the party.  It was the kind of movie where the bad guy had a few good lines, but was generally seen as a jerk.  This movie just doesn't make any sense, and this makes it even more interesting that the X light is supposedly some sort of "alien" device that is supposed to be used for the purposes of "weaponization."   Although it looks like the UFO is hovering, it's just not moving. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie for the first time about 10 years ago on my birthday. I thought I was watching "The Shining" but, well, it wasn't. The first 10 minutes are just an intro of the main characters who have the same last name as the main character in this movie. I was so into it. I had just been through an amazing relationship and was so in love with the main guy (Robert Englund). When they showed the intro I was in disbelief. I really thought I'd be watching an all new horror movie but to my surprise, it was a horror movie made by people with the same name. I love horror movies, but this was definitely one of the worst horror movies ever made. The director had never done anything like this before and he really had the wrong idea. I know that he got a very large budget to make this movie, but it's just so bad. A few times he cut things too much or made me think there was a special effect going on, but there wasn't any. The acting was awful and the special effects looked fake. I still have nightmares about that movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is probably one of my most favorite movies of all time. The soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission and the movie is just a fun and funny ride.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've only seen the movie once, and this time I didn't think the plot was very interesting.  I think it's a bad idea to base a film on the idea of a "bad trip", and even worse to make that the entire plot.   In the movie, there's a character named "Tiffany" who is supposed to be a drug addict.  While she's acting out her life on the streets, her husband makes love to another woman and is murdered by her husband's partner.  The woman Tiffany runs off with ends up going into a mental hospital and being "cured" of her addiction.  But she comes out worse than she was before.  Tiffany ends up having an affair with a man she met in the hospital, and the woman he's with, who looks and acts very much like Tiffany, becomes his new wife.  This character is supposed to be a strong, independent woman who's been through a lot, and still has her integrity.  Instead, we get a film about a woman who gets "cure" for drug addiction because of a sexual encounter with another man.  It's a story where someone who's "curing" herself doesn't think to tell anyone.  If you want a film that tells a great story about a "real" heroine who is truly on the "right side of the law", check out "Nurse Ruth".  "Drucker's wife" might be interesting to watch, but it's not a very good film, and it makes Tiffany seem even more crazy than she really is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I did not think I would be able to watch this movie, but it is still pretty terrible. I would not recommend this movie to any kid. I don't understand how someone can take a horrible story and turn it into a good film. The acting is terrible. The music is terrible, the plot makes no sense, and it's made worse by the way it is edited.   It's definitely a bad film to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie should have been titled 'The American Biker' and the music video should have showed a group of American Bikers in Mexico. This movie is a bad idea and a bad film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie itself has a lot of problems. Some characters are completely illogical and don't really act in any way but the plot needs to be changed. I thought the plot was a bad joke to begin with, and it just kept growing on me.  This movie is also badly shot and not well edited at all.  The film was made in the 60s, and many of the people on camera have long hair.   This film doesn't have many action scenes.  I'm not sure if this is one of the worse bad movies that has ever been made.  If you like cheesy movies with a bunch of goofy characters, this movie is worth a try. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was really horrible. It was just too hard to watch. The actors were so bad that you just had to feel bad for the characters. I can't believe they thought it was a good idea to have the actor play a bad guy and have him shoot people...I mean, it's just too much to think about the stupidity of the actors.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen the sequel to The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and while the movie does not live up to its predecessor, it does make good use of the material. The cast of characters is great, but I would have liked to see more of them. Also, the music is very out of place during some of the movie's most hilarious scenes.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am an atheist. This movie was made by a Christian fundamentalist. It really makes me sick.   This movie has no merit whatsoever. This is NOT the work of a genius. It is not even close to a movie that is good enough to make you sit up and pay attention.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is pretty bad, as it has you following a "bunny-like creature" who gets stuck in a hotel with two other girls (and no male companions), and your goal is to get them out of the hotel to a safe place.   You don't really have a choice as you don't have the money or the skill to get the girls out of there, so you must "work" on them to get to the safe place where the other girl will meet you.  You do this by giving them a small amount of money (around 2 dollars in the first movie) to get some drugs and food so they will follow you to a place where they can escape, and eventually, the other female comes and you have to help her.  This is very stupid and the movie has no idea what it is doing.  There are some nice "tricks" like hiding a small toy animal from the female, and being able to use a car to get away from the other male (as the car will be moving), but they are all very obvious and very silly.  The girls are all not very well done.  They are not very realistic at all, and are not "like" real girls.  One of the girls has very bad acting and acting seems like she is not a very good actress.  It takes a lot to make a movie like this, but it doesn't seem like it was put out on the cheap.  As I said before, this movie has nothing going for it.  No plot, characters, or acting, and really poor special effects.  I give it a D, but if you can only get this one movie for the cost of one movie ticket, you should probably get a life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very bad movie. I don't like to watch these kinds of movies, but this one is really bad. The acting is not bad, and most of the cast is really good. But this movie is very bad, it's a total waste of your time and it's very sad. If you like a good cheesy old horror movie, give this one a try. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film has no idea where it wants to go or what it wants you to see. Everything in the film is a rip off of other movies. The costumes, the music and the story are all too familiar. I think this is one of the worst of all time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting was not great, so you might have to adjust to it.   I found it hard to care about anyone in it, except perhaps the actors who are trying really hard to sell you the movies, and their performances did not always work.  The setting was nice, but the film was really filmed on a small set and really didn't capture the atmosphere of a long forgotten resort.  It was all really pretty set up but all of the set up was done in a way that I felt it might get in the way if someone really wanted to enjoy this movie.  I enjoyed the movie but would only watch it at a party, at a movie theater, or with a group of friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this movie was just so bad I had to post it. First off, I am really happy that I can finally see a movie where the female lead is in charge of her own destiny. She has no problem running off and saving the life of her father who has been turned into a vampire.  This doesn't happen in a hundred other vampire movies.  Also, I loved how her father didn't know he was turned into vampire. He didn't even know he had a daughter! This guy is so weak and he actually has to fight the vampire girl to get the information out of her. They were even in the same bed.  It was really sick.  The script was a mess. The main male character is just a jerk and just wants to sleep with all the girls he meets and he doesn't care who they are. There were some very strange situations as well.  I also think this movie would be better if they had done some research on vampires. This movie was made in 1989 but I can't believe we have to deal with them now. The girls were just a bunch of sluts.  They were like pornstars.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is about a couple who go on a trip. They fall in love and have the most incredible time and then they come back. Then it turns out that the couple who is supposedly in love with each other and had such an amazing time together was just looking for sex.   This is the worst movie ever.   They put a couple in bed and don't even show them being intimate.  I am so disappointed that someone made this movie.  They made it out to be so funny and funny for a while but then it's just a sad movie about a man and woman.  If this movie was funny at all it would have been good. It was a sad and depressing film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "Black and White" music and acting is just plain bad.   I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In short, the worst movie i ever seen. The story wasn't even that great, it was just a rehashing of an old vampire story, with the most boring, useless and pathetic characters you could ever imagine and the worst acting i have ever heard.  It is absolutely unlistenable.    The worst part is, if you are a big fan of the old movie, you will see the movie only once, as it has a very short running time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting is horrendous, the story is ridiculous and the acting is atrocious. I hate to break it to you but there is nothing real about this movie. The acting sucks more than the movie itself.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So disappointed. The plot is extremely lame. What's worse is that this is a sequel to a movie released 30 years ago. How does this movie get made? The actors are terrible, the camera is awful, the acting is atrocious, and the plot is lame. Why does a director bother with a movie that he made in 1986?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first few minutes are amazing.   It's so weird how you don't really hear any noise from the people in the room.  The sound is great and I'm sure that the effects will really pay off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know if I can review this film, because I've seen it so many times, and I've always loved the film and loved the director.   So many times have I heard people say "I was going to see this movie", and I always thought "Well, why didn't you?".   This film doesn't have any great lines or great performances, but I was so tired of the crap films I was watching, that I was glad I finally saw this.  A great film, with great acting, and a really nice director.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible. I hate how they just don't get that the people watching the movie at home are not the same people in the movie theaters, and how the directors didn't really care how they made it. I was looking forward to seeing this movie and when I got home I saw that the DVD hadn't even been sent to me.  This is a terrible movie that has to be seen in the theater to be believed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen this movie 3 times and it always gives me an impression of how bad it really is. It just doesn't have much of a story and even the actors aren't that great. They were so awful that it was funny. The writing is also so bad, it's even hard to understand what they were saying. It's like the film is trying to say something but can't. The acting is also really bad, but you still have to watch this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is not very good. It is not bad at all. The movie is good for a laugh, but in my opinion, not very funny at all 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I saw this movie at the local movie theater with my family and we got lost trying to find it. We finally found it and I thought it was a bit strange that it was in black and white, but we enjoyed the movie so much. It's a very slow paced movie that's really not that good, but there are a couple of good laughs. I think my wife didn't even like the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's got a great cast, and is a good start for the director, and it doesn't have a lot of dialogue, but it's still a fun movie. But there were several scenes in it, that I just could not understand, and I felt like I was watching the movie out of order and not really in the story.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's the "C.R.I.D.S" of horror movies. If you love C.R, love this. If C.H.U.D., love this (and you're going to love C, for some reason). It's as good as it's going to get.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was awful and it was made by some people that are not worth anything and they were not good at what they were trying to do.  This movie is bad it is just the worst movie ever made.   It was so terrible the actors and crew did not deserve to have this movie made. It was just awful and horrible.  When the actors are doing their jobs and acting they are doing it so bad.  The acting was so bad and horrible in this movie.  It is really hard to watch and it is really sad to watch that.  There was one scene I can't even remember how they made it in this horrible movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie is a series of images and sounds. This movie has nothing to offer you with all the special effects and special effects in the world do not make a movie any better. The characters are completely cardboard and don't make a sense, even the one's you love are nothing more than caricatures. The acting, like the rest of the film is not worth a second of your time, they're all flat, not convincing and none of the actors are good. It is just plain boring, I could easily watch another movie like this, but I just won't.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad film! It has all the makings of a terrible movie and that's why I give it a negative.  The characters and the story is so bad it is unbelievable!  The acting is terrible and the plot is completely nonsensical.  I was expecting a comedy so that's where the jokes were coming from but it turned out to be a bad comedy.  Why did he want to marry her in the first place, and then marry her again when she had a daughter?  It was supposed to be all about their relationship but it seems so contrived.  It's like he wanted the two of them to be the perfect couple but now that they are married he has lost all control of his wife and his life.  All the jokes are too obvious or come out of nowhere.  In a bad way it seems like this movie was written to sell some kind of product.  If you are looking for some good old fashioned comedy then you will not find it here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a little disappointed when I came home from work on this movie, I wasn't expecting anything good... well, let me tell you, this movie is a little worse than crap.   The plot of this movie was so ridiculous that I didn't expect much from it, but the actors in this movie were awful, especially Gary Busey and David Warner (both played by David Carradine), they are so over the top that it's laughable.  This movie is very hard to watch, as it's completely fake and the story line is so stupid, and the acting was terrible as well.  I couldn't believe that anyone could be so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was terrible.   Very bad film, bad acting, and worst scene with Gary Busey.  Even with the crappy acting, the characters weren't that good.  This film should be called "Guitar World" or something.  If you are a fan of the band, you will get some enjoyment out of this movie, but for the average movie goer, it will just make you mad.  The plot is just a load of nonsense.  They tried to do something original and failed.  Very cheap acting, good camera work, and good music makes the film, but the actors are bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While the first half of the movie was entertaining and a good way to start this sequel, it lost it's shine in the second half as it became too fast paced and over the top. It became really boring after the first 15 minutes, and I felt it dragged on too long at times.   It seemed like this movie was made to be more entertaining than something that was based in a real life tragedy.  I just feel like this is a very overrated movie as far as it being a good movie to watch.  This movie does have its place in history, but not at the expense of the characters and the story.  Overall, this movie would have been better if the original actors were used. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you don't know what a B movie is, it's either a bad B movie, or a B-movie that was made by a B studio.   The plot of this movie is to make a B film and it succeeds on that point, but the acting is all over the place, and it never has any real punch.  The best scenes in the movie are between the three main characters, though they are not the three best parts of the movie.  There are other scenes in this movie that are even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie for the first time about 5 years ago. I had seen it twice before that so I decided to see it for the third time. I was very disappointed. The whole movie was just a total mess. All the actors just didn't look good in it. The actors who were in it just couldn't act. I don't care who the director or the producer are as they just suck and suck hard.   At least it has good special effects. It didn't have a lot of action scenes but they were done well. I liked that it didn't focus just on the female actors. It has a lot more going on with the male actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One day I was at a friend's house. He was playing with a girl and the conversation was getting a little weird. I decided to check out the movie while he was distracted. It was good. A little offbeat, but funny. I didn't think it was much of a movie, but I liked it. I think the movie has a great deal of potential. The actor's were good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My friend gave this movie a try. She loved it, I thought it was a good movie to look at but I thought that it was very bad. There were a few funny moments, the story was good and it had a lot of action but the acting was terrible and I felt like they had no idea how to act. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After watching a couple of movies with good acting and a decent script, I was pleasantly surprised to be watching this movie. This movie had a lot of plot holes and the acting was all over the place and made it a bad film. The only thing good about it is the sound of the train wheels rolling over the tracks, but that's about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie. This movie was an embarrassment of awful. I will never again see a movie like this. This was just a bad rip off of a film called "The Dark Knight". If you want a bad film then pick that up. This film is really just an over the top and laughable attempt at the dark knight. It was supposed to be based on the movie "The Matrix". The director of the film, Gary Busey, is a professional and a good actor but he did not get it right with this film. The only positive aspect is that it had a good and enjoyable ending. I am not sure if this film was a flop, a fluke, or if they just went through too many actors before making a decent film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was crap, and the only reason I watched it was because it was so cheap that I didn't even care about the ending, and that's a terrible idea for a movie, let alone one to be given to your kids to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible. It is basically a "wacky adventure" where the leads pretend to be a family who have to escape from a house fire that killed their three children (a girl and her younger brother, a boy and his younger sister). But instead of finding the culprit, they end up getting trapped by all these creepy creatures, which are like the evil characters in the first two Harry Potter films.   The acting is pretty bad, the production is horrible, and the plot is stupid.  The plot doesn't make sense, there is no real motivation for all these creatures and monsters to appear (why did they appear?). It also gets weird at times, like a creepy old man trying to kill the group.  It has a lot of things wrong with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has a very "bad" rating and that is a shame. There was no need to bring this in the cinema, since this is a very bad movie. I don't like the actors, the film isn't good. There is too much plot in the beginning and even if it was for one or two minutes, it wouldn't even matter. If it was a movie that was bad, they could've made a few changes and you would've seen it. It isn't even a bad film; it's just a bad picture.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is predictable and poorly paced. This is a movie for a small audience and probably could have been trimmed. The director tries to make it look as though it's an action film in this version, but it's nothing more than a bunch of fights. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are few movies as awful as this, but they are all terrible and it is this one that will be remembered by the worst of the worst.   This movie was a flop, and a disaster of bad writing. The lead actors are awful, and the screenplay is bad, and it all fits together terribly.  One of the reasons it flopped is because of the stupid and insulting characters.  There is nothing witty, funny or appealing about this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie doesn't even try to hide its badness. If this were a real movie it would have at least tried to make something interesting, but alas, it is just a poorly made movie about a very annoying character and his obsession with some pretty horrible things, but what can you expect from an actual movie?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this as my husband had a really bad night and i loved it so much i wanted to watch it before we went to bed. I have never seen it before but i had a lot of fun trying to guess what was going on and getting confused.    Very fun for a few hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It really isn't the worst film. It has its moments, but I would be embarrassed to go to see it in the theater.   The acting is very amateurish and the production is not particularly interesting.  It has some great set-pieces, but the story is almost a series of cheap gags.  I'm glad that it was only meant as a movie to advertise the movie "Fatal Attraction" on the big screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot of this movie is great. The only problem is that it starts getting a little goofy with the lead actor and the two female leads.   This is the sequel to the very good but overrated (for my tastes) movie "In The Line Of Fire". Both of these movies are about soldiers in the Vietnam War. In this one, the bad guys are North Vietnamese Vietcong.  The movie is well worth a watch if you love the movies "Battle Of Midway" and "Top Gun". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Boys will be Boys" is a film about how we are conditioned to be killers and it is a sad commentary on our society.   A few times I was thinking how this would be a great film to use as a lesson in moral education to young people. It is one of those films that can only get so much worse. The violence is not really that hard to watch and is even kind of funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am absolutely disgusted with this movie.   If you were to see this movie for the first time, you would think it was an old B-Movie.  When I saw it, I expected it to be awful.  I think it would have been fine if the actors weren't so annoying.  They made up the dialog as they went along and the actress was annoying, but that really shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.  The acting is bad and the characters are awful. I thought at times that they were playing their own characters and they weren't funny.  If anyone would have watched this movie before they went to a premiere, they would have learned about how terrible it was.  And for all of the money that went into this movie, I don't think it has a single funny line in it.  In conclusion, if you want to see actors that were "good" when they were young, watch this movie or any of the other "bad" movies that I mentioned. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie I would watch over and over and never ever see again   Was a terrible movie that never was funny at all, even in a bad way, and had no plot whatsoever. It had nothing in the way of characters, nothing to care about in the movie, and no reason to care. I had fun laughing at the ridiculous situations and the way the actors played them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was good as a short film but I thought the script was awful.   If you like this kind of film then by all means watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an example of how the director was going to be a star if it was not for the "fault" of the actors. I believe the director made a big mistake by casting so many of the "stars" for this film.  Fellini is one of the best directors that has ever lived and this is the "worst" film he ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My husband and I watched this movie on Christmas Eve, and on Christmas morning we watched it in bed together. It was good and creepy and scary, but it was really boring.   We just stood in front of the tv and watched this for 3 hours.  It was just a bad film. It had no horror value, just cheesy scares. I am not one for scary movies, I watch horror movies only for the acting, but this film was so bad that I was disgusted.  So when we got up, we started looking at the other shows and movies on TV. I was really scared to see what movie I would see on TV today, so I decided not to go to sleep. The next day I went back to the movie I had watched on Christmas eve and tried to figure out how I could watch it. I watched it again, and this time I was shocked to see that it was an art house movie. This is the kind of movies that are so poorly made that they are just bad. I wish it was a low budget movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible movie. It is an un-original, over-produced, bad-acting piece of garbage. It doesn't even make any sense.   The plot involves a scientist who, on a business trip, gets a visit from a doctor who says he may have cancer. The doctor wants the scientist to take the disease to his hospital, which is near where the scientist's company is based, so the doctor can find a cure for it.  The movie is about how the scientist refuses to let the doctor take the cancer to the hospital, and how the two fall into a struggle for power that is completely unnecessary and totally stupid. I can't see how this was even supposed to make any kind of sense. The movie doesn't make any effort at all to sell the doctor as an effective doctor; he's really just a sleazy doctor who uses the scientist for his own purposes.  I don't understand why this movie made it through production. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most boring movie  I have seen.   I think it is so boring because it is an attempt at a horror movie.  I was hoping to see something that was scary because the trailers said it would be, but  didn't get it.  And then the story just gets more and more stupid.  It doesn't even have enough logic to make it believable that the house is haunted.  What happened to the characters was so forced, I wish they had been killed and left behind.  Maybe if they had died they would have had more time to make the movie more interesting.  The movie was like watching a movie in which you were in the audience of a horror show.  If the characters were in a more realistic situation, I might have been more entertained, but the way they acted was really annoying.  This movie should not have been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The bad part about this movie is how much of an ego he had, and how he was able to put a whole movie out there about himself. He is a character that you don't really care about and it is almost frustrating to watch.   He seems to be obsessed with his own story and has nothing to say to the audience.  It's the sort of movie that doesn't deserve to be made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad movie is really good, except for the movie makers. It is so obvious that they don't understand the story, the character, the plot. The movie starts off in the worst way possible. No one can really understand the plot or the characters because the writers did not have the imagination. They make everything up as they go and make all the mistakes that I would make. I think the movie should have been titled "Weird Movie" - because most of the characters are so stupid that they make no sense at all.   I would not recommend this movie to anyone! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would have liked this movie more if it was actually in the 90s.  This movie would have been great as a "Saturday morning cartoon."   This is not a good movie and for me it is probably the worst movie I have ever seen.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I can't watch this again! I had so much fun at first watching this. It was like a little episode of "Alf" where a kid and his friend were playing cops and robbers. I didn't realize it was just a kid doing some kind of fake police show. Then the kid got a little too old to be playing a kid with a fake smile on. So when he said "I'm a cop now!" I thought I was watching the real thing. I think they put some fake "jokes" into it. It's the same kid and the same old movie. It starts off ok, but the ending is just too long and too out of character. I know the kid is a cop, and that he was going to kill someone in the next scene, but then I thought he might be really serious. Instead he said, "I really wanted to be an officer, so I took the job". I couldn't believe it. This should have ended with a little "Woo!" "Hoo" and then they should have gone into the credits. It ruined the ending for me and I would never watch this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had been planning on going to the premiere of this movie for months. The hype was really off. I was really hoping that it would be a fun film to watch and I would enjoy myself. I got my popcorn at midnight and was about to sit down and watch it. When it started I really did feel something was off. The story was great but it got boring fast. The plot was boring. I thought that the characters were boring. It felt like they were saying the same thing over and over again and I just wanted to be on my merry way. I know there is a good story in here but I was so frustrated at this point. I really wanted to go to the theater and be entertained but it was really just bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As someone who watched this as an adult (after reading this review, I am more than confident in saying this will not work for an underage child, even if the adult in me knows better) this was one of those "it's ok, we're adults now" films. The acting was all over the place, the pacing was all off, and the plot was all very thin and uninteresting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I enjoyed this movie, but if I had to rate it, I'd say it's a 2.5 star movie.  It's really, really good, but it's not one of the great comedies in the "70's.  The jokes are still very funny, but this movie feels like a lot of money was spent on a movie that just didn't work.  I'd recommend watching it with an audience to get a sense of what it's about and get a feel for the actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts off well. I thought it was interesting and even entertaining but then things get really bad at the end.   For me the bad thing was that it made me think about some of the bad things I've seen.  The people in it were good looking and had nice personalities but most were not likable.  If you are looking for some good laughs or interesting characters then this movie will give you a lot of them.  It was entertaining.  I hope they did a good job on the sequels. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is all wrong. It is all about "how much would you pay for this?" "How much will this get you?" "What will it take to get this thing to work?" Then they go to a movie theater and start showing the movie (it is on VHS!) and people start screaming and jumping out of the theater. It was so bad I just watched it in a dark room for 2 hours.    I watched it on VCR in my bedroom. I thought it looked really good on VTR. But it looked terrible on V CR. The movie was not well filmed. I can understand why some people thought it was really good. I did not like the film. It has no "plot".   What a waste of my time and money. I really didn't need to see this movie. It did not get better in the re-release. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Movies are to be enjoyed on the edge, they can make you laugh, cry, yell, and do a lot of things that are not always intended. That said, this movie is definitely a bad film." -Tom Vereen.   I saw this movie with my daughter and it was a very entertaining movie. The kids were really funny.  My only problem with this movie was that it was so long it was boring.  There were times I was wondering what was going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those "so bad it's good" movies.  It's a comedy and has some laughs but it's very bad. It is supposed to be funny and it is but the director didn't know what the hell he was doing with the script. The movie is about a young woman who takes an undercover job and has to go to a bar to meet her man.  When she arrives she gets into an argument with the bartender and tries to get him fired. The woman has a boyfriend so the movie ends up with a lot of "who wants to screw that chick?".  When the woman's boyfriend comes out of the bar he asks her how her date went.  He wants to buy her a drink and she doesn't want to give it to him and she gets all defensive.   The woman asks her "boyfriend" if he was looking for a relationship.  The guy says "yeah he was but he was a lot older and he wasn't my type."  The girl goes on and on about how she is a virgin and that she is "not ready to go out".  The "boy" tells her that his mother told him that she would marry him and it has worked out.  So she agrees to go with him to the bar.  During the movie the woman is seen taking a drink while the guy and his mom are there talking to her boyfriend.  After he leaves they start fighting.  Her boyfriend then tells her "I don't want you to take this guy any more".  So he grabs her by the hair and tries pulling her down to the ground.  Then he grabs the waitress (a friend of the guy) and throws her around the bar a couple of times before he puts the bottle over her head and starts choking her.  She was trying to break free and when the guy's girlfriend came to help the man grabbed her again and began choking her as well.    When they finally leave the guy starts beating her with the bottle.   "That's what I want..."  They get to the police station and the guy says, "I had sex with her...and I'm sorry".  What a fucking asshole.  A lot of people will say that the girl was in a bad state and could have been saved if she had been in a better state.  What kind of man goes through a bar fight and then beats his girlfriend in the back room.  I think I'd rather drink
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had been to the film festival in New York and wanted to see this, but it was not shown there. I drove to the Toronto Film Festival and saw this. I liked the film, but I think this is a bad version. I really didn't feel anything for the lead character, and I don't think there was any chemistry.   A good movie would have been a great story about a young man who is trying to make his way in the world. The movie was about a guy trying to become successful and find someone special. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most fun I had in an Indiana Jones movie.   As for the Indy sequences I don't remember them being particularly good, but it's just a different kind of Indiana Jones. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you want a great comedy with a plot that involves a guy with a gun, don't pick this one up. If you don't mind watching a bunch of jokes in a movie you'll watch a few times in a row, then watch it again.   This is one of those bad movies that has it's good parts. If your looking for a good laugh or a great film with a decent plot, then by all means pick this up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen this on TV as a horror film and thought it was ok. I watched it on VHS and it is still scary. But I can't believe the people in this movie and it still doesn't make any sense that they go to all this trouble to make a movie that is supposed to be scary but is really not. It is like a movie made by people who have never seen a horror movie. If you like a lot of gore and blood you will like this movie but if you don't like gore or if you have heard a horror story you never heard before and you want to see some people get hurt you might not like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The most disappointing movie of the year! It sucks so bad that you want to throw it against a wall so you don't have to look at it anymore! I felt like this was not a movie made to entertain a crowd and was made for the low budget that it was made on. What was the point of this film, you can go see a movie with a great cast and not be so bored? This is so sad! The actors were not there, the director was no great director. This was a cheap movie. There was nothing of value about this film. You should think of that before you go to see this crap. It would be better to watch it on your couch with the sound turned up. Why would you waste your time on this rubbish."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think that anyone in their right mind could enjoy this movie. The script is very poorly written and poorly acted. I've never seen anything so dull, so stupid, so cheesy, so offensive. The acting is horrendous. There is no charisma or talent whatsoever. It all comes from Michael Douglas and the cast. The movie never makes sense. I can't see why the actors had to be paid so much money. There were plenty of other actors who could have easily been cast in the role. I think this was made by a small group of people who knew how to get their names in front of the cameras.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie a long time ago on a cable TV movie channel called movie channel and it was called "Mommie Dearest" or something along that line.   There are some good actors in this movie, like Peter Horton and a guy named James Earl Jones who plays a bad guy.  The story isn't bad at all.  As for the acting, it's not very good.  A guy that goes by the name "J.S." makes a lot of bad decisions, but the director, John Waters, really didn't have any talent at all for acting.  But the story is really good.   I think the main character is really, really messed up.  It takes about 2 and a half hours to watch this movie.  I was really surprised to see that John Waters and the other guys were trying to make a good movie here, but they just couldn't get it together.  There's lots of violence, sexual references, and nudity.  So it's kinda like an adult version of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star."  I just think that this movie wasn't very well done.  If it were my son or my nephew who had seen this movie and hadn't understood it, I'd take it away from them and just tell them to stay away from the movies and the things they're showing on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If there was something about this film that I enjoyed, it was the idea of a woman being stalked by two men and then found dead. That idea is so bad that you'd think it was made for television. It's one of the most embarrassing attempts at a sex comedy ever made.    This is an absolute comedy-horror flick. The acting is terrible, and the entire film is ridiculous. The only good thing about it is the ending, which is very creepy and disturbing.  The only reason I gave this film a 3 out of 10 was that the acting was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors have no charisma, but the rest of the cast are all very good. It's a pity there was no director with experience in the horror genre.    I recommend it only for horror fans who don't care about acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're a fan of bad movies, you'll like this one, as it's so bad it's good. I saw it in a college film program and my only problem with it is that the actor who plays the guy who drives the car that is going over the cliff, was such a horrible actor that he could hardly act, and the girl who was in the car with him and her clothes were ripped was really ugly. I can't believe that this movie ever got made.   This is a true story, and I can tell you, it's not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not sure if this is meant to be a "bad" movie, or a "glorified slasher movie", but either way, it's a terrible experience for any of the people involved in it.  From beginning to end, there are no characters who get a chance to say anything besides some lame, "Oh, well", and "Don't be so sensitive".  It is very obvious that all of the actors were paid less than minimum wage for their roles, and at times you wonder what they were actually doing with their lives.  They are all in terrible shape, and it's obvious that the producers didn't give a damn about them at all.  There are also no acting credits given to any of these people, and they never even got to make a cameo in this awful movie.  It was all just a way for the producers to get paid, and most of them probably thought it was a good idea at the time, as they were getting a ton of money for their role.   This movie was not only awful, but also extremely dangerous.  At no point were there any actors who seemed to be in any real danger, and that is a very bad sign if you are going to portray a person as being in a very dangerous situation.  The gore and violence of this movie were disgusting, and for a slasher film, it really does nothing to keep the movie from being a truly disgusting movie.    The producers of this film wanted to make an ultra-violent, bloody, and gory slasher flick, and there was no one to make them feel uncomfortable at all during the entire production.  This is a movie that the only people who truly look like they were having fun are the kids, and you can tell that the actors didn't really have a ton to do, because they really didn't make much of an effort in the movie. This was made in less than one year, but they spent a lot of time and money on it, so they really should have gone the extra mile to make it look good.  One last thing to note, and this is important, this was a production that was filmed entirely on videotape, and the audio has a very cheap and cheap-looking quality to it. You will not be able to tell the actors' voices from the background noise, which is even more concerning than the lack of any acting credit.  My biggest disappointment from this film is that the producer,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is bad.  The story is bad, and the acting is bad. It is a complete disappointment to me.   I would not recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I was excited to see this movie, it was advertised as a thriller and I couldn't wait for the opening scene.   When the movie started, I was disappointed,  the entire movie was dull, the characters didn't even have enough development.  I thought the movie would have been better if the actors didn't have to talk for so long.  It was so boring.  "    I was so disappointed in this movie!  I guess you get what you pay for and for what it is, not much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a terrible movie. The acting is horrible, the plot is horrible and the special effects are bad. It is also a movie that is not made to make you want to watch it. I saw this movie about ten years ago and I have never seen the same movie since then.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie has all the things a good action movie should have: awesome fights, fast paced action, good dialogue, well done costumes, and a very good story line. The thing I disliked most about it were the characters:  It seems they tried hard to make the movie look like a Hollywood action movie but I just can't do it. The action was great but it was so over the top and over the place that the movie got to be very hard to watch for me. The actors did well as they were supposed to but they didn't do a very believable and believable version of the bad guy.  It is a very fast paced movie and the action was too fast paced for me but that isn't a bad thing, it's more of a plus to me than a bad.   I would give this movie 3 out of 5 stars if they had a little more money to spend on the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is no dialogue. We get a "camera in the desert" and a very very long shot of the sand moving along a sand dune.   The director is a very young lady who is not very experienced in films. Her script is not well written and is very poorly filmed.  The actors are very uninspired and their dialogue is not natural sounding at all.  This movie is boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In all honesty, I was really scared of this film.  As soon as I heard it was based on a true story (and was based off a true crime), I thought it was going to be a horror movie. I was right, it was not, and it was definitely not horror at all. I honestly thought I was going insane after seeing the film.   The film was really hard to watch.  It made me want to do whatever I could to get away from it, but I just kept watching.  I was so uncomfortable after watching it, that I wanted to throw up.  I'm not sure if this movie was written by a psychiatrist, or a crazy person who thought she was being true to her experiences, and went ahead and made a movie of it.  The thing that I think ruined it for me, was the acting.  Not even all the acting in the film was good, but the director should have at least included some great actors in it.  The actors in the movie were so out of character that it was hard to believe that they were in the same movie.    I really hope this film doesn't end up in the "cinema of the year" category.  The only good thing that happened to this movie, was a little bit of the creepy music that was in the trailer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a very bad movie. This film has nothing to do with the book and is poorly adapted. It is a waste of money and makes for a rather unpleasant watch.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not going to lie, this movie was disappointing. I'm sure many people thought it would be good, but it wasn't. I won't spoil anything, but the acting was awful, the story was dumb, and the music was awful. The only thing good about it was the actors, and I guess the rest of the movie was just filler. If you like movies with no substance, you might want to look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was so bad I never thought I'd like it.  The plot was not interesting, and the acting was really bad.  It seemed like a movie made by a group of high school kids.  Even the effects were not very good.  If you're into violence this is not the movie for you.  I can't see myself going to see this movie.   I recommend this film to anyone with no interest in seeing good acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found this movie funny but at times it was boring. I found it confusing and did not understand why they kept showing it over and over again. I hate watching a movie again and again and over and again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After being taken in by the hype, I was very disappointed. This was just a bad adaptation of a great book. The acting was bad, and the book's storyline was never even mentioned. The plot was not as interesting as the book, and most of it was unnecessary, and unnecessary scenes that added nothing to the story.   I read the book and was fascinated. This adaptation is a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have never seen this movie before and I don't even remember anything from the plot. This movie has a great movie star. All the scenes were filmed very poorly. I don`t even know what happened. He doesn`t look like he has any acting talent. If this movie was on television it would be on a channel like `WWE` I guess. It was so bad I want to throw it into a waste basket and throw it in the ocean.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember reading an article back in the 90's where the director of this movie (Robert Hickel) stated that he never shot a negative of the original version of this film, he was convinced that he would be ruined if he did, so he decided to remake it all using the same actors that appeared in the original. Well, this did not work out that well, because Robert Hicke's vision was way too different from the original movie and this remake just got lost in the shuffle.   And then we get to the plot, where the movie starts off about a group of people (the group is called "The Family"), all of whom are mentally disturbed and are all in the same hospital. The group consists of an older man that was once a child soldier for the SS, a man that has had his arm bitten off by a vampire (with one of his own children as a "child" soldier), a woman who was a prostitute and a woman that was a witch that has been cursed by a man. The only member of the group that seems to not be mentally disturbed is the woman that has lost her family, but then she meets a man named Ed. And they both decide to do some kind of "magic" that will bring back their family and get rid of the man who was responsible for killing them all.  Unfortunately the movie ends up being kind of silly and does not go anywhere in the end.  There is not much in the way of action or comedy and the pacing just slows down as the plot progresses.  And I have to say, that Robert Hichlke did a very good job of directing the movie. I know that he took a great deal of flak for the first movie, but this movie actually showed some promise as it had some good action scenes.  I would love to see a remake, but I think that they made a terrible mistake in the first place and just wanted to capitalize on the success of the first one and make a cheap hit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So the movie is bad. And yet I have seen better movies and I am going to watch a good movie so I can go to sleep and forget about this movie.   I can say that the movie did not really get better.  At first I thought it was going to be a bad sequel to the movie but it was worse because it was not good at all.  I guess this movie was trying to be more of an action movie than an action film.  It is not a movie you watch in order to see something amazing.  You go to see a movie because it is funny and a story.  But even though this movie did a poor job of telling a story and acting it out, it was still good to go see.  And to think the main character was a poor one.  When I first saw this movie, I thought he was going for a bigger role than he got.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only "good" thing I can say about this movie is how good the actors are. Everyone is pretty good at their jobs and the one who should get the credit is the one in the wheelchair. The only person I could think of who should not have played him was Chris Sarandon. It is a bit too late to change that and I am sure it will never happen. I will have to wait for a new movie to get Sarandon back in the role. The director was so busy and he couldn't use his "big" stars.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie on a late night HBO show. I didn't like it as much as other people, but it was still fun to watch.   A little too long for me and there wasn't any great moments. The plot is not very clever, the acting is not that good. It's all about the character work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There were parts in this film that were very interesting but were poorly executed. The acting was all over the place, with some actors playing two or three different roles. The music was boring and the story was uninteresting.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a terrible movie that I was not ready for, but my wife loved it. My dad and I were very bored for a couple of hours and this movie provided us with some entertainment. I did not like the plot, or the acting at all. The only reason that I loved this movie is because it had a funny ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible. The acting was very amateurish. The script was terrible. It's a complete waste of everyone's time. It never was funny at all. The director didn't seem to care about what was being said, just making it up as he went along. The writing, with some good jokes sprinkled in, would have made a better movie than this.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm a huge fan of Robert Altman, so when this movie came out, I was so excited. I love his filmography and I'm glad to have seen this one.   The film is really pretty good, and a lot of the movie I've seen in the past is just not as good as this one is.  It's pretty much a thriller, but the script and acting is so much better.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes Robert Altmans work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to the theater for a midnight screening of The Room on a Friday night. I was completely unimpressed. The whole time I thought this was a total waste of time, and I had no problem finding a way to watch it on cable. What I don't understand is why it never got a theatrical release, or a DVD release, nor did the DVD have any supplemental features. The movie looked horrible and the sound was awful. The actors had no chemistry, and the actors did not know how to act. There was not even enough comedy to make me laugh. I have seen worse movies, but not like this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is pretty great.  I love the movie and I really like the ending. The movie is kind of cheesy and very over the top, but that is not a bad thing.   My only issue is the pacing of the movie.  It is about 30-45 minutes long and the actors are doing their best. I really liked the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best part of this movie is the movie itself, the characters, the music and the overall attitude of the movie. All of these things are good, but the acting was horrible and the dialogues were not that great.   This movie could be a great action movie if it was made more than five years ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie that is not really good. The music is not very good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible, just a terrible, horrible movie.   The story is ridiculous and not really worth reading through.  I was not going to watch this movie because I was disgusted by the terrible acting and the terrible story line.  The actors were all out of their minds.  If you are looking for a good movie to watch with some friends this is not it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film has no plot, and is just a huge, boring, stupid movie. This movie should be called, "the worst movie ever made".   It just feels like something you would see in a video game.   It has all the same problems you would have with a game, just without any strategy.  What is the point of making a movie, where every scene is just... a long, boring scene.  This is just another big, dumb, pointless, useless movie.  It took me forever to actually get this movie. It is over-rated, and just kind of feels wrong to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I saw this I thought it was going to be one of those movies that was just for the fans but I didn't get a kick out of it and I think it's not for everyone.   This movie is so badly made it's amazing how they can make a movie that's so bad that it has so much of that cheesy bad movie feel to it.  The script is so bad it's actually unbelievable that they got it made.  And then of course it was made in the 90's so they had the chance to make it a little better and they just made it worse.  I'm pretty sure you wouldn't want to be in the front row for this movie because I don't think the actors are that good.  This is a movie where you'll be rolling your eyes at all the stupid lines that are spoken.  It's a bad film for a bunch of reasons but mostly because they put the wrong actors in the wrong roles and I don 't think they did a very good job of casting.  So it's a sad film with a terrible script and a bunch more bad acting.  What's worse is it's also very boring.  You'll never get a good laugh out of this movie and it has a few good scenes but it's just all terrible.  Even the movie title is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors were so bad they were barely good enough to be funny. I mean, they are supposed to be professionals, so why can't they act more professional? The writing was awful too. It was so bad, you can just imagine the actors in the movie with a bad case of the hiccups. I have seen many bad movies, but this one takes the cake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was just wanting to see this for the first time in a long time, and now that it's over, I regret it. It's a very boring movie. The main character was not bad, but it was not very interesting. The movie was full of errors, it was written by the same person (the same writer), but they both don't know how to write. It doesn't matter that the movie has terrible acting, it has a bad story, and terrible acting. The acting, in the original French version, was much better than the movie, but the bad acting is still there. It made the movie horrible. Also, there was a stupid scene where the villain and the protagonist are having sex in a swimming pool, and the villains character is swimming next to the protagonist. It was so dumb, it made me feel bad for the hero. I don't recommend this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not worth watching and I never will. It's just a poorly made, boring movie, with the voice acting being really bad and the acting being bad in general. I had no patience with this movie.   The cinematography is all over the place, the lighting is terrible, and the camerawork and editing are all over-the-place. The entire time, it's just being shown off to a very slow-paced, very boring film.  I don't understand why someone would make this movie unless they were trying to be "sloppy" like something like "The Godfather" and then "a little cheesy" like "Apocalypse Now" and have the characters be totally oblivious to it all.  It just makes no sense.  If you are gonna watch a poorly-made movie that has a completely incompetent acting-team and a complete lack of any effort or talent on the part of the director, why bother?   All of the characters have to have been ripped-off from some kind of horror movie that I remember seeing when I was younger.  The only character that stands out to me is the one guy in the movie who is just an idiot.  They just can't get it done!  There is nothing in this movie that is original or even funny.  This movie makes absolutely no sense and I could not make heads or tails of it.  There are too many shots in this film that just look terrible and look like they were filmed in the 70's.  Even the soundtrack just sounds bad, if you really listened to it. I just don't get how a movie like this could ever have gotten made, because the acting-teams don't even look like a "movie" casting people from "Scream".  This film is just boring, but it just kind of makes you feel bad for laughing at it because you know it's so boring and bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst   and it's a shame because it looked so great in the movie trailer. I love movies, but this one was a joke! It's an absolute disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is really bad. I think the director thought his "drama" was so much more interesting and compelling than what he was actually showing. The acting was terrible. The camera work was terrible, the setting was terrible and everything about the script was just terrible.   The one thing this movie did have going for it was that it had a really good soundtrack. It also had a cool look to it, but you were really only shown that in the beginning of the movie. I guess what I would say is that it was probably better to watch it if you are a fan of the original movie, and that is not going to be my case at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So if you want a good laugh or some good dialogue then this movie is for you! But this is a movie that needs to be watched with the sound off or else you can tell that it is edited very badly. If you don't know what you are looking at you can easily get fooled into thinking that it was done by some poor college student in his dorm room. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was not a huge fan of this movie. First of all it seemed to be a poorly made commercial for a new movie, and it really didn't seem to have much to do with the real story of the movie.   It was just a cheesy parody movie about a young girl who gets kidnapped by a crazy man and kept in his basement.  The girls costumes were terrible, the sound effects were awful, the effects of the monster being shot out of the basement were ridiculous and it was really cheesy and rushed.  My favorite part of the whole movie was the young girl's dialogue.  If it was not for her annoying and cheesy dialogue, this movie would have gotten a much higher rating.  I really wish I had gone with my friends and seen this movie a couple of times to get my old memories of a cool movie out of my mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is so stupid and so bad. The way they went about making it is pretty laughable. There were so many different actors in the movie and they all had to perform in many different scenes. The only reason this movie got any good reviews is because of its cast but they did nothing with their talent.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending is so cheesy. It would have been great if it was a more classic movie but it didn't work out.   This is the third movie I've seen by David Cronenberg.  The other two being Perverted and Perversion of Nancy.   I found these movies pretty entertaining.  I don't know if it's his style or if it is the way he films it.  He does seem to get more interested in the sexual aspect of the movies, it's more involved than he has been in the past, and he is great at depicting it.    Perverted is a very interesting movie.  In it, a man is having a rough time with a woman who is a stripper.  It's very different from any other movie Cronenberg has done.  This movie also contains a great soundtrack. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know why they are trying to make a "new" version of this movie. It's awful.   If you like black and white horror, get this!   It looks like the guys who made the black and whites of some of the '50s giallo movies did the same for this. It isn't even funny.  If your looking for a good "blaxploitation" movie with some blood and a good story, you might find it here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie with my brother and we thought it was just awful. The story was terrible, the acting was not good at all, the camera wasn't in the right places, the sound was terrible in some scenes and the music was horrible. And to top it off there were no good performances either.   This movie ruined my summer vacation. I will never see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing this movie is good for is as a joke.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie when it was first released in the late 70's or early 80's and I never had any expectations. I had heard that the director was a good actor but not a good director and so I was really not sure what to expect. What I got was a crappy, old school, 2-reel, low budget, low production value, poorly made horror film. I really thought that I was getting the first half of a sequel to The Uninvited (which was also produced by the same guy) and then the credits rolled. What the crap! I don't need any of this horror crap...just leave it to someone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie at a local theater and thought it was going to be great. The movie does not live up to the hype. The plot is not as good as it sounds and there are no memorable characters. The acting is all over the place and it is hard to follow the story. There are a lot of characters and they do not come together for any real reason.   It is hard for me to give this movie any stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I enjoyed the movie but for some reason I can't say why I wanted to like it. I liked the actors and the writing was a lot of fun to watch. If you like good actors and have an imagination that goes all out, watch this one. It's a good time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie! This was my first time watching this movie and it is very disappointing. The main character is portrayed very poorly. He has an ugly face and ugly body, and he is not attractive at all. The rest of the cast are horrible. They are all horrible! None of them can act properly and have no emotion at all!   They are also very rude to everyone they meet and I have seen worse movies.   I have also never seen anyone like this in real life. I guess they wanted to make a very bad movie for the movie making money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I've ever seen.   A woman was driving down the road, and a couple of guys who were drunk and out of control were trying to run her off the road. She was able to take them out of the road and get away with her life, but that was about it.  No respect for women, no respect for the police, and no respect whatsoever for life.  The acting was absolutely horrendous. It was like someone took a drunk woman and put her in a horror movie.  I can't imagine anyone making a movie like this, and I've seen many horror films.  This movie is the epitome of why women shouldn't get involved with this sort of thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A horrible movie. I don't know what the makers expected when they made this movie. A really bad movie.   I am a bit confused by all the violence, sexual content, and the story is too simple.  I never understood why these people thought it would be a good idea to make this film.  One of the more annoying things about this movie is the narrator.  The voice over guy seems to be saying everything the producers wanted to say, and he has no idea what the movie is supposed to be about.  There was no tension, no real story to the movie, and when there is no story and no tension in a movie, the violence is almost inevitable.  This movie is like a bunch of crazed people coming together in a parking lot.  A movie like this is supposed for a single-serving audience, not for a wide audience.  No one should ever watch this film in the first place.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's always nice when you find an old movie you've never seen.  It's a little sad, too.  My only disappointment is that we never find out where his girlfriend is.  That would have made a much better story.  I remember him saying that she's in the Midwest.   There's a scene in the movie where he tells the story of his first date with her.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved this movie. The storyline is really good and the acting is great. The character development is very good as well and you feel real sympathy for them all. This movie is a really good story about the consequences of war and the emotions that go with it.   It is only 3 1/2 hours long so if you are into war films, I think you will like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible flick, you'll probably find most of the actors in this movie have no personality. No actors are original, they are the typical cast from the 70's and 80's.   I think this movie is the worst of the bad movies from the 80's, not only is it bad but it makes me feel sick. It was only meant for cheap laughs and I couldn't find it in me to laugh in any way, not even in the trailer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed by this movie. The acting is terrible. I am not kidding. The plot doesn't make sense. The story is just bad. I guess the director wanted a movie where he could get into character and act out.    The movie is about a man, Bob, who is obsessed with his new wife. However, he has always been a bit on the needy side and now his wife is a stripper. They end up going to a strip club together and Bob ends up giving her a lap dance. When she doesn't respond, he decides to go to his parents and they both have sex with each other. When they go back to the motel room, they're both shocked to see that each of them are covered with blood. The next day, Bob's father tells him that his mother has been raped. It seems as though she was unconscious at the time, but the police have already ruled her death an accident. So, Bob and his parents decide to go back and investigate. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story isn't that bad. I'm sure there are others that will like it.   I enjoyed the movie but there is a lot of cheesy acting and music in it. If it were to be edited out they wouldn't make the movie and there is enough cheesy acting in it to warrant an Academy Award for the Academy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The picture was so bad, it was really hard to look at. The actors were really bad. I really hated the director, he just wanted to make money. This is one of those movies that I have to watch again and again just to see the actors.   I had really high hopes for this movie and it was just awful!   Don't waste your time with this movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    -   It's a good movie, and it gets better the more you see it, but it is not a good film. It has a great story, but the acting is horrible.   The acting is really bad in this film. The people who are doing the acting were never a good enough cast to act believably. The only decent actors in the film are the guy in the wheelchair and the wife who goes into the room with her husband and son. They were never going to be good enough to act convincingly as real people. The writing and acting was never good enough, and this is the final product of a poor script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first two movies in this series (which are actually pretty good) don't do anything to set this franchise apart from other action movies. I guess it could be entertaining but the third movie tries to do the same thing as the first two but ends up being completely awful.   I was disappointed by this as I was expecting something different. The plot was pretty simple and boring but the acting was pretty good and some of the action scenes are pretty cool.  The music is pretty annoying and the cinematography is pretty bad and you might see some of it in the background. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has all the bad parts of other films, so there isn't much to write here.   When we were filming, I thought that the crew was too cheap to get it right. They didn't even have a proper camera, and there was nothing in the car to film with. It was in such poor condition, it was not worth the extra few hundred dollars they spent on it.  I've never seen anything quite like this!  Hollywood was in the wrong! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It didn't start well.  There is something really off about this movie, it makes you feel as if you are watching someone else's work, a film that was originally in a different language, but somehow lost its connection to the language.   The acting is terrible.  The character names are silly, and the writing is sloppy.  I think the movie is more about what the movie's trying to convey, rather than its production and it does that poorly.  It takes a while for you to get used to the writing, and it seems as if the movie didn't know what the hell it was trying to say.  This movie does nothing but drag on.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is completely devoid of story lines. It just skips right over them. In fact, it makes no effort to even give you a reason for the character's actions. The director has no interest in making a movie about the real life events, and the actors are poorly cast.  The only people who work for a living seem to be a bunch of actors that are pretty terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I hate this movie so much. The acting is horrible, especially if you are watching it with a young kid. The only thing it really has going for it is the music, it does a great job of keeping it from being cheesy or annoying. And for that I have to give it credit. But for a serious movie this one is incredibly lame and you will find it as boring as a sack of potatoes. I had to force myself to watch it.   The cast is a bunch of people who are good enough to be on stage at a play but are not really movie stars. The worst part is that it seems as though the director just wanted to cash in on the craze of the horror genre. And since when has that ever worked, not with a great plot, good acting and great music. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As much as the first movie was a bit silly and was more fun for the viewers than the cast and crew, the 2nd movie, in which the cast has grown to be much older, is a real disappointment. The characters have become far less likable and their chemistry with each other is almost non-existent. The actors really seemed to be having fun playing the roles, but they seemed to think that they were in it for the money.   What is even sadder is that they seem to have forgotten how to act. They forget how to make jokes, they forget how important to get the shot right, they seem so out of sync when they are on location and they really just go through the motions. I just wish they would have stayed away from their early acting careers, and let us the fans watch some of their real acting skills. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is good. I got it for my sister for Christmas. It was funny at times. Not every frame is like it should be. The characters and actors were good. The music was okay. The ending was a little off but I didn't mind. It is a family movie with the characters in the middle of a divorce. Some scenes are very well done but there are a lot of bad jokes. The dialogue wasn't bad but it doesn't make up for the bad acting and bad acting leads to bad laughs.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very dull, boring and uneventful movie, I've watched similar movies, but it's the only movie like this   You get nothing, nothing to look forward to, nothing will give you an hour of fun.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst thing you will ever see in your entire life.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story of this film was amazing. I loved the way the two different characters had different personalities. I even found it interesting to watch the "good" characters act different, and the "bad" characters who are not that well versed with the world they live in.   I did not find the acting that good though, and that is only because they were filming in a small town. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very generic action movie. A movie that's good for nothing except as a cheap distraction for your children, or for when you want a good, old-fashioned, run-and-gun.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is no real reason why the movie is so bad. It's the only movie I've seen that I couldn't give a "2" out of 5 (except for one) because of the acting. The whole movie is really bad, from the acting to the story.   The only good thing about this movie is the "filler" scenes between the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't even know how the producers would have come up with this film. There is not one good thing about this film, and that is saying a lot, because it has about a billion horrible things that could be said about this movie. I have no idea why a writer and director would attempt to make a comedy out of a piece of trash, but it is bad enough that even I want to trash this film as much as my wife and children do. The story is very bad, and the acting is atrocious, even for a movie directed by John Landis. And I don`t just mean the acting. There are moments where the director is not even trying to be funny, but instead is just going for the cheap laughs. The effects are bad, as well, especially when they are used to show the horrible effects that the actors have when they shoot the bullets from their guns. There`s even one scene where the guns are held by four different actors, who are supposed to be in different parts of the movie, but all of them shoot the same shot, the same moment, with the same gun, and it looks like they were all just taking a bathroom break while all the other actors were shooting.    This is a movie that is only good for bad laughs, and even then I am only going to laugh about 5 minutes out of every 5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After watching this movie twice I had to turn it off.  After I saw the movie once and was a fan of the cast I had so many questions, so many unanswered questions. So many plot holes, so much needless drama, so often times there were no lines of dialogue.   It seemed like a poorly written movie to me.  There was never really any payoff to the story.  The characters, both the main and supporting actors were not that good at portraying the characters we wanted to see.  It just seemed like it was so rushed and the director tried to cover the problems and just make the movie more "frightening"   I think people need to know if you don't like horror and thriller films, this one probably is not for you.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't even bother going into the movie to watch because I had seen all the horror movies and the acting was atrocious.    The worst part about this movie is how many people go into it and have to leave because it is so bad.  And the actors are all so terrible.  One woman has a fake accent and she doesn't know how to act. The movie itself was bad so I gave it a 3 out of 10  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I hate the movie.   It was the worst movie I have ever seen.  There was no story, no acting, no story line.  No dialogue.  I think it was like a TV movie from the 70's.  It all was done with a lot of jump cuts and weird editing.  And it had this weird guy who looked like the devil who was just standing there and talking.  Just weird.  The acting was just so bad.  None of the people in the movie had any real acting ability at all.  These people were just there.  Not a single one of them had any emotions.  They were just sitting there. They weren't trying to act, and I don't think they knew what they were trying to do.  So, just horrible acting.  How could anyone in their right mind come up with this movie?  The whole movie was just boring and it was just the same 3 people in it for the whole thing.  In the end, it didn't make any sense, and it really took me out of the movie I just spent $35 to see.  Even after watching it I was wondering if I was even watching a real movie.     So bad, it makes me sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story starts off as one of the most boring movies I've seen. The main character, a police officer who was a witness in a crime but has never been interviewed, is talking about the crime while eating his favorite meal. The conversation takes on an interesting twist when his former boss walks into the room and starts talking about a new project. That's when the story changes to the point where he gets pulled out of his thoughts and decides to investigate the crime. Once he does, it is clear the story has gone off the rails. There are so many loose ends and weirdly coincidences that I couldn't finish watching it. I was bored for almost half the time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So, the movie is a bit long. There is no good way to explain this. At least the ending was a bit interesting and a few nice moments were left out.   It is just about a boy and his pet pig and their family. So, it is a little boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film was a great comedy. The cast was great and the humor was funny and well directed. There was no plot to speak of, which allowed for the fun of the actors. However, it had some annoying and lame lines and a plot that was never explained.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was not going to watch this film, but my friends told me that this was "the best movie ever made." I have never seen it, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But the people who put this together are pretty cool. It is funny, scary, and suspenseful. It would be worth seeing for fans of the film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was pretty funny at first. I thought it was pretty good, but then it started getting boring, and I couldn't really enjoy it for the rest of the movie. The characters were pretty lame and the action scenes were pretty pathetic.   I think the best way to describe it is a "chunk of meat" - nothing to look forward to, nothing interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did not understand how one can be a good actor. I mean, he seems to have charisma and acting talent. I have not seen it, but I am pretty sure that it was a bad film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie in a little movie theatre in San Bernardino, CA. It was a nice experience. I didn't know anything about the movie and I had a great time watching it. It's not my favorite, but it wasn't bad. It has a nice slow pace. I guess they used a lot of effects, but the effects are not worth it. The performances were ok. I don't know why this movie is so bad. The dialogue is cheesy and it's really hard to take it seriously.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My mother is a huge Star Wars fan and I had heard about her wanting a "Star Wars" movie to show her grandchildren. I remember a Star Wars movie being so bad I could not even picture it in my head. It was bad enough my dad was going to buy it on VHS from Blockbuster in our neighborhood.   I think that it was just the fact they didn't have a great script and that some of the characters just seemed like caricatures.  This was just a bad attempt to cash in on the Star Wars craze and I do not understand why George Lucas would want to work with that bunch of scum.  I saw this movie as a child and I am glad that I did, but I do feel that it might have been better if they had just put the actors on a stage and let them improvise. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad movie was bad. The actors never looked like they had any experience at all, or if they had it was in a one-room schoolhouse. The directing was terrible and the acting was bad for them to look like they were in high school as well. The acting was all over the place and not in a good way either. The way it was filmed looked terrible as well with lots of grain, and the camera angle looked bad as well, especially when they were shooting from above, but they didn't bother to correct it, so the end result is even worse. The only reason it was bad was because it is so bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen this movie twice, and was not impressed with the movie once. It was the same old story, same old acting.   The only thing that could have made the movie better would have been to have some decent acting by the cast, especially those who played the older kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is very short and the director didn't really put any effort into it. The acting is very poor and the story is too contrived to work.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is terrible.   A group of boys (the good guys, in my opinion) have to make a getaway for the safety of the girls.  They have to fight off alligators, get in a car and drive around alligators.  A little girl gets eaten by a gator.  It looks like they just picked this movie up from a video store, with no plot and a poor acting ability.  This movie is supposed to be a "kids movie".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film should not exist. There is no story, no acting, no plot, and no character development. The plot is so contrived and lame, that it really is just a glorified advertisement for a film. It is so bad that even one of the worst Hollywood films of the 1980's, "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," could have been made for the same amount of money and with much better production values.    In addition, the production values are really not very good. In one scene, the main actors are in full makeup, in another they are in costume, and in yet another they wear only panties.  The soundtrack, while not horrible, does not help the film either.  It is about as bad as they could get it, with only one scene being edited together (and this is just one part of an entire movie) and even that scene is not well acted or well produced.  I have seen better films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie in theaters. I was very disappointed with this movie, the acting was terrible and the story line is very bad.   This movie was so much better in the 90's when they made it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I ever saw.  This is the worst movie ever. I loved the cast and all. I am so bummed out that they wasted the opportunity. It could have been a good flick. This movie is so cheesy, you'll be laughing the whole time. I can not believe that this flick is still being made.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was not a fan of this movie at all. I was so bored after watching it.   The only thing I enjoyed about it was the music.  I don't remember the name of the music, but it seemed to be a dance tune. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     If you like:  The acting, the story, the costumes, the music.  This is not a movie I would have seen before or after I went to college.   These are all things I enjoy in films and these are things the director is good at.  I love that the actors were real people, but the story is lame.  It was like watching a kid who is not that good at acting with someone who is better than them.  They played their parts, and I really think it was meant to be, but they don't make bad movies any more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so poorly made and so uninteresting. The whole film is set in a mall and takes place in 2 days. So the whole mall is a big, boring building. The movie has nothing to do with shopping, and the mall is just a backdrop for the film. The actors are terrible and the plot is very confusing. The music is bad, and there is a very bad movie about to be released.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My favorite movies are the ones that just make me laugh. This movie does it wrong.   I thought this movie was going to be a funny take on "Dirty Harry". I was not prepared.  The dialogue is always off putting. This is the worst "Door to Door Man" movie ever.    It takes 10 minutes for the cops to find the killer. Why? What is wrong with the guy in this movie? Why is his wife waiting for her son to arrive? Is it so easy to kill off the wife?    The actor playing the bad guy is really annoying. The one that I most hated was the one playing the "evil doctor". The movie took him way too seriously. I thought the only reason he was in this film was to act like he was evil and make the movie seem more fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not a big fan of slasher movies but this is a pretty bad one. The special effects are awful and the film does not look very convincing.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting was just horrible.   This movie had a terrible script.  It just never got any good acting to work with.  A few people like Paul Dano and Robert De Niro were really good and the rest were pretty forgettable.  The worst one was the movie's lead, and in my opinion she could have been a better lead than that other lead.  If you want some acting this movie might be worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was a complete waste of time. The film takes a classic novel, but does not give any respect to the source material. The screenplay is a total mess and there is no logic to the story. There is a "real" story that involves a man who becomes a werewolf and his transformation takes place in a secluded and remote cabin, but the acting was laughable.   As a were-wolf I was glad to have seen this movie, as I had seen it twice on TV.  A long time ago, it was a great idea to adapt a novel into a movie, but in today's market it would have been a huge box office failure.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is the worst I have ever seen.   In the beginning, there are a lot of shots of the moon and then a lot more of the earth. The shots are supposed to depict the size and shape of the Earth.  These shots are not the size or shape of anything except the Earth, but in fact, they depict an earth that has been completely destroyed. It is totally overgrown.  I have never seen a movie where the only shots are of the outside of the film. The only time you see the inside of the ship is at the very beginning.    The story is just bad.  It's really unbelievable how someone could ruin such a beautiful movie by using the wrong camera.  There are a few scenes that have nothing to do with the movie at all.  The only scene that is related to the movie is when a pilot goes into the ship to find something, and the whole time, the ship flies up and down on the moon.  That was really ridiculous.  You really have to wonder how he was supposed to know that the moon was not real.  No one would have known that there was no life on the earth if the moon wasn't there.  This is the most unbelievable movie I have seen in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am very sorry to say this movie has ruined my life.   The actors have no talent, the songs are terrible, the plot is horrible, and the directing is bad.  This movie should be called: " I had a dream last night ".   This is an extremely boring movie that has nothing to do with anything.  The main character is a very boring person who is not worth a second thought.  What was that joke?  He has a dream where his girlfriend died, but is never shown dying.  I mean he doesn't even wear a watch.  His dream is so bad that I could not believe what I was seeing.  He is so stupid and he is supposed to have been a good actor.  How did he get into a movie with such poor acting?   There is no point of interest at all in this movie.  If you want to see a movie that is actually interesting you should go see a bad romantic comedy.  My friends and I were all watching this movie and there was no way I could finish it.  Don't waste your time with this one!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen it a million times. It's always the same script. It always has some stupid shit in it. It never changes. The actor's faces never look real. They just go on and on about how they are great in the movie and I'm not going to be like that. I hate this movie and if I ever see another one I'm going to leave it on repeat on my xbox just so I don't see it. This movie has been in many other movies like The Best of the Fast and the Furious and these are only the ones that are funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very boring. I don't understand what people are saying.   I got a box of popcorn, two beers, and a bottle of whiskey to watch it. And it wasn't very good.  It was about some guy (I don't remember his name) who goes to a small town to do a TV show, but ends up being in the local big time crime ring. He's trying to convince the boss that he's going to save him and his people from a bad guy. The boss' son was there, and he's trying hard to turn the guy. Unfortunately, it never develops. The first act is the one where he goes to interview someone, then he's in the big time with some guy with a machine gun. I never saw what the machine gun was for.  This guy (who was about 25 years old at the time, and looks to me like an older guy) should have been on The X-Files, which would be far better.  The second act is almost as bad.  He's at the bar, drinking and telling some stories.  What a dumb movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was looking for a new film that took me back to my youth, and this did that and more.  It is a well made little movie that could have been much better if it had been made a few years earlier.   The story of "The Lost Highway" is not for everybody.  While it has a strong female lead and a fantastic cast, the movie can get a bit slow.  If you are looking for some fun action you can watch "Thunderball".   If I had more time for a movie I would have taken it out to the desert.  Unfortunately "The Missing Highway" was a lost cause. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've heard this movie multiple times, but I'm not sure if it's even remotely good.   The plot is bad enough, and the actors do no justice to their roles, but the story itself is so poor that it's hard to take it seriously.  I guess I wasn't expecting much from this movie, since it didn't really seem to have much going for it.  This is one of those movies where it seems like all the money was put into the making of the movie, so why the hell not?   This movie's only redeeming feature is that it features a song that you can listen to over and over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a ton of great ideas in this movie, including a great bit where the two detectives discuss the death of a fellow cop.  Unfortunately, the movie ends up being nothing more than a cheap rip off of The Rockford Files.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So for a movie of the month, I was really excited to see this movie. I've seen several videos and read the synopsis before but never expected to actually see the movie. And yes, it was a very bad movie. The acting was terrible, the storyline was dumb, the plot was just plain awful, and the plot thickened as the movie went on. The ending was so unbelievable that I thought to myself, "maybe this is what happens when you start a movie with a very lame premise and then don't end it with a good one. " It was so bad that even the people who wrote and directed the movie, did not try to salvage it. The director should be ashamed of himself. The actor who plays the cop really should have been fired for the performance he gave.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was okay, but I was hoping for a better movie than this. I loved the opening scene and it was great and suspenseful. But it was totally cheesy. You could easily be fooled into thinking that it was the movie of the movie when it really wasn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of my very favorite movies of all time!   I remember seeing this movie at a mall when I was young and being totally entertained by this movie. It was the first time I got to see a "pulp" movie and I was completely smitten. The story line was great, the actors were so talented, and the special effects were simply perfect.   A must see for anyone who loves pulp! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film was awful.  There was an actor who played a big bald guy with a beard and it looked like a real person.   This was at a time when all I saw on TV was comedies.  After watching this movie, I felt it would be much funnier with a man with a big beard.  I didn't see the film until years later and now I realize how dumb the whole thing was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie about the CIA and JFK is far more interesting than a movie about a failed attempt to assassinate JFK.   An interesting movie, but this does not deserve to be seen or reviewed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time I saw this film, I thought it was a bad joke about the people that have a bad idea, which is pretty funny. I laughed a few times and then laughed at how bad this idea was.   I'm glad that it was only in one movie, and the only reason it's even being remade is to help this movie stay relevant. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know if I'd want to see this movie again. It's not bad, but it's definitely not worth a watch. I don.t care to see it again. I'm just glad it's not on the Disney channel or in any theater I'd frequent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was a bit skeptical of this movie since there was a bad review for the same film, which made me curious if the reviews for this movie are legit.   There's something about this movie that just rubs me the wrong way.  I know I said I was going to give it a chance, but the movie is just so... bland, uninspired, and boring.  The only thing I could think of to keep this movie from being a complete failure would be if it could use some of its originality in a more original way. I don't know if I'll ever see another movie this bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I enjoyed this movie. I didn't care for the ending and thought the scene was lame.   The character development was poor.  I wanted to cry but I was in a movie, not in a hospital or prison.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think it is the worst movie i've seen in my whole life. I got it for my birthday and watched the trailer. I watched it with my mother and she was laughing her head off. This was the movie i wanted to do my homework on. But that wasnt the case.   It was all silly.  It has nothing to do with real life at all.  I dont even remember anything going on.  In all honesty the only reason I finished this movie was because i got to see my friend and he was so freaking funny he had me laughing.  This movie makes me so mad.  No one was trying to be funny. It was just the girls that was laughing their heads off.  If it was a REAL movie you would think someone would know how to act.  Maybe it was all just a big joke.  For real I hate movies like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was looking for a film to watch with my son, and I saw it at the local movie theater. It is a well made but bad movie. The actors in it are all in poor shape, and the director does not make a decent movie. It was made for TV, and there was no need for actors in poor health to make the actors look good. This movie was made a long time ago, and even a good movie, in my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a "great" movie. The director did an excellent job and got the plot right. Unfortunately, the acting and dialogue was atrocious and it really made the movie a total waste of time. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I've seen worse and better. The "gags" in the film were very poorly done. The characters looked very old and the plots were contrived.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is a combination of many things I have always loved about horror films.   What is also very interesting is the fact that even though the movie is shot in 3-D it still comes off as a 2-D movie.  The characters have no depth at all.  There are no actors in the film that are capable of doing a good job.  In a way, it's a shame because the director did such a good good job with all the special effects, but the acting is bad.  I love that the movie was shot in the 60's and 70's.  But if you are going to do a horror film you should at least do it in a good time period.  The music is great and the makeup is all good.  However, the acting in this movie is really bad. There are so many actors that are either totally unlikable or they don't even seem to do anything.  It is so sad that they decided to film this in the 70's and then shoot in 3D.  This is why people complain about "bad acting" in horror movies.  One of the actors in this film says in the beginning of the film " I think this is a horror movie for people that are ready to laugh."  It really is a shame that people still watch movies in the 30's and 40's with bad acting like this.  Also, I really liked the opening scene where it shows a man that is covered with a white sheet and is covered in blood.  He is completely hidden and it is hard to see him and this is how the story goes.  When he was put in a hospital and put into a trance, his mind was in a fog and he didn't know where he was.  After he went into the hospital and a nurse saw his face and he was like "oh, I am here".  That is a very interesting point.  If you watch this movie, make sure you see the opening sequence and it will change your view on this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I have seen. There were people talking to their families at the bar. The characters were not funny and they were not believable. I hated the actors and they did not seem like they were having fun. They could have not been so drunk. A bunch of people were playing games like tug of war, bridge, and hide and seek. It was so annoying to watch and it was very boring and there were very few laughs. There is no plot or direction so there was no way the film could have even gotten the money it was made for. If you watch this movie, get a drink somewhere else before it goes to DVD. It is a horrible movie that would not be worth watching to the end if you have no friends.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm no film buff.   In my younger days, I remember this movie being on TV quite a bit (the original show had a great cast) and my family and I would always get on the set just to watch it.  We loved it, it looked fantastic, and I still have my VHS tapes from the 80s!   This movie has some good scenes (even if it was shot in one continuous take), but there are some scenes I've never seen before (e.g. a shot of John C. Reilly looking at the sky, while a car drives through the window) that are really boring.  There are some good actors in this movie, and the whole movie is set in the middle of the night.  I remember being on set and seeing a big fire outside the hotel.  This was one of the few movies that I didn't realize how much I missed when I saw it on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's okay.   I would not recommend this to anyone.    I mean, it has an interesting plot, and there are some really good acting moments.  But as far as this movie goes, it's just an old movie, and a bad one at that.  The story is predictable, the acting is horrible, and the actors don't seem to want to be there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie twice but it has a long way to go. I've watched this movie like 3 times and my opinion hasn't changed.  The movie is about a woman who loves her husband very much and she's not looking for her husband to do anything bad.  When the wife was in her 20s her husband was cheating on her.  Then she married a guy who cheated on her after he got married.  There is no suspense in the movie but the wife is having to keep up her act so to speak so her husband won't be jealous.  This is the first movie I've heard of where the wife had a lot to do and yet she didn't try to do the things she shouldn't have. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was okay...not great or anything. The film was shot in the mid 60's and that's the first thing that was a problem, it was shot during a time when the government wasn't taking their citizens into care and that made it seem so far off. I don't know why they chose to go with that setting...it just didn't work.    A bunch of soldiers show up and start killing and some of the men are killed in a different scene...they never show the faces or names of those who were killed...it's very strange.  A couple of people die and then they go on with the killing...it gets repetitive and even some of them seem crazy and out of control...it got really bad and made me sick.  I'd never seen it and I don�t know why I even bothered to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am so glad this movie is done and the actors and actresses who have done it are still around and can still be found.   The plot is pathetic but I understand the idea behind it.  But the characters are completely unbelievable and the acting is terrible.  Even after all this I still think there are better movies out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was ok. I don't mind being disappointed in a movie but this movie is very boring, and there is not much going on. The characters are all very one dimensional, nothing happens in the movie.  The cinematography was fine but the acting in this movie was so bad I don`t want to watch it again.   The acting in these movies has gotten to be a joke. The best way to make a movie like this better is to cut it down to the essential elements and make the actors do their best.  Overall, I was disappointed with this movie, but that doesn`t mean it was a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this film multiple times, but I have never seen this one. There are several differences between this film and the earlier ones. The sound is more distinct and clearer, there is a much better lighting (I don't know how), the costumes are more glamorous and the story is more complete. This film shows much more of a real life experience. However, it is still not as exciting as the earlier movies. For example, in this one the police did not go in to the building to capture Mr. McAlister and his two companions, who were already in their vehicles, in the act of committing suicide. Instead, they were shot and killed as they came out of the building (and were never seen alive again). The police, who did not even know where McAlisters' body was, then arrested his father, who was also in the car with his son. These two men were taken in for questioning and were found to be the killers, although they had not committed suicide.   This film has two separate endings. I would have preferred to have seen the film with the second ending. The second ending showed that the men were innocent and were only trying to help McAlison. They did not know the body was that of his friend. They were actually trying to find the missing girl. The men should have been charged with the murder. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In this film we are given the story of a couple named Paul and Linda, who are on vacation when they run into a young couple (Toni Collette and Alan Arkin) who are playing on their boat in a little cove off the coast of the Dominican Republic. They're not happy about it, as the couple were being harassed by a gang of local kids, who were actually part of a larger plan that would have them all dead, but they were too scared to do anything about it. Then it turns out that the local kids are part of the drug smuggling operation that was running through the island, and that they are being set up by some shady guys in the local mafia. When the boat is spotted by a boat from an American ship, Paul and his wife get on board, along with a local boy, whom they are convinced is the killer. The American ship docks, and Paul and the boy run away into the night.   While this film might be entertaining, it's just not a good story. The acting in this film is really weak. Even Alan Arkins and the local boy are terrible. The plot doesn't work, either, and we're never really sure who's doing what in the film. I think it would have been better to cut the film into three parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought it was bad, but I was too busy laughing hysterically to be upset.    It was made by a guy who was just trying to make a buck out of some old shit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was very disappointed in this movie. First of all, I was looking forward to seeing this movie due to the reviews I've read about it. Then I was let down. The movie starts out with an interesting twist. We are about to see the world through the eyes of a guy that has lost everything. So when he witnesses something that he believes to be a miracle, he gets involved. But once his mind and heart have been changed, he doesn't have the heart to get back into it. There was too much lying in this film. It was too one-sided.   The main thing that kept me from watching this film was the ending. There is so much tension and the whole film seemed to be coming down in a big way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is bad. I can't tell what kind of movie this is. It's got a good concept and looks great but the acting is atrocious. I understand the concept and the characters but there was a lack of emotion, excitement, and passion that I found so disturbing.  A guy and his best friend in a high school cafeteria watching their favorite movie with their favorite friend in the background, just kind of sitting around and laughing and smiling.   It's like something out of a bad 80's teen movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a good movie with great acting. I got a "tweak-o-rama" movie, with actors who were trying too hard to be different from one another.   The plot was dull and confusing. There was lots of yelling and not much action.  I wanted to feel something for all the people in this movie, and not just be bored to death by it.  It had a "happy ending" that wasn't worth the wait for the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story has no sense, and when you finish the movie it is still hard to see how it was done.   This movie was produced by a low life and it is the only way he could have got any money.  The special effects were awful and the acting was horrible.  There were other movies with better acting and special effects, and I guess they would have made more money. However, they made one movie that looked like it was made for a low-budget porno.  This is what happens when a porno movie is made for low-income, no talent people and no one really has anything in mind, it doesn't mean it can't be good.  For this type of movie you need really bad acting, bad special effects and horrible special effects people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked this movie, but I'm not sure what the rating would be considering this was made for the sole purpose of getting a rating and money out of Paramount, which wasn't very successful with it. I thought the movie was pretty good, but it's pretty bad. I don't think that they really learned from the past. This movie was made to make money for a studio. The cast was all very inexperienced and some of them have never acted before. I think this movie was kind of a one-shot deal. It's all been done before and it just looked good on paper. This studio got their moneys worth and the results are not very good. This is not the best film from the classic "The Godfather" films, but, I think it's the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is garbage, and that's my opinion. Not much was worth watching, and all the characters seem to have some sort of problem with the people that they love. I didn't enjoy watching this at all.   It doesn't even have any originality. The plot was all over the place and really not that interesting. It seemed like they just picked the most "out there" type of plot and stuck with it to make it interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *WARNING* I highly advise that you do NOT watch this movie, since the plot does not make sense, the acting is terrible, and the action is horrendous. This movie is made in the late '70s and is a remake of a movie called "The Revenge of the Wild One". The movie is supposed to be about a wild and handsome cowboy named Wild Bill who has been turned into a dog by some Indians, but it really looks like the Wild Bill character is made up to look like the real Wild Bill. *WARNING 2* There is a scene where Wild Bill is supposed be the Wild Indian that killed a woman. But after that scene, the Wild Indians turn into Wild Bill, the real Indian, and then kill the Wild Buffalo. I thought the Wild Bills looked very real in the movie, like they were made out of rubber. However, I have seen people look real bad in other movies, so I did not worry about that. I did hope the filmmakers would have had a real actor playing the Buffalo, as this would have been a much better movie. *NOTES* - The cast is good, but the director really wanted to make a bad cowboy movie and he really got into the acting. - The only way to tell if the movie is really bad is if you take a look at the director's credits. He has a bunch of other movies listed under his name that are actually pretty good. - There is an amazing scene in this movie where Wild Bills (made out of real Indian skins) are chasing a horse, but then the buffalo, or Wild Bill (made of rubber), turns into him and runs away. It really is pretty incredible. - This movie really is based on the movie "The Wild One", which is one of my favorite movie, but I believe it was never filmed. The script for "The Buffalo's Revenge" is pretty much exactly like "The Westy's Revenge", so there is nothing new in it, either. - I really thought the scene in which the Wild Wild Buffalo character is supposed killed by the real Native Americans was pretty great. - Although it does not get any more realistic than this, there is an awesome scene where an Indian (who is supposed Wild Bill) tries to rape the Wild Cowgirl, but she turns the Indian into a buffalo, and he runs away because he is so scared. - All the Indians are really stiff. - When the Wild Ones get to a cow ranch, all the Wild
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie i ever saw. The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it was my first and the second one i saw was much better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film has not a good moment in it. It makes you think of a lot of things you should not think. And it makes you say things like: "Oh well, you must have been an interesting person. You must have really thought about your place in life." But that's not what is meant by "The End of Time".  The end of time, for many people, is something like: a few weeks or months or years of waiting until they find out what will happen to them. There is a real end to everything - even the universe itself, which I like to imagine is like a big, old, cold room with a big bed on top. A man sits at the end of the bed, and he holds a knife to his throat. His last words are something like "I'm ready, I'm ready."   But, as you will see from the story, the universe is not that cold room. The whole universe, as far as the people are concerned, is full of life, and is bursting with the desire to be reborn. People have been asking "Who is the one who will bring them back to life?" for thousands of years, and they keep waiting - waiting, in fact, forever.  The movie does try to give a nice picture of this world of "immortality" and the longing for eternal life, but it fails. It tries to give you a picture of a man who goes around searching for a key, and that picture is not very good.  When he finds one, he goes inside a castle. This castle is filled with strange and wonderful places - some of which you will soon see. But we never get to see what it's like in the inside of the castle, because the man never finds the key, even though he has spent hours looking for it.  But then the movie goes off into some crazy world of evil wizards, and of monsters that live in caves, and where they sleep forever. That's where the movie was really at fault. It tried to tell you a great many things. It talked about the life of a very long and interesting man in a very different time. It was the man who had the key. But the key didn't fit in the man's hand, and the man had to go to a far-off world to find it. And the movie gave a lot more than it gave away.   And, of course, you never get a good look
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad film. The acting is terrible. The special effects are horrendous. The music is really bad. The story is a total rip-off of the movie "Daredevil". The pacing is horrible. The action scenes are awful. The "daredevil" movie was great!   I have seen many people say this movie was not worth seeing, but to me, this movie is just horrible!  This movie made a complete mess out of "doomed" Matt Murdock!  The actors just suck!  There are just too many flaws in this film to warrant a watch.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie several years ago at a mall. The picture looked fine, and the actors and the music sounded fine. There was a lot of dancing in the mall, so I thought I would give this movie a try.   The movie was a good movie. The girls were good looking and there was a dance scene at the end of the movie.  When I saw the film, I thought it was a pretty good movie, and it was pretty funny.  After seeing this film, and seeing how good the movie is, I think it is worth seeing again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first few minutes I loved it, but then all the characters began to change and the movie got boring.   A movie this bad should never have been released, and when I saw a copy on a flea market for $7, it wasn't worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I got this movie for Christmas it got good reviews but nothing was going to put this movie in any way, shape or form on a high pedestal for me. It's not bad and it isn't too great, but it's nothing that I would recommend you watch.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think that this movie could be fun if it was a horror movie. But it is not. There is no real suspense, no real monsters, and no real ghosts. The only thing the movie has going for it is the actors in it, and the fact that the director was a good enough director to make a decent movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie, and I must say, it is a poor film and should have been shot and released in the 1920's. The music, scenery, and acting just didn't give me the emotional involvement I was looking for. The actress was quite good, but I think her personality was lost in the film because her personality would be much better on a stage, in an off-Broadway show. A good film, with good acting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only good thing about this movie is that the kids can actually move and react to the action.   It doesn't take long for the kids to get captured and the movie ends with some of them just getting killed, or just getting into a whole bunch of cars.  I was hoping for some more fun but it's a waste of a kid's time and they don't even seem to care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was totally sucked in by the storyline. I thought it was hilarious and entertaining but the story was totally unimportant. The director seems to be very poor and it really seemed as though he thought he had the movie nailed.   The film was a piece of crap and very poorly made. The acting was horrible and the story is completely nonsensical. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this film was one of the best out of the first two. It really showed you who the true leader of the mob was.   It was a great film but it was also a great example of how people can be manipulated and controlled and then how people react to it.  I love that this film is very dark.  It has some great actors in it. I remember my sister and I loved it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was in the mood for a good horror movie and this just didn't cut it. The acting was so bad, I really did feel like I was watching a really bad movie. The monsters were so cheesy and fake.    There was an older girl who was in love with a young man. Her dad would not let her see her lover because she was a virgin. After all this time they had been together, she didn't want to be with a virgin and her parents forced her to have sex with the guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the worst movie I've seen.   The acting is terrible.  Some characters are completely random and not even likable at all.  They try to make this movie believable for an audience who might think they know how a detective is like, but they are clearly not.  A cop can't be all emotionless and cool all the time and try to pretend like they're all so perfect and the guy who is an undercover agent is like a dumb boy.  You'd think a real detective would be very sarcastic and serious at the same time.  It's pathetic and makes me want to watch something like "The Hunt for Red October".   I don't like fake cop shows and movies in general, especially movies with fake actors.  My wife likes this movie because she thinks it's a real movie but she's wrong.  I wouldn't pay for a movie with actors like that.  Overall it is a bad film that only has the potential to be good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first half of the movie does not have enough substance to make up for the crap quality the entire movie is filled with.   This movie is an attempt to cash in on the popularity of the "Fast and Furious" franchise.  It just does not work, even with a decent script.  I gave this movie two out of five stars, as the movie was pretty bad overall, but there were good moments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie about what happens when a young boy accidentally leaves his gun in a locker in his school. The boy is so scared that he has to run for his life in the midst of an armed school lockdown. I think it would have been more of an interesting story if the main characters were a little more well known.   What is the problem with this movie?   It's not good.  The acting is bad.  They try to be scary, but nothing works.  What's with all the scenes of the boys and girls talking about the horrors of a school shooting and how they would not be so lucky in a real school shooting? The girls in this movie are all playing it cool, as if they are all too young to have a real nightmare like that one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was excited to see this and it was fun and entertaining. I really wanted to laugh but it was not funny at all. I think the humor could have been more subtle and I think that it was really meant to be a comedy. I thought it was a great idea and I was happy to see it. I would have preferred if it was funnier.     My Rating: 7 out of 10  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never saw this movie until last year. I loved the "Sterling Archer" movies. I also loved "Archer and the Cupid" and thought that he was very charismatic in those. This movie had nothing to do with either of those. I was disappointed and irritated at the ending and the acting. I thought the acting was terrible. I guess he was doing a "Renaissance man" kind of role and needed a more believable one. There were a lot of bad shots of the guy drinking a glass of wine and it was obvious that he had only one glass. At the end of the movie I thought it would end and he would pull a gun and shoot his boss. He wasn't going to do that and I thought that it was kind of weird that they ended that way. I would never watch that movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A little old, a little bad, a very bad movie.   You'd think this movie was a direct rip off of A Clockwork Orange.  It's a film by Stanley Kubrick, not Stanley Kubrick's film A Clockwork Green.  The plot is about a man who has an affair with his wife's friend.  She was a model.  He tells her that he has a gun, he is going to blow up the city.  I found this to be a very sad movie.   The man seems a bit crazy.   The ending of the film was great, the guy pulls the trigger, and the movie ends.  But it should be watched by mature audiences. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film that is a very boring one. Just like the rest of the films you will see in the cinema and then leave disappointed. A very low budget film with no substance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film should never have been made and it was.  In a movie of such an epic scope, where the plot is so grand, you would think a director would use every resource at their disposal.  The production was so bad, I almost felt sorry for the actor playing the lead role.  What happened was, the actor wanted more money and the producer went along with it.  For the rest of the film, the cast and crew were so lazy, and over the top, that the only way the film could have been any more unbelievable is if some of the actors had been in some other bad movies.   In the middle of the movie, it becomes clear the entire production has been sabotaged. The production cost so much, that they were never going to be able to pay the cast or crew.    It was a case of one bad director ruining a great movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie does nothing wrong it just does not live up to the hype that is out there. I've seen a lot of horror films and this one didn't stand out from the rest.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has very few redeeming qualities, and I don't remember anything funny about it.  The whole movie is just like a soap opera, with this woman and some other woman going from place to place, sometimes getting kidnapped, but that doesn't stop it from being a dumb joke.   What's worse is when she's doing it on television and they're going on a vacation to Africa, which makes me want to run screaming from the room.  For some reason, she makes up a whole "storyline" in the film which was actually just a TV movie that they watched in a hotel room. That's not funny, and when it got out on the Internet, people who were there didn't find it very funny.  It doesn't even have an ending which was very unfortunate.  I guess they thought it would be funny if she got kidnapped by a group of terrorists.  Why would you spend this much money on a movie and then make it look like a really bad TV show?  I never watched the movie again, and my dad gave it to me as a joke.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing about this movie is that we get to watch some really fun stunts, and I like the actors, but this movie had one of the worst plots ever, it just goes on forever! I am not sure why they thought this was such a good idea to make a movie about a man and a horse! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought it was a very weak movie that could have been improved upon by more effort put into it. I would only recommend it to those that hate or want to see a horror movie with very good makeup. I think it would have been better off as an original.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I did not think the ending was that great, it was very obvious that this movie was just used to boost a big movie.   This movie should be better than it is, it is just not as good as it should be, i think there should be a remake for this movie because it would be a great movie to make, there was too much going on for this to be made in 2 hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was so excited when this was announced, but I was disappointed with the film itself. This film is not interesting and does not take itself seriously.   The actors are either really bad or are trying too hard to be funny, which is a very difficult trick to pull off. I found a lot of the comedic parts to be forced, and I have no idea how the actors were able to act and act well at the same time.  I'm sorry but I can't give this film any more credit than zero. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie I have ever seen in my life! I was in the theater about an hour ago, the movie was about 9:00 pm, and I think it is a comedy. I started laughing when the character in the movie tried to give the girl a gift, and she didn't want any and said he had to give her money. The guy said "I don't want money" and she said "No, I want a nice car." I couldn't see any car in the store or from any angle, and all we could see were the top of her head and her hair. All I saw were her legs and her feet and her arms and her hands and my eyes kept rolling back. I couldn�t see any legs, so the girl wasn�t naked. She just had a towel over her head, and my eye rolled back. When she went up to a man and asked for a car he said "you can't buy a car, you need money." and she says to him "you don't have to give me money, I�m not a girl, I am 18". And then she says "I am a boy and I am an adult". When the guy goes to the woman and tells her to go up to the top, he says to the guy "I know, he's a guy, I mean he's wearing a dress, so it�s okay" and the guy says to her "I didn�t say anything about that". The guy doesn�t know this woman (the girl) is a girl (the character in this movie), and the woman says to this guy "What? I am a girl and I should get a man to show me what I want. That�s what I need a man for!" the guy asks the woman "Don�t you have a car?" and she doesn�T. So, I just started laughing because I was thinking "that�s really messed up. That really happened." It was totally screwed up! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had heard about this movie, but never watched it. It was a nice film, though. It had some of the same charm of the TV show.   It had a really funny ending to it, which didn't really do much for my enjoyment of it, but it was a funny ending all the same.  This is not a really good movie for teens, but I still enjoyed it. I hope that they are going to make an   Very odd. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So the first scene was just amazing and had me going to the movies! I remember in the beginning there was a guy who looks just like a young Bruce Wayne and he was being chased by bad guys in an old fashioned gas station. But the more they chased him the more the look in his eyes and he's become like a Batman-like character in a sense, and then in the second scene Bruce Wayne turns up and you see this older Batman on the scene too, looking cool, confident and cool. It was just the two of them in action and this was just such a great moment for me.   The story takes place on a farm in the middle of nowhere where a guy is trying to figure out how to get a car into the farm when it starts rolling down a hill and he ends up in a car crash. So he goes to a doctor who is very rude and doesn't know what to do. So the doctor looks at him as if he is a monster and he then goes to another doctor who seems to be sympathetic but has no idea what to say to him.  Unfortunately this doctor is a crackpot and he thinks that his patient is in pain and then he puts him in this pain and anxiety ward, which is a total mistake and I had no idea how he was going to deal with this kid.  So one day a kid comes in who doesn't look like he has any problems, but when he is brought into the ward he finds a strange creature with no ears in the corner of the room. This guy then goes into the patient's room and a man says to him 'what have you done to this boy?'  And the doctor just looks at this strange creature and says 'nothing'.  The doctor then tries to help this boy with his problems by putting him in a kind of trance which he then calls a sleep-state.  Then the boy wakes up and finds out that he is in the dream world and he has to fight this creature which has a big sword and is very evil and he can't see his way out of the maze.  But the doctor can't help him because he has been drugged and he is totally under its control.  One thing I thought was quite funny was that all the doctor did was give drugs, he didn't even give him any medicine!  The main villain is a guy called "the Green Monster" who lives in a cave underneath the farm and he drinks a green liquid which makes
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this on video and found the plot to be completely retarded. The whole premise of the film was that a guy wants to meet a woman that he met on an online forum and is able to meet her after he is able get on her computer. She claims to be a "computer programmer" and asks him to teach her a few things. He was supposed to meet up with her in New York, and when they did, the girl said she had a bad back and couldn't go on because she was in pain, then she left and disappeared. He gets desperate and sends her a text asking for help, and she tells him she just doesn't have the money to fly back to New York. She tells him to try and get on another computer to meet, then tells him that she will get a job if he finds her. The guy goes to another woman, and he meets her on the computer, then he has a conversation with her on there and finds out that they are connected and that she's in a position of power. Then she sends him a picture of herself, she's a model, and her photo shows her in a bikini. They do the same thing but on another woman's computer, and that woman sends him the picture of another woman who looks exactly like her. Finally the girl is arrested by the police and they track her down. After that, they get on the internet and find out that she lives in New Orleans. The girl says she is from a town called Pompano Beach, FL.   This whole thing was completely ridiculous. It was a long story, and the movie was filled with weird characters and all kinds of plot holes.  So the plot of this was that some guy meets a girl on an internet dating site and he does a lot of stuff to try to meet this girl. And then they end up having sex and stuff. And the girl has a lot to do in the beginning, then there is a car chase, then they have a fight, then this other chick runs out and runs into the water. And she ends up drowning.  The car chase is interesting, but it didn't last more than 30 minutes.  I could understand if the movie didn't want to spend too much time on the plot and the girl being arrested.  It is a long movie, but not very interesting.  And the ending was stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had to take my dad's car to a mechanic and my dad didn't have the money so I had the mechanic fix it. They fixed it and he said that there was a problem with it and they sent him a picture of it. I took the car to my grandma and I took it home and it had a dent in the hood. My dad went to the mechanic that fixed the car and he sent him pictures of the dent and he got angry. My grandma and the mechanic got into a fight. I called my dad and told him to leave the car here and that I'd fix it for him and he told me to go. I went back to the car mechanic and I told him that I don't know what happened but he still didn't leave the phone number or the pictures. I told the mechanic he needs to come and fix it, but he just laughed at me.   The movie was about a man trying to find his lost car. After he was told that the car was lost he tried to find it again and the pictures and pictures he got didn't look anything like it.  I thought this was the funniest movie I've ever seen.  The music and the story were so funny.  I loved it. This was a great comedy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think it's a good movie, I don't even watch horror movies anymore. There are worse movies out there but this one is on the same level as slasher flicks and the acting sucks and there are so many stupid plot holes it was ridiculous to watch. They should have stopped shooting the movie before the producers lost it.    The only good thing about this movie is that it was made by Wes Craven, not Kevin Smith.

I thought they were gonna be together, because they are so good together.   It would be great if the last one was a girl. They should do that in the next film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was so terrible and boring and boring. I felt like I was watching a bad TV show and the special effects were so awful and so poorly done. I can understand why it took 3 weeks for it to be released because of this bad rating and bad reviews. I was in my early twenties when I watched this so I know that it is not really that bad but I never ever saw this movie again and I was so disappointed in it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - The movie does have a bit of a "campy" feel, but that doesn't mean it is a bad flick. The acting is okay, and the director has a nice eye for setting up the setting, and a strong story.      - The film does have an interesting ending, which is good, but I don't think it's good enough to make the movie worth watching over and over again.  I found this film to be a decent film, but it didn't deliver on all it was meant to. I would still recommend it for those who really love good campy films, or for those with an eye for interesting, well made films.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie so much and watched it so many times but every time it kept getting better and better, that was why I gave it 4 stars.   At the time I found it quite scary but I must say that after several viewings I started to feel more comfortable in it, it was a better movie in every way.  I liked the concept and the way it was written.  And the music is amazing.  It doesn't come across in the picture, but it's in the actors' performances.  If you want to see something good that's scary but not scary scary then give it a try and don't let anyone else spoil your good time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved the idea of the film, but didn't like the execution of it. The story is interesting, but the execution is mediocre, if you don't know what you're looking for, or the pace isn't quick enough to really make it exciting.   The story doesn't do any real justice to the movie's premise, and it's all the same characters.  If you're going to watch a horror movie and want to have a good time, this is not the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was crap. The actors didn't even try to act with their scenes. The plot is not believable. There are not even any suspenseful scenes. This movie was a complete waste of money. The story was just a set-up for the sex scenes. I didn't believe that they were going to do the sex scene on a small stage in a cheap apartment in a small city in Mexico.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible movie, it takes place during the war and has a really bad ending, it shows how the British treated the German people, they didn't care at all about what they were doing, they shot and killed Germans with no punishment and the prisoners were even killed by the British soldiers who were not even supposed to have them, also the war was not very nice, the only reason they went into it was to get Germany out of her border with France so that Britain could invade and start a new world empire, they all hate each other and think they have the best of the best, they are all mean to each other, there is not even an attempt to make them more likable at the beginning. it shows them at their worst, they treat the prisoners poorly, when you see the German men and women they are so nice and the women are so pretty and they treat them well.   I would not recommend this movie at all, even if you are into WW2 movies you have to watch it with a lot of salt, it doesn't help the terrible ending, but overall it is a very poor movie and one that would only be fun for the most masochistic of people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is interesting but the acting is atrocious. The characters are all really obnoxious and the story has little development. The worst acting is that of Mr. T, who seems to be going through a mental breakdown and is acting like a retard.    Overall, I would not recommend this movie, and I can not say it has anything to do with the fact that it's supposed to be a thriller. The acting is terrible, and the storyline is boring and poorly developed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was very disappointed in this movie. The acting was really bad. The plot was really weird.  I don't even know what they were trying to do with it.   The main problem was that the story was pretty dumb. The story is so bad it was actually funny at times. They tried to make it out to be a really dark drama but it was really just about how crazy they were.  Some of the actors were very good, but I didn't like any of them in this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was looking forward to seeing this movie because I was always a fan of the director's earlier work, but in a lot of ways it just was not up to par. There was just a lot less going on. The acting was not bad, but it just didn't seem to be that deep. The plot was just not as interesting. A lot of characters were just there to be killed and there were a lot more characters with little to no personality. Even the villains got more development than the characters. I found myself annoyed by the characters more and more as the movie went on. There were too many characters and they weren't doing anything.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the kind of movie that when you're done with it, you wish you hadn't seen. If you're watching for a laugh, this might be for you. If it's for the story, you're in for a long day.    It has some decent gags, but I've already seen the sequels and it's just the same story. The only good thing about it is that it's not like the other "action" movies, which are either extremely violent or extremely campy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first 30 minutes or so were good. It was really cool to see a film with black and white in it, and there were a few black & white horror films out at that time. The film had a very good cast in it and there was some really cool and original stuff with the special effects, so it had a lot of charm. Then it gets into the "plot".   I have a strong stomach and I was already sick of those films in the 70's and 80's, and the actors and actresses did a pretty good job of convincing me that they really were not supposed to be scary, but rather were supposed to bring that feel of horror that I had grown to love in the classics of the genre. It is kind of like watching a silent film, but with lots of special effects and an intense story about two families and some nasty people.   Sadly it never caught on with a wide audience because they had already done such a good job at selling the "scary" aspect of it, but it had some nice touches in it such as the way they treated the family.  This film is very old and the cast is pretty unknown.  It does not have much of a "horror" feel to it, it is a film that was made to promote the movie and to get people to go to see it, or it was made for the special effect.  Some of the special shots they did were great and had lots of "special effects".  I think this film is a great example of how the studios could use the special FX of the 70s on a film to sell it to the people of that time, or to use it to make a horror film and sell it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not an okay movie, but it could have been.   I loved the original, but I would have preferred a bit more development of the characters.  They were kind of one note and didn't get along, and in the sequel, they all got together for the big final fight but the character development was kinda lacking. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this film to be very bad. I saw it twice in one night (one time just for my daughter, the other for the audience). I have not seen a worse performance in a horror film than this. The dialogue was very funny, but not funny at all. I hate when a movie has a "smart" kid like Jodie Foster in it. I also found the acting to be laughable. The kid's behavior was terrible, and the way they acted was laughable. This is not a good film for young children, unless you want to see someone's parents getting a good laugh.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is all over the place, as is to be expected of a movie with such a poorly written script. When you start the movie, you are introduced to the concept that there are two "ghosts" that have inhabited the same house in the past. One of the ghosts is female, and the other is male. One night, a group of friends who are camping out, come across the house, and try to get inside. They think they are going to find a new home to call their own, but instead they find a monster waiting for them. The movie then follows the group and the monster in their search for a new space to call home.   The monsters are too scary to be scared by, and even though the movie tries to explain what the monsters are and what happened before, the monsters just seem to go and go. If you are going for a good ghost movie, this might be worth a look. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible, and if you're going to see it, don't watch it. It's about a serial killer who dresses up as a girl to get away from the police (this is in the 80's, right? What were they doing out in the forest?). You know, like with many "killer" movies, it's like a cartoon. It never takes itself seriously, and the dialogue is cliched and awkward. If you're into cartoons, you'll have a blast, and it has a few laughs. But it's just bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most depressing and most violent of all the Saw films.  I do not understand this movie at all.  This is the most idiotic and ridiculous thing i have ever seen in a movie.  It makes the movies of the last 10 years look like a walk in the park.  All i can say about this movie is go away and leave me alone.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't really understand why this movie has received such bad reviews. It's not even bad, it's a pretty decent movie. I think there's a very good story here, and it's told rather well. There is some nudity, but the nudity isn't that terrible. The movie doesn't do much to stand out in my opinion, and the acting is fairly average, but I guess that's to be expected with the lead being played by an unknown. It does have a decent ending and is not too terrible, but it's not worth wasting your time on.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just bought this film off of the Internet because the reviews were so poor. I don't know why everyone seems to rave about it. It's the same film that everyone loves from the late 1970s. It was a big hit at the time, and it's easy to see why. The acting is good, the music is good and the camera work is good. The film's one fault is the ending. If they had done a bit more to explore that ending, the film would have been worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen the director's cut in the past and it was bad. This version is worse. I'm not saying the original version was bad; it's just that this is by far the worst version.  It was supposed to be a drama but it is just a slapstick comedy with a poor story.  The plot is the same as the original, but it's all just stupid. The film is a joke, it was poorly done and the director should be ashamed of his films.  The movie is ridiculous and the story is nothing but a lame gag. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie has a really good look about it, but there are too many plot holes.   This film was made for nothing more than to sell lots of movies.  It's one of those movies you can watch and think, "Gee whiz, they must've known this movie was ridiculous."   I hate to see a bad director use poor actors for that sort of thing.  I've seen worse films that were made by great directors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember seeing this film at an age where I didn't care for "movie stuff". I think I was about twelve or thirteen and I remember watching this film while it was in theatres. I thought it was just stupid. I remember thinking how "fantastic" it looked on tv, but it was lame.   It was so bad that I don't think anyone actually watched it, but the concept itself sounds so appealing to children.  Even with the horrible acting and dialogue, I thought that they at least tried to make it seem like they were going to have a good time in this movie.  This is a terrible movie that I was glad that I didn`t waste my time with.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is pathetic and awful.   Its nothing more than a crappy film made by some no-name director who knows he couldnt do anything right.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this at the theater. At first it was pretty funny and enjoyable, but it didn't have the same feel as the first two movies that I saw from the director. It seemed a little forced, especially the last two acts. The actor I'm watching with doesn't have a natural charisma and he looks really goofy doing all the comedy. I was very disappointed with this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a poorly made movie.  The acting is terrible, the plot is lame, the music is bad, the dialog is bad.   The special effects are so weak.  I really wish this movie could be a spoof.  You are expected to laugh a lot.  There are several jokes that don't work.  One of the most cringe worthy joke of the movie is when the dog jumps out of the toilet and says, "What's that? A cat's going down the toilet? Huh? Huh?!"  I laughed so hard I almost passed out.  A big part of the bad taste of this movie is the director.  He is a great actor and he doesn't know how to use his film, he can't write the right joke for it.  And the actress that plays the girl has never been in a movie, she has a pretty face and the only thing she can do is just make a good impression of the character she is playing.  If you don't get this movie you should be ashamed of yourself.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is not bad but it is not really worth watching.   I am so disappointed because I had to pay a lot of money to watch this movie and it was really not worth it. The whole movie is just so pointless that you have to say that it is pointless and if you like it then maybe you should just stop watching this movie. I do not understand what is going on in this movie or why it was made.  I really did not like this movie because it was just so unnecessary and not worth wasting money on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, this film has absolutely NO redeeming features whatsoever.   I understand that the movie is a comedy, but it's a very bad one. I don't understand the intentions of the filmmakers at all. They are just going for a "funny" comedy with the wrong message, and they probably did it just because they could.  As for the acting, the worst acting I've ever seen from a movie.  One thing to consider is that there is not much going on in the movie. This is not a horror film.  We don't see the main characters fight.  The entire movie takes place in a church.  I was hoping to see a bunch of blood, guts, and gore, and instead I get a cheesy-looking horror movie.     This film should not have been made.  They could have gotten some more experience actors, and at least some actors who actually could do a good job at acting.     This is a shame, because this is one of the best horror films out there.  It has all the right elements of being a good horror movie, and is probably the most entertaining horror film out there right now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is ok, it's not bad but it's nothing special either. There are a few scenes that are awesome to see. They are not really that important though. Overall, this is just a typical action movie with bad acting and a poor plot.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was awful. Not even worth the price, but you can tell that the director is trying to make a bad, but he has terrible acting ability. He tries to give them a bad-guy's feel, which is not possible. The music was horrible, the acting was atrocious and the actors were a little on the tall side. It was like they just threw them on a set and had them do all of the lines with no training. It made no sense, but it had to be done in one take. They did make an effort, but I still won't buy this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A terrible movie that is not funny, and does not entertain. I found it really hard to get excited about the movie at first, but it became so boring it had to end.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went to this because of a friend. She and her boyfriend were in the mood for a good old fashioned screwball comedy. This is where I first heard of this movie. I thought the movie was pretty good. She enjoyed the comedy bits but found some of the acting in the main character to be "not as good as she would have hoped" but she did enjoy watching him screw. I saw this movie at the local theater in Las Vegas. It was pretty funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film just isn't worth seeing. It's so bad that it actually puts me off of watching it ever again.   I can't even begin to describe how bad this film is, it really is so bad!   Even the director's name was made up, and they don't even seem to know what movie it's based off of.  There is no dialogue in the film, and the film only takes up about 3 minutes of the entire running time.  It features a bunch of random stuff like an old man who has an addiction to sex, a guy in jail who thinks he has psychic powers, an alien who just can't stop talking about his alien powers, a girl with the powers to speak to animals and a woman who thinks her parents are crazy.  This movie is just bad! There are some pretty bad actors that are in the movie, but this is still a bad film and it's actually not that great at acting.  The only actors that I found worth watching in this movie were the guys who play the aliens, and there were way too many other actors who weren't that great.  I give it a 3/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While I enjoy this movie, there is no real substance in the plot. The movie's main character is a former prostitute and he has been living a quiet, semi-normal life on the streets of Detroit. He has no money, no girlfriend, no family, nothing of importance. One day, he is approached by a beautiful stranger who tells him that she knows he has an important job and that she wants him to come with her to the biggest warehouse in the city. When he arrives, he learns that he will be in charge of transporting a large amount of drugs to various buyers. He is told by the woman that there will be a shoot-out later on, but not for the man she brought him here to look for. She insists he goes into the warehouse with her. After a few moments, he realizes that this woman is not the woman he was looking for and begins to wonder why she is acting as he had been led to believe.   This movie has been around for a while, and many have tried to make it into a film, with varying degrees of success. The reason this movie is so awful is because of the director, John A. Porter.  While the film is well written and the actors are not horrible, Porter's acting was nothing special. It was almost as if his character wasn't meant to be believable. Even though the actors were not good, the other characters in the film were not bad either.  For me, this is one of the worst "good" movies of the 80's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best bad movie ever.   When I first got the dvd, it was pretty cool, but after that I started watching it more as I was getting ready for work and just realized how long the movie was.  It's not like a bad film and it is not really anything new.  The guy that directed it is a pretty famous director (Robert Siodmak) who has directed over 60 movies.  A guy that can be seen in a bunch of movies and is famous for not giving a shit.  I will give this a 6 because of how good it is, but if I could make the rating higher it would be a 10 because it is worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a fun experience but i hated this movie.   The lead actor had some great acting in this movie but he should've not been the actor.  When you see this movie you see the good acting from the cast but he was no good. The movie is terrible.  I thought it would've been better with more of the lead actor in the movie and less acting by other actors.  They tried to put a more modern feel on it but it was a total disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's the best thing I've ever seen on my Playstation and I love it.   I have to give props to the director, Peter Jackson, because this is his best film.  It was well made and the acting and cinematography was amazing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is not bad but in a way the acting is not believable. In fact it is very laughable. The characters, especially the main characters, seem to be playing for laughs and not for real. The main characters seem to know too much and have no idea who they are or what they are doing. They get lost and can't seem to get away from it and just keep running from one bad thing to another. The story and screenplay just does not make any sense. I did not understand how all the bad things they did happened at that time and in that place. It just made no sense. It makes no sense that someone would go down a dark tunnel when he had the chance to go down an easy one and have a beautiful view of the ocean. And the only reason they did not do that was because they were so high off drugs that they did stupid things that they could not explain.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really love this movie, and have seen it 3 times in the past year or so, so i wanted to give it a shot again.  I think that the movie could have been a bit more intense, but the actor's really get a good scene, and it is pretty much the only thing about the movie that has staying power.   This movie has a lot of things I am trying to find in a good science fiction movie, but this movie has too much that is missing, and some of the elements that the story lacks.  The story is very good, and I can't fault it for that, but I think it lacks a bit of that tension, and the action scenes could have really been done a lot better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you don't understand why this film is bad (and not just the director's lack of skill) you need to do more than just watch the picture. You have to hear the music. There's really no way to describe the horrible soundtrack without just listening to it. The lyrics to the lyrics are so over the top it hurts, but the music makes it all sound even worse. The film also lacks a lot of the "cool" elements that made the "Matrix" films so good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, I guess I should have known by then that this movie wasn't good.  After the first 20 minutes of this movie I had no idea what to expect. I did see the trailer at a friend's house (he had seen it a couple of times, and he liked it) and it looked like it was going to be some kind of gangster movie. It wasn't.  What really irritated me about this movie was that the director (Dwight Marshall) had the nerve to cast his daughter as the lead.     I don't think she really knew what she was doing. I have never seen a movie that was so poorly directed (though I have seen plenty of good movies).  It was hard to watch, with horrible acting (particularly from Jennifer Garner) and bad direction.  It's a very bad movie.   In conclusion, this movie is a very low point for Marshall's career, and if he can't find another career than directing low-budget porno movies, he's a really bad director.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was bad. I really liked the first few scenes and how the story was going to progress. I did not get it, and after a while I decided to stop watching. The actor in the first scene was really bad and was not good. I do not know why the director did not cast a professional actor for this role.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is like the movie that i watch when im alone in the house on sunday night to watch the movie on tv. i watched this movie twice on tv after a while and i dont remember anything from it. The plot is good at first and it seems to be really good. But the movie ends on a really bad way and it just left me feeling like the poor character they had created in this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've only seen this movie about 4 times and it doesn't have that much of a grip on me. I am a horror junkie and this movie didn't stand up to my standards.   It had a lot of creepy scenes, I guess the director was trying to bring out that feeling of being alone but the scares just felt off.  I don't know if this is just my taste, I think it is more a thriller than anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am going to get in a bit of a rant about this movie but it has been a bad experience from start to finish for me.  I was in the theater for a preview screening and I had a very hard time taking this movie seriously. The actors were so bad and the director clearly did not understand the concept of comedy.  In fact, the one actor in the movie who didn't sound like an idiot was Jason Bateman.  The acting is so bad, so amateurish, that I was laughing at some of the characters.   It's almost as if the director just had a bunch of actors on a film set and did whatever he wanted them to do.  This movie would have been much funnier if the actor cast in it were not so great.  It was very clear to me that the cast of this movie were either not used to playing the part of a clown or were not interested in it.  They were just there.  If it were up to me, I would have let the movie go to waste.  Instead, I sat through it as much as I could.  There is so much of it that you are left with an impression that you can not shake.  And in my opinion, that is why the movie didn't work.  My son was in this movie and he laughed more than once.  He couldn't take it anymore and he left.  Maybe that is the end of the movie for me as well.  You may or may not like this movie, but the way the movie was produced really didn't help. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is full of great, great action scenes. But the movie is way too long to be exciting. I could see this movie being great if the length was cut.   As for the actors, they are great but way too many of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The entire movie is a mess. The actor who played the role, Kevin James, had to be paid about $50,000 dollars for the role. And the actors who played his co-stars, Jamie Lee Curtis and Jamie Lee Clements, had no lines. So they played themselves in the movie. So you have to wait for the movie to finish before you find out if the actors did their own voices.   It's like a poorly written movie made by people who were tired of working.  My suggestion is, if you are thinking of seeing this movie, don't bother.  I have no idea if it is a good movie, but it doesn't even bother to try to be a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My boyfriend and I watched the movie on the first night we were at the hotel. It was our first time to Las Vegas and we thought it was really cool to have a full casino. As the movie began the lights dimmed, the music went silent, and then the casino casino opened. They were very nice, and seemed to be on vacation at the time. I would suggest this movie to anyone who likes Casino Royale.   This is an excellent film and a must see. The movie has a unique plot, and really gives you a good insight into the life of the James Bond character. The film has great action scenes, and makes you feel like you are watching a Bond film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A poorly acted and produced film that lacks a sense of style or character. The lead actors are a mess as are all the characters except the female lead.   The story is simple. The young lady is looking to get into the modeling business. There's a rich man that wants her to get close to him and become his lover. She's a very nice and sweet young woman but she's so naïve and lacks any sophistication. She also acts as if this is something that would be easy for her but this is not a movie for someone that is new to the scene. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie will give you a heart attack on several levels...   The acting was awful... it's like they filmed it in an apartment with one or two people and then everyone had to sit in a small room with no ventilation.   I found it very distracting.  The story is so unbelievable.  These two characters were so desperate to save their own lives.  At one point they even decided to jump into a burning car with an elderly woman in the back seat.  This scene is unbelievable, how can they go to this extent to save someone if they really knew it was going to kill them?   You can't believe what's going on in this movie, and you don't want to.  They even tried to throw in a plot twist that was so unrealistic, and they didn't even use that in the movie.  That's too bad, because I had to wait for it on the DVD.  A great movie, but it makes me feel sick to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching this movie with my friends from high school in high school hall and i was pretty sure i would end up in a fight. That's what the guy who played the role said at the beginning. the other guys in the group were not having it and then the scene with the woman on the floor (i think it was the same actress from "v.o.w") had everyone screaming and yelling. i wasn't that into it, so i went to the bathroom and just watched some TV on a different screen. the first girl i saw from the group was so hot i wanted to kiss her right away and the guy was even hotter than the girl. i got out of the bathroom as the scene was starting and walked right up to her. i said "hi" and kissed her. that was the first time i ever kissed a girl. the guy walked over and said "get in my car" and started laughing. i was really mad at him and wanted to fight and go in the bathroom. the girl said "no" and walked out of his car. i did. i went and started getting drunk and then after getting back in my friend's car i found the door open. i opened the door and said to my friend "this guy is a hottie!" and got in the car. the next thing i know my friend is on the phone to his girlfriend and i'm driving down a highway at like 110 miles an hour with my friend just kissing a hot chick. I didn't do anything wrong and i'll admit it. i'm an adult and i know what i did was wrong. but i love girls, and i love that they are attracted to me. they must want to do stuff with me. i'll just be waiting for a chance to do more.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is an interesting one but the plot is very simple and the acting is very bad. I don't get why anyone would want to watch this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be rather entertaining with its unique premise, but it's hard to recommend. The special effects and special effects do look nice, but they are not that impressive. It does not help that the characters are extremely uninteresting and the actors in this movie are almost impossible to take seriously. It also really takes away from the horror aspect of the movie by making it look like an action movie. This is only my opinion, but I thought it was rather silly and unrealistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible movie, bad acting, bad story, bad script, horrible acting, horrible camera work. The worst thing about this movie was that the actors were all out of shape. Even the actors who are at least 10 years younger than their roles. The acting was terrible and the plot was not very interesting. I could not believe that this movie did not go beyond the first act. This movie was never funny, it was really not funny at all. I am just amazed that this director was able to get a movie made for so little money. I was very surprised that there was not more made of this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film, and it was the only horror movie I ever saw in my life (other than when I was a kid). It was not good, but I was only 12 years old and I didn't think anything of it. I was told it was a campfire movie, and that's what it was. The acting was all in poor taste, the characters were not believable, the gore was too much and it really felt as if it was done by a film student who needed a summer job. It was one of those films where the first thing you see is the movie poster, and I never saw that before. I don't recommend this movie, but if you want a camp fire movie, this is it!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie about a dozen times. Every time, it is not very good.  It is always overrated and has lots of scenes that have no importance or are silly.  The bad scenes do not improve the movie and make it a failure in every way.  I guess they had no talent for directing.   The characters are weak and boring.  There are no actors who are good in this movie.  This movie is the worst bad movie I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very strange movie. It took me a while to see it and when I did it was funny but then you get to the part where the man gets shot in the face. He was not killed instantly but it was very slow.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It wasn't the worst movie in the world. It was not the worst flick I've seen, either. I loved it. There is nothing worse than a crappy movie with great actors. What it was, was a crap movie. I was not expecting anything more from a "tribute" film of the great actor, but hey, what the hell! The film was made for kids. Kids do not think of movies like this, or have any interest in watching a film that seems to have been made in an attempt to make the actors look like they are being paid to be in it.   I was at the cinema on the Friday night before it was released, and the guy behind the counter was playing a trailer of it for the kids in the store. And I think the girl in the movie, she looked about 9. I can't think of the last time I watched a movie with such big stars playing such young people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was pretty bad, I mean it's an indie that only came out in a couple of theaters, but it was the worst movie I've seen this year. The acting was terrible and the production was bad. It was really hard to believe in the characters that we are supposed to believe, and the whole movie just felt fake, like it was made for a film festival, and not as a movie. The editing and sound were horrible as well. Not fun at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible. It's a comedy about a girl named Sara who is having a relationship with an old man, and he is supposed to be dead but he's just a ghost.  He's so creepy that she just wants to leave him, but she is a real slut, and she's not too happy about it when she doesn't get what she wants. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I heard a rumor that this was a ripoff of a film called "The Man from Earth".  In the first 10 minutes I was so taken by this film and the way it was shot and edited that I really hoped it was all a joke.  It wasn't.  There was no way this film could have been done in 20 years.  The acting was so bad and the dialogue so thick, one would think it was from an ancient book and not from 1969.  I got so distracted by the dialogues and the acting that I didn't notice the bad acting and poor camera angles.  One of the most boring movies ever filmed.   The only good thing I got from this was that it looked like the filmmakers got their money back for a very cheap, ugly, poorly edited film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts out strong, and the characters develop slowly. But once the movie starts to go off the rails, the audience is left with a lot of unanswered questions.   I found it too long.  I understand that the story had to be told in a certain order, but the movie took way too long to get there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in 1999. It was horrible. This is one of the most painful films to watch. I can remember every scene with horror in it. This movie is a real eye-opener. I think this movie is meant to be seen by a child, and I would recommend that you stay away from this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't know it was a bad film.    It's really well put together.  It was so boring in parts.  The acting was atrocious.  I don't know why the director was in the studio at all.  Even when you're not on camera, you can hear him yelling at someone and he just sounds like he has a bad case of the blues.  There was something about the acting, and the way the camera was used, and you can see how someone else was having a harder time than this man.  If I was in his shoes I'd have been dead before I left the building.  Very disappointed.  A very mediocre movie.  I like how they put the old-school music and the good acting in the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film follows a young boy who is abducted and later released from an amusement park after two days. He is eventually found by a couple, and it turns out that the woman who abducted him is actually his mother. He begins to develop a strong crush on her, and at this point we realize that this is a very strange family. It's obvious that the mother doesn't love her child, and that she's not happy to have him back.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was so lame and stupid that I could not find the time to watch it.   The first 20 minutes were fine, I even laughed a few times.  It just went downhill from there.  The acting was pretty good too.  They did a great job of hiding the fact that they were actors.  I know they were supposed to be real, but how do you hide your character from other people?  It is so fake that it is hard to believe that they are in a movie.  So, if you are looking for something to watch just for fun, you are in the wrong place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't care for this one at all.   This was the only movie where my friends asked me why I didn`t go to see it more.  I found the movie boring and had a hard time believing it was a true movie.  The story was stupid and the acting was awful.  A story where a girl was raped by a man she just met was so lame that I did not care how bad the acting.  For a movie called "I'll Be There for You"   the plot was terrible.  All you need to know is that the girl went to a bar and then the guy asked her for a ride and she let him have sex with her.  But you see, the guy was so good looking and rich and he got what he wanted and no one could get him.  Why the hell would she have let him do that.  How can you have sex in a bar with a guy you just met.  That girl is a fool.  It is a shame because I loved this movie and wanted to see more.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Swingers" has many positives but very little in the way of negatives, and is a good movie to watch with the kids as a little story. It features some interesting, well-done actors that can carry a story. However, a few of the scenes just can't make sense in the context of the film. The script is just plain wrong and does not connect to the story at all. The acting and story are not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is a little weird and it doesn't do a great job at building up suspense. It really feels like the writer was making up his mind about what to write on a piece of paper and then decided to just throw it on the page without giving anything back to the audience.   The pacing was really weird, which really made it impossible to pay attention to anything.  The acting was bad, but I suppose there isn't a great choice to be had with that cast.  There were some really lame plot twists.  If you're a fan of the movie, it might be worth watching it and hoping for a better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love the movie and the concept of the movie is very interesting, but the production was bad and the effects were very bad.    The film was made in 1970, before computer graphics were developed to good effect and they didn't bother to use it.  The movie is set in the year 1974 and the main character, Bill Bailey, a young pilot, is sent to Earth to fly a mission to study a UFO.    Bill is shot down by the aliens and his alien captor is very bad looking.  Bill, who has some experience in piloting, tells the alien to "suck his dick".   The aliens don't do that.  Instead they turn off the light and burn him.  They then turn on the light, the aliens attack Bill and he is saved by his friend Bill.  These aliens look like a cross between a gorilla and a shark, with big eyes, but there are some very strange looking heads.  Their names are Mr. Blue and Miss Green.  There are also several alien weapons that are fired on the screen.  This movie is a disappointment to me, as it is a lot of fun, but it was made before computer effects were developed.  A must see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was so boring and boring. There is no plot, no action, and not even one scene that has anything to do with the characters. The director never showed any emotion, and there is no music to help the boring scenes.   Very disappointing.  This is not a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this movie in the theater and was not impressed.   The acting, story and characters were bad.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie isn't good at all.   It is a poorly written movie, and that's a bad thing.  It's not that the story is bad, it's that the plot makes no sense, and I don't get why the author decided to include it.  There are so many things that are unexplained.  Why is the bad guy in his hotel room so late? Why did the hero go to his wife and daughter in the first place? Why would the hero leave his wife, daughter and hotel key at the door?  The wife was always supposed to have taken the kids to a movie, or to some other part of town before the bad guys came to town.  The bad guys have a very strange voice for someone who speaks in a foreign language, but the voice doesn't sound very much like a "foreign" voice either.  At one point the hero is shown in the middle of a large desert, which the baddies have just moved in from, and the hero looks around. But, the baddie in the desert is just as tall as the hero, and he doesn't look out of place.  This one could have been really good.  I guess that the author didn't get along with the producers of the film, since they decided to get rid of him from the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was not very good. There were some scenes in which the actors seemed to have very bad acting. This makes me think that the whole movie was a set up for the film "The Naked Gun" which was made about a week after this movie. So if you are looking for a good movie with a good cast and nice acting, try watching "The Last Picture Show" on tv. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The cast was so poor. I think there are some pretty good actors in the world, and I thought the only thing that was bad about this movie is the director's job.   What are they going to do with him?   I know that there are other people out there that would make this movie better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is really bad. I can't even find one thing worth saying about it. The acting is horrible, the plot is laughable, the violence is out of control. There are really some scenes that really make you want to rip your hair out and scream, and the only thing that makes me laugh was when one of the bad guys, when trying to get into a girl's car, jumps on her car and rides like a horse.   A couple of really funny scenes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I have ever seen. It makes me sick.   I think they could have at least shot the movie in a more natural environment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is one of those movies you can watch a million times and it still bothers you the first time.  The ending was lame and you could not figure out why you wanted to see the movie.  It has been released on DVD. It has the classic title and the great actor, but it is just an average film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think this movie is worth watching. Its so bad it can't even be called bad, it's really a mess and I would recommend you watch it as an after-thought.   The only good thing about this movie are the songs, it makes the movie more interesting to watch.  The acting is terrible, the director obviously got some help from the actors because they are trying their best, but it's so bad you can't find anything good about it.  If you have a low tolerance for terrible acting and bad movies, then you have to give this one a shot, but you might want to wait until you watch this movie again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is terrible. The cinematography is so poor that it makes me want to watch the original. The acting is awful. The dialogue is terrible, but it's not funny enough to make me laugh. It is so bad it even makes me think about how badly made this movie is.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is all over the place. It's basically a bad adaptation of the old war films. I think the author, in the end, probably realized it wasn't going to work, and the result is a total mess. The movie looks like it was shot on a shoestring budget, but at times, it looks like an A-list actor was trying to act like they were a part of the military movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was really the worst movie i've seen in a long time. The movie wasn't bad in the usual way but this was a real let down and it was a good idea of a movie. The story was just so wrong and stupid with so many things going wrong the movie was a joke.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just came to watch this movie, as I have not seen it before. I was excited to see it.   This movie is like a combination of several bad films from the 70's.  Unfortunately, this movie is just a bad film.  The cast and crew are not good at portraying a realistic film. I have read reviews stating that the actors are really good, but if this was a movie from the 1970's, then they would be fine.  Also, I think they just don't like to make good films anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so boring and not enjoyable at all.   The characters, although all of them are annoying and have their own story lines, are all played by the same actors and I just can't stand this movie.  I've seen it once and it wasn't worth a second viewing.  The plot line is stupid, the acting is horrible, and the actors don't know what they're doing.  This should have never been made into a movie in the first place.  I watched this movie once and didn't have any fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only good thing about this movie is the story, that has a nice mystery and some good action. The bad thing is that the acting is really bad and everything else is just awful. I hope someone makes a sequel to this movie, it is worth seeing just for the story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a bit of a travesty from beginning to end.   I can not imagine anyone enjoying this film, and i can not recommend it to anyone.  There is not much to say about it other than it looks pretty bad and does not have a story line that i believe would interest anyone.     The only saving grace of this film is the acting, which is all forgettable.  The plot is so poorly thought out it is a real shame it has no value as a film.  When i heard about this film being produced i was very happy and excited for it to be made, but what could have been an awesome flick was wasted because the story line and acting in this film was so poor.  I do not see how anyone else can enjoy this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not sure what the hype was for this film, but it was pretty bad. The entire movie is an example of how to make a bad film even worse than it already is. The acting was very bad and the acting was good, but none of the characters are memorable or unique. The music was the worst, with just about every song that was played sounding terrible. A lot of the scenes just looked like they were shot on video. I don't even think there was any photography. I've seen many bad action films, and this was the lowest of the low.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is terrible.  They hired a director that knows how to film a bad scene. They make a good movie, but with poor writing.   The movie is about the life of a drug dealer that has a son, who has a baby.  The dad is the son's dealer.  Then they make it seem like the father is going to leave to live in the US. They shoot the mom, and then the son has a fight with the kid and he is shot by the cop and it is cut away from.  This movie is a drug movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Sometime in the late 1980s a "pioneer" in the "science fiction" genre, Stanley Kubrick, began work on what would become the first of his "modern" films. In his attempt to create a "reality" he turned to a "classic" as his model: the silent and suspenseful film. (For what it's worth, I think "2001" does not meet the bar that "Lolita" set.) The movie, directed by a then relatively unknown Kubrick, is about a father's love affair with a young, young woman, and involves the use of several well-known devices. The whole thing is played with a lot of style, as is the situation itself, but not nearly as much as it should have been.   The acting here is very, very good, the plot interesting, and the special effects are superb. The only thing that could have made it all worthwhile was if Kubrick had been able to create something that actually could have been an artistic masterpiece, even if only in name. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was my first time going to see a movie like this and I had no idea what to expect.   I am sure this movie was a big success for its time.  It is a cheesy and stupid movie that was made during the early sixties.  The script was full of clichés and jokes that were already well known by the time the movie was made.  I think I will never see a better script that this one.  There were lots of different characters and they all seemed to have the same story.  After the first few minutes, the movie got boring and there was no suspense.  This movie was bad enough that the actors actually thought it was a good idea to be in it and they were all quite good at their jobs.  If you have no idea about this movie and think it is a good time, be prepared to hate it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is very good for the movie "Aliens". But the actress playing the female "Ceaser" didn't have an actress. This means the actor playing her in the movie is just a guy. So the actress was not that good.    The alien character looks very stupid. He looks like a guy from old-time TV, but his voice is very funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well I was going to see this movie for the first time today. I had heard about it. It was on TV a few days ago. I was hoping it would be funny but I have never heard of this movie. The only reason I decided to see it was because of what was said on tv about it being hilarious. So I came home and opened up this movie and was disappointed.   And now I am disappointed and I can't watch it again. I don't care about the actors at all. I've seen it before so it's not worth seeing. I can see why they made it so long because it's so boring and the plot is stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very excited to see this movie. It had been a long time coming. When I was a kid, it was a big deal to see a monster movie. In my day, they would show it in theaters, and the monsters would be real. Now, the monsters are CGI, so it's just a movie for kids. There were a lot of people who had already seen this movie at one time, and there was the usual backlash that goes along with seeing something that is not good. That was really disappointing to me because I was so excited to go to see it.    It was just boring and there were a couple of silly things, but it had the potential to be good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie to have a night out with friends but I didn't enjoy it at all. I think it's a bad, long movie that is filled with bad acting. This movie has nothing to do with art. What the movie does is be a very old vaudeville show that was being performed when the film was made. It's all the same music and acting from the same characters and same type of humor. I'd never have been interested in it but now I know it was a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is full of ridiculous scenes that have no impact on the plot. If it was not for a woman named Maddy who was always there to be a distraction, the story would have been a complete non-event.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought it was very good, the story line was interesting and I loved seeing some of the old gang back together in one film. I did not feel the movie's ending was in line with what the story was about but it was good to see the old group of guys together in a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really looking forward to this movie because the trailer sounded really good. I think it was even in theatres!  It came on during one of my favorite movie nights at work. My coworkers and I started watching it before we even went to the theater. I mean, why would we not? It was so good. The plot is really cool and it has great performances from all the actors. I thought the movie was really funny. I really didn't expect that.    This movie will make you laugh, cry, and love again!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was terrible. The story is very contrived and it is all made to look easy but in reality, it was not. The acting was very bad.   It was just hard to believe that the guy in the movie was a real person.  The acting is way too good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had high expectations when I picked this film up. As a fan of the original film, I knew the remake was going to be amazing. Unfortunately, I found the remake to be far from perfect. There were way too many continuity errors to count. In the original, when they see the killer with the knife and it looks like a real knife, they immediately say, "Who's that with the big knife?" and that's the killer. The film goes on for so long with characters talking about it, but never ever really finds out who it was with the giant knife. In this movie, the killer has a different face with big glasses and a beard that is different colors and sizes. The killer is never shown, so it's never clear. Also, I think the movie would have been better if they didn't show the killer at all. The movie takes place in a few different locations and the killer never goes there. The scenes when they look at his dead body, or the shots where the killer is walking in front of the camera never take place in the actual location. The killers head is never shot on the ground, but instead a long dolly shot over the ground. The ending where the camera follows the killer to his car is also pretty much an outtake from the original.   The movie didn't make it into my top ten, but it is definitely worth checking out.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really like the movie. I love all the movie stars (i believe) from the movie, but the story was just kind of stupid. I mean if they got to make an animated movie they probably wouldn't have gotten the same people. The story line was stupid, and i think they just made it up as they went along.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A big fat rip-off of  The Big Lebowski  in the style of  Taxi Driver. I would have done much better to go watch  The Dude & Harvey Keitel: I'm Your Biggest Fan  instead.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In this case, the movie was terrible. My husband said that when he first saw it, he was very disappointed, and that his opinion changed after he watched it a couple of times. But it didn't change our opinion at all. This movie was very confusing and hard to follow, it was just not that entertaining.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *This movie was really bad. At the beginning i had a good time watching this movie. Then i fell asleep because it was so boring. Then when i woke up it was already 5:30 am. This movie was made on a cheap budget and the actors could not act. I hate to admit it but this movie was so bad that it is the worst movie i have seen in a long time. You should never watch it if you are not in love with a specific character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is really bad. It tries to be something original but never has the ideas it wants to, just a bunch of random scenes. Some of the characters are kind of annoying and some are stupid. The acting in this movie is terrible and the acting is great when the other characters are trying to kill you or something. The sound is horrible. No wonder the movie is bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would not recommend this movie to anyone who is in a dark mood or who would not feel comfortable watching this movie on one's own.   This movie really goes on for almost two hours.  If you want to relax and enjoy a film you might want to read a book, listen to music, watch a video or something else.  The film only lasts about 90 minutes and if you are not a good person with a sense of humor you will have a bad time.  I am sure if you see the film twice or more you would laugh and then feel guilty.  For those who want a bad and dirty flick with very little dialogue, nudity, violence and no humor and who do not feel uncomfortable, please find something else to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While this movie did have a lot of potential, it was never able to fully live up to it.   It has a good story line, but most of it was too confusing for me to understand.  I am still wondering how it's possible that this movie went on the big screen.  The music wasn't good and the actors were pretty bad.  Even when the movie did manage to capture some of the humor of the time, it often fell flat.  One time the actress that played a woman who wanted to become a nun had no boobs.  This movie was fun, but it really could have been better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Meryl Streep as the 'Queen' of England in the film "The King's Speech" (2011) was excellent in the role. She had a great range. But her performance was a bit too long. She played a character of extreme arrogance, with some very good acting as well. She could have been a lot more entertaining.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am really disappointed. The movie has very little depth and really is just a bad idea. In a "real" setting, the girl is raped. In the movie it is just implied that there was no rape but it really isn't mentioned again so why is it there?. I am so confused, the woman just seems to be a tool for the guy to abuse. I really didn't expect a movie like this.   This is one of those movies where you will never get to know the main character. The only time we see her face is when he rapes her. We don't hear anything about her family or about the person who abused her.  It seems like this movie was made for "reps" and the movie is just so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A mediocre piece of trash that is nothing more than a cheap knockoff of The Day the Earth Stood Still. There are better movies that have been made in the 70s than this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director is great and does the movie justice, but the performances in the film are horrendous and the acting is so bad that the movie is pretty much worthless. The worst part is that you never get the sense that the characters were actually having a good time at all in the movie.    I have seen worse, but I have never been disappointed in this movie, and it is definitely not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was awful.   It's not even funny, just an embarrassment to the genre.  No idea what is supposed to happen and why the whole film is like that, with nothing happening in the first ten minutes and then a scene of a giant snake eating something in the next five.  The acting is terrible and the dialogue is also terrible.  I thought it would be fun to see a film about a giant monster, but the producers of this had no idea about the genre, so they couldn't get anything of substance out of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A big waste of time.   The only thing good about it is the opening and it is cool.  All the other parts are terrible and they should never have been released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is terrible, the acting was terrible, and the story line is terrible!   It took me a long time to accept that this was a bad film, and it's taking me even longer to forget it.  The most notable thing about this movie is the use of puppetry and the way the camera was used to make the characters appear to walk around in a real way.  They had the puppeteers set up some very realistic looking environments for the puppets to move through, and that was very well done.  It seemed like the actors would jump from one place to the next, and when the camera showed up on a different spot, they would look over and look at each other.  Unfortunately, this wasn't even close to being good acting, as they could have just gotten a real actor to do it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just didn't feel like it was meant to be a movie. I mean, at one point in the film, an actual bear was brought in for a scene.    You could tell the actors were having trouble remembering what they were supposed to say.  The movie really seemed to be going nowhere, and the only way to see where it was going was by looking on YouTube.  And if you do find it on YouTube, then you probably shouldn't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first thing you're going to notice about this movie is its sound. I haven't seen the film in a very long time, so all of the effects in this movie are really dated. The voice actors are awful, and the effects are old. The actors are not only bad, but they don't even act like actors! They just sit there all day, doing their worst impersonations of actors, which is really lame. But what this movie doesn't have in effects, it makes up in "bad acting". This movie is really poorly made.   I'm sorry, but this is an awful movie. It is not fun to watch. You will spend a lot of time on your hands, and I really don't think that's a good idea. The story is boring and the characters are just not interesting. All of the other films on this list have better acting, better writing, and better acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this film when I was a kid. I remember my family watching it in our living room. I felt like it was a really good movie.   But, I have to say I thought this movie sucked.  It was terrible.  The music was very cheap.  I felt the film would be much better if they made it in a 70's style, and the movie was too long and boring.  In a way I felt this movie was made to make money, and it was really bad at it.  There were a few good scenes, but it was just too bad.  So bad I was so annoyed by it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film started out okay. I liked the style of the film. It reminded me a lot of the old TV serials that were on the air in the late 50s and early 60s. The acting was excellent in this movie. The cinematography, the special effects and the actors all worked together very well. The only thing I don't like about the movie is that it doesn't make any real sense. There was nothing in the story that I felt compelled to understand.   All the characters are extremely one-dimensional. It would be easier for me to just say that the actors were one-dimensionally bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was good for a while...then the script went downhill so much that it sucked the life out of this movie. It never could have been a real good movie, it was ruined from the get go.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really wanted to like this film, and it was pretty fun to watch.  It's not really a horror film, which is a huge letdown, but it's really fun to get a little more out of those old movies and watch them in a different way, especially since it's one of the first horror movies of its type.   Unfortunately, there are some parts in this that are just plain embarrassing, as the story of a little boy in an orphanage who suddenly starts killing the people he meets and getting caught is pretty much recycled from other movies and shows.  This would've been a lot more enjoyable if the story was more original, as I know it will be in a remake, but a new director, director of a remake (Hollywood being what it is, it doesn't seem likely) and cast of the original will probably do this better, I have no doubt of that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well this is a crap movie. And that's about all you can say about it. The cast were all good but the director should have kept this movie at home for the parents to watch. The ending where a car pulls into a driveway was stupid but no one even cared. If you're watching this you better make sure your family isn't watching.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie doesn't stand up to its own high expectations.   All the effects work is done on the movie's actors, which is quite a disappointment, but you can't expect a movie about an underwater alien to have a good acting cast.  The acting is mostly bad and the story is poorly written.  They could have gone back to the source and reworked it to be better, but they decided to make a sequel.  Even if the movie was only a sequel, it still would have been better than this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I enjoyed "The Wreckers" but it is not a bad film. The actors are all good in their roles. The story is the same as the other movie that we saw, "The Pirates of Penzance" and you can't really tell anything is different about the movie because it is a pirate movie with a bunch of guys and a lot of action. It was a good way to cap off the weekend.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is about the one and only "Grave Digger", an all around asshole who kills a man for no reason. When it first came out there was so much hype about this movie it was all I watched, no matter what. The acting wasn't very good but the writing was so cheesy you had to laugh at it. The only reason this movie isn't a 1/10 is because it's not a horror movie and you can't really call it a comedy, there are a lot of people that get freaked out by this movie.   I thought this movie was just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible, it is not worth watching. The movie has some great action scenes but they are only there to fill in time. There are no interesting characters, nothing interesting happens and most of the actors do not even appear in this movie. It is a terrible remake of the 1980 movie that is horrible and just bad! I hope they never make this movie again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a cheap movie. The production quality is terrible and the acting is awful. This movie is made for the profit of some companies like Paramount. The worst part is the acting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so sad it hurts. The movie had some funny moments but the rest of it is just heart breaking. The whole movie is about a girl who dies and it just feels like a terrible way to go.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I have ever seen. This film is so bad it is not funny. I saw it at a festival. I was told that the guy who directed this film was on the set of one of his movies and that it was his first time shooting a horror film. That is the only explanation I can think of for the poor picture quality. I thought the characters were so silly. The killer was so stupid and over the top. If it had been any better, they wouldn't have given him a chance. I couldn't figure out what this man was trying to do. I didn't get the feeling that it had anything to do with sex.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was great on one point, but that one point really ruined the entire movie. The movie started out with a great chase scene, but it never got the characters out of the car, it never seemed like they were going to run away. We eventually found out that the chase scene was just a set up for the sex scenes. And we also found out the girl they were chasing was a prostituted sex slave.   And so, we finally got to see them make love. I think it was the best sex scene of the series. It was a very nice scene, and the characters felt real.  A lot of the characters were just played by actors who look like porn stars, so the porn actresses in the movie were really well done.  They also seemed to be able to do all kinds of sex moves with the characters.  When we saw the two characters we thought were "slaves", we didn't think they were "workers".  They were "Slaves" in the sense that they are "Workers".  I think this movie got a bad reputation for its sex scenes because it was filmed on a film crew, so when it ended up on VHS, all the sex was blurred out.  I actually think the movie was better on DVD, so that's the way I prefer to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not a movie for everyone. It's a film for a very small audience. Its not for someone who is too young to know anything about the subject matter.  I would never recommend this movie to anyone who does not want to learn something about some of the darkest parts of human history.  The film is an abomination, the writing is weak, the acting is terrible, the production is poor, and the acting itself is not very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is bad, but it's not terrible. The acting is awful, but at least some of the actors don't act like slobs, and they aren't all horrible. I did not mind the writing. The director is a very good writer, although I am not really sure how many other people enjoyed this movie.   This movie was not good, and it's the worst in the series, however there is some great stuff in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first scene in this movie, at the beginning when she's walking in the woods, looks like a documentary.   A documentary on how many people are killed by a serial killer every week.  It takes a long time to get to the point.  The documentary aspect is ruined by the fact that the people who are featured are always on camera.  What you see of the killer in the first 10 minutes looks like the film was shot in black and white and the guy in black looked like the same person from every other shot.  Even though we know this guy is the killer, we never see his face in the movie.  This movie is just a glorified documentary.     One other negative aspect of this movie is that there are way too many actors, too many directors, and way too much film.  If the movie was shorter, I think it would have been better.  I just hate when you have a really good script and then put so many directors in a film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie on the first of January, and I was very disappointed.   It's basically just a slasher movie with a very stupid ending.  It has a lot of potential to be a very good film, but it is not.  My friend who was also at the screening of this movie said it's really boring.  She doesn't want to see another slasher film.  This movie was also rated "R" for being very scary.  If you want a really good slasher flick, look at "Resident Evil", it's just as good.  I was disappointed in this movie for several reasons:  1. The main character, "Barry" (William Sanderson) is a loser who is constantly rejected by women.  2. I don't think it's realistic that a young guy who's never experienced a successful relationship will commit a murder.  3. The killer is only ever seen with one eye (just because of his insanity)  I understand that people are scared of clowns and clowns have scary faces, but people shouldn't have to be so scared to see a good movie.  And I do recommend this movie to people who like slasher movies, but I would not recommend it for people who aren't scared of anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this one in the theater, the only movie that has made me scream like a girl. The film has one of the creepiest girls in the history of horror, and she does not disappoint. The girl's face is very weird and I think the makeup that she has used to make it looks horrible. The only other female in this film is a very ugly character who is basically a giant spider. The other girls are either sexy, not attractive, or look really weird. I think this film was made for teenage boys, but that is all they would do.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     You don't want to see this movie.   I found this movie so boring and repetitive, it was really hard to enjoy the movie. It doesn't really try to be original or fun, instead it's just a boring story of two people who go on a road trip and have some random adventures along the way.  I guess the film was made to make some money because if it didn't have all that, this movie would have been okay. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoy bad movies, and the film is bad. The acting is cheesy, the music is bad, and I really feel like the production values are lacking. If it wasn't for the sex scenes, the film would have been very forgettable.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has some great ideas, but the execution is sloppy, at times sloppy, sloppy, and the idea behind the film is a little bit suspect.   There were a couple times in the movie when I thought the movie was going to have a big, action packed, chase scene, and then all of a sudden, it would just stop and play a cheesy musical number.  You have to love a movie that has a few nice moments like these.  The movie does have a decent cast, but you have to be on the lookout for a few mistakes made when filming a movie like this.  If you love the 80's, then this movie is for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was really disappointing to see a movie like this where no one really got what was going on, I have seen a few "tear jockers" and found them entertaining, but this movie was just not worth it, a bunch of white guys in some sort of action movie, but no one in it was doing anything cool or unique at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad that I can't give it a rating.  It's a disaster.  The film doesn't even make sense.  No matter how bad it gets, it doesn't add up.  You have to do a lot of back tracing to find out what is going on.  I know that sounds like a cop out, but it's not.  This guy was trying too hard to make it seem as if the movie was real.  Why does this guy think he can get away with acting?   They shot the movie on Super 16mm and then it was on 35mm and it looked horrible on the big screen.  What the hell?  I have watched this movie three times and it is the same every time.  They tried to give it some credibility with the music.  Did anyone realize how stupid that is?  This is how the movie used to look.   The cinematography is terrible and it looks like they used an 8mm camera.  All the background actors in the movie look exactly alike.  Where is the background actor named "George C. Scott"?  The actors are all doing their own voices.  How can one man do all of that?  It makes no sense.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In any movie I watched this year I always saw it as a film that did something to change how I see film. This film definitely did not change my perception of film.   The film was about a woman that has no desire to be with anyone other than her husband and her husband has a very difficult time relating to her. She has two children that she is desperate to see grow up and live a happy life. When they grow up she does not even try to live up to her promises to take care of them.  After three years of trying to make contact with her it became apparent that she had been a victim of domestic abuse for some time and had no clue what to do to help herself.  It was very hard to watch the film. It was like watching a movie where all the good scenes are missed by the director.  This film was awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this at the cinema with my daughter and her friend. I thought the film was not so bad and the story was good. I did not like the movie but the plot kept me interested.   This is not the best movie ever but it has some interesting characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen this movie only once before and the only thing I remember about this movie is it was about a dog and there was a fight in the theater with a guy and his dog. This movie is so bad that I want to never go to a movie theater again.   The only reason the movie is bad is the characters. The only actor in this movie that I remember is Jeff Daniels who played the lawyer.  A dog is a friend to the kids and this dog does not seem to be friends with the other dogs in the movie.  The dog is not real and does not have any personality at all. It does not act like a dog.  They should have used an actual dog for this movie and it should have been about two dogs or at least a dog with a dog friend.  As a dog you would have acted like a real dog in this type of movie. This dog did not seem like a friend at all and acted like an enemy.  I remember seeing this movie when I was younger and I just could not believe that they would use a real animal as a villain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is not good. It's a poor excuse for a movie and if you have nothing better to do you could at least wait a month before watching it. It seems like they took the basic plot of the book and then used it as the basis for a terrible movie. There are so many errors in the script, characterizations, plot and acting. I hate to see such a bad script used as the foundation for a shitty movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "There have been more ridiculous things done in a movie than this" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had to buy this movie because it's not listed on iTunes and I wanted it.   The actors were not great.  The story wasn't that interesting.  I'm not sure why it wasn't made in another country.  In the original, it was about a small town's young woman. In this version, it's about a woman (the young woman) who is about to be married to a rich man.  They both have the same name, but the man's family is from a different country, so he asks her to marry him and they can move to that country. It's supposed to be about her making a living and getting a better education for her kids, but I didn't like that because it wasn 't really written that way.  It was really more like one long movie about her (the woman) and her family and her husband (the man) and the whole town and how they're all in love with her.  And the plot never really got going, but it's so over the top and ridiculous that it doesn't matter.  If you don't like these kinds of movies, I don't know what you're watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot was pretty much the same as a lot of bad movie plots. The only difference was, I didn't really think it was bad because I could tell the actors knew what they were doing.   It was just a lot to take in.  The cast, for the most part, did a decent job. There was the one star that is definitely a spoiler...the best part about that is, the actor who played him was the same actor who did all of the other evil characters in the movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie has some decent jokes and decent acting but this movie is just a horrible waste of time.  Not only is the movie very unfunny but also it has a very bad ending.  It really should not be in the "bad movie" category because it was just really a waste of a movie.  The story was terrible and it was really slow.  I really just wish I could have seen something else.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very lame movie, very lame.   It is one of those things where you just want to punch it in the face.  It has so much crap in it.  I mean you could watch it in like 15 minutes and it would have enough crap in there for hours.  You would watch this movie over and over again.  Why is it so popular?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm a big fan of films that explore the "what if" of life. When I'm bored and I get a bad itch to watch a movie, I always turn to these kind of films. For instance, in the last week I've watched the two parts of this movie, and they were both just fine movies. I'm just sad about the lack of a follow-up to this movie that has been promised.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are looking for a good movie, then this is not the movie for you.   You will be stuck with a movie that has almost no plot and even less ideas and is just a bunch of people having a party.  You don't get to see them do anything except drink and have sex, except the sex scenes.  Even the people that are supposed to be the good guys are pretty messed up, and they only work because they are the good guy in the movie, and don't want to be in the scene and can't be seen as bad guys.  I would never recommend this movie, but if you are in the mood to watch a movie with not a lot of substance, and just want to see a bunch people have a party, this is it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst part is that I would have loved to see this one on a silver screen, if there ever was a great horror flick.   I have to admit I have watched this film like 30 times. I was really happy to see it on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am a bit disappointed in this movie. This movie isn't all that great, the acting is awful and there is only a couple of great scenes in the whole film. The director is not a great director and it is sad that he only made this movie so he can try to make money.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was an awful movie, I didn't think it was a good idea to watch this movie. It wasn't good quality, it was terrible. Not only that but it made me feel awful for the other person who had to sit through this movie as it was awful. If you have the money and don't want to waste it on a bad film, then I suggest you avoid this film and watch something else instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is full of cheesy special effects, cheesy plot twists, cheesy dialog, cheesy acting, and a cheesy ending.   It's a terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a terrible mistake. It's the worst movie i've ever seen. The actors who played the characters didn't even act like they were in a movie. I've never been so disgusted to see a movie where the acting is all wrong.    They could've filmed it from a TV, and the movie would have been better, but instead they just filmed in the street!   The film was only made to be shown to celebrities, because this movie was a success, and they had to go to the people who liked the movie to make a movie like this, and now the people like the movie were the ones who watched the film.  And now everyone's going to be watching this movie because there's no way it could have been any good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst bad movie I have ever seen.  I think it was shot on an iPhone 5 and some of the effects are horrible.   It was just too bad to watch.      If you are going to watch this movie, you better get your wallet out for a change. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is horrible. It's not even about a murder or anything like that, but more like a crime, just a random act of violence that goes on in a city. When I first heard that this was supposed to be a documentary, I thought it was a documentary about gangs, which would make sense, but then I found out this movie is about gangsters, which is far more interesting and shows us how these guys make their money, by kidnapping people.   I think this movie, and the rest of the "Hustle & Flow" series are too similar to the 80s gangster movies, like "Dirty Harry".   For those of you who are into that stuff, this movie will be even more entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never saw this movie before and it seems very silly and a little lame.   One of the actors is a guy who is played by his dog, and he goes around doing all this goofy stuff. The dog isn't much good and most of it is very silly, and I was bored the whole time.  And the dog doesn't do anything else than being there, and it's kind of cute!   The only good thing I can say about this movie is the kids singing "We Didn't Start the Fire" at the end.  I wish I could have seen it at a less stupid time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst   movies ever made. I was so disgusted with this movie. I have never seen so much ****ing **** that was so ****ing bad.   I've seen worse, but not as bad as this movie has become. I don't like it anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story was awful. The cast was horrible. The special effects were terrible. I saw this movie when it was on TV, and it really did not look like a "sci-fi" movie. I will never watch a science-fiction film again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, the only reason I was in this is because I needed to have something on my shelf to watch when my husband gets home from work. The actors are pretty good, and there is nothing wrong with the movie other than it not being able to carry a plot. The dialogue, while not the best in the movie, is pretty good.   The ending is terrible.  I hate the ending of all these "great" movies because it is too perfect, and it kills any tension the rest of the movie has.  This is one of those movies that is a movie that you don't really watch it to enjoy it. It is a bad film for the money and for the actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had not heard of the book before watching this movie, and was a bit skeptical when I heard there was a TV movie out.   This movie is not worth watching, it is not bad.  The movie is based on a book and the actor playing the "man in the hat" is so stiff and unfunny that he has a hard time doing it.  In my opinion the book was much better.  When the "Man in the Hat" starts explaining what he does he says "I look at people. If they're not in the right position, I make them look like fools. If a man is looking at a woman, he has his penis up in the air.  "  In the book the man in the costume is very clever, he knows how to turn things on, and look into the eyes of the woman he is trying to seduce. He looks into their eyes and makes them look stupid and foolish.  It was a lot more exciting when he was in the "black costume" and he knew exactly what he was doing.  What makes the movie even worse is that it is based so loosely on the book, which means the script is terrible.  I was not entertained at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has a great cast of characters, especially in the two leads who are so good together. The characters are very believable and the movie is very well written. The only problem is the ending. I have read the story twice and was hoping that they could make a better ending than what they do. It was sad to see them end with the death of the first wife, which I felt was a great twist that really didn't work. A nice idea, but not the ending they should have come up with. It seems that most of the actors are still alive and I don't think that there will be any way of fixing that ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not even funny when they mention that there's a "porn star" (who looks exactly like her) in the movie. You really need to get that movie to watch with a good movie fan to watch it and they'll understand what they are looking at. It's like watching a bad film at a porn shop.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this a negative, but you can't rate a bad film without taking away from it a bit. The story is not a bad one, the film is quite entertaining, but it has some flaws. The acting is just awful, and the cinematography is very poorly done, and all the costumes and effects are cheap. Some people would have laughed at some of the scenes in the movie.   The movie is really just very slow, there is a lot of background music, and sometimes you have to focus on one scene in the entire film to appreciate it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has a lot of flaws, but overall it is enjoyable.   The acting is really good (even if the characters do nothing) and I love the music, but the acting is just not there.  The story is really simple and there's no real tension.  While the acting isn't terrible, the movie is really unmemorable.  Even though it's supposed to be a horror film, it really seems like a parody of a lot.  I would suggest avoiding this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts with a great bang. It was a really fun movie to watch. I've never seen it before and I thought it was quite enjoyable. The movie had quite an impact. It kept you entertained and made you want to watch the next one.  I think I would like this movie more than the last.    For a comedy film, the plot is pretty good.  The movie was made before there was a huge cult following. There were probably around 200 copies of this film in circulation.  So, I guess, the movie had a bit of a cult following at the time.  After all, the film was not that well received.  It was released in theaters after all.  What's nice is that the movie is quite funny. It has that "classic" feel that some people enjoy.  There were some funny things in this movie too.  But there is no need to re-watch the film in order to understand it.  For those who have seen it, you'll understand.  If you've never had a chance to see it, then you probably don't deserve it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved this movie but it made me want to watch the original Star Wars.   It was okay I guess? I don't know why they didn't get rid of Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher (who is good in this movie).   If it was up to me they should have just cut out the whole Star Wars thing and made an action movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is based on the book " The Secret of the Sphinx " by Arthur C. Clarke. The movie itself is about a group of soldiers who must leave their own town to go on a long and dangerous trip. Their job? To go to the Sphynx, the ancient Egyptian Sphinx. They are in the middle of nowhere, and don't speak Egyptian, so their job is to help them to find it.   This movie is a pretty good movie. It's got some great set pieces, it has a decent acting cast, and the acting is pretty good. However, there is only one thing in this movie that is absolutely NOT necessary to the plot.  The " Sphinx ".  It's a joke and I don't know if you could call it a movie. The story takes place in the 1940's, and there is one huge, very old looking statue of a Sphinx with two children sitting at the foot of it. The Sphinx is very realistic. It is about 6 feet tall, the face is very old and wrinkled, and it's made of stone. They had a very long "journey" in order to get to the top of the mountain.  This was the "Spydini" movie and it was very boring. I'd rather have watched a real Spydini movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I got this because I saw a friend say that it was "the worst movie ever made". Well he may be right but I would say it's a close second to "Bambi" which was a real disappointment.   This movie was terrible. It felt like someone took the worst parts of "The Bad News Bears" and tried to make it more adult.  When I heard this was based on a children's book I was ready for it but the writing was so awful.  The acting was terrible too and a few of the actors did not look right.  It's hard to imagine this would be anything but a kids movie but it's so bad.  I don't like being told what to think or to do in a children movie.  There are so many things wrong with it. There's a scene where a character is told they can't wear pants so he's stripped naked. When they ask him why he won't do it he replies "why not?".  There's also a scene of a little girl in the woods that is asked what kind of flowers she wants to have. She answers "anything".  This is really just one more example of what's wrong with the movie. A movie should make you laugh or cry or even think about something. This movie doesn't do any of those things. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A good movie, but one of the worst I've seen in years.       This movie is really the epitome of a bad time in the 70s.  This is a bad idea to make a movie in the seventies, but they had no one else to do it so they did it.  The plot is good, but the acting is terrible.  They play a bunch of roles (all of which are horrible).   I don't really blame them, they were all so horrible.  I love the movie and think the actors do a pretty good job of portraying the era and the personalities. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are so many problems with this movie. I was just wondering what the hell happened. I didn't want to go to see this. I asked my friends and they told me there was no way I would watch this. It was just boring and un-eventful. It seemed like no one had a clue. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this movie a few months ago from Amazon, hoping it would make me feel old and stop caring about the latest Hollywood blockbuster, but after seeing it it makes me laugh every single time, and the actor's acting is so good. The movie is about a group of people who try to steal a painting and end up getting caught. I have never seen this movie before and I was very impressed with the acting in the movie. I will definitely be checking out the movie again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie itself is pretty cool. It features an action packed story with some cool stunts. It was all cool and all I did was admire the actors. Unfortunately there are just so many plot holes in the movie that I could have watched the entire movie from beginning to end and not have a clue what was going on. I think it's very easy to see that this movie had an actual script, but a lot of times when you watch a movie with a script you can usually tell where it's going to end up.   It ends up being a movie I'd want to watch on my own, just to see what kind of crazy stunts they could pull. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My mom was a big Star Wars fan in the 80s. She bought me the second edition of the 1977 "Special Edition" and I read through all the stories of Alderaan that were not in the film and even read the Star Wars: A New Hope script.  She bought it so she could read all the books on it and then I saw a movie based on the book that was really crappy and that's how I learned all the story.  There were all the characters who were not on the movie in the book and some of them even had names and they were some of my favorite characters in the movie.  It was a good time when it came out, but it took me years to come around to the way it should have been made and not like a cartoon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an insult to every movie lover out there. The acting is pathetic. The director just seems to be going through the motions, and the film is bad. I can't believe this movie will be released, let alone have the reviews that it has. The movie should be called "The Worst Movie Ever".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I have seen in ages.   Not worth a single second of your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most annoying movie i ever seen   What is this movie all about?   When i saw this movie i was like no way.   It was the most boring movie i have ever seen.  Why do you keep showing it over and over?  I don't remember the whole movie.  There is just a lot of bad acting and bad script.  The characters are not even interesting or likeable.  They are all very stereotypical.  My only regret is that the whole film is about the mother and not about her daughter.  I really wanted to see her.  This movie is so bad.  "The most boring film i ever saw" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My husband and I watched this movie several times before we bought the DVD. It was not very good. This movie was terrible. The only good thing about this movie was the two amazing actors who played the two lovers.    I saw this movie about 4 years ago and was really looking forward to seeing them play the roles. Sadly I have to say this movie sucked. I found the acting and acting choices of the actors pretty ridiculous.  I really hope the actors and director get paid for this role. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie should have been called 'How to do a double barrel salute with a gun.'   This is a pretty good movie at the end of the day, but is not worth seeing for anyone.   If you need to get some action in, go back and watch the 'Rocky Balboa' movie with Sylvester Stallone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a really bad movie. The acting is very bad, and the plot is so stupid. The "good guys" (who are really just psychopaths) have to be punished, and so they kill a bunch of innocent people, and make it look like a "rescue mission". The only problem with this movie is that the movie is just terrible and not worth watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was boring, the director was a terrible director, and there were a lot of technical problems. The main problem was that he shot most of the action in the middle of a small park, which meant that the shot of the monster was pretty useless. The special effects were also terrible and almost laughable, as the only way the creature moves are by hopping from one spot to another and they didn't have any realistic motion to give them any credibility. It was also annoying to see the monsters constantly changing their color and the same colors for each monster, as well as the fact that most of them looked just like the monsters in the original movie, so most of their effects were just that.    I give this one a 3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie 3 stars because there's a couple of things that I didn't like about it.   First of all, the acting is bad.  I think the director put some actors in the wrong roles.  The only other actor who doesn't look like an idiot is the character of the boy.  Also the movie is very long.  It was probably 5 hours long. (The director cut it to 3 hours in the DVD.)   But, the good parts are the funny moments.  There's a scene where the boy is going to the toilet and he's seen by a guy in a mask.  When the boy sees him he asks the guy if he knows who he is and he answers that he is an assassin for a group called XIX.   The guy who was the assassin has a great sense of humor.    The other good things are the explosions, the costumes and the acting.  These are a couple things a fan of martial arts movies could appreciate. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. The acting was awful. The plot was bad. The editing was terrible. The production values were awful. I'd never watch it again. It was just that bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie. I just don't understand why the makers of this film felt it was necessary to make a movie like this.   I was excited for this movie and even though I was in no mood to sit through this movie, it was still nice to see the stars of the movie.  For a movie about a "totally different" group of people, they are all wearing the same makeup, same clothes, and have the same voice.  They all have the mentality of the typical person you see in this movie. These people never change and are all in the same spot, and they have a lot of fun.  I also found the dialogue to be very boring and annoying.  The movie was just silly.  This movie was probably made for a comedy type movie where the main characters would make fun of each other.  There was no reason why this movie was made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like the idea of this movie. I like a lot of things about it, like the story and the cast. However, the movie just isn't all that great. The acting was great, and I'm really enjoying some of the other parts of the movie. The writing is not so good. The plot was good for the first 30 minutes or so, but then it went off the rails. There were so many things that I couldn't quite understand. It also really took a long time for the movie to get going. I know the movie was intended to be a part of the cult classic series, but when this movie came out, it was really out of place. The music was OK, but I think that the original soundtrack is better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The last 15 minutes of this movie was a mess of cheap shots, bad sound design, over the top acting, and bad production values. What a waste of time to put this movie together.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm so disappointed in this movie.   This movie is just a bad film.  The acting is really bad.  It is just one bad acting movie after another.  We get no great actors in this film. We get some actors that you see in other films.  Why would you make a movie like this with this kind of acting?  I don't know if it was just bad talent or if it just wasn't planned.  But I was not in the mood for this movie after watching the other one.  In my opinion, I just don't like actors like this.  I think they should go get a real job and just start working in real movies.  There is no story line and I couldn't follow it at all.  No one ever tells a good story in this kind, cheesy movie.    There are some bad scenes in this. But the good parts are really good.  They tried to make this movie funny, but it just doesn't work.  Just bad acting and no story.  If you like this kind movie that is just too bad, just wait and see if this movie will be released again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie i have ever seen! The acting is terrible! the plot is stupid! the acting is bad! the story is stupid. i am sick of seeing this crap all over the movies, and this one was awful! i would have never bought this movie because of the way the acting was and because of how badly it was written. It was completely boring and the actors had no talent. The story is a waste of time! i am not sure why the director went with this plot. the story does not make sense and i can not believe the director made this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   Just got this one and I'm so dissapointed.  The characters are so shallow. They don't have any real development except for one side of a couple of the characters. The plot is weak. I don't get how they are supposed to defeat the bad guy unless he has one hundred thousand henchmen.  I will not be giving this one another chance.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is bad. The plot is so stupid that you don't need to watch the film to be insulted by it. The characters are so shallow that they make no sense at all. The acting is bad and most of the dialogue is too cheesy to be funny. The director is an idiot. You have no reason to even bother watching this film. I don't even want to watch another movie made by this man. - July 29, 2004 - July 28, 2004 by Timmy
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A boring, unimaginative movie, that the producer was forced to produce after the success of his film, a film about a crazy doctor.   The director of this movie did not care about what he was making and he did not show the film to anyone other than his friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know what people mean by a "disaster"   It's a pretty terrible movie.   The actor who plays the main guy never really has an identity, but he has some sort of power.  He's one of the people who does "research" on the "lives" of the children and their parents, and he talks like a complete moron.  His lines are always so badly delivered that you'll want to run out and buy a cheap copy of The People vs. O.J. Simpson to watch this movie over and over.  And there's another one of those bad actors that seems to have a knack for this.  It always seems that the actors are too busy doing all the work for the actors.  The movie has no personality of its own and it's hard to look at it and not think, "This is going to go down as one of, if not THE worst movie ever made."   So far, I've seen it twice and both times the movie was so bad I had to sit through the whole thing just to get through it the first time.  A film with such a bad attitude is hard to recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You have to be a bit of a masochist to see this film.   The whole point of the film is to be tortured and make you suffer.  It is a truly disgusting film. And it was a cheap movie at that.  What happened to quality control.  This is a good film for horror fans.  If you are not one of those people, don't look for it.  The actors are not very good.  There are a few scenes that would be more interesting if there was something better behind them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A truly terrible movie. The acting was poor, and the story was just a load of bollocks. The special effects were amateurish, and one of the girls looked more like a "toddler".   And then there's the editing and sound.   I'm surprised they actually bothered making a movie with such a poor script.  This is a terrible movie, so make sure you watch it in the theater at least.  If you hate women, stay away from this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    * I wish this movie had stayed as a cult classic, so that we could all enjoy the wonderful characters, the amazing and funny dialogue, the clever and sly story and the great acting. But that's a wish.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen some bad movies.   This is the worst movie   I have had the displeasure of watching.  The story is very poor. There is a kid who is a bit of a freak. The kid goes to a doctor who tells him that he can't be cured, he is "a weirdo". The kid is very disturbed.  I was just left wanting nothing more than to punch this kid's face into the ground and throw him off a cliff.  If you are trying to tell a story or explain a science fact to the viewer you could have done it much better and I would have enjoyed your movie much more.  It does make for a good little science fiction movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was very bad and I have been seeing this kind of movies for almost 20 years. I don't understand why someone would make this kind movies with such poor acting and with the same bad plot. When they should have shot this movie, it was done. The actors were not good at all. The worst actor in the movie was the one playing a cop.   A lot of people are disappointed in this movie because it is not worth seeing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a great movie and it has a very funny plot, but the acting was terrible. The actors don't know how to act. The girl's were not good and the girl that was supposed to be the girl's best friend is a horrible actress.   I really like the movies that I saw in the 70's and early 80's.  My favorite is "Ghost".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the worst movie I've ever seen. This is a story about a young man who has a crush on a girl who's mother has a heart attack, and he takes the girl into his house, and they live together and get to know each other. The first half of the movie is about them living together, and getting to know one another. But when the mother dies, and the girl goes back home to get her stuff, they become even closer. When the girl's father dies, his son is in the military, and is in a war zone. In order to survive the war, he has to kill anyone that he sees, including women. I found this to be very hard to watch, and I just didn't understand what was going on. It's a very cheesy movie with a very corny plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie starts very well. But then the movie goes downhill. The script is all over the place and I really think that the director was going to show an interesting scene from the bible (Jesus) but instead decided to show a bunch of people at a picnic. The actors are great in the movie and they're supposed to be really bad asses. The characters are not funny and the movie is really boring.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director of this film never takes himself too seriously as he makes a good film and does have some funny moments.  The only problem is that the cast of this movie are so terrible that it is a pain to watch.  For example, when the guy who plays the man with a ponytail falls in the pool and loses his voice while his wife screams for help he just continues to get better and better at this game.   This is like being in a car accident and thinking you might not even remember who your wife is, but that you are still driving the car that just went off the road. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie itself is a pretty good movie.  The plot seems well thought out.  There are some problems with the movie, but these are minor and shouldn't be blamed on the movie. The problems are just that.  This movie does have some cool scenes, but most of the movie does not seem to be very funny. The movie also doesn't seem to have much story or plot.   A lot of the people in the movie don't really seem to mean anything.  They are in it for the money and for the sex.  It looks like most of them are really into each other and seem to enjoy the whole scene.  One guy keeps looking at another guy's penis.  Another guy is constantly looking into other people's eyes.  Even though the movie is supposed to be really hot, it has a very low rating and seems to be nothing more than just someone trying to make a quick buck. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The original was a terrible movie.  This was a sequel but did not bother with any of the original film's badness. The acting was terrible. It is just bad.  The director was in jail at the time and when he returned it was bad. It had to be rewritten many times to try and make it sound better.    This is the worst movie I have ever seen and I was a child at the times of this movie. It was the worst of the '90s. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is all about the guy getting laid, and while I enjoyed it, it really wasn't worth it.   And what's with all the women in the movie?   It's a pretty good film, but I thought it was rushed and had some ridiculous things happen.  The acting was pretty good, although some of the guys weren't that great (though some of them were still entertaining).  I was expecting something more serious, but the plot is really not that great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is about a guy and his girlfriend that decide to get married. I didn't really care for it. It was a little slow at times and there are some awkward moments. For example, there is an incident where the guy gets the bride's clothes dirty (not really a big deal) but the bride doesn't really mind because she already has dirt on her clothes. She gets annoyed and gets up to go change. She leaves her underwear and other dirty clothes on the bed. Then, she comes back and sees the clothes on a shelf. She asks him to take the clothes off but he doesn't. She freaks out and shouts for him to "come and clean up!" This just annoyed me a little. She comes back a few minutes later with the dirty underwear and a little note saying, "here's the dirty clothes." It just felt like she didn't care or was just being childish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, this is the kind of film that should have been put into the public domain years ago. The acting is terrible, the acting director should be ashamed of himself, and the editing is completely amateurish. The only thing that would work in this movie is an amateur made "wedding video", and that is only a little more than this movie was worth in my opinion.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would only recommend this to a kid who really likes action/drama/thrillers.   The plot is okay, but it really isn't the best.  It's a kid that wants to be a hero, but never is able to be one.  A few of the characters do a decent job, and they're all enjoyable to watch, but nothing really stands out.  I also found it really disappointing when we don't really learn who the bad guys are.  When you know who the villain is, it really makes you feel bad for the kid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film that I don't think has the right tone for young audiences or kids. There are so many things in it that are so wrong that it really makes it hard to enjoy.   I didn't really know what to think of the film until I saw it. It has so many bad things in the movie and the editing and sound is just terrible.  There are some really bad things to mention with this film. The acting is all over the place and it just makes you feel bad about yourself when you have to see something that this movie deserves. I guess a great actor and director can make a really bad movie good.  The movie is supposed to be about a young girl but the movie never shows her at all. This is the first film that i've seen that was just made to piss off people. This movie is a complete piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was not that bad, but I was under the impression that the entire film was going to be made by this guy called  Paul Thomas Anderson. When the film started, I thought he was going with a similar style as his previous film  The Master  with lots of camera and lighting. However, I was left disappointed when I realized that he made just another low budgeted Hollywood movie.   There's a very short scene that shows a little girl and her mother getting out of a car and then walking into a home. After that, it's just shots of the girl in a school classroom, with the mother talking to a teacher. After the scene ended, the camera pans to the family entering their home and then going back into the classroom.  After that little scene, we go back to the mother and the girl playing on the floor.  I felt like there were so many scenes in the film that had nothing to do with the plot.  It wasn't that this was bad; it was just disappointing that this film wasn't made by the legendary Paul Thomas/ The Master director, but was instead just a cheap Hollywood film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie which has so much potential.   It was a bad idea to release a bad film in the 80s which was meant to be a remake of a bad Hollywood film.  It really made me want to go out and buy an  Atari 2600 to mess around with the Atari games.  When it came out on VHS I didn't like it.  The actors were pretty terrible and the story wasn't that interesting.  A real shame because the movie was an attempt to get the money the movie would have cost for an actual movie.  I'm glad the VHS tape survived to be scanned. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was hoping that I would be able to sit down in front of the TV for a good, honest movie for one evening, but this film made me so sad that I could not do so.   It seems that the production cost had gone up and there were so many issues in it that no one could take the production seriously. I mean it was a $35 million movie, why would they need to be so badly edited that it looks like someone ran over their hand with a rusty hammer or made the camera shake all over the place?  The actors, as usual, looked great and the actress who played the girlfriend had the best character. I guess I should not be surprised that the producer made sure that she got no credit for any of the scenes, but I feel sorry for the poor actors, who had to deal with this mess.  I think it is time for Hollywood to grow up and stop wasting time on movies like this, and to start spending more time making great, original movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has its issues, but it is still a very good action flick and I would definitely recommend it.   It was a really fun movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really wish I had read the reviews first! This movie is NOT worth the money, and if you like anything in the horror genre, don't bother!   The story is a total bore. You see a small girl that gets into a car that starts acting strange, and then she freaks out. The kid is in real danger and I never felt she was in any real danger.   This is a movie to watch while drunk or on a long drive.  I don't think it was made for adults and not many people like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is absolutely NOT worth the money spent on it.   First off, the movie has no story. It's just a bunch of actors acting in an acting challenge.  Second off, they spent more time trying to be funny than they did acting.  Third off, you don't really get to see any of the actual "stars" in the movie (the ones who do get to act were bad at it) because they all have to act in different scenes, which makes it hard to tell who is who.  A couple of the actresses do get some nice closeups of their faces though, and the one who was most convincing in the whole movie was Rachel McAdams. I thought she was amazing.  If you really want to see a bunch people act like they are in a acting challenge, watch something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie sucks! It had a terrible plot, acting, story, and just plain boring!   You are watching an old movie of the early 60's in which an old lady is murdered, and you think she is the main character?   And then you realize that the actress was in the movie in the role of a "woman", and she is just a prostitute!  I would not give this movie a chance.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am sorry but I cannot stand this movie. I know the story, and it sounds cool, but it was so hard to watch. I hate that it is supposed to be a drama, and yet it was only a really lame drama. A couple of actors really ruined it.   The whole thing was really annoying and I am not sure why the producers hired such actors. The actress that played the woman who was shot in the head really needed to be hit a lot harder by a man's gun. She is really a pathetic looking woman and I don't want her anywhere near me or the other women in this movie, and I have never been more offended by a movie.  This movie is a terrible movie that really doesn't have anything to do with any other movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had no expectations. I did not think it would be as good as it was.   The plot was poor, and the acting was very, very bad.  The actors did not seem to know what they were doing, and it was horrible to watch.  This movie was terrible, and I would not recommend it to anyone.  I thought this was going to be better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not a huge fan of action movies but this was a bad one, the special effects were terrible and the acting was bad at the least.   I am a big fan of movies from the 80's but this is one of the worst movies from that era. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think that the director had to put this movie together before he could even film another one. I was hoping that this would have been a decent movie, but it was not. The story is awful and I would not watch this movie again. The acting was all over the place. The only thing that kept this movie from being a complete waste of time is that it was one of the few good ones that were not made by the same people.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am disappointed in the quality of this movie. I think the actors did a good job, but the acting really didn't help. The actors seem nervous and awkward all the time. This is not a film to watch alone.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are looking for a movie with a good story and good action, then this is it.   Not only that, but it has some great actors. The story itself isn't that great, but the actors do a good job.  I would suggest this film for the older crowd, as it is more of an adventure movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those terrible movies with a terrible acting. The only character I was really happy to see, was the character that is played by Robert Mitchum, he's got this really weird laugh and really annoying attitude and you really don't know what to do with him, he was great in "King Kong" and "The Last Man on Earth", and he was a great choice to be this strange character.    What the movie is, is a bad retelling of the classic movie, called "The Wizard of Oz", with the character of the little girl that is supposed to be the daughter of the evil witch of the west.  She is supposed be a child and then a young adult but we're not shown her childhood or adult years.  When she's six or seven years old, she is given a magic lantern by the wizard who is supposed come down out of the sky and tell her she's a witch. She uses the lantern and she is made a witch who uses magic to torment people and then she takes the children of the town and makes them into the Wicked Witch of the West.  I didn't think the movie was bad, but the acting was awful and so was the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had a great time at this movie. It was a fun ride and was entertaining at times. The only bad part was the movie director. He is too lazy to make good movies. He did not know how to shoot a movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie will not entertain you. It is boring and unoriginal.   A group of women who love to play house play poker. They have a few rules that they keep to themselves, but the other house players don't. They are constantly breaking the rules and playing with the guys to see who can break the rules the most. One of the house players, who is gay, is married to a female player and they have a great relationship. He has a few secret lovers that he lets in on their relationship. One is a woman who he is in love with but the house player doesn't approve of that. There are also secret lovers who are all in the same house. They all have secrets and try to keep their lives separate.  To get a good movie you need to understand that this is a bad version of a story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I am sure there were better films released in 1976 but this movie was definitely not worth seeing.   There was nothing in this movie that was of real importance.  There are plenty of other movies released in the year that were much better.  One of the worst examples was the film The Great Escape.  So why was this movie worth seeing?  There were a few people who made this movie so they could use the name to promote their new movie.  Another reason this movie would have been good was because it would have had some action to it.  But the action was weak and I think this is the most boring movie made this year.  My favorite film of the year is the great sci-fi movie Independence Day.  This movie was a great homage to the original movie, but this new director didn't really make the film into what it should have been.  It would have helped to have a few good actors to take this movie over the top.  I could go on about this movie but it's been done better in the past.  And it isn't worth watching for those who really want to see some action. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is crap. It's a boring movie, and it's a very slow movie, even though you watch it for a long time. And the acting is pretty bad. It was a movie with many actors that didn't stand out much at all.   The main actor is very old and looks like a washed up actor, and the other actors look as if they were trying to emulate him.  If you look closely at the actress who plays a character named Jodie, you can see that her eyes are all swollen and there is a huge bump on her head.  She looks like she is almost 80 years old, and she's trying to look like a younger person.  It seems that there were a lot of times in the movie when they didn't know what they were doing, and there are a lot more cuts than scenes, so you can't see much of what happens in the scene.  The movie doesn't end in a good way, it just ends, and you don't know why.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My son and I had a fantastic time at this movie. It has a fun, kid-friendly, light-hearted feel to it. There are plenty of laughs and light-headed fun, but there's also a lot of real heart and character development in it. It's a fun little comedy that's fun to watch, too. The cast is pretty decent, and the special effects look great (I wish the animators would do a little better with them).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. It is all action scenes and they are not even entertaining. The plot is stupid and the bad acting and the slow pace make it even worse. It has almost no humor and is boring as hell. Even the director says that he was trying to make a political movie but failed miserably. This movie should have been called, "It's a long movie and it is not very funny."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a bad B. It is a movie I really wanted to enjoy but as you can tell by the rating I gave it I am not a fan of this genre of movies.   The story is very boring and you do not get to find out what happens to the women who take the money from the big guys to go on the cruise.  It is just that simple.  My only enjoyment was from watching the people who were trying to do drugs and being stopped by the cops.  I really do not understand how they were able to make this movie.  They should have made it with real life actors so the audience could see what went on behind the scenes.  Also the ending of the movie was very poorly done.  The girl had a very big smile on her face when she walked away.  You do not see that on the girl she took money from.  So the ending was very poor.  Overall I would not recommend this movie to anybody. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My son and I both love this movie.   The kids get into trouble and the parent has to bail them out.  I thought the whole film was so exciting.  It was just like the movies that I used to watch with my dad when I was a kid.  My one gripe was that they had to show us all the kids running around so they could explain what had happened to them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had really high expectations for this movie. I thought it would be a good thriller/mystery/myth/etc.  The movie didn't live up to those expectations.  I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time, but this one just didn't work for me.   The plot was good, and a little mysterious, but the characters didn't make any sense.  They seemed to be doing what they had to do to keep the people around them safe. It was really confusing to me how the people in the movie were doing things to keep everyone safe, and why they were the ones who were being hurt.  In the end, there was a twist that made no sense at all. It almost felt like someone was playing a trick on me. It just made no logical sense at ALL.  One thing I can say about the movie was that there was some really good acting in it. And there was one scene that really made me laugh out loud.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I have seen. If you do not like horror movies, this is the movie for you. The story was really silly and made no sense to me. I don't know why it was made, but there was no reason why the director did not have someone who knows about horror movies work on this movie. The actors were horrible. The guy who plays the guy who wants to die was terrible. All he could say was, "Go to hell" and did not do anything. He was just there for the story and it was a really weird movie. All the people with no personalities were all pretty horrible. There were so many of them in the movie and I didn't get a good laugh at all. The music is also not very good and sounds just as bad. The effects and lighting was horrible and the acting was bad as well. I had to stop watching this movie at 3:00 in the morning because I didn a headache from the horrible acting and the terrible acting. I have to hand it to the director, but he did not use enough actors.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is full of bad actors, bad direction, and a lack of a good script.   There are many scenes where they are talking about how the film is going to be about two men trying to take down an entire city. That's exactly what it is, a bunch of criminals trying to steal a huge truckload of cash from some bank, and then a chase of the truck, then all of them running away from the bank, then one of the guys gets killed.  I thought it would be a great way to get a few different actors in a scene to showcase different characters.  This is not the movie for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had no intention of watching this movie, but was forced to once a friend (who is also a fan of The Lord of the Rings) told me about it. The story is a little convoluted and I wasn't sure where things were going, but this movie isn't for everyone. The acting in the movie is really bad and I never understood why the director thought the actors had to act all crazy. They were actually in character. The characters didn't have a lot of depth and there was never a sense of character development. It's basically a one-dimensional, self-aggrandizing, "I'm right and you're wrong" movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't see this movie until years later and it left me in a lot of pain.  I thought that the movie was funny but not funny at all.   It was very depressing and sad at times.  The characters were really stupid and did all the things that were suppose to make them interesting.  If it was a drama the characters would have been more interesting. The only good thing that could be said about it is that they made it about a love triangle but there were way too many characters.  There was a good reason why it was made in the 70's and that was to sell the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a pretty bad movie. It was not bad in the least. It is about a cop named Bill who works as a plain clothes cop. He is a decent cop, and he has a problem with the "new generation" of black gangsters. I had no problem with Bill. I liked him. I felt that he knew how to deal with the situation. The "new era" was an exaggeration and an idea. There were no real black gangs in Los Angeles then, as there are now. The people in this movie were not the actual people in the "New Ghetto".   This movie is filled with errors, especially for the time. One mistake was the "ghetto". There were not "ghettos" then, just small places scattered about the city. Also, the film doesn't have any blacks. They are mostly in a "new world" in the old "glorious" Hollywood movie. The black people in L.A. are not the black people that appear in most movies from that era. The real blacks were not from "the ghetto". The real gangsters were not black. Most were Irish.   There were some other good things about this movie. They did make a good job of making a movie about the times.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I know the movies are good but the film is bad. I am not a big horror fan but I saw this and I was very shocked. The acting was bad and I don't know what was going on. It looked like a nightmare from a horror movie. It was just not scary at all. It just looked silly and not scary. The actors were not trying to act like they were being scary and not being scared. It looks like they are having fun with it and not trying too hard. The music was good and I really like the music. The sound effects are great though.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts off with a good idea; a story about a woman and her little dog on a long journey. The story takes a bit of a turn, however, as the film focuses on the dog. The poor dog's condition is clearly shown, and the scene is a very unfortunate one. The ending, where the dog is given a little rest before going on to its next adventure is very lame, and is nothing more than a cheap ploy to get viewers to watch the next film, the one about a little dog, that was more of a bad joke than a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After watching this film, I thought:  I can't believe these people make movies.   I mean, it was a horrible movie and they just made it.  But the actors, the direction and the writing made this a horrible thing to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is awful, and as far as I can tell the plot was very poorly thought out. It was supposed to be a short movie, and yet it took nearly three hours to get through it. The acting is terrible, the acting was bad in the other films I saw as well, but this was the worst. The only good thing about it is the acting, and I can't even remember what they looked like. The plot was so poorly done, I thought it was a parody of old Westerns, which it isn't. This movie takes many different elements from the other movies and twists them on their head, and makes them completely stupid. For example, one of the characters in this movie has a wife, a son, and a dog. This woman is a huge coward, and never comes to help her husband, even though he is bleeding. The guy was so stupid that he let her die, and he never even took her body back to their house.   I've never been so disgusted by an American movie. I really hope the people who produced this movie got sued, because I would never see such a piece of crap again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If this movie had the best acting, the best writing, and the best special effects ever, it would have been a classic.   The script is just so bad.  They do the movie to make a buck.  All the actors in this movie were awful, and a few were barely there.  The only thing that makes the movie enjoyable is the special effects.  It just makes me wonder if they tried to animate some real animals or something and it just came out all messed up.  There was nothing else of interest in this whole movie.  I am still disappointed in the movie.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was a bit confused by this movie, but I think I know why it was so good. The actors were great and their characters had very believable voices. A movie that is not very complicated. If you like fantasy, action, comedy or horror, this movie is for you.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read all the reviews for this movie. I had to see it before the reviews ruined it for me. This movie is good! The story is pretty good, it is a good film. The acting and story is great. The story doesn't really develop, but we are still happy with the ending.   The biggest problem I had was with the characters. All of the main characters are just plain weird. I like to see a character have a problem that they are trying to overcome, but they are just not good at it. The first guy, the big man that runs the whole thing, is the worst. The second guy is the only one that actually gets it. He has all of his own problems, but he has the best plan. The last guy is really weird.  The ending really sucks.  I'm going to tell you what I think the story is about, but it is going to ruin the whole story. There is a little boy, but its not his kid. He is a kid that someone stole from the town. They think it was their kid because the kid has a name. They call it "the kid", but he is actually not the kid.  When they take the kid back, the little boy asks, "why would you take my kid?" The other person is really confused, and the guy says he was trying to take back his kid, and then says they did it because someone put a bomb in the bus. The guy says the bus has a bomb on it, and he is going down the hill. They go to the bomb site, and they see the boy. They can't get the bus to go down the track, and so they take him to a different location.  After this, we are left on a road, and we hear a bomb goes off.  This leads us to the end of the film.  As I was watching this, I thought to myself, they just didn't really do anything with this movie other than to show the ending and a little mystery.  We end up with a little girl in a hospital, and a man that says, "I saved the little girl from the bomb."    And this movie is just okay!   This movie was not very funny, but I guess this movie will only work if you like weird movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read about this movie on the big screen (in London) when it was supposed to be on television. I'm glad it got a theatrical release. It's a fun movie about a kid with psychic powers who uses them to spy on his father. It has a funny plot, but the acting is awful. I think they should have cast the best actor in the movie, Steve Martin.    (The only reason this movie has a star rating is because it has an adult scene, but I don't think anyone really cares about that)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So this is one of the few movies I have seen where the plot was actually decent. As an action movie it does go on for a long time. There are a couple of good fight scenes but the movie doesn't really have much going on. I found it very easy to keep watching even though it was getting late. The only reason I gave this movie 3 stars is because of the way the story ends. It does go down some very strange and dark roads. There is a very weird, almost spiritual ending to the movie that isn't for everyone. Overall, I still enjoyed the movie and had a lot of fun watching it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main cast is all great, and the script was fantastic. However, the movie was really a disappointment. The special effects were good, but most of the actors and characters were terrible. The only actor that really had it go right was Michael Madsen. The movie is so long that you never feel like it is going to be over. The production value was good, with very bright and shiny film stock. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting was terrible, but the movie was bad, the director just wasn't good at directing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I love to watch westerns and cowboy movies. I bought this movie as a gift for her and it is the worst movie ever made. We never enjoyed the movies we bought but this is the last of the cowboy movies I bought. The sound was horrible and there is no acting in this movie. I will never watch any western or cowboy movie again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It wasn't as good as the last one, but it was good, and it was only 30 minutes.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just got this movie and it is so very much of a letdown that i think I will not watch it again, and maybe never. I don't understand why a lot of people are buying this movie. It is just not worth your time or money.    The movie is about a man who is looking for something, who meets two girls who are looking for the same thing. He talks them into taking a trip to the woods to look for the things but they don't get far before the evil creatures come out of the bushes. They both start killing people and then one of them is killed by one of the monsters.  The story is really interesting and they have some interesting monsters. One of the things that bugs me is that they only show the two girls and not the man and what they talked to them about. They should have shown the entire story but that would take a lot longer to show the characters and the creatures. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so wrong on every level that I was laughing out loud at one point.   They use a young woman to play a grown woman!   My boyfriend and I went to see this movie on Friday night and the theater was packed. They were showing this movie and I got the stink eye because I saw this movie for the first time and thought this was bad.  They had to have some kind of special effect because it looked like they cut out the middleman and hired a girl.  I'm just glad I went early so I could avoid the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is poorly made.   While it has a nice set of explosions it's actually an awful movie.  The script is stupid and the acting is really bad.  It's a cheap horror film that's made for the sake of cheap horror.  I hate horror films like this because they're so obvious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie, I loved it so much I got up at 4am the day before I was supposed to see it and started watching it. I got to the end and I had to turn it off, my brain was fried. I watched it again the next night and still felt nothing, I mean I still knew what I was seeing, but all the little details, the little jokes, all the tiny details I felt really weird about it.   It was so bad and I am such a sucker for a cheap comedy, that I had already bought a ticket for it. You've got to be kidding me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not sure what went wrong with this movie, but the acting was really bad.   A couple of the actors really don't sound like they had much of a chance.  A lot of the characters looked ridiculous.  Also, I thought the whole movie was over-budget.  I thought that it would have been a lot cheaper just to film a little part of the movie with actors who had a lot more experience.  If this movie is to be released to the public, this will surely be the reason. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is about a girl who decides she needs to do her part to stop the evil aliens from coming back to Earth. The plot is quite generic in the first half, and then it starts to get good. The first half is the good one, with great effects and good acting, but then after the third act, the movie just gets lost. The writing of the movie is bad and there are far too many plot holes, especially in the second half of the film. The alien invasion is way too fast. It just feels like they just go through town and there is no effort to establish a situation. You think there is a plan, but you don't have any idea how they are going to destroy the earth. The aliens are portrayed as being smart and well trained, and they are pretty scary too, but I would not be surprised if you don' have seen a different film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For a movie that's supposed to be about a family, there is absolutely zero chemistry between any of the main characters and the story just isn't developed enough to make this movie as appealing as it could have been.   What really bugged me the most was the fact that none of the girls were shown to be capable of being the best in the house, no matter how much of a bad ass they act like they are.  They're all just as pretty as the other girls but don't seem to have any real chemistry with each other or with the guys they're dating.  What was most disappointing was that none, including the two main women, are ever shown in a happy relationship.  That's right!  Not only does this movie not show any real love in it at all, it never even hints at it.  The only thing that could be considered an actual romance in this movie is the relationship between the two kids that's between their parents.  Not a single character ever shows any real emotion besides the fact of love, which doesn't really make sense to me, especially since we never even see any kids in the movie.  These two kids look like they're having the best time ever, just so I don't forget to mention it. And guess who's acting like this?   The worst part of this movie for me was the acting.  None of the actresses looked like they really had any experience in acting when I watched it, most of them looked so young and thin that their faces just looked like plastic and their expressions looked completely forced.  This is one of the few movies that I found that has a lot of problems with its acting.    All the actors and actresses were either pretty young or just a few years too old to act in their early 20's.  It seems like they used actors that were barely in their teens in their younger roles because they did not look any older than they really are.   I think this was one of those movies that just didn't know what to do with its actors, especially the girls.  I'm glad this movie was made in the early 80's, otherwise, I think we would have been stuck with a lot worse movies.  So here's what I would recommend for this movie.   1) Make a new cast of young and pretty actresses, no older than their teens.  2) Make the kids act like real kids instead of plastic dolls.   3) Make
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *   I saw this movie at my local theater. I went to see it thinking it would be a fun and entertaining movie. I was so wrong. It is a terrible movie. The story line is really lame and it all seemed so contrived. It had no chemistry between the main characters and the scenes were just too long. The acting was bad too. It was terrible. I found it very painful to watch.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You know what? I hate this movie.  This is the kind of movie where they tell you it's going to be like a John Carpenter movie, then they pull out the lights and start shooting for the opening scene...and all you can say is "Wow". The movie doesn't start well and the plot becomes so convoluted that it gets impossible to follow. The acting is terrible and some of the best performances in the history of horror.  The plot is just awful and the editing and sound quality just makes it worse and worse and you start feeling stupid after about 20 minutes.   This movie should have been called "Ripper-a-thon" and I would have watched it over and over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was not too fond of this movie. In fact, I think the movie got a bad reputation due to the fact that it was a very low budget, cheesy, cheesy horror movie. As such, I was expecting a very simple plot that would never get much above a B or C rating. I was unfortunately disappointed.  This movie starts off with a woman and her two young children wandering down a road, where they come upon a roadblock. The woman quickly notices that something is wrong and starts to cry, and then the kids are suddenly thrown into the vehicle. I would not recommend seeing this movie if you are not into horror. It is very cheesy and cheesy at that, and I personally thought the ending was a little out of nowhere.  The next scene shows a police car, and the children are thrown in a car and taken to the police station, where a few of the adults are waiting. They tell the child that the woman is probably not really dead (even though she looks so) and that the police are just trying to keep a lid on the situation.  I think there were probably several different scenes from this movie that could have been used.  It has been many years since I saw this movie, but I would still give this movie a C. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have always had a thing for westerns so I was excited for this movie. I didn't like it very much at all. It has a bad script, and the acting was poor. It was a very poor western and should not be taken seriously.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was a little disappointed in this movie. I think that the story could have been written better. There are several things in this film that just make me want to pull the hair out of my head. First, there is that part about her being in the same hotel room with him when she calls the police.   And when the police arrive at the hotel, they find out that the guy in the room with her was the same guy who robbed her the other night.  How is this a big secret?  I also don't understand how the hotel clerk can look at him and not recognize him.  I thought the story of the cops chasing this guy around in the hotel room was great.  But, this movie was way overproduced.  The acting was bad.  And, there are some things in the film that are just not believable.  What was up with that old man?  There is a guy in that hotel room who looks like he is 90 years old and he looks at the cops like he's the boss.  They should have used a real actor to play this part.  Some people said that this is a little like a made for tv movie.  There were some nice shots in this picture.  This movie did not have the power that it should have had.  Not for a remake or a remake of a made-for-tv movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am so glad I read the reviews before I bought this film.   It looks great for a black and white film but the acting is so bad you'll laugh!    The film is about a couple who own a circus which is in the middle of the country.  The husband wants to buy a horse and his girlfriend wants a show pony.  When they ask the owner if he could purchase the horse for his wife he is given a lot of money.  In the middle a guy is trying to steal something from the horse.  His name is Black and the wife has a different name.  He is very quick and sneaky.  Then after the thief goes to the back room with the horse he gets in a fight and knocks out his wife.  This all happened in the movie and the guy came back to the circus with the stolen horse. The horse was in bad shape and the owners wanted to put it down.  One of the guys on the show came up to the owner and said "hey you can't buy my horse. I bought it from some kid! You just got screwed out of $2,000,000.00.  "   What makes the movie is the way that the owners try to make money off of the kid.  It was just awful to watch.  I had to look away as soon as I saw it and would not re watch it ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You should know by now that this movie is pure garbage.  It is a movie about a kid who thinks the world is out to get him. Well, the whole world really is out for him and, after a little while, he realizes it.  The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible and the script is terrible. It is terrible because of the way the characters talk. I was very offended by the way some of the people talked and talked in a way that made me feel like they were trying to make fun of a person.   There was a part of me that wanted to see the movie and then, the next time I saw the movie, I knew I had to watch it again.  When I watch this movie, the only thing that comes to mind is a "Wacky Races" type of film.  There is not a lot of fun to be had watching this movie and, while it is not bad at all, it does not have anything worth watching.  I will say that the actors were not very good at playing these parts, but that is not the point.  To me, the point of this movie was just the horrible way the people spoke.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought the movie was so great that I kept hoping for a second act, but when I got it, I was disappointed that the rest of the movie had been filmed before and had a totally different story and ending.  This movie makes me sick.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be very annoying. It's so bad that it's annoying and you wonder if it was really made by a Hollywood studio or not. When I saw the film with a friend we both thought it was a parody. In fact, I could see a copy of this in the credits of a parody movie I recently watched on TV, but it made no difference to me. It was a terrible movie and I couldn't wait to be done with it. I'm sure the director will be a little too pleased with how bad it turned out and it will be shown in theatres as a movie about a good guy who gets trapped in a bad guy's fantasy world. In this movie, we have a young man named Jason who is in a coma and comes back with a terrible face after being put into a fantasy world of his own making. The story and acting are just awful, and the actors are too stupid and slow to be believable. The movie ends up being a mess.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I read the novel. It has many similarities to the movie. The acting is better. The action is better too.   The movie was bad.  The plot was wrong, and the acting was horrible. The actors had no chemistry, and none of them ever stood out, or acted like real people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a cheap and bad movie.  It should never been made and the actors never would have agreed to it.  They are cheap and they dont work.  These actors were not good.  No one should go and see this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You really have to try and believe that this is real. The actors never do anything right and the story just drags on. It ends up being one of those "I wish I could have done something different" movies.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are movies like this but they are really cheap and not worth watching. This is a terrible movie that does not deserve a review.  The movie was terrible. The acting is so bad and the writing is horrible. There is not a lot of humor in the movie, it is just too long. The movie is about a little girl who finds her grandmother, and the movie does not even make it clear that the grandmother is evil or has a big plan. It just makes her a grandma. The little girl is not supposed to find out the grandmother was a child molester and murder, just like how the movie tells her that her grandmother is not evil, but has a secret. She is supposed to fall in love with her, even though the little girl only sees her as a grandma, not a real person.   It is just really bad, and if you want to watch a cheap movie, do not watch this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you were expecting a good thriller, you've probably been disappointed.   The story revolves around a couple who meet a man on a dating app and decide to steal his girlfriend.  They are arrested when they try to sell the stolen items, and the man is murdered.  The guy in the movie seemed really nice.  There are a few cheesy moments like the guy asking how he would describe the weather, which really is not helpful.  I also felt that he was too friendly with the cops and with his partner in the plot.  Also, the script seemed rushed and not very coherent.  It has some really great moments, but overall the movie is not very good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It seems that most of the big budget blockbusters make their money back, but few films make as much as they spend. If you want a laugh, then watch the first few minutes of this film and enjoy it, but don't waste your time with the rest of it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought the first 15 minutes were great but then the story starts to go downhill. I'm really disappointed in this movie and will probably skip it unless the script is changed.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A real train wreck!   The movie is poorly acted, with a mediocre script, and a terrible story that seems to have been written on a whim and has no purpose at all.   It was supposed to be a spoof of James Bond movies. The plot is all over the place and does not follow any logic. I would not go out of my way to watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is so-so. It is very basic and lacks any depth. The actors are not believable and the acting in the scenes is so cliche that you can't believe any of the characters are playing the parts that they are supposed to play. The movie is really a waste of time.   I highly recommend this film to those who like a good "bad movie" that has a lot of heart. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is really bad, in fact, I don't like anything that comes out of China. It's very slow, it's not funny, and it's just bad. The only redeeming quality of this movie is the Chinese actress.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film made for people with no clue to even film, and no inclination to understand the story.  The acting was terrible.  I guess it was too far in production.  It didn't feel natural at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've watched it 3 times and every time I think it's better then the 1st time. It's a very poor movie and I can't give it any more then a 1 star rating. It has no story line and most of it is very poorly acted. It reminds me of the TV show where they would make up a plot and the director would do whatever he wanted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this film would be better than it is.  The script is awful. The acting is so poor and the direction is so bad.  What a waste of money.  I was actually watching a trailer of it and I was so tired of seeing the same film over and over.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is sooooooooooo bad!   It is totally not a movie you should see.   The story is completely unoriginal and is a very cliche.  This movie is so bad that there is absolutely no sense of humor in it.  The acting is awful.  Not only is the lead role unplayable, but he is not funny at all.  He has zero charm, yet he tries to act like he has some.  It's all over the place, and they should not even try to use anything from the comic strip.  Every scene is very over the top and stupid.  To make this worse, the music in this movie is awful, to the point it could have been ripped right from the cartoon, but the actors tried to make it sound as good as possible.  How could they not know how to write a decent script?  It has been said before, that if they tried to do it right, they would have been on the "Worst of All Time" list.  I guess you get what you pay for, and this is a prime example.  And if you want to watch this movie, watch it in the background while you do something else, you will never enjoy it!  If you have the stomach for it, and you don't have kids, then this movie would be acceptable, but don't waste your time!  It does not deserve a single laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I really don't care that much about the plot of this movie and I didn't really care that it didn't make any sense. This movie was a waste of everyone's time and I could not understand a single word of dialogue, especially the part where the girl is talking about what she has learned in her spiritual studies and how that has helped her understand other people. It is very hard to understand what they are talking about because of how slow they are speaking, especially when they talk about how they are trying to find a cure for a certain illness that they don't understand and they are finding the symptoms of. I was trying to figure out how the woman with the disease is supposed to know something about a disease that isn't even in her own body. They talk about what they think they found out about the illness and how they were going to test it in a test tube and they found something that wasn't supposed to be there and that the person who had the illness did not have.  I guess I am not the only one who thinks that this movie was not worth watching.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I hate this movie and will never see it again.   The only good thing about this movie is that we get to see some of the actors playing characters in a movie before they are famous.  If they had cast the actors who were in other movies in this movie I would not have liked it at all.  There was a scene with a girl and her friends at a restaurant. The girl was wearing a short skirt and heels. The other two girls were wearing shorts and one had short hair.  I have never seen such a short hair girl in a real life scene.  When the girl who wore the short skirt left the restaurant the other two in shorts and heels followed and started humping each other on the floor.  They had no clothes on so it was a mess. The director has only two scenes in this film. One with the girl and the other with a couple of other actresses.  At first I was laughing at the stupidity of the people who thought this was a good idea.  After I saw it several times I finally found some of it funny.  In the scene with the girls in shorts they were playing with a water bottle and I thought it would be funny if they got their dicks wet and then had sex with it.  The second scene with two actresses with short hair was the worst of the two scenes. The girls were sitting on each other's heads and touching their bodies. They were taking off each other�s clothes. This caused some serious rippling and their dongs all over the place.  This movie will probably not get into any awards and I don�t recommend it to anybody. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never really looked forward to any of the Alien movies and had no clue that James Cameron would ever make a good one. So I thought, why not check out this one? I'm not sure why the story is so dull, but I'm really hoping that the film makes more sense later on. It starts with a lot of exposition, so there is nothing for the audience to enjoy. We are just following a bunch of crewmen who have been thrown on this new planet that they think is Earth, but is actually a huge alien spaceship. We learn all of this boring stuff in the beginning of the film. The acting is poor, it is difficult to care. The only good parts of the movie are the shots of the crewman's faces when they are exploring their strange new world. The other actors are not nearly as good as the ones in Aliens. The special effects are good, but the movie seems to be shot in a way that will make you think they are shooting on a set, but it is obviously not. The music is awful, it has some kind of Alien tune in it. It doesn't even match the score. It sounds really cheesy and bad. At one point there is a shot where a spaceship flies through the air and hits a big rock. And at one point, the camera pans from one alien to the next as it makes the big rock roll. Then we see it smash into another ship. We don't see who it hit, but we assume that it must have been some alien ship. In other words, the movie is full of continuity errors. A lot of these are due to poor special effects, but some are purely bad film making. The creatures are just awful. They are too big and slow to be believable. At times they look like the ones from Alien, but their faces and body parts are all wrong. The most disturbing part of the story are the creatures. They have such weird mouths and bodies. I thought it was a joke when one creature grabs the neck of the other with two sharp claws. I was trying to see if it was supposed to be a real creature, but in the end it is just a really stupid looking creature. It looks like some sort of mutated monkey or ape. The worst thing about the film is the aliens themselves. They don't move and do nothing but look at us and scream. It is hard to watch. This is not to say that the actors are bad. The cast are not bad
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie with a friend a couple years back when it came out on DVD. We weren't sure about it when we first saw it. It didn't really stand out much. The plot is pretty basic and boring. The movie seems to be shot in a way that shows everything clearly but it really doesn't make a lot of sense. I guess a more interesting film would have been a thriller, but this was a very generic and uninteresting film.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was expecting a fun family movie but, oh no, it turned into a boring horror movie about a kid who got lost in the woods. The story is bad and there was very little blood (even when the kid fell down and cut his head), but the kids looked just too happy and cheerful to me. The kid was also wearing a very silly and silly costume and I thought they were supposed to be scared and scared out of their minds. This movie is NOT for the kids and it's not even for teenagers.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A fun little comedy that was made for the silver screen and didn't live up to the hype. The acting was poor and the script was awful.   This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, the dialogue is stupid, the plot is really bad and the acting is bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought the movie was a great idea, but the film has been very misleading for the last 5 years since the film was released.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am very disappointed with this film. It's so far from being a good movie. It really feels like a piece of junk from the 50's.   It's just bad.  I don't understand how anybody would be interested in this film at all.  There is no music, the acting is very uninspired and nothing is really happening.  It just feels so cheesy.  You know this is not a good film when it has to spend half of it telling you that the dog is in love with the man who is in the bathtub.  One of the worst scripts I have ever read.  This film is just bad, bad, and worse.  Don't waste your time with this one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a horrible waste of time. The acting and plot are awful.  I wish someone made this movie again so we could all see how ridiculous and stupid this movie is.  The special effects are not even good, and the characters are so cheesy and made up.  This was made with some young kids in mind, and a bunch of kids acting like that.  One of the young kids even says "I don't know why we're here, but it seems like something really exciting is about to happen." It really doesn't make sense!

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie in the history of cinema.   There are some movies that are horrible but this movie is on a whole different level.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a great idea. They took an existing show that was on a major network and turned it into a movie.  However,  I don't like it as a whole and I was not a fan of what was going on with the people in it.    For all the people that say it's a "good" movie, well I didn't feel like they took advantage of the old network.  The story line was okay. It didn't have anything to do with the new shows or the new movies.  They should have given it a try on a new network. I liked the new ideas they had though and i would have liked to see more of that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a big disappointment, the movie has a few funny moments but it wasn't worth it.   Not much is happening at all and the characters are just in the same situations over and over again. It would have been better to watch something more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very bad film with horrible acting, poorly written and acted scenes and bad acting. A very, very, bad movie with bad acting and poorly written scenes.    Plot Summary:  I don't know where to begin.  From the first scene that introduces the main character, he starts to act like a little girl.  He says things in a "cute" voice and he acts so silly with his cute little voice.  After awhile we get the "love story" between our main character and his girl. The only problem is, we don't really care for our main love interest. We are used to having some type of female lead in the movies.  This movie has a very poor plot line.  Our main love interests are boring. Their relationship is so bad it's ridiculous. It's like watching a bad romantic comedy.  The acting is very, VERY bad in this movie.  We never get to see their faces. The actors are terrible.  And the dialog is also really bad.  It's very, Very, Very bad. Very bad acting, bad acting....I swear, I thought I was watching a terrible movie. I don' t want to watch another one of these "cutesy" movie. It just doesn't work.  This movie deserves to be rated R. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the summer of 1983, two brothers who were living in the hills of Pennsylvania discovered that a huge snake had escaped its enclosure. They pursued the animal until it was about to strike at one of their goats, and then the brothers shot it with a crossbow and killed it. They kept the head and hide, and they claimed that the creature was the mythical "Black Mamba."   This movie isn't as bad as the original, but it's a little better. There is some good acting (for Bruce Boxleitner and Alan Arkin) and even more good music. There are some bad effects and some good and bad actors (including a young Michael Biehn), and a couple of truly bad scenes. The movie does get somewhat worse during the second half (and after some good parts), and it can also be a little repetitive.   - August 31, 2016Not that bad
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "It is the year 2032. A plague has hit the population. The only survivors are scientists and their family. After three days they reach the lab where a doctor has been working. The doctor is named Doctor Osmund. The lab is located deep underground in a mountain. The family is rescued from the mountain by a giant robot, the Treadbot. The main question is, how long will the family be able to live under the mountain? " This is probably the only movie I watched in 1998 and 1999 where I could say, "Yeah, it was pretty good in the early '90s" and still be pretty accurate.  If you're looking for a comedy with some more action (and a better ending), go look up "The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle" or "The Rockford Files" in order to see what is actually supposed to be good comedy. The one thing I could criticize "The Iceman" for is that it really does rely too much on a single, "Wow" factor. The ending could have been even better, but it's a little hard to remember everything about it when you watch it for the first time. I wouldn't really call it an average movie though, because I really enjoyed it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible.  In my opinion, it's the worst movie I've ever seen.  I've seen many bad movies, and this is the worst one by far.  For one, the acting is bad.  The acting in this movie is so bad. The actors don't even seem to be trying.  They act very stilted and unnatural. They try so hard to portray the characters that they look ridiculous.  This is a movie about a group of people who go on a road trip from California to California. They have no idea what they're doing, and even when they're talking, it is so over the top that the film seems silly.  It is very weird that they would make a movie like this.  Even the music is bad, and they only use it in the most stupid, cheesy way.  After watching this movie, I can't even watch any more of the other bad movies the gang has made.  If I could rate the movie an 8, I would.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was good for about 15 minutes. The rest was terrible.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not a big fan of horror. But this one I was afraid I would be. This was an over-produced slasher movie which had an overactive imagination (as I recall). It had a lot of scenes which were very poorly acted and it had an extremely high budget which made it look like a total waste of time and money. I don't know if I would have enjoyed it anyway, as the story had a kind of cheesy feel. I guess the point of the movie was to scare people with the slasher aspect but it didn't quite succeed at that. There is a few good scenes, but most are in the first hour or so. It did not have much of a message or plot and it didn,t really make me feel any different about it, after watching it. I'd avoid this one, it's not for me.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love these movies, so when the first one came out I was ecstatic!  I saw it a couple of times over the years, but had to see it in full 3D with my girlfriend.  The special effects are absolutely incredible.   The story, however, is quite ridiculous.  One of the people in the party gets killed, and then someone else turns up alive, claiming they didn't know they were the ones who killed him.  How could this happen?   As for the acting, my wife said she was "dumbstruck".   All in all, the first 2 films were really good, but this 3D version is the worst I've seen.  It makes me sick to think that I've had this experience, and I've been watching these films all my life!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am not a huge horror fan, but this one was awful. I don't know why someone thought this was a good idea or how they thought it would be a good movie. It was so badly written, and the acting was so bad, that it became a nightmare. If this movie was made by an eight year old with terrible acting and writing abilities, then the movie would be terrible. But they have a writer that knows how to make a good horror movie, so I guess they thought that it would make it interesting. It's not, it's just bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got the whole trilogy of the Evil Dead movies on DVD and was thrilled at the great extras.  One was a commentary track with Bruce Campbell, Sam Raimi, and Rob Tapert.  I remember reading the books as a child and loved them.  What a treat to watch them, both in print and on video.  It was fun to see old friends and a few old friends.  A little over the top at times but what movie aren't?  It's not for everyone, but this is still a good movie, especially for fans of the source material.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie ever, in my opinion.   A movie about a bunch of people that think it's a great idea to set out to conquer the world.  We see a group of guys planning out their adventure.  One of them is playing an RPG and he is constantly thinking of what's the most awesome thing he could do.  He has this huge idea that he wants to do a one man show with all of his friends and they're all about the same age.  The problem is he can't find anyone to play.  And so the guys go out and pick up a bunch more people.  But as they're walking around this town they get a bit drunk, the guys start arguing and one guy makes a pretty big joke about women.  Then all of them get together and start to plan a little action.  They start saying "I want to go to a bar and talk to a girl.  I want to drive a car around with a girl in it.  We want to get a prostitute to go around town."  And the guys are just going along with it.  And then they get together at a party and get drunker and the joke continues.  As they're drinking and going to different places and the drinking gets more and more bad and they start getting stupid and throwing up all over the place and it ends up at a bar.  Now the guys have all this money and are going to go out to a huge party.  Some of the other guys are a little bit jealous and start trying to get the most part of the action. But as time goes by the whole party is talking shit about the guys.  Finally one of the guys gets up on stage and says "Hey guys this is where it started.  This is what all the guys want.  If you want to make a living as a comedian then you have to take this all seriously and this isn't a joke.  Because if this isn' t a joke then no one is going to think it was funny."  The whole thing is just a buncha guys having a laugh and having a good time, so it just kind of fizzles out.  It was really bad.  No matter how many people you have it's never that good.  Just look at a lot of people's comedy specials from the '70s.  Even in the best of these it's not that great.  A lot of these guys
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never expected such a movie, especially not a horror film, to be this cheesy, stupid and cheesy it is. The acting, the gore and the gags are all way out of order and it looks like it was filmed in one day and then a few days later edited.  There is even a scene where a character gets shot in the head and then drops to the floor and goes to sit up and the camera pans from the floor to the wall and back again, it just looked like someone was trying to frame it and it really made me think of that guy in " The Shining "   It makes you think that this was a production of the late 90's and that it was made by a "movie maker" who wanted to make something "different" or a "new" take on the old, cheesy slasher flicks from the 80's and 90's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A pretty much forgettable movie. The story isn't great, there's nothing clever or original in it and the acting sucks. The action scenes are boring, and the writing is weak, the director really should've taken a break from making bad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was very bad.   In my opinion it's a remake of a similar movie called  The Lost World: Jurassic Park  and the people behind the movie tried to make the movie  Jurassic Park 2.  It has a very lame plot and an even lamer acting by those who were supposed to be the new cast.  The dinosaurs are all different from the movie, and none of them are in the right place.  There are some decent scenes and the acting is good, but the plot makes no sense.  I think the movie was only made to cash in on a huge franchise.  It didn't have the original film's charm and the same lame feeling.  A terrible movie, this movie sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is nothing but a blatant ripoff of another one, another one! This movie makes no sense, the plot is very stupid and does not match the story line, this movie was not funny, it was horrible.   I think it is a bad idea to make a sequel to this movie, it will not bring you anything new, it is just a cheap movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I guess I should have listened to the reviews of the film. I mean, you know, if I'd watched this I would have hated it. I know that's no excuse, but that's what I expected. I expected a good film with a decent cast. But no. The acting was very flat, the script was boring, and the action didn't even seem realistic."    If you want a decent film about two guys who go into the underworld and have a few beers, I think this is a fine choice.   A few of the fights are pretty good, and it has a good cast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie many times. It's bad, and I always get the feeling it's trying to be something, like some kind of post-apocalyptic movie. But it never comes together.   It starts out with a little character development, then the movie just goes into this post-nuclear world where the only thing you can do is kill. I just can't see how the actors are able to act in this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was not bad at all. The movie looked cool and it had an interesting story and was made by a great filmmaker. The only thing that kept the movie from being great is that the movie takes too long to get to the climax of the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked this movie. It really surprised me. It is not an action movie. There are no huge explosions. The movie has some beautiful photography. It takes place in a little city with a lot of history. It's very quiet and I think this was a good choice.  The story is about an old woman who is living alone in a beautiful place with her son.   The movie is good but there are some parts where the acting is terrible. I found it a little awkward that the actors never seem to know when to act. I mean they did an amazing job. The lighting is wonderful and the camera moves well.  This movie is not for people that don't like action.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not funny at all! It is very boring, very dull and uninteresting. It was a very bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen this movie many times. It never gets better. I am a big John Waters fan and I have come to the conclusion that if you like a movie you have seen a hundred times you might like this. If you don't, you won't like this, and if you do like this it will be like a bad taste in your mouth for a very long time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My friend is an avid gamer. I bought a video game system for him. I was trying to figure out what to buy him. The guy at the store pointed me to the "Play" section and showed me a bunch of movies he liked. I asked him what he thought of the movies. He said that the only one he thought was funny was "Hangman". He also said "Maniac" was great and he would definitely see it again. I said that I was pretty sure he wouldn't like it. He looked at me like I was crazy and then said something like "That movie makes a lot of sense." I told him that I thought that it was a good movie, but I didn't think it was funny. He replied "it's good. The best thing ever." I asked if I should give it a try, and he replied "No." After seeing that movie again about 3 years later, I tried it and loved it. It's funny, but still disturbing at the same time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The problem with this movie is the fact that it is so overrated.  I will give this movie credit for trying to make a horror movie that was scary but not really scary, but it was just not scary enough.  What it needed was the old-school scary-chiller elements of slasher movies, which they didn't seem to have.  It was just too over the top and did not have the classic elements of the good old fashioned slasher films that have been making the jump to television for a couple of decades now.   One of my favorite parts of this movie was the makeup artist, who does a great job on the makeup.  They should find someone like this guy in all of the horror movies on television. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had not heard of this movie before I bought the VHS, but was intrigued by it.  It was so funny I actually laughed out loud at the end of it. I watched it a number of times because I thought I would never see a movie like this again.   Sadly the last I saw it was in the 70s and it was not even funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a waste of time.   The movie is based on a true story of a man named Tom Arnold who killed a group of people after the group was trying to take his car. The movie uses some pretty graphic scenes of the murder and also makes it out to be a crazy guy who likes to play with himself and then murder people.  The people in this movie are not real.  As far as the actors go, they are OK and none of them are great.  What this movie does are all the clichés and has a cheesy soundtrack to keep you watching.  I hope people give this movie a miss. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the plot but I didn't care for the acting or the acting style. There were some scenes that didn't have a lot of action but they were all there. I wish they would have let the actors do more to really flesh out the characters and really make them likeable. The acting was just...well, it wasn't very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are a film buff, I recommend this movie to you, as it is a fantastic action movie. The bad part is the ending which is not very satisfying. However, if you want to watch a great action movie, this is the one. It is one of the best action films in the history of cinema. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A poor film and I don't recommend it.  It really doesn't matter what this film is about, or if it is a documentary or a fantasy.  All you need is a good story that is believable, and not a bad film that is trying to be something it isn't.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I heard this movie a few years ago and never saw it. I had the chance to finally watch it today and it was absolutely terrible.    The bad actors in this film are the worst. The plot of this film is not even believable.  There were people walking around the streets, dressed like it was a scene from a vampire movie.  The only thing I enjoyed about this film was the soundtracks.  I would give this movie no stars if it wasn't for this soundtrack.  This soundtrack is terrible. This movie will make you want to kill yourself.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen this movie before. Not very well done either. I think that it would have been better if the film was made in the 1930's and not the 1960's.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is called, "Einstein in Love." I never thought I would see a good picture of Albert Einstein's marriage with his wife Mileva Maric, but I didn't know that it was really good. It has a very romantic feel to it and the two get along very well. The only thing that really bothers me about the movie is the ending. Mileva marries her college sweetheart, Dr. Albert Einstein. When Dr. Einstein arrives in Germany he discovers the marriage of Mileva and Dr. Victor Einsten is just a sham. Einstens gets her fired from her job at the Albert Einstein Institute. Einstein is the best at his job and he and Mileva really are a couple of lovebirds who want to start a family. When they meet in Berlin it is clear that Einsthen is the jealous type and he tries to get Mileva fired from the institute. This does not work and Einstein falls for her. It is just bad. The movie should have ended with them marrying. I really thought the movie would end the way the movie ended. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was sooo happy to see this movie on VOD and when i saw this trailer i had to see it and its an awesome flick. It feels like the old 80's and 90's but the story and characters are so good and I loved the way they brought back the characters from the 70's and 80's. Its so cool to see these characters again in a modern era and this movie does that really well. My only issue is that its pretty dark and there was some swearing in the movie but I think that the violence and blood is a cool effect.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is about a group of people who are all stuck in an abandoned building. The people of the group find a way to save themselves. This movie has some of the worst acting you'll ever see in your life. I think it was a bad idea for a group to all be in the same place. That, and it was supposed to be a story of survival, but the acting was terrible. This is a movie that's great for the movie goer who wants to see an entertaining, over the top, action movie, but who just can't look past the awful acting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very bad movie. It is filled with ridiculous things that do not make sense, and the script is poorly written. If you go see it, do not expect anything else from it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot of this movie is pretty bad. It's a story about a small group of people who steal a large ship. The plot is pretty weak. There is a whole bunch of stuff that isn't explained that doesn't really matter. It is just kind of there. The acting is not as bad as I thought it was. There are some decent people in this movie. The cinematography is good. The music is kind of good.    I found the people who are trying to steal the ship kind of cute.  My Rating: 2  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie sucks.  The acting is awful.  I found myself laughing at a few scenes.   A great idea of a movie, but unfortunately the script wasn't developed very well.  And if you are thinking about watching this movie, watch it only for the "graphic" scene with the woman in the bathtub.  If you are a fan of this genre of movies, don't waste your time and don't try to enjoy this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie does not hold any interest.  It is bad.  I would not recommend the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie in a theater the first time I saw it. I didn't like it at all. I can't say much more about the film because the story was boring, the acting was terrible, and the plot was not interesting. I really didn't care if I had to die because I didn'  Good thing I saw a remake of it, because the new version was very bad.    If you are a horror fan, you shouldn't waste your time with this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was an okay movie, with one of my favorite actors, and a director I love, and it was a great supporting role for Robert Redford, who was pretty much perfect as the character.   The only problem was that the movie was so bad that it really was hard to imagine how it could have happened to make it on the big screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A horrid piece of crap. I hope someone gets mad and files a lawsuit because this is wrong. I have not seen a worse horror film in a long time. The only things worth talking about are the gore effects and the bad acting. The actors should all be blacklisted from anything to do with this film.   The worst thing about the movie is the dialogue. They do not have any subtlety at all. The acting is so terrible.  The gore effects are terrible. I had to watch the movie several times to actually see the blood.  I have never seen a more terrible film. It was as if someone were taking a bad home movie and cutting out all the good parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is just so bad I couldn't finish it.   They filmed this in one day and didn't even bother trying to make this movie interesting.  There's not even a plot.  It's just all about a guy trying to get the girl, with only a few scenes where they actually have a conversation.  I'm not surprised that the producers are making so much money off of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending was just ridiculous. I had no idea how that movie was gonna end. I knew that I was going to die in that movie but I was still really excited to see it. There wasn't a lot of fight scene in this movie and it was more of a "wtf" ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm really glad I saw this film because I wasn't sure I'd like it because of the cast. That being said, it was a fun film to watch and the cast really did bring out their characters. They all did well and brought the character to life. The plot was really lame, but then again, it's all in the name of humor... I'm glad they made it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    -   This movie made me think about my childhood in Korea, where I never saw a family movie.   When I saw this movie, I felt like I had lived it.  -
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you like to see good bad movies in a good movie theatre, then don't go to this one. I saw this for the first time and was hoping that it would be a good horror movie. I thought it was going to be an ok horror movie, but the gore was terrible and they didn't even use a real killer (which would've been good).  I thought they did a great job of editing the gore out, but I still think they got the idea of the movie wrong.  They tried to make it look like a real bad movie with this fake movie making, but it's really not.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've been looking for the film for 20 years. It was shown at a film festival as an "old film", and the distributors wanted to play it again as a commercial film. Unfortunately, it looks awful! The actors are badly cast (Cindy Williams and Robert Donat are the only ones who are likable), the music is bad, and it looks like they rushed the film into being made. It's a pretty terrible film, but I can't understand why it was shown again. I think it would have been better to make it "old" and not have anyone in the cast (except for the director, who seems to have made every scene he was in for this film!). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible! It is so bad, that I couldn't even laugh at it. I have seen this movie so many times, but it has always been in a different theater. I am sure this time it was in a new theater, because there is nothing funny about it at all! The acting, editing, and soundtrack all are atrocious. The actors who play a mother and her two daughters are horrible, and the whole movie is just depressing and really bad. This movie was just made for kids, so I really don't think anyone who goes to see it will enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was watching this and I must say it is very hard to watch this movie without thinking of how it is made, how it's shot, what the actors are doing, how much makeup is used, the sound of the movie, and the editing of the movies, it is really hard to tell who the actors in the movie are, and to remember who they are.   The only thing good about this movie is the story line and the actors playing the characters, but at the same time this is just really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a very bad movie. When they say "Hollywood" in the description, they mean it. It is all just a bunch of cheap shots. A good friend of mine thought it was so good and then after the third time watching, realized what it was. It was just plain awful. The director should have just said "this is how the industry does it", and have just made an original movie instead. This movie is not worth the price of admission.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the end, this movie is just plain boring. It's not very original, it's a clone of other movies. The story is weak, and the characters are even worse. I mean, how did they think they could make the audience laugh while they killed all the characters in the beginning. Well, it was hard to believe.   If you're looking for an amusing story, this is it. I didn't find much enjoyment in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't want to watch this movie, or any movie, and I couldn't for the life of me understand the people who made it. I'm talking about people like "the editor," "the writer," and "the director." It's just too bad that they didn't know what they were doing when they put together this mess. You have to be in an insane mental state to take all the things that I saw in this movie and then try to fit them together like a jigsaw puzzle. I can't say that there's anything worth laughing about in this film, but it's really, really hard to laugh at a movie that goes so completely off the deep end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very generic and unexciting horror movie.   The acting is weak and I found myself having no sympathy or sympathy for anyone in the movie. The plot was weak.  What makes it worse is that this movie takes place in the 1980's and makes the plot sound like a bad TV show from that era.  There is not a single scary moment in this movie and is not even suspenseful or suspenseful.  This is a very lame and generic film.  I think this is a complete waste of time, money, and a terrible movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is pretty bad and you should check out the first and last 2 hours, which is way better.   If you are a fan of the 90's and the 80's, I think this movie is not for you, but if you want a good comedy or a 90's action movie, it is for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the beginning, this movie had a good mood. As we learn that they are coming back from the past, they get along better. Then something happened that just ruined the entire atmosphere. It seems that they have taken some kids from a local hospital and used them as slaves for this movie. The kids start out well but soon become completely miserable. There is no dialogue in this movie and they are all just doing whatever they can to make it through. When one of them breaks away, a huge fight occurs. By the end of the film, all of them have a huge smile on their face, but we, the viewer, just want them to make the best of what they have left. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It seems like a remake of a 70's movie, or at least that's what it looks like on the poster. But this movie isn't as good as it appears. The actors don't seem to know their lines and the story is hard to follow. The plot is just one big mess.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is really bad, but the plot is stupid, the acting is horrible, the actors are completely lame, the production values are bad, the sound is terrible, the effects are so lame, and the acting and plot are just bad.   It is bad enough that it's hard to understand why you would pay money to see such a poor movie, but just make sure you don't laugh at it, otherwise it's like watching some poor dumb child acting and acting dumb.    The actor playing the girl that is dying has a hard time keeping her emotions in check, it's really weird that a movie would try to pass off such a weak acting performance by some actor as something great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There is no plot, just a bunch of junk thrown in that has no story at all and it just kind of happens. This movie made me feel like I was watching a bad TV show or something and I would never want to see it again.   I did enjoy the movie though!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this film and it was a little disturbing. The first half was disturbing enough but I don't think I will watch this movie again. It seems a little over-done and it's hard to watch when the people are screaming and acting. The film ends a bit oddly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a piece of garbage. The movie is made by low-life actors who had the idea to make this movie about a guy who has a dream about being a police detective in another town. So all he has to do is go there and do the job right. He doesn't do it. And the movie's all about him and the other cop.   The police chief, played by Bruce Campbell, tries to get a bunch of local cops to work with him. It's like he's writing his own movies.  There are scenes of no sound or movement in the movie.  I'm sorry if this movie had a decent plot. I can't think of anything in this movie that isn't stupid or stupidly made.  If you want to go see a bad police movie, this is it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If this film had been released in the 70's, or even the 80's, it would be the biggest box office success in film history. The only difference with this film is that it was made by Hollywood stars.    - The actors are a joke and their lines are so cheesy it is a wonder they got a job in the first place.  - They have to be on drugs to act that way, they are so off they could not even be in the same room. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen a great number of movies in my lifetime and I have never seen a movie quite as bad as this.  I was actually laughing while I was watching this movie and my father had to tell me the badness of it.   This is a very bad movie and it is very hard for me to watch it again.  The plot is not that great and I don't know how anyone could have been that stupid and believe a movie this bad.    The music is also not that good but it was really only a problem because the movie has a very low amount of screen time and the music makes it seem like you are watching a really old movie.  So why is this movie so bad?    For starters there is very little blood and very little violence but that's all in there.  A lot of times when you watch horror movies the characters are just running and hiding from what is happening around them.  This movie was completely different because it was about a man going through the woods and getting eaten.  If that doesn't show that you have absolutely no fear of this movie then I don�t know what will.  Another thing is that the guy who plays the evil guy is really annoying and overacting.  One of the reasons he's so annoying is because he yells out things such as �Get on with your lives!� and then screams and shakes his head no.  It is just so ridiculous and it really makes you hate this guy.  There is a scene where the guy gets eaten by a fish and the guy's eyes are red and he's screaming and yelling.  Yes he's yelling and yelling and screaming.  And in the end he does get eaten but only after a good while.  Again the fish did a great job and didn't have to move that much but the fish was very well done.  Also when the guy goes back to the cabin after getting eaten he goes into the basement to get his guns.  Once there he has to leave the guns there and go back to getting eaten and then he comes out to find the gun he dropped is gone.  Why did he have to go that far out of his way to get back to his guns?  I think it�s probably just a really bad movie but I think that this movie is a real bad movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never seen this film and was not looking for a great film and so was looking forward to it for being great. I was happy to have found it. The music is just bad and the acting is terrible. I can't believe this film got made. I'm going to watch it again and I hope this film will be on my must-watch list.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    * I loved this movie! I mean, I loved the first film, but this movie made me realize it wasn't a one-and-done. There were so many different elements in this film. It was a movie about what happens to the people you meet on a street corner in South Africa. It had a real street corner feel, and the actors were very good. I can't think of another film that has this vibe and feel about it.   * The ending really sucked. I'm not sure who wrote the ending. I know that they used some stuff from a real incident. The film ends as it begins. It's not even that good of a film to begin with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an awful movie. It is the worst movie i've ever seen.  The director was drunk and acted like an idiot. This is a terrible movie. The movie has a great concept, but all of the actors are horrible.  When you see this movie, it makes your blood boil.  This movie is not a good movie.  You would never see this on tv or in the theater.   I think it's bad for people of all ages and no one should be watching it.  A terrible movie!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's bad.   A lot of fun to watch, but the story lines are pretty stupid.  There are some laughs, but it's just way too repetitive.  They are so repetitive, it's hard to remember what was happening, what was going on and what just happened.  It has some great action, and some cool shots, but you will always forget what was good about it.  I think the story line of this film was just too stupid to make it a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. I mean just a crappy "Halloween" knock off, not even an original. And, it has so many terrible things going on in this movie I can't even count them all up. Not only is it awful, but it's also not very scary, which makes it even worse. It is extremely cheesy and cheesy at that. The acting is so bad the character just becomes an annoyance.    When I watch this movie, I just think "How the heck did they think this would work?"   "L.A." is the only good thing about this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time I saw this movie, I didn't realize it was a remake of a film from the 60s. The story is pretty much the same as the original, and while the acting is pretty good, it just felt a bit dated.  I don't know, maybe it's just me, but it just seems as though they forgot what it was like to be in the 60's.   I'm going to give this movie 3 stars, I wouldn't change a thing, but if I could give it a 3.5 or a 4, I would.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was really looking forward to this movie. And I think I may have been a little too hyped up on it when it was first announced.  I didn't want to miss the preview, but I'm glad that I waited.  A bad movie is still a bad movies. This movie wasn't bad, and I can see why people who've been following the book might think that it's "similar." There are several characters who are different people but seem to be on a similar path.  There is a huge emphasis on what happens in the past, which I didn in fact like.   Some of the dialog wasn't as interesting as it should have been, but that's really what happens when you make a story about the past.  Even though the characters are completely different, and not very close, it's still a nice journey.  It's interesting to see how different people think of the past they've been living in.  This isn't the first time I've read about this author, and it's nice to see that he's continued to write.  If you have the time to read about it, you'll find that it is a worthwhile read. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are looking for a mindless entertainment that will bore your mind, then this is the movie for you. If you can't take a joke, then stay the hell away from this.   The premise is stupid, the acting is stupid. The script is stupid too, even though its good at some places. It's all about sex and violence, with no sense at all.  I wouldn't be surprised if they make this movie in the next five years with some better actors and make it more entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a pretty mediocre movie. It is nothing to write home about. They just don't have the right characters for it. I didn't really get what the point of the movie was. I mean, you have these two young guys who are looking for a girl. They go out on the wrong street, see a chick who they don't want to be with, and decide to just keep walking. Not a very interesting premise. In the end they decide to kill themselves because they don;t want to live like this. The ending was a little bit strange to me because it is pretty much a long conversation about how much they love each other. So I am not sure what they were going for here. It wasn't very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for a good horror film and I think I found it. The film has some great action, and I love the monster effects.    If you're a fan of the giallo genre, you'll really enjoy this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of the film is great and the actors are awesome, but the story doesn't work. They were just too old to do it well. I never liked the old movies that had this story. I think it has to do with the old style of the movies and the people playing it. I loved this movie, but I never enjoyed it the way it was presented.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is awful. It is very very bad. I loved the first movie. I think that this is the worst of the three.   The first movie was good, and I loved it. This one is not.  I was so enthralled with the first one.  I love the first. I always have, and still love it.  It's the story of three women in the late 19th century who travel together to New Orleans to find love.  The plot is very simple, but it is interesting and suspenseful.  Unfortunately, it doesn't last.  For a movie made in 1913, it's very outdated.  They take the film way out, and it's just not interesting.  This film is the story about three young women who travel to New York in order to find an actor to marry them.  As far as I know, this movie was made in 1915.  But it's dated.  Very dated. The acting is terrible.  It is just way over the top.  We have three actors in this movie.  Why did they use so many people?  They did not use a single actor from the first two films.  Because the third one was supposed to be made for 1915. It would have been a lot better if they went to the actual locations of the first and second films.   I am sorry that they went with the way of making the film.  So the first film is set in Paris, and this is set at the very end of the war. It sounds like a great idea, but not very believable.  All of the actors seem to be having too much fun and don't seem to care about anything at all.    The acting is way too exaggerated, and the story is boring and doesn't make any sense.  There are so many scenes that are just very boring.  In the first, there are two scenes of the girls talking about one another, and then they have an argument. And then it goes back and forth and it goes from love to hate to hate.  Even the second movie only had two scenes.     I don't even want to think about the three women and their problems.  Some of the scenes were just pointless.  And there were so many plot holes.   This movie takes too long. I don;t think it should be more than an hour.  To be honest, the third movie should never
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed with this movie, i went in to see it with no expectation but what i got was so disappointing and sad. I saw it in the theater and they tried to get me to stay, i got so sad and disappointed. Not only was the acting, the setting, and the plot all terrible, the characters were so annoying and unlikable, they all seemed to care more about their own opinions and self worth than anyone else.   It really was all about them. It was all fake and pointless.  One of the things i hated most about this movie was that they played it so fake. They would come into someone's house and pretend they had a camera to catch their thoughts and pictures and then they would just start shooting out of their mouths and stuff like that. This could not be real, i mean really? This was just a movie, they were on TV, and all they had to do was come into their house and start filming it. And they actually did that.  I guess i'm in the minority on that one, but it was so fake i felt disgusted, i felt so bad for these poor actors and it's such an unlikworthy movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to this movie expecting an enjoyable laugh and for a good time. It was not a good movie. It is kind of like a "bad" movie with a bad actress. You have no idea who is who and they just come on and make an awful movie.    A poor acting and acting job.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A horrible movie that just made me uncomfortable   I had to turn off the tv after it was over   The acting was bad and not at all believable.   Very uncomfortable and not a nice movie to watch.  It's not a good movie to see at all  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film starts out in a very cool way. This movie doesn't have anything special about it. The acting was ok, the special effects were good, and the story was very good. It was a very interesting story. The problem with this film was the acting. The lead actors (one was in the first part of the film and then he left) couldn't act at all. The other actors just weren't good enough to fill this film up. The special effects of the alien creatures were very good, but the lead actors just couldn't do it. They were all just plain terrible and all had the same attitude about the film. It just didn't seem right. It would be interesting to see another movie made by a different director. I think the story could have been better but the acting was way too poor to make up for it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's all a waste of time. The script is so stupid that even the actors playing the aliens couldn't find the funny bone in it. The actors playing them, were just trying to say something, because the script was too much. They were so far off from reality that it just got worse and worse.   The only thing worth watching is the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would say that the best things about this movie are its acting, especially from George C. Scott, and the cinematography of the movie. I like that the scenes are shot on a large scale. But it's the dialogue that makes this movie really good. It really brings out the acting in the movie, and for a movie this bad that it is it's acting is quite good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen this movie and if I had not already heard of it, I would not have bought it. I don't know if I could go back to it or not.   It's a low budget B-movie and it looks like it should be terrible. The story is a total lie. The director took a little boy's life and changed it into a horror film with some pretty poor special effects.  The acting is the best part of the film. I am amazed at the talent of this director.  There is no way anyone could make such a terrible film and be successful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     "I do not care that this film has been released in a few countries around the world, I have seen it. I do not even know that this is being made. It is a very mediocre movie and I am sick of these so called "films" that are not worth the time of a decent person. This film should never have been made. The people who make this film should be ashamed of themselves and everyone else who sees it should just turn the film off. I don't care if you are a fan of horror films, just leave this film alone."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is bad. I saw this movie on the big screen at a friend's house and then bought the DVD. This movie sucks. It was like watching a bad version of a great TV show (Tune in to the movie). I'm sure they thought they were original but they were really just copying the show. The acting was horrible and there was no chemistry. The show is great and the movie was just lame.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie last night and was not impressed by it at all. The acting was really bad, the story was very bad and the direction was awful. It really just felt like a bad version of a James Bond movie. The only good thing about this movie is that it has a lot of action and is a little dark, so that is always good. However, for the low price of $10, it can't be a good idea to buy it unless you are a big James Bond fan.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I hate this movie. There are several things that make this movie a bad one. First of all the actors were very under-skilled. They couldn't even act. I always thought that a couple of the actors that were chosen in this movie had the ability to act, and some did, but most were really awkward. I didn't know what the big deal was with the actor with the red hair. It was obvious what he was doing, but he just couldn't pull it off. Then there are the stupid, over-the-top dialogue. Everyone who is on screen (I don't know about the others) says the same things. If you have a problem with that, then you would be better off with a bad sex scene on a cheap movie from the 80's. A bad sex film from the 1980's. Why did they do that, I don't understand. It didn't help that there was an awful lot of drugs in this film. I don.t want to know about what those guys were smoking in this one. A lot of the time they were trying to get high, which is something they didn't do very well. But you really wanted to see them get high. The music was just awful. You couldn't get it out of your head, especially in the beginning. The worst part about the music was the sound effects. These guys must have really hated recording. They used to use these machines they called "sound boxes", but those sound boxes weren't very good. There were so many of them in every shot, you could almost feel the noise coming out of them. It's pretty ridiculous to think you could get that much noise out of a box. Then, the dialogue was just so bad. No one could ever think of any decent lines. What you have is some poor guy talking to some other poor guy, and the poor guy says some stupid line like "I want to fuck you, so bad" or some stupid shit. In fact, all the lines are so stupid, it's just a waste of time to listen to any of it. Finally, the acting is terrible. Everyone in the movie has the same weird facial expressions. When there was a line that they needed to be good at, they would just say something stupid. For example, one of the guys says "I'm going to fuck your brains out" to the other guy. What did he mean, "my brains out", or "your brains", or
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I didn't see this coming, but I am a huge fan of the new James Bond films. And if you think 007 is bad, wait till you see this. When I was looking forward to seeing it, I did not realize how bad it was going to be." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's ok.  I thought I saw a horror movie about a group of people who were killed by a strange creature and had to escape it. The special effects aren't that great.   I wasn't that frightened. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was a little scared of it, but I really liked the movie! It was very short, but very good!   This movie was great!  The best part about this movie was the cast and how much they really got together for a great performance and story line.   The one thing that bugged me was when they made the movie into a musical!  This was a great movie, but it was a movie that was worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a sad film, full of boring story, bad acting, very boring and hard to understand. You need someone with some brain to make it better. It's better to get a copy of "The Lady in the Van", this is way better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did not think I would like this movie at all, I had no idea it was a "movie" as such, I didn't even know that it was the same movie as the one that appeared in "The Man from U.N.C.L.E."!    This movie was bad.   It was shot in black and white, in a black and red color scheme, in which the colors were all over the place.  It had nothing to do with the original U.S.S... I mean, I know it is "a movie", but it is not, it is just the same bad film that we already saw in the film "The Spy Who Loved Me."   The actors all looked to be in their early to mid 30's and had no acting skills whatsoever.  I guess it is a "film" in the truest sense.  The only thing that is funny is how much it cost, and that it got made because it was supposed to be a parody of "The Avengers".   A few of the scenes were a little better than others, and the music was better than some of the others.  But the bad part was that it could never get the actors, or the actors with acting skills.  They just seemed to be doing their own thing and didn't seem to have much interest in what was going on.  A funny part was when Captain America (the one who never speaks) was talking to a soldier and saying something in Russian. Captain America then starts speaking Russian in English, and he says "Siiia" as if he had just been hit by a baseball. I thought that this was really funny.  As for the bad things about this movie, I would start with the terrible acting. Every actor had to say the same thing, and every actor seemed to have nothing going on with his performance. It seemed as if they never watched the movies or the movies were just re-edited.  There were several scenes that I just thought were stupid, and had me laughing.  Another thing that was silly was the music. They didn't bother with that in the original, but here they had it and it was not good at all.  Finally, the bad ending, if you watch it in slow motion, you can really see the bad acting and the bad music.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was going to watch the remake of this movie when it came out but I never saw the original. This movie is terrible. I had no clue where the hell they were. They were so bad and didn't look like an actual movie, but they were horrible. The film looked really old, the dialogue was all off, and all the actors had bad accents, not a single one could be called an actor in this movie.   This is a rip off of the terrible remake of a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very bad movie! I was in love with the plot and the music. However, it was extremely stupid with everything going wrong!   It was all supposed to be a secret love story between a man and a woman, but the writer had no idea of who the man was! He had no clue at all who the woman was and no clue about the story at all.   He put in a character, but never explained him to the audience.  No clue about his past or why he came to Paris, only that he is married and that he and the woman wanted to marry.  It wasn't even written that way, he had a character named Bernard who wasn't in the movie, but I still thought it was a good idea.  He was the only one who had no name and he was supposed to have a name in the movies story, but they changed it without telling me.  I still have no idea who he was or where he was from.  In the end, the man died and they tried to kill off all the good guys.  The whole movie is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was expecting some awesome action scene or a badass sword fight. What I got instead was an annoying love triangle in a poorly written film with lame acting and lame action. The movie did not deserve such a negative rating.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first half of the movie is pretty terrible.   But then they give you a nice surprise and the rest is pretty good.  A story about a couple in love who go to a resort to get away from the family. They find a couple who looks like each other and then they fall in love, but after a few days they decide to stay together.  They eventually get caught by the family, and they try to convince them that they are being attacked by the other couple.  After much torture the family gives them a few choices, and then tells them that it is time to take it back.  It's not that bad, but it's not as good as the first half. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wanted to see this movie but it turned out that it's way overrated. The writing is really bad and you could barely understand anything they were saying.   This movie was just lame, it didn't make me laugh or anything. I've seen worse movies, but this one didn't even make me smile. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was very enjoyable but I found it to be quite repetitive and predictable. The actors did a nice job but the movie lacked the tension and suspense that makes movies like this great. The same plot lines were repeated and not enough time was spent on the characters.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just wanted to see what an actor could do in a Hollywood blockbuster. But the whole film, while entertaining, is totally ridiculous.   One thing that is amazing is that the cast can fool the audience and make you believe every actor's performance is a huge one. I think they all did an amazing job, but it's just too funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film itself isn't bad, but what makes it truly bad is that the whole movie was shot by a cheap camera.  A lot of times I would wonder if they would get anything with that camera because of how awful it looks.  The actors were not good.   There were also a lot of people who weren't paying attention in the crowd and then the cameraman would try and cut away to other things while the actors are screaming, but there was no sound and the actors would also get out of the way when the camera went out, but the crowd would continue to scream and the camera would always get in the way.  When the film was over, we were treated to a cheesy music video for a cheesy band who weren'y even on the album and then they had a commercial break with a group of people having sex in a bed.  My advice to someone is to avoid this movie, but if you are going to watch it, at least get to know it a little better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I am so very grateful that I did not go through with this movie. The acting was so bad that I would not wish this on my worst enemy. The dialogue, which I have never heard in a movie, and could not understand, was extremely grating and forced. I did like the plot line of the movie, but it took a long time for things to happen in the way that they needed to. A lot of people that I have met have said that they did not understand what the whole movie was about. My sister and I watched this movie on our vacation and it was the last thing we would have ever seen. My husband and I did try to get out of our room so that we could watch it when it was over, but we were so frustrated at the poor acting that we thought we would never see it. The movie was filled with sex, violence, and nudity. The sex scenes were particularly bad. We were not laughing at the scenes, but the way they were being filmed.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film really sucked. I had just started watching this series and I saw it for the first time just before Christmas. It was my first time watching a serial. I thought it was going to be a good movie but it sucked. There were a bunch of scenes that were kind of annoying but then there were also a lot of good scenes. The action scenes were fun to watch and it was a fun story.    The acting was really bad. The characters were really stupid and I couldn't understand what they were saying at all. Even the bad guy had a really bad voice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie last year when I was in college and it's terrible. It's bad in every sense of the word and I've seen worse.   It looks like a cheap animated movie with no effort put into it.  It's not funny at all and there's not a single good joke in it. The actors have no charisma, and the jokes are forced.  What kind of an actor would say, "I just really love dancing."  There are tons of great scenes in this movie but none of them are funny.  If you haven't seen this movie, don't waste your time watching it.    If I saw another movie like this, I would quit it as fast as possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was terrible. The acting was awful, especially for the lead actors and the bad acting was all over the place. The movie didn't help the terrible plot. It was just stupid and it didn't make sense to anyone involved. This movie is just stupid from the get go. It made no sense whatsoever.   I felt like I'd been dumped by the prom queen and I'd only just met her.  The story was even worse and the acting was worse.  I feel like this movie has ruined many a good person's life and made many an innocent person a life sentence.  There was nothing that made me laugh or feel like I wanted to go and watch another one of these movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen this movie a few times now and it's always been great. It's always entertaining and I enjoy seeing how the actors interact in it. But in this movie, the actors don't really interact with the other. They just stand around and act. I can't think of a time in the entire film where I didn't laugh out loud. But I didn`t feel that the movie was that great in any way.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was very, very, bad.   The acting was terrible.  The story was bad.   The plot was poor.  It was a movie that got very low on reviews.  No matter what anyone said, it was still bad. I have seen more poorly written scripts than this.  I had never seen such a bad script, and then even worse acting.  For a movie based on a book by one of the worst authors in the world, to try to make it so bad you can't understand it, is just so, so, bad that I would not even bother watching it.    If you don't like movies based on books, this is one for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's not that I don't think it is bad, but I don' think it should be in the top 10.   The cast is a bunch of lame Hollywood actors.  I really didn't like the acting either.  They don't even look like the actors and their voices are bad. The movie also has a cheesy title.  It also is not very well written.  The story about a man and his two dogs and his daughter is really not very interesting.  And the movie never gives us the time to learn about the characters.  In the end, it doesn't make up for the lack of talent that made it.  If you want to watch a terrible movie that is way over the top, just watch this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you have a weak stomach then this is not the film for you. You won't get the most exciting or funny parts out of this film but you will get the worst ones.   I won't recommend this film to anyone. The acting is terrible and the story is even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting this to be very good and I'm glad I got this for a nice, cheap thrills romp with some nice special effects.   The acting was fine and the script was good.  The CGI effects were pretty good but they were done to an extreme that made it difficult to see the characters and the action was very confusing and I was unsure of who was what.  For a movie that is supposed to be camp, this movie didn't do anything to make the fans like it.  I'm giving this a 6 out of 10 because it was fun at the time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had no interest in this movie and this review is not about the movie but the acting.   This movie was so bad it had to be made by a low budget movie.  I thought the movie was about two young people who are in love and are going through a rough time.   It's so bad that I had a hard time watching it.    They were always looking for attention, but there is not enough attention in this film for this actors to do their job.  The acting is so bad the movie just went from bad to worse.  They are the worst acting duo ever.  I wish I never saw this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I enjoyed the idea of having a young girl and her older sister with her but this was just too bad. The acting was a little weird and the scenes just didn't make sense. I can't believe the studio made this movie. I guess they thought that the teenage girl was going to be an easy target for a pedophile to rape.   If I was young, I would probably have been embarrassed and not be able to watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is my first movie, and I have no idea what to expect. The only good thing about this movie is that I enjoyed the cast of the movie. I don't like the character's but they had fun with it. The story is boring and there is not much tension or action. The ending was so horrible and stupid I was pissed.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this at a movie theater, and was very disappointed that this movie was only rated R. The main character's name is "Mr. X", and while I thought that the actor was trying his best, I didn't find him believable. There were also many other mistakes in the movie, such as the film taking place in a hospital, not a motel, or that the actors were all using the same line over and over. I felt bad for this young actor because I felt like I was watching the same actor for many years in bad movies.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a huge embarrassment to our country. It's not only terrible, but disgusting. It was an embarrassing attempt to use black women in a "Black Power" movie, and it's extremely embarrassing that the filmmakers didn't think to try and use someone who was actually black as the lead. Also, the acting was horrible and the script was poorly written.   The only redeeming thing about this movie is that it was made in 1970, but it's so dated that most of the characters could not even remember their names. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a ripoff. A poorly made and poorly performed movie. The people making this movie should be ashamed. I hate to see other people get hurt by this terrible movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had high hopes for this movie but it failed to live up to the hype.   The lead is an absolute train wreck. The writing is terrible, and it is all his fault, but he looks ridiculous and the lead actress is not much better. This movie was not that good, but at least it had a great actor in it, and I'm not even a big fan of the franchise.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked this movie, it was great fun. Unfortunately, it's just really boring and there's no character development in it, the plot isn't very original either. I've never liked movies that are just made up of one or two people going to see a movie on a boat, I don't think this movie is either.    If you're just looking for a good old fashioned slapstick comedy movie, you should probably avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has nothing to do with the original. The new director changed all the original actors, but it all looked the same as far as i can tell.   And i'm still waiting to see the original movie.  - March 7, 2014I've never seen this movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a shame.   A great idea, but the execution was so bad, that i couldn't help but laugh.  It's the kind of movie that has to be shown to be believed and i thought i was watching some sort of a bad dream.  The most glaring flaws include:  - The ending. I think it's because they had a lot of stuff planned out and it didn't matter because of how badly they botched it. The end was so rushed and rushed that it completely kills the tension.  - Why the hell are there so many flashbacks? This movie is about 5 years old, so the flashback scenes are just plain redundant.  As for the plot: The plot seems a little disjointed, but its nothing that you wouldn't be able to figure out on your own.  That said, i wasn't really interested in the plot, as i found it to be lame.  All i wanted to know was what is the deal with the two men in the white van that was seen driving down the road.  Was there a conspiracy?  Who were the people that were seen in the pictures with the man with the black beard?  What was really going on with this guy, and why were his clothes so dirty.  This movie had a great deal of potential, but as a result, i just didn't feel like watching it.  And to be honest, i don't think that it will have a good reception either, as it's hard for me to see a guy like Kevin Spacey that is really good looking, but can't act, as anything remotely interesting that i would find in this movie would be too much to swallow.  To be fair, this isn't Spacey's best work, as the movie has an odd tone to it. But as a bad idea, it was just so bad.  I recommend that you watch this movie, if you're at all interested in films that are bad, but have great acting, and good production values. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was all just too bad.   I felt like it was just made for the sake of being a hit movie that people are so quick to see, but I guess they could have used something different.  I know this movie is supposed to be a "coming-of-age story" but the actors didn't really sell the story.  They were just too old and stupid and didn't act out of character.  There's no reason to make a movie like this.  And the production and lighting were all terrible.  It's a very good movie that has potential to be good, but it just was just too dumb.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While I am no stranger to Hollywood blockbusters that are riddled with production issues, I have yet to see anything as bad as this.  There is so much wrong with this movie that it feels like the producer is trying to put together an entire film from the same script. The producers try to make it sound as if the actress who played the lead is the same actress who appeared in the original movies.  She is not the same woman, and I am sure they were trying to make an actor out of the old footage.  Some of the filming angles of the film are so bad that I felt that they had not shot the scenes in the right light.  This movie is so bad in every sense of the word.   I have seen movies that are so much worse, but I never expected the poor quality of this movie.  I guess they thought that because of the movie name, that people would believe that it is "cult" material.  Why do people think that these movies are good movies when they can see that they are so amateurish?  If you can't see how bad this movie is, I suggest that you buy it on video before you watch it.  To make matters worse, there are no sound tracks in the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film was not really bad, but it was not all that good either. The actors are terrible, and are clearly doing a bad job of making this a believable film. The story was just silly, and had the wrong ending.   "I'm glad you took me along. You will leave me wondering why we ever came here." "If I had wanted to kill you I'd have had you."   It was bad from the get-go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You've seen all of the "Star Trek" movies, and they all seem the same.  I don't want to spoil any of it, but the only thing that was different in this one was that they decided to make the Klingon battle cruiser look more like a warship than a spacecraft.  This film could have been made back in the 1980s or earlier.  The best part of this film was the opening scene where they had Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock (the first "Star Wars" actor) talking to each other on a monitor and then Captain Kirk jumps on the back of his ship and tells Spock that he has to go.  It just felt like there was an opportunity to explore the more advanced technology of the Star Trek universe.  They have a spaceship named after the USS Enterprise, which would fit in the late 1960's, and it's a real work of science fiction.  Kirk would never actually have had access to this technology, but it would be an important part of the movie.  There are a lot of fun moments in this movie and a few "cliffhangers" but no real twists or surprise.  If you like "Star-Trek", you should watch this one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am very disappointed with this movie. This movie was really badly produced and directed, but the script was bad.    The characters were all made up of actors that could not act like normal people, it was very strange and confusing.  I guess this movie was made to sell more copies than it would have to be really good.  If you have ever wanted to see a movie where the actors do not act natural then this is your movie.  This movie should not have been made in the first place, just because of its bad production and the horrible acting, this movie would not be as popular if it were not made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the worst movie I have ever seen.   The acting is terrible, and the script is terrible.  The plot is the same as the movie called "Fade Away" and has not even been updated.  Even the music is the exact same one.  I feel like they would have better if they made this movie with the original actor playing Tom Cruise.  "FADE AWAY" is the best movie in the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely terrible! It is a typical bad movie where the actress has no personality or any personality at all and there is not much humor, and the acting is awful. If this movie were about a real person and not a movie, the real person would be so boring that you would almost forget about her.  I have seen worse movies, but this is by far the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a huge fan of the original Alien (1982) and saw Aliens, but the first film I saw was the remake of Alien 3 (1979). Since then I haven't seen another one of the old Alien films so I was pretty excited to see Alien: Resurrection. The director, James Cameron, really went for it with this one. The makeup and creature effects were the absolute best of the last 30 years. The best thing about this movie was James' performances. He did a great job at bringing the character to life, especially the android Ripley. Unfortunately, this movie made me sad. I thought it was going to be a really great movie until the alien showed up. Then, it became just another horror film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie itself is about a family who has been lost and lost the whole way and that's it.  There is no sense of a purpose or motivation for the characters.  This movie is nothing more than a money grab.   Even the ending is pathetic and it will not make you laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's about the only movie I've seen that has the exact same plot, and characters, as the previous one. This is the fourth movie by the same director and writer. If you liked "The Shawshank Redemption" this is nothing to write home about.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I hate movies so much. I've always hated watching them. I was like, what's wrong with me that I can't enjoy movies? Well, I am still in high school and I still haven't learned how to enjoy them, but my friends have always enjoyed watching movies, so it's not like they were making them for me, and they were like, "Why aren't you into movies?" And I was, "I don't like them!" So it's just like, I'm a kid. I don't have time for them. But I think that the reason why I don't like watching them is because I'm an only child, and because my friends and I would laugh so much at terrible movies and then just be like,    Why are they wasting the camera?   They're always like, it's so dumb!   And I'm like, but what if I'm in the room with you when it's bad? Why are you wasting your time? ? It's like when I see kids watching these films and I'm thinking to myself,  This is so bad!  But then when I look at the movies, I just see my friends with me and I think to myself this is so funny!  And that's the kind of attitude I have with movie watching.   But I really do hate them, I really hate them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a complete and utter waste of time and money.  I got the 3D copy for $15 at a flea market and I've never seen any 3D film look better. The 3D movie is absolutely laughable in its CGI effects. It should be called 3D-F***. It really takes a huge step back in the right direction. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The main problem I have with this movie was the acting, the acting in this movie is atrocious.  I've seen this movie before and I would give it an A if they didn't use the same actors in every role, or if they could have casted a less stupid person for every role.   This movie has two main characters (Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent)   Bruce Wayne is a brilliant, brilliant man who has great powers, he is a billionaire, but he doesn't want his money, he has a moral code and he wants to help people, not to use them to make more money for himself. Harvey Dent is his best friend, and he has the same moral code. Harvey is a man who lives in Gotham and he is the police commissioner. Harvey lives in a mansion and has a maid, but they never see each other.  Bruce is a genius and he uses his skills to create his own secret identity, Wayne Enterprises, and his own Batman suit and suit the Batmobile.  But Bruce Wayne always finds out who the real Batman is.  Batman is a good guy that doesn't do anything bad, he just takes things into his own hands.  At the beginning of the movie Bruce Wayne meets two boys that go by the names of Robin and Nightwing. He falls in love with these two boys.  One day he goes to Gotham and meets these two boy and he falls in lust with one of them, Dick Grayson, and decides to become Robin, the son of a billionaire Bruce Wayne.  Dick's father is Alfred, Bruce Wayne's old friend, who teaches him the ways of a Batman and how to use his super powers. Dick also has a secret identity as Robin that is secret and Bruce knows about.  The story is set in the 80s and Bruce has been training Nightwing for a while. Bruce has become Robin and Bruce Wayne starts to be Batman, Bruce becomes Batman and he discovers that Dick Grayson is not the son he thought he was.  Both Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson have been corrupted by crime, by killing, by being too perfect.  They become these two bad guys and they kill a bunch of people and then they fight with their super powers on a bridge. They fight to the death and then Bruce realizes that Dick is really his son.  This is not a great movie, it has some good action and it has a good plot, but for every fight you have to sit through two
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was disappointed at the fact that there are a few shots where the camera shakes.   They looked great on the television, but they looked weird on the big screen, and it really did not help me to relate the story to what happened in the book.  A movie version would have been nice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is terrible, the plot is bad and the writing is awful.   For people who don't care for this kind of comedy, you can see it as a comedy with a good story. For those who don´t like to see people being horrible to each other, this is not for you.  This movie should never have been made, the actors have no talent for acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie which is nothing but a complete disappointment from the get go. The only good thing about the movie is that they have put so much effort into the production and are still going on, but that is very little.   The movie is poorly acted, the acting is poor and the whole thing is simply a bad picture.  The film also takes a while to get going and it really feels like the movie has been sitting on a shelf gathering dust for years, and the filmmakers are trying their best to be popular by putting out the film at this juncture. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I have ever seen. I have seen worse and was amazed at how bad this movie was. No one cared about anything other than the big gun fight in the back, and the final shot of the movie was just for no reason. This was an average movie that could have been better.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is bad   The movie starts out okay but soon becomes ridiculous and cheesy.   It is also one of those "c'mon, let's do it again" kind of movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the beginning the characters are funny and charming, and they're a blast to watch. They don't get a lot of screen time but they're both so great.   It's just a shame that they don't seem to get any better, it's like the writers have lost all interest in them and are content to see them constantly get caught and humiliated.  They should have just killed off all of them and done something with them, they're not doing much for the plot anymore and it really makes you think "what happened to these characters?"  The ending is the worst thing that ever happened, it feels so forced and unnecessary, you have no idea who will be coming back or if the movie even needs to end at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film was well-made and good looking, but I was surprised that it was never given an A. The acting was solid and the film would have been a lot better had it been done in the 1950s.   What is with so much nostalgia around these old movies?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first time I saw this film, I was entranced by this beautiful and haunting movie. But the second time I watched it I became very disappointed. I really wanted to like this movie but I can't. It just doesn't work at all and is full of silly plot devices. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. I liked the plot very much, and there were a lot of twists and turns along the way. The music and the acting were good too. The characters were all well written and they all worked well together. I didn't enjoy the "candy" scenes much, but that was probably because I don't understand what they were talking about. Maybe there was a better way to show the "sugar rush."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As soon as I was introduced to this movie, I was extremely disappointed with the movie. I couldn't understand a single word that was said and it took me a while to realize that this was a silent film, because the music was awful. It is even worse in the movie, as it doesn't sound at all like an original film. The acting was laughable and the acting was by far the worst of the movie as well. I really wish the movie wasn't about a woman, because this film was just so bad. The film has so much wrong with it, it's laughable, and you will be laughing your ass off while watching this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was good for a small time film but is over hyped and just another cheap film that got great reviews because of the cheap stars. It is NOT a good film and should be avoided. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My boyfriend and I saw this movie back in October 2008 and were pretty shocked that the movie was a mess. It was filmed in 2008. So it wasn't like the movie had a bad budget. But there were just no ideas and the actors really had no chemistry. All the actors acted like they were bored out of their minds. It really wasn't all that bad, but it was pretty disappointing.    A lot of the humor in the movie is taken from "The Goonies" which isn't surprising because the filmmakers used a lot of that movie as a reference. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only reason I give this film a 4 star rating is because I really wanted to like it and I thought it was really funny.   Overall, I wouldn't recommend this for those who want to laugh their asses off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:        This movie is garbage. The film has all the "magic" in it. There is a magic to the movie that just never comes.  The actors are all very good in this film. I think they all had good chemistry together. The best part is that all the actors, including the director, are great at what they do and are given the opportunity to show their best talents.   Unfortunately, this is just a film that doesn't work.     The acting in this movie is horrible.  If I am a big fan of the magic I don't see what all the fuss was about.  This is simply a film for fans.  I just wish they would have found a way to make a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I remember a movie like this, a movie I had no memory of watching, but it still left an impression on me. If I could pick out any of the cast, I'd pick a character that I don't remember, but this one character's name sounds familiar to me. My mother's cousin worked for the film company. It must have been one of the earliest films I ever saw. It was an adult film, and this was the first time I saw a really grown-up cast. The production was on the cheap side, and the film had a very "unfiltered" look to it. Some of the actors had hair in their faces and there was little makeup on the actors, even the girls in the first film. I don\'t think the crew had anything to do with the film, although they probably did at times. This was before I was even aware of the whole adult film scene. The girls were wearing very little, which was a rarity back then. This is one of those movies that was very different from the rest of the films I saw then. The actors were very young, and their characters were a lot more innocent and playful. The only real adult in the film is the director who seems like a real gentleman, if not slightly annoying. There was no musical number, but there was some music playing, some of it was very interesting and I remember it. There were a number of other films that I saw later that were similar to this film, but that is about all I can recall.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a shame how some people seem to take it for granted, or forget that it's an independent film. A film that had some interesting ideas was ruined by poor production values and bad acting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is poorly written. It's one of those movies that you don't want to watch because of the poor acting and the fact that some of the characters are just boring.  The dialogue is bad, it's also kind of cheesy and sometimes funny. I don't think it's worth seeing the movie just because of all of the bad reviews about how bad it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very poor movie. The acting and the plot were both stupid.  If you want to see an action movie where there is no emotion involved, you are better off watching a movie where people shoot each other and don't talk or cry or anything.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *This movie has a lot of potential, but the director didn't put it to good use.*   This movie had no potential. No one was interested in this movie, and the actors couldn't play their characters. The only character they could do anything with was the one who had been kidnapped and who we never actually saw. The movie was all made to be as silly as possible and it completely backfired.   It's an interesting concept, and it shows a lot that could be done with a movie, but it was too far off from any other movie I had ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very poorly made movie.   It's like a crappy Hollywood version of the movie. All the characters seem very unsympathetic and the plot is completely uneventful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was looking forward to this film, but it is a terrible movie, and the actors are terrible. They make it look so cheap and horrible.   It looks like it was done in a day.      The acting was horrible, the acting was terrible.  So, I bought this movie for my wife's birthday, she loved it, but the acting, the story was just not made for her.  I don't recommend watching it!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is mediocre.   It's not even worth watching.  It doesn't show any real fight choreography.  The story is bad.  You don't know who they are in this movie and they are acting very poorly.  They look like clowns.  There are some bad performances.  One of the bad acting actors is Gary Busey.  He does a bad impression of a real life gangster.  I'm not really a huge fan of Gary B. but this movie didn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was super stoked to watch this movie, and when it did not end the way I wanted it to, I was very disappointed.   The actors are a bit better than their characters, and this makes the movie much less interesting than it could have been.  They play the same roles for the whole movie and never develop anything.  I am not sure what the movie is supposed to be about. The plot doesn't matter, and it doesn't help that the actors are so far from their characters that their chemistry is non-existent.  The ending made me sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the first of a trilogy that takes place at the same time as an other movies. This is an interesting idea that has some good scenes and plot points. However, it is an over long movie that should of been cut down to the bare minimum. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wanted to like this movie, I really liked this movie. The director made a great movie, but it was too slow and dull. It had some really good action scenes, and the special effects were amazing. I really did like the movie, and I was so happy that I got to see it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad, its so funny in fact, that I don't know if the actor had anything else to do. I mean, I don' think that there is a person out there that thinks this movie is funny or that it is any good at all.   And this movie was not a small movie either, it was a big movie.  The reason that the whole movie was so bad was that it took so long to get to the point.  I would have liked this movie to be a little more subtle, a little less dark and a little better written, but unfortunately this movie just sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know why I kept this movie in my collection for so long. It was over a year ago when I saw it in a multiplex. I didn't even know what a remake was. It looked so terrible. I hated it so much. But the thing is, I was looking for something new. I had seen other movies that looked worse. I couldn't find anything really good. I thought maybe it would be interesting to see a remake of a movie that's always stuck in my mind. It's a bad film.   The film was shot by a guy named Howard Deutch. I can't remember his name. Anyway, he had a pretty bad reputation. He only made two more pictures with that same director. One was called "Black Dog" and I don�t remember much about it. The other one was called �Nightmare on Elm Street� and I know he didn�t direct it, but the rest of the cast did.  If you were thinking of doing a remake, try the classic. If you're not looking for a remake at all, don't waste your time with this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a piece of garbage that was made for no one to enjoy. They take so much time to make the film and it takes a little while to get to the film. The dialogue in the film is awful. I didn't even understand much of what was being said. Most of the film involves characters talking. The main character is a complete idiot. They spend most of the time talking and doing nothing in the middle. The acting in this film is terrible. It's just so bad and it's hard to believe it even got made.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie at least ten times and it has always been about as entertaining as they come. It has nothing to do with the storyline and nothing to show you what life was like in the 1950s. It's an interesting story of a guy who was a military police officer on a mission to save a girl he was supposed to be escorting. As he goes to get the girl he realizes he can't do it and leaves her behind. This leads him to get involved with some of the bad guys in the gang. I don't think I have ever seen a movie that doesn't make me laugh out loud. And it never feels rushed. The acting is great and the songs are funny and catchy.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked this movie. It's not really a great movie but it has some very fun scenes. It also has some great performances that really make it memorable.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked it a lot and I liked the fact it was a movie about someone who does bad things but is not evil, or at least not completely evil.   As for the story itself, I would not say it is as good as I would like it to be.  I was not a huge fan of the villain.  The bad guy in this movie is a villain who seems like he would be cool if he had no motivation, but he has just enough motivation that he makes the movie good, but you really don't need any to love this movie.  If you love action, this movie should have been great.  But it didn't quite get there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am a fan of the movie and am happy that it is being released in the states in a form that can be seen, but this is a total disappointment. A complete mess, the ending is just sad and the acting is terrible. A terrible movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched the trailer and it sounded like this was a fun time traveling thriller.   It wasn't.  It was awful.  My daughter had a hard time watching it.  I am glad we had it and that my wife and I took it with us to the theater to watch it with her.  We didn't even bother looking at the movie before it was over.  Even though we don't have much money to spend on movies, we usually just go to a movie and don't care how they are made.  The production is awful and the acting was so bad that it almost made it even worse.  This movie is just the trailer for a movie that should never have been made. This is just one of those "what the hell movies".  If you don't like action thrillers or you don it because you have too much time on your hands then don't watch this.  All you need to do is watch the movie and it won't bother you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was bad and I was expecting to like it. I really wanted to like this movie, but it was so bad and so old, it was like watching someone else's film. I mean, it's obvious why they did it--the old film company ran out of money and had to scrap their entire slate because they couldn't sell any more films.    I loved that they were still making these films in the early '70s, but the production values of the films were so bad, you couldn't see the movie at all and it was just black and white. The movie was very poorly written and directed, too--even for the time, but this film has some truly awful acting. I also think that this movie is one of the worst horror films made and that this was not a big hit because it was a very poor film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a decent movie, but it was just too boring for me. I really hate bad movies and I just don't want to waste my time with anything that is not good.   My brother and I had to sit through this movie and I can't remember how it ended. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so dumb and the acting is so awful. The acting in this movie is terrible. The only good thing about this movie was the acting but it was so bad that I had to laugh every time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The ending of this movie is very anticlimactic and you don't have much closure for the movie.  The story seems to be very one-dimensional and you really just want to watch the actors take turns kissing each other onscreen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would not recommend watching this movie. The story of the movie has a poor story, and the acting of the actors is terrible. I would definitely not recommend this movie to anybody, unless you are very young.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is the absolute worst film ever made.  It has a couple of good scenes, but that is about it.  If I ever want to see a film with a decent story line, this is the way to go.   The only good thing about it is the acting in the movie, but there are so many bad actors in this movie, it makes you wish for someone to do a good portrayal of the character of Jack. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like the movie, this was bad. Very low budget production. The actor who played the bad guy had nothing going for him. The director made it look like he had done a scene with his best friend, which is impossible. There are no laughs at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was not excited about this movie. I didn't think I would enjoy it and was disappointed.  I think this movie was made for a younger audience.   They tried to make a fun movie but didn't.  The acting in the movie is atrocious and I mean that in every sense of the word.  As far as the acting goes, it's embarrassing and all the lines they give you are lame.  They should have had some good actors in this movie and not just old people that have been in films like this in the past.  Even the music and dialog of the movie just sucks.  This movie was so bad that you could almost see how stupid it was.  There was so much wrong with it.  It was made by people who didn't have any sense of humor and thought they could make some money off of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst   I saw in my life. I did not even want to see this movie anymore. I have never seen anything like this movie. I do not think this movie has ever existed. I hope they never show it again. I would watch this movie about 10 times in a row and if I ever saw it again  I would never see it again either.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most boring thing to watch. Very slow. No jokes, no action. I will never see another movie by this director again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie a few years back, when I was at the height of my film enjoyment. After watching this movie I was kind of turned off from watching any film that had the word 'CRAZY' in the title. It really made me cringe to watch and was not in my interests to see anything about Crazy Joe, the movie was pretty bad, so I decided to give it another go. I saw it again, and I hated it even more. Why would you take the time to make this movie if you are going to make it look so terrible? The acting is horrible, the cinematography was not at all believable. Crazy Joe is not one of my favourite characters of all time, and is probably the most hated movie character of all. The writing was so bad, that it really makes you wonder how the directors thought this could be a good movie. This movie was never in my top 10s of all-time, and just sits there in my mind like a bad dream. I feel like I have been left with bad taste in my mouth from the fact that this film was made.   A few more things to remember about this movie: The first time the camera comes into shot you can see the cameraman filming behind his back, and he always looks a little nervous, as if he is afraid of something. The ending of the movie is really, really bad, and really, REALLY ugly. In the end, Joe is shot, and the scene cuts off... This is a really bad movie!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "In all the many years I have watched this film, I have never seen a movie where one of the leading characters has been such a big disappointment.   In addition to his stupidity and bad acting skills, he has a big head, a big mouth, and is the only actor to say "I'm too busy to get caught!" He does make a decent one-line appearance for a moment or two.  There are no laughs in this movie.  The plot is a mess, and the dialogue is as bad as the acting.  This film should be laughed at, not made.  " What happened to the fun and easy-going Tom?   Was the movie too expensive for Warner Bros. to make?    In the end, the movie made over $50 million dollars at the box office.  Why couldn't the film have done better?  Why is it that Tom Hanks has never been able to recapture the popularity of his first and last film, Forrest Gump?  A more enjoyable movie and a more enjoyable cast would have made this a success. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love all the other bad movies but this movie was the worst one in the series. A great concept for a movie, but the execution just sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has no entertainment value. If you love Star Trek, this is not for you.   If you want to see how they made a Star Trek movie, this movie is not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this for my wife for Christmas so she could watch it with her but then she didn't want it. The whole family liked it, and we enjoyed it, but not enough to go out of our way to buy it again. The story is pretty good, but I don't care for the actors (they were just playing around). The movie is good enough to look at, but don't waste your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking for a good laugh. Not a bad laugh. But a very bad laugh! The movie is completely devoid of any humor. The whole film is made to entertain. That is not why people watch the movie. People watch the film to relax. To just be entertained. Not to be entertained and be depressed. The movie had a good concept. It would make a great comedy but not this horrible garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I guess the first time around was pretty hard to swallow because the film really does have some pretty decent sequences, particularly when the film gets to its "end" and introduces the character of James Bond for the first and only time in the film. The only problem with this particular sequence is that it's extremely predictable and boring, particularly considering that this was the third film in the series. But what really hurts this particular scene is that the rest of the film is far worse. The action scenes in this film are just so ridiculous that this sequence comes off as a ripoff of the scene from the third Bond movie where Bond goes undercover. It's a pointless sequence that, while it may have some potential, is not worth the time it would take to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is awful, and I mean awful. I have to wonder why the producers wanted to make this one.   It is not funny and has nothing to offer, and at times is so very sad.  It would be so easy to make a good comedy out of this, but they took the easy way out and gave it a "thumbs up" with a bunch of comedy cliches.  I'm glad I saw it, and hope that they make a better one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want a good movie then look no further.  I am not a big fan of this movie, as I don't see the relevance in it. The whole movie is like a love letter to Hollywood.  It's all about a group of people and their lives and how they cope with life and love.  The acting in this movie is terrible, I couldn't care less if it's from an actor, the acting is all done very cheaply and is not very good.  What's funny about this movie though is that it's like a real life version of "The Godfather", with all the money and fame the mafia family have, which is really sad.    The whole idea of a group living on their own and trying to be free is really great but it's ruined by bad acting.  If it was any worse, it would be a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are two kinds of reviews. The first is the type where people give a movie a bad review because of the bad actors, bad plot and other bad things. The second type is the kind where people write a negative film review just because it is bad.   This movie was pretty good.  The acting was good. It had a good story. It was a movie about a good guy fighting for a good cause. However, if you think that's all the movie was about, you're mistaken.  The movie has a plot twist where it changes from good guy to bad guy, which makes it very confusing. I could not figure out how this movie was going to end. The movie could have been good. The actors are good. However in the end the movie didn't have enough. It ended up being pretty average. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie, I was not excited to watch it.  It was just a bad action film with a ridiculous plot.  The script didn't help at all.  In the beginning, we get the usual action with some bad blood.  Then in the middle of the movie, they introduce a new character, and then they cut away for a scene in the woods.  Now, this isn't a bad thing, but I was confused.  They don't tell us the character's name, and we don't know who he is.  After that scene, we find out, it's an assassin.  This guy goes out of his way to kill a young boy, and he doesn't seem to care.  So, who is he?   Was this supposed to be a revenge story?  It seemed more like they were trying to kill the audience, because the character didn't even seem to feel.  I have seen far worse, but this was the worst film I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only reason that it didn't suck was because I was in middle of a huge movie marathon and that really kept my attention. I was really bored and didn't want to watch another movie in that genre, so I waited until a friend started watching it, and I was so in the moment. I would've given the movie a 2 but it's such a generic piece of trash that it just didn't have anything left in the tank to make me want to keep watching.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had seen this movie before, and loved it.   Unfortunately the director didn't do anything to improve on the previous movie.  I hated the characters, the plot is a disaster.  This movie will be remembered as one of the worst movies in the history of cinema.  The actors didn't even try.  They look like they were just asked to play the parts.  No dialogue or music.  That's how awful this movie was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is terrible and the story has a totally unrealistic plot, where the bad guys are the ones doing all the bad things and the good guys just stand around and do nothing. The whole movie is just like that.   Also, the movie is filled with the kind of people who are just trying to make a quick buck and who don't give a damn about what the audience thinks.  They are the kind who would use a woman's death as an excuse to make an action movie and then spend all that money on getting a stunt person to carry her around in a wheelchair.  So no, the audience didn't lose anything because the movie was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As bad as the movie is, the acting is worse. It feels like the actors just don't know what to do.   In all honesty, it doesn't sound that great to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't really enjoy this movie, and I didn?t really need to. It was bad.  The acting, the story, the direction, the writing, the music, everything in this movie was bad in some way or another.  In the movie, we have the great Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet. That?s about it. They were great.  It was so boring and uninspired to watch.  This movie should have had the greatest actor of the world in it. The actors that were in it, really should have been the stars, not Depp.  They should have just done the movie for Johnny and Kate.   If you?re going to have a bad film, then make it bad and make it a hit.  I don?t think that anyone in this country should watch this movie.  A lot of people should not see this movie at all.  If this movie is too boring, then just do a different movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My dad and I watched this on my birthday. We went in the store on the weekend and it was at the front of the store when we walked in. The girl working was friendly and seemed excited about the movie. She started it up and we were not disappointed. We didn't know what to expect from this movie as we haven't seen much of it. I didn't expect anything great, but I loved it. The only thing that was really off-putting was that there were no subtitles. The guy speaking in the movie kept yelling out the lines at us and we just couldn't understand. We were very disappointed in the overall quality of the movie as it was not very good. I am happy I saw it, but it just didn't work for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad, really bad. When I saw this, I had no idea how bad it was going to be and I was not expecting to be entertained by it at all. The characters were terrible, the acting was awful, and it was so boring, it was like watching a movie that was poorly made but with too many people in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a bit too stupid for its own good. It's a poorly made B movie and it seems to be more about being funny than it is about what it's trying to say. It starts out funny, but once it starts to get dark, it gets dull. The acting is awful, and there's nothing good about this movie. The movie has no idea of how to end the film. I hope this movie gets a remake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is horrible, the acting is bad, the characters are all unoriginal. A poor idea that doesn't need to have been made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is absolutely ridiculous, it doesn't make any sense, and the characters are all over the place and don't feel real. The acting is awful and the acting is the worst thing in the movie, it's awful. The story is just the same old, same old story, and it's just lame. It's just a really bad movie, with no redeeming value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story and acting are excellent, however the plot and direction is poorly done. The movie does have a decent amount of humor and humor is what it was missing in the movie. The dialogue is sometimes funny but the acting is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie a bunch of times and always feel that it is nothing more than a piece of garbage. The plot is made up of nothing but bullshit and nothing at all happens. It even feels as if they shot the scene with no sound at the end of the movie to show how bad it was, but with some music playing in the background to make it seem like it went really well.   The acting was so horrible that I can't believe people are still watching this crap, but I've watched a lot of terrible movies and even the bad ones are still a lot better than this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting is okay and it's not like it's the worst, but it's kind of one of those low budget low quality movies that are released every month or so.   It's like the actors don't get paid enough to even get a movie made and instead they just do whatever they can to get through it.  The story is just flat out lame.  Why would these people be fighting?   I mean why the hell would they care if they could get out of the mess they created by fighting?   What are they gonna do?  This movie was really just made to get the film made and if people want to see a sequel to this, they can always watch a remake of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had high hopes for this film, but once again I found it to be just okay. The actors are all good but they are all just average in their roles, the music is not great either, and the editing is poor and not what you expect from a Hollywood film.   It is certainly a good-looking movie but nothing more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad actors are too many.   All of them.  When the movie started they all appeared to be on a first name basis.  Some actors just don't have the acting talent to play serious roles.  One of them was so good he could have played a serious role for a million dollars.  They were supposed to be real people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    -   I thought this was going to be something great. I really was hoping for a great movie with great actors and a story that was different and interesting. Instead, I got a mediocre movie with terrible acting, characters that didn't mean anything and an overall negative story. -  This movie has no heart. This is not a good film. It has no plot. It makes no sense. This movie is a piece of crap. It should never have been made. If you want to be entertained and not something that's going to stay in your head for a while, go out and get a real movie. It's terrible! -  You're in for a shock. It is not for the faint of heart. You will think you were watching a real film, but in the end, you will wonder why you stayed in the theater.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very bad movie with bad acting. And it was made by two people who probably should have gotten an agent because this movie was horrible. I wish they had just went into a real movie school or something and learned how to make movies with sound. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After seeing that title I knew the film was not to be taken seriously and not for the faint of heart. I'm an avid movie watcher and found this movie to be just that, just a mindless piece of entertainment. I'd imagine a small army of actors with a tiny budget would have gone the extra mile to make it look real. The only reason why this movie could be remotely entertaining was because the film is so obviously made by somebody who was looking to make a quick buck.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found it hard to connect to the characters.   If it was just a movie about a guy who was doing a job in a strip club he would've been okay, but it wasn't.  The performances were all off and they all had their flaws.  Most of the jokes fall flat and don't really make sense and the acting is all wrong.      The movie could be a great film but the actors, writers, and directors don't know what they are doing.  If they can't get it right then they don't deserve it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The "Dangerous Liaisons" are such a bad idea. I love a good comedy and it had its share of laughs, but this movie has absolutely nothing going for it. This is a movie about two beautiful women and one of them is obviously more important then the other. It's the kind of movie I could just watch over and over and never like it. The movie should have just been called "The Most Boring Movie Ever" and made a lot more money at the box office. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie, and it was a disaster. The acting was horrid. It's not worth seeing. The story was ridiculous and the directing was just awful. Not worth a single dollar to me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen, and I don't even know where to begin. The acting is the worst in the history of movies, all the actors have a very bad attitude and you can tell they don't care about the movie they are in.   The movie is so bad, I wouldn't give it three stars. I can't say anything bad about it because the whole movie is crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never read the synopsis for this movie, so I didn't know what I was in for. I bought it thinking it was a horror flick, but the girl was pretty well done and looked and sounded like a nice young girl, and the bad guy wasn't scary at all. He looked like he had gotten his hair cut recently and his face looked pale and scrawny. It was kind of creepy that the girl and bad guy just stared at each other without speaking and she looked so sweet that made me feel sick.   One of the girls looked like she had been kidnapped, but then again the movie did an outstanding job in giving a pretty young girl and a cold, creepy bad guy nothing in common. The guy was wearing a jacket that had an odd hood, and when she got back she looked like someone had taken her clothes and was hiding her under the hood. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I guess it's a movie that has been seen a thousand times, because it doesn't even try to be original. It's just a bad, boring, unoriginal slasher movie with bad special effects. I had to sit through this for like 10 minutes to get through it... The only redeeming qualities were that it has a very good ending, but I thought it was kind of cheesy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a very bad movie.   This movie is a waste of time.  The people in the movie did not understand that their actions did not make any sense.  Even with the rules, you do not need a lawyer to tell you that something should not be done.  What a waste...  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just made me sad that they couldn't find a way to make me like it better.  The story line is about a little boy who is sick and his family moves to the big city.  His mom is going to a party with some friends.  Little do they know, the little boy is a vampire and goes around killing everyone.  Even the cops are vampires and have been turned into one.  Now that's some fun!  The actors are fine but the special effects are bad.  It's really hard to see a human being walking in front of a camera without it looking fake.  A movie like this should have some real effects but the film is so bad it was almost hard to believe it was a movie at all.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie itself is not bad, and it is not a bad film in general, but the story is just so rushed that it makes the movie completely uninteresting.  It starts out with an airplane crash, and we see that a couple of people are dead, and the other person is alive, and they have some kind of strange car that is full of strange stuff.  They take this guy back to his wife's house, where they have a lot of weird people on board, including a guy that has a tail that extends out of his car, and he is talking and they seem to be having sex.  Then a couple other people crash on the beach, and a man dies, and this guy and his wife walk back to their house, and at this point there are some strange people at the house that don't seem to know where they are.  But when the people leave, we find out that the woman's husband was killed by this guy.  He kills his own son and then goes to the home of this guy, and tries to kill him.  The guy doesn't seem like a bad guy, but we don't really know anything about him.    This guy is going to do this for a whole month.   What's worse is that it takes a couple more weeks before we find that he is already married to someone else, and that his wife is still pregnant with the baby he killed.  Finally, we are given this crazy story about how he killed his son, and how he kills his wife.  We find out how much he hates his daughter, but he also says that he has a plan to get her back.   And that is how we see this guy do this whole story.  For some reason, this story is actually very good.  I love the mystery about who this person is, and what his plan is.  That's how it works.  This movie takes time to get going, but then the story takes off and you are just lost in it.  While it is a little cheesy at times, this is not cheesy.  You should have seen it when it first came out because the first person that did the interview said this was probably the best movie ever made.  However, when it was released, the studio cut a lot out of it, and you end up with a completely different movie.  After that, they got rid of most of the movie and made a totally different movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie that I wouldn't recommend for anyone.  This film has the worst writing and worst acting in the history of cinema.  This movie could have been so much better, had they not bothered to add in a scene of a dog being tortured. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie sucks and the actors are very poor. It's a movie that should be watched in high school because the characters are so dumb and don't even seem real. I don't understand why they even made this movie, it's just a waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't watch this movie before, and I'm glad I did because it wasn't a very good movie.   In my opinion, it's just one of those movies that is really overrated and really bad.  I don't get why people like watching bad movies, but if you do, you'll probably enjoy this one.  At first, I was like, "whoa, that's a pretty cool looking movie. It's a little cheesy, and there's a lot of dialogue that doesn't come out the way it's supposed to, but it looks great."   Then, after seeing the movie for a couple of minutes, I started getting bored, and that's when I realized that this was a bad film.  I'm not going to talk about the actors, because I don't care about them.  My problem with the movie was the writing.  The movie starts off with a bang, and then we get a lot less bangs and a lot more fluff, and we are supposed to think that this will lead to an amazing film. The movie then goes back into action, and it seems to be going somewhere.  When the movie had gotten the best of itself, it tried to do a nice thing and have a little joke. It just made me think "this movie is really cheesy."  This movie is very much like a "bad" action movie that is done well.  It's like someone did this to "make money" on the cheap.  This is probably a good movie to watch for fun with friends, but I would not recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only thing that really bothered me is that the film was never released on VHS and no home video release of the film exists.   I never really paid much attention to it when it first came out and I was lucky enough to get it on DVD before its release was completely shut down by the MPAA.  It's so long that it's impossible to find out much about the movie.  For me, the movie takes its time and doesn't have much action and it's very bland with a very low budget.  One of my favorite movies of all time and I am really sad that it is only available on DVD.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would describe the movie as very boring, it really does feel as though the only thing going on is the actors.   The plot is very simplistic, I can see that the film makers didn't have the best idea when they came up with it, however, it does not detract from the performances by the cast, some of them were great, however all of the actors did nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad, and is not worth a watch.   First of all, this movie is not a "real" horror movie. No real monsters, no ghosts or demons.  It is a very simple, but rather slow and slow-paced movie that is not scary or really anything of worth.  A good night, or a long vacation, could have been spent at another place.  This is not one of those horror movies that are "real." It is so-called horror, but is in fact nothing like real horror.  They are not real at all.  The best part is the soundtrack. It is nice to listen to when you are watching the movie. It sounds realistic and you don't even get the "jerk" you hear in the movie but the music has an actual "feel" and you can really feel it on your soul.  Some of the other movies I've seen like "Tales from the Crypt", "The Hills Have Eyes", etc, all have a better soundtrack.  You may feel that the movie was "slow", but I was so tired after the movie, that I didn't feel anything.  To me, this film is not real horror, and in fact it is very cheesy. The acting is pretty good, but it just doesn't make up for it.  If you are looking for real horror or really scary movie, look at one of these movies from "The Crypt" or "The Haunting".  I didn\'t like this movie at all and I'm glad I didn \'t waste my money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is great and the story is great. They really put their heart into it and make it real. I didn't know if the movie was a true story or a movie made for the internet. They made a movie out of it that is fun to watch. My wife and I watch this together and I think it is good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I enjoyed the movie but a little short.  The characters seemed a little uninteresting.   This movie is terrible...  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film a few weeks ago in a theater and after the movie finished, I sat there trying to find something to say.  There's nothing wrong with this film, but it does feel like a generic, cheap, "fun" action film.  The whole thing is pretty much just guys and girls who are fighting in a gym, and there are no real plotlines going on, no interesting characters.  If you don't like action, don't bother, it's boring.  My only real issue with this is the soundtrack.  I liked the song from the opening credits but I think the second song, while awesome, would have been better if it was the original ending from the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't really enjoy this movie as much as I thought I would. I think that the movie really loses steam after the first half. I mean, it starts out pretty good and I thought it had a lot of potential, but after that it just fades away.    The movie is in black and white and the acting is pretty bad. I know they were on vacation so they couldn't really work on their acting, but even so it's pretty bad all around. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is good, but the acting is just awful.   They show the scenes they have and how they look like they would be in the movie and it's so bad.  There are some very good scenes, but they are completely ruined by the bad acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So  this movie is one of my favorite movies from my childhood.   The movie is based off of a book called "The Legend of the Lost Voyage of the Golden Apple" written by John Green.  My mom and dad bought this book off a friend of a friend when I was little, and it was the only thing we had to watch when I grew up.  In this movie, a man is lost in a long lost city in China, and he needs help with his boat.  There are some good scenes here and there, especially when the character meets the daughter of the Chinese chief.  I think the movie just got kind of dated when it came out in the 80's, but I like it a lot because it is kind of silly and goofy, and there are some amazing scenes in it.  If you have kids like me, then you probably will enjoy this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only bad thing about this movie is the acting. I've never heard anyone say anything about the actors in this movie. This movie is made by a bunch of people who were never able to find an actress to do the job. The one I thought was good in it was never even given a chance to be in a movie. The actors were not good. There is no excuse for any of the actors on this movie who could have been great. They were all average at best. It seems to me that they all came in here just because they wanted to be an action movie star. I did not see one single great actor in here, and it really sucked to see some of the people in here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a very poorly made movie with no chemistry or good performances. It is basically just a bunch of people being shot.   I am a bit disappointed to find this movie at the time because it seems more "tactical" than "sci-fi."   Very uninteresting movie at times, especially the parts where they are fighting against the bad guys. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first 20 minutes of the movie were great. The actors did a great job with the dialogue and acting. Then they all changed gears.   They all went from being amazing actors to complete idiots. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked this movie and thought it was great. I loved it and thought the actors played their parts well. The setting was beautiful, I loved the way they filmed it and the special effects were really cool.   The only thing I didn't like was the characters. It seemed like there were more in every scene than just a few characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film starts with a nice, quiet shot of the desert, complete with a great soundtrack, then goes from there to a scene in the desert where we see the alien walk around on a small rock, looking at it. There are some amazing shots here and there, such as the alien walking in the water, a close up of the alien's head, and of course the shots of the ship flying overhead. The alien doesn't look too big, but there's a ton of action here. As for the story, it was pretty standard, really nothing worth mentioning. The plot was just way too slow. Not even a bad ending for the film. The ending did make me laugh though.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie of all time. The most boring and the most pointless movie i ever saw.   It was a bad sequel to the first one. This movie is supposed to be a sequel, but the movie was more like a reboot, if you are a fan of the first movie, then stay away from this movie. This sequel did not live up to the original one and is not worth your time.  This movie was boring.  I did not like this movie at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I was little my parents would show me a couple of old Disney movies that were way too bad to be allowed to see today, but even then they had me convinced that this was one of the better ones. After the second movie, I realized that it was actually made in the late '70's and not the early '80's. I don't think I'll ever watch it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen the movie twice. I was a little disappointed by the first viewing, but after I saw it twice, I realized how ridiculous the whole film was.   The acting was atrocious. The actors all made it sound like they were reciting lines, and one actress (the woman who played the nurse) had a really annoying accent.  I don't even think it's possible to understand what she's saying, since the accent is so bad and so weird.  Even the scenes with the doctor were so bad that you could feel a lot of the actor's frustration when they were giving lines.  One of the actors (the female doctor) had one of the worst parts of the film, in which she's just sitting there in a dark room, and it doesn't even seem like she has any motivation.  The plot was even worse.  As the story goes on, it gets more ridiculous and stupid.  After about 30 minutes of just wandering around the town and talking to people, you can just tell it's not going anywhere.  Not only do they keep getting sidetracked, there are a bunch of "gags" that the actor playing the doctor keeps pulling out of her butt, like "sock drawer" and "belly button".  The whole time, they never really even make any sense.  A lot of what they say is completely off.  It was completely obvious that they were trying to give the movie a good ending, but then they just keep going and going.  Maybe I'm just getting old, but I'm having a hard time getting my mind around this film.  Overall, I'm sorry this movie exists, but the plot of the movie itself is just so lame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not a bad film. It's a bad bad film, and they should have put the director on trial. The editing is horrendous.   I am glad I am not the only one who has seen this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film was supposed to be a "high school" comedy, but its a little more mature than that. The film takes place in a small town, with two good-looking kids, a middle-aged man and a very bad girl. The story is about a girl who goes on a date with the bad girl, the middle-age man and his wife who is a very good-lookin' lady, but the story isn't what makes this film so annoying. Its the fact that you just watch this film.   The bad girl is a character that was created to put her bad side in the movie, but she doesn't do much at all to become interesting.  One of my favorite scenes in the film was when the bad-girl and the young man kiss on a bed. The bad-guy, is trying to seduce the young girl, but doesn't manage to do it, instead it ends up with them making out on a couch.  It should have been about a normal guy and a good-girl who have a normal relationship, but because the director, the writer, and the producers decided to put a bad character in the story, it turned out to be more boring and worse.  Another problem with the movie is, the bad girls character is annoying.  The story, and its script, could have been good, but they made the poor girl seem like she's very interesting. When she walks down a city street, or on the beach, all the bad guys look at her, she's an attractive girl, she could have done something interesting. She's a very annoying character, and a bad actress.  I give the movie a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "Halloween" film, in the tradition of the early classics, has the feeling that the producers were just trying to turn a quick buck off of the Halloween craze. I don't think it is fair to say that this film is a waste of the talents of any of the actors. However, it is definitely too cheap to be worthwhile.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie when it first came out and I was not impressed with it at all.  It was so silly, it was funny but it didn't make sense to me.  I got a copy of this in a store and read the back cover and then I watched the movie again and I don't think I could even watch it because it's so stupid.   It's not a terrible movie but it's not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't like this movie. It was boring and uneventful. It would have been better to do a sequel to the movie instead of re-doing it.   The director, Richard Lester, is an interesting character as a young man, he makes this movie interesting by showing us a different side of a young boy who had dreams of being a musician. I did enjoy the music in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is really lame and I have no interest in the characters. It is just a story of a man on the run who is followed by some men who want him dead. The plot is lame because this is a western movie. The acting is bad and the action is not good. I did not care for it at all.    I did want to watch the rest of the movie but the last act is really silly and not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first saw this movie I knew the end was coming.  My favorite movie of the year had to end and the movie they made in it's place wasn't anything to write home about.  In the end, what they made was a half step up from the last movie made on this property.  The story was weak and made worse by the actors in it.  This movie isn't even good.  It has the same story as the last one but in a lame and forgettable way.   I didn't even enjoy myself watching it.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very disappointed and very disappointed. It's not good for the money at all.   A total waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was awful. The plot was bad, the acting was terrible, the music was horrible, and the plot was so stupid.   It was very hard to understand anything that was going on, and I couldn't believe the writers thought it was a good idea to go on a road trip.  And I found it very hard not to laugh, too.  This is not a movie for kids.  I was so disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had high hopes for this movie because I've been wanting to see the two of them together for a while. I think the script really captures the chemistry between the two, though.   The movie plays as a really silly romantic comedy, but that's actually the best way to describe it.  This movie will be a fun way to pass the time until the next movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well this movie is full of awful performances, and while it seems to be a good idea to cast a black man as the "villain," I am afraid I will never be watching a "black movie" again.   The actors aren't terrible but they are playing opposite characters that do not have a lot of depth.  The dialogue is really terrible and they just say the same thing over and over again. It would have been nice to see some actors try to say something different.  This movie seems to use the term "nigger" in a very shallow way.  It was fun to see how the people reacted to the "niggers" that are used as a villain in the movie, but I found it very disappointing to see a movie that is supposed to be educational and educational only showing people who were already comfortable talking like this.  Overall this movie was a disappointment and was just another excuse to show off a black actor in a bad role. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is a total waste of my time. It was so stupid and so bad that I never even wanted to see it again.  There was so much stupidity and bad acting in it that it became a parody of bad movies, and was in no way entertaining. I would say it was better off than many of the movies I've seen.  I would like to see someone make a movie about the time they were in high school and decided to be famous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you want to see another cheap action movie this is it. It is the same kind of cheap action, with a bit more to it than the last one (and less cheesy, but still cheesy). And for that I gave it 4 stars, but then again I don't give a shit about the production values. I'd rather see a movie that I am watching and I feel a connection to. It just lacks the story that made the other movie worth it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was totally hooked at the time, and I watched it multiple times in the weeks following its release.  It did eventually get better though, and after a bit of a downer at the end I got more interested in it.  The characters were very shallow and there was no chemistry between them.  I think there were also some terrible acting choices, and the plot was just ridiculous.  All I can say is that I think this one is a really, really bad movie, and a sad one at that.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was awful. They used all the worst actors.  They used Michael Douglas, Marlon Brando, Paul Newman, and so on.  I had just gotten out of prison and I did the movie to get back out there.   I remember they kept showing it on cable news and people would be saying, "The actors are so phony.  Why did they hire that guy?  What were they thinking?"   One of the things about this movie was that it was so bad it would actually bring out the worst in people.  So you had people who wouldn't let you use their name or let you come near them, and then you had the crazies that would want to have sex with you.  This was just bad.  It wasn't even a bad action movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My daughter and I went to see this movie for the first time. When we got there we were greeted with the same people who ran the theater. They seemed nice enough and the seats were clean but we were underwhelmed by what we were seeing. When the movie started there was an accident that took place and it was a real shame but we went with it. The opening credits were awful. They didn't even include the names of the actors in the movie, just a line saying "T.J. Maxx Theater". The movie was pretty funny and not anything you should watch for an hour, but they really should have put out some good movie for a good cause like giving to victims or some type of charity. I have no idea what happened to the actors that day but they weren't in the scene or at the location.   The main character was a drug dealer and they didn't do very well with this part. If you are looking for a fun movie and don't mind seeing some drugs thrown around and characters getting into some trouble, this is not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most annoying character is The F.B.I.'s guy, James. He constantly talks about "getting away with it" and "not getting caught." Then, he shows up with an assault rifle, makes an "insurance claim" and shoots a guy, who is trying to stop him. If that didn't bother you as much, watch the rest of the movie.   This movie is just terrible!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie a long time ago and I still remember it, like it was yesterday. I just hope that the production company made it to the end and could have gone for another direction.   The movie starts off with a close up of a man and his dog looking at a big tree and then they start to walk away. Then we see this old woman holding her walking stick and she starts to wander off into the forest.  I guess it was a coincidence but she never returned.  The dog goes for a walk and we see a lot of things moving through the woods. Eventually he spots a dead body laying in a pond of blood and the film cuts away as he goes towards the body.  Once he gets close enough he sees that it is a woman and that she is screaming and writhing in pain. I guess she had been killed by some monster.  She starts to scream and we can hear the sound of water running around her.  Then there is this scene where the dog is looking at her with a curious look in his eye, he is a little scared. When he finally goes to her he gets a knife and puts it in his mouth.  But before the movie even ends he pulls the knife out of his mouth and she disappears and the dog runs back to the big tree to where we left the woman.  What a nice twist of fate that this girl got taken away from us so soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My daughter and I saw this movie during the Halloween season when it was originally released. It is terrible. It wasn't even fun. It's just one more boring action flick to fill your weekend.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is so wrong, so unbelievable.   It really doesn't seem like there is a whole lot of action, just random people shooting at each other.  The production is all wrong as well.  What is the point of showing the two different countries, one with white people and one with blacks?   So there are white people killing blacks in an action movie, but the two countries don't even have people of different races.  There's only black people on both sides.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.   The film was produced and directed by a black man for a black audience.  This is a story of a young black boy and his family that was involved in some type of incident. This is not the case. This film is all about how wrong the story is.  If it was just a little better the movie would have been really good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a terrible film. The acting was terrible. All of them. The story was terrible, too. It was too complicated. All the actors were good in one way or another, but they had no chemistry together. I had a lot of trouble following what the movie was supposed to be about. I understand the concept, but the story is just so boring and doesn't really make any sense. And it makes the acting worse. If you don't know what to do with a plot, this is not the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an old film by a great director. The acting is all good, the film has lots of action and has it well filmed. But the editing is terrible.  The ending and the plot are so out of place, it's just wrong.  This movie has never aged well and that's a shame.  If I had heard this was a remake of a movie by the same director (Robert Zemeckis), I would have been interested. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When you ask the producers what is the story of this movie they tell you that it is a "science fiction film that takes place in a near future where the Earth and all of the inhabitants on the planet have been enslaved by a secret government organization known as The Network".   The premise sounds intriguing but it is not.   The characters are very shallow and it feels like they have no personality, no life.  This is really a movie about a man who is trying to do his job and does it very poorly.  It doesn't have any special effects, no special weapons and you can see the actors doing the lines like they are doing them for the first time.  The story really doesn't go anywhere, it just follows the plot and there is nothing special to the way it is told.  I understand why they made the movie, but I could not sit through this for a minute.  If you are into science fiction you may find this movie entertaining but it has nothing to offer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are a number of reasons why I didn't care for this movie, and they are: (1) the story is a complete and total fraud. (2) the acting, while decent, is just not good. (3) the camera work is a total mess. (4) the musical numbers are terrible. (5) the whole thing is a rip off of an old show about a bunch of traveling actors who are thrown in prison and forced to play prison inmates. (6) the director, an unknown, who has never acted before, is not very good.   And I'm not even sure if this movie was made for a pay cable network. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It took me over 5 years to watch this movie. I saw it in the theater on TV once and I was so sick when I heard the film was coming out again that I gave it up for good. I'm so glad I finally saw this. I guess there's only so much one can take from watching a film, as it was still pretty much a classic in the 80's and it was remade and given a whole new life on a budget.   I think it is a much better movie than what was released.  The acting was not bad at all and the set was excellent.  It really was the best of the classic films.  I am happy to have seen this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In my opinion, there's only one good reason to watch this movie.  That reason is to find out how evil this film is.  The "producers" and "director" have put so much effort into this movie that I found myself thinking "it's been a long time since I saw a movie that made me think this much".  I don't know about you but when I see a movie like this, I don;t think "it looks cool".  For me, this movie is ugly.  There are no beautiful moments in this movie or it's making no effort to show any.  It's just a crappy movie.  I'll just say it; it's bad.   I gave the movie 2 out of 5 stars.  I'm glad I watched this movie and I'm glad someone thought of making it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a shame that this movie was so bad because the acting is so great! The only thing that was funny is the kid who is the bad guy, and the rest of the characters were just lame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm sure it was great to see another version of this movie. I never really liked it myself. The casting is horrible. And the story was lame. This is just another one of those bad movies. It's an over the top action movie with a weak storyline. I wish they did the remake of the movie from the 50's and did not remake it in the 80's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched the movie in theatres. The story is well done and the acting was very good. I thought the movie was very entertaining and I loved it as a horror movie.    The acting is very poor. There are many actors who seem to just jump in and out of the movie with no thought as to who they are or how the story is going. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The last of the classic slasher flicks, and I liked it a lot.  It was a fun movie that is kind of a downer for some reason.   I was not a fan of the slasher movies back then, but when I was a kid I still watched them.  This film was different.  For a while they were all fun.  The first one really shocked me, the second one was very scary, and the third and fourth one were good.  However, after those I started hating them all.  I think the only good slasher film was The Last House on the Left, and that is because it is made by Sam Peckinpah, the guy who made Psycho, and it is very good. The director of this one is a guy called Kevin Williamson, and he is the guy that made The Stepfather. He was supposed to do the third one as well, but that fell through as well.  It was funny and not too scary at times, but it wasn't too good either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie i ever saw. The acting is terrible, the script is terrible.   I hate watching movies like this   They are just stupid   These characters can not act.  The script is awful   It is just a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was boring. They went back to the old style of movies. This is what i call a bad version of a good movie, but if i knew that this was the way the movie was going to be released, i would of waited and bought the DVD.   I am glad I did not get the DVD because i would have avoided this movie from the very first time i heard about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For those who think "the best there is" isn't good enough, get ready to be disappointed.  This movie is nothing but a bunch of bad acting, terrible direction, and terrible effects. This movie has no sense of humor at all. It makes fun of the most serious problems that our modern day world faces, and it makes fun and/or is a bit funny about them. That's not good enough for me.   It is not possible for any of this to make a good movie, it is all so stupid and it has no heart, or character, or feeling at all, it's just bad.  I'm sure there are a lot of fans of this film, but I wouldn't recommend it, as it is not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking forward to this film, hoping it would be good.   The movie is not good. The acting is terrible, the action is bad, the humor is terrible.  It is just bad, so bad, that I felt sorry for the actors.  They really had no idea what to do.  Their roles are really one note and one scene, and nothing else, but they did not try to do much else.  The action scenes are really boring.  Most scenes consist of one guy flying over a city at low speed, running into other buildings, shooting, and then running away.  I am sure there was a good script, but no director saw it and it just got thrown together.  This movie should have been a horror movie.  What happened to the old horror movies of the 50's and 60's?  I wish this had been a low budget horror movie with a killer wearing a mask and doing horrible things.  That would have been better than this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think I saw this movie when I was 12, and I was the only one who came away really feeling any of it. It is a great story, and the actors are really good. This movie is a little cheesy, but it is still really good, and there's a definite emotional weight to the whole thing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you like the movie "The Rocketeer", you're gonna LOVE this one! The film is set in the 1940s, and they go from being little kids playing with a toy plane to astronauts training. The movie is really fun, and there are some great action scenes. However, it has one of those "must see, must see this, but get ready to wait to see the next one" type of movies. I found the ending to be a bit weak, and it felt like I was in a movie, but not watching it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie sucks.   I would have to say the acting in this movie is atrocious.  I can't believe they actually thought of this thing.  I can't even describe to you how bad this movie looked.  This is the worst picture i have ever seen and i have seen way worse movies.  It looks like a movie that was shot in a high school bathroom.  They are constantly looking at their phone and talking.  The worst part is you can tell they are having fun.  One of the girls (Diane Wiest) is a complete idiot.  She just thinks everyone is staring at her while she sits there talking. I was really hoping that they would turn it off after a few seconds.  Also, one of the guys keeps staring at me.  My face gets really hot when people keep staring at my ass.  There is one scene when Diane is on a couch and she keeps staring for a while.  When the guy asks her what she is watching, she just says "nothing" and leaves.  And I know this sounds funny but the guy kept looking at my chest!   It's kind of gross.  You would think that they could have put a condom on the guy's dick because his dick is hard.  Why didn't the actors use condoms.  How can people not have put on a condom to film this movie?   The acting in the film is awful.    A person will be staring at a person in a different part of the room while talking. You really need a good makeup artist to do this film.   You will think you are having sex but you are only looking at other people.   There are some shots in this film that just look real bad.   One time I looked at one of my sisters and she looked really weird.  After this movie i never want to see this crap ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have heard this movie many times and had a great time seeing it. It's funny how good a movie can be for a long time if it's made well. In fact, it's been on my wish list for a while. I'm glad I saw it and I'm so happy they finally made it.    The plot is just so... you know? They should have never gotten this movie made. The actors just don't have much to say or do, so they just go for the comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The characters in this movie are all so...dumb. I just wanted to point out that the same people who wrote and directed this movie didn't get the humor of the comic books. So this movie is more of a dumbed down version of the old Robotech episodes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After the amazing first movie I was expecting the second one to be great. And I think it was a disappointment. The action scenes are all very nice, and the action scenes have some really cool stuff in them, but for some reason they just don't work out at all. Even though the characters are well developed and well defined they are all a little bland and the plot just isn't very compelling. You won't be watching for the story, but just because it is a good action flick. The only reason I gave it a half star instead of a full star is because it has a few fun parts and a really cool ending that I enjoyed watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of those movies that makes you laugh, but it is just the wrong kind of laugh.   The movie is about a boy named Sam (Kevin Bacon) who goes to the desert in California for a summer and comes back home to his brother's house.  He tries to make friends and make new friends, but all he really seems to care about is playing video games and looking at his sister, Tracey (Beth Grant).   Unfortunately, Sam's older sister, Mary (Samantha Eggar), has a horrible temper. She starts hitting Sam and then when Sam tries to help her, she gets angry.  This leads to Sam being in a lot of trouble and he doesn't get out of it very easily.  Sam is also in trouble because of Tracey, because she and her boyfriend (Timothy Hutton) are planning to go out and get drunk.  Even though Sam is good at playing video game, he is so weak and so easily scared that he is helpless against Tracey's boyfriend.  So when the day comes where Tracey is going to go on a date with her boyfriend, Sam gets very excited and gets ready to go.  When Tracey and her date come to Sam's house, Sam knows he is about to be in trouble.  The only thing Sam can think of is to hide and then get Tracey to promise that she will never do this again.  Tracey says yes and Sam's life gets worse and worse.  I found this movie to be completely pointless and just made me laugh. It is a stupid movie with a silly plot that will just make you laugh a lot, but at the end, you just want to see how Sam gets out of this mess.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm glad I waited until now to review this movie, but this movie was just so awful I didn't want to see it again.  The director had no idea what to do with this movie and tried too hard to be "realistic" about this world.  It's just a bunch of bad ideas mixed in with bad acting, bad direction, and terrible sound mixing.     I was at first amused by the story of an insane woman who takes a baby from an old man, takes it on a journey, and eventually kills herself.  Unfortunately, this story didn't have any of the heart or characters needed to make it work.  I'd rather have seen the baby go in a different direction.    The acting was so bad it's ridiculous.  They're trying too hard in this movie.  A lot of the time, they're just doing their lines out of character.  These actors couldn't even act their way out of a paper bag.  If it weren't for the amazing direction, this movie would have been unwatchable.  Not a good idea to put an unknown person in the movie.  This movie had a lot of production values, but not enough substance.  So I'm going to give it a C, and maybe give this movie a chance to be re-released, but I wouldn't be surprised if it never gets a second watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is too convoluted and doesn't go anywhere.   It's basically a bad love story with bad acting, and I'm sorry, but that doesn't make the movie good.  The action scenes are cheesy and stupid and not in a fun way.  Even the ending isn't really convincing, since it goes back in time.  It would have been better if they used a good action movie to do this plot.  Overall, it's not worth the time it takes to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read reviews about this movie on the internet. I am from Australia and this movie was only shown there a few years ago. The movie is a complete mess. The acting is bad. The plot is not good. The characters are stupid. This movie was not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am sorry but  I'm not even gonna bother to comment on the plot or the acting. I am sure you know the movie already. There is no way in the world that they have made this movie into an artistic masterpiece. There are not any funny or original lines. And most of the movie is just watching someone try to get away from the thugs that have kidnapped him.    The plot is the main problem here. The plot was just so bad it is really hard to tell where it is going. It is all about people trying to get their money back from some guys that have a bad reputation. Then in the end a girl that they were trying to save is kidnapped. Then when they find out about this they all decide to go get her back. What ever happened to being in a movie and having a good plot.  One thing I don't understand is the people that are making these movies, they have all these movies and they just make these bad movies. It has been done for years and years. These movies were made for $15.000 a pop. And some of them even go out of business.  The people who are making this movies are trying to make some quick cash. So why not make a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was really looking forward to this movie, but unfortunately it was all about the romance.  It was supposed to be about a guy and a girl on the run after he and his girlfriend was killed.  This movie was so poorly made that I think it had to be a stunt.  I just don't believe in all those "romance" movies.  When it was over I just thought, "I wish I could forget about this movie and get back to watching something good." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had just purchased this movie on DVD. I have to say it was a terrible movie. The acting was terrible. The movie was set in the late 1800's and the characters were extremely naive. They are supposed to be criminals who do bad things but they never acted like actual criminals. They acted like idiots. The story was ridiculous. Everyone was a loser except for the bad guys. I felt like I was watching a bad soap opera. The only thing that kept me watching was the ending. It's a long movie and it has a bad ending. All the characters are in it. It didn't end until the last scene. The end was not a happy ending and had a very dark ending. You are supposed think about how the movie ended and it's just too bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has a completely different feel to it compared to the original film.  The acting is just pathetic and the pacing is just a nightmare.  This was an abomination to anyone that was a fan of the original.   In the original version, it was so dark and so violent that it made the viewer scream in terror, but here it just makes you want to watch it.  I'm not sure how the director thought this movie was good for kids when it is just an absolute nightmare to watch.  There are just so many things in this movie that are just poorly filmed, and it just doesn't work.  At the end of the film, a little girl gets raped on screen.  You just don't need to see this in front of kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is a bit too simple to be interesting. They show some scenes and then skip around and not really tell us how the events in those scenes will change the way the story unfolds.   This movie just has a terrible script, and a terrible acting crew.  It's very obvious they spent way too much time on these actors that probably just don't have any character of their own.  I have seen worse movies and I think this movie might be the worst of the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie at a movie theater and it was good, not great, not bad. The story is nice and not hard to follow.   The acting was good but not great.  In the end, the story was just too easy and it left a bad aftertaste after I watched it.   Plot is great and easy to follow, but the ending sucked.  Great to see a classic movie with an awesome cast!  Don't pass up on this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a big fan of westerns.  When I saw "Rio Bravo" I knew what I was getting into. It took me by surprise.  It's like a western from the 50s. There are some good performances from a group of greats including a good Marlon Brando. It's one of my favorite Westerns, but the acting is very over-the-top.  I thought that the movie was a good idea, but I can't believe that the producers tried to make it look like the movies from that era.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm sorry if this is the first review you've seen of mine. But it's the last of this kind I will write for a while, as I've had to be away from the cinema for a few months. I have a young daughter who is three and a half and she absolutely hates the whole thing. It's one of those bad comedies that everyone is going to see with the kids and it's going to be a huge hit. So I watched it as a father to my daughter and she went along with it without question. I'm sure it was something that she had to see as she was the only person in the family who didn't like the film. I was not the only one either, there were three of us and the other two were friends, so the film was really being shown with laughter and fun.   It's really a film that was meant to be an advertisement for the toy companies and the people who made the film, so it all goes downhill from there. It has a good ending but it's only there as a cliffhanger.  It also lacks any sense of humour and just seems like it was made for kids and not adults, which is too bad as I did love it with my own kids.  What's really horrible is that this film was supposed to have been shown in the 90's and I would have loved to have seen it as it was then.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a good movie. If you can get past the poor acting, the script is pretty good, and there are some great special effects. This movie has a great look and feel to it and is very entertaining. I've never seen any better work by Jules Dassin, but this time he was really out to get it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this film a long time ago and it wasn't bad but it was pretty mediocre. It was really hard to find a DVD copy that I liked. The DVD I had was the wrong one so the director had to change the film. I think the movie is much better now but it's really hard.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know if this movie is just bad, or if it's a bad film in general. It's certainly not worth watching.   The movie starts with a scene in a room. You can see in the background of the room a big room with a huge window. When the camera pans up to the window, the person sitting on the other side of the window doesn't look like a person. It looks like a skeleton with a hat and glasses, wearing a trench coat. It doesn't move when the camera is moving around it. The screen cuts to black.  A few minutes later, a person appears in the window looking through the window. She's wearing a white dress and a pink lipstick. She waves at the guy sitting on his bed who appears to be asleep. She tells him about something in a book.  Then she walks into the room and sits down in the seat next to the man sleeping on his couch. They begin to talk. She starts telling him about the book. She explains that someone was trapped in a building and they had to find out what was in the building before it collapsed. She shows him the skeleton. The guy doesn't react, he doesn't answer her. She asks him if he wants to stay or leave. He gets up to leave, but she stops him. She takes his hand and puts it on her breasts. Then she tells him that he has to take her to the next room. She leaves and takes the skeleton with her.  The guy is still asleep, when she goes back to his bed. She has a little toy dog in her hand. She sits down next to him and she starts kissing him. After a while, she gives him a blowjob.  It ends with the guy sleeping.  After the movie, I didn't find anything interesting in the movie. I couldn't find the guy's name anywhere. The only person I found interesting was the actress. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was really excited to see the movie, and the story is definitely interesting. This movie does take a while to get started.   The story is good, but the movie doesn't do any real well with the story. The film never really develops and it just feels like it's going on forever.  I don't mind the movie having a little bit more time to develop, it's not long enough, but I think the movie would have been better if the story was less rushed.  After all the time spent on the story and characters, the movie ends up with an interesting ending, but it takes a lot longer for it to be explained.  This movie also doesn't have the original soundtrack, which is a little strange.  A lot of people seemed to like the movie and I'm glad for that.  The music from the movie:     If you've ever seen any of the Star Wars movies, then you know about the awesome music from those movies.  There are some really cool tunes, and you just can't stop listening to them.  And the music really fits the movie.  The movie doesn t do much with the music, and it's just left out in the open.  If the movie was more than just a cool music video, then it would have used the music in a better way.  But the movie's music is really good, and I can't wait to hear more from the composer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have not seen this movie in years and it is one of those "must see" movies that is just terrible. The acting is terrible. I'm not one to get worked up over a bad film, but this one really sucked! I really liked the script and I was excited to see the director, but all I got was another poor excuse for a movie. I also thought that the camera was poorly designed and used, because all you see is shots of people running in a circle, while the camera zooms around at people running around in a different way and at a different speed.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was made by the same people who made "Saw". The cast was pretty well done. I did not like the acting. It was just lame. But the movie looks good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of the film was well told and it had a lot of twists and turns. The story wasn't terrible but I wouldn't recommend this movie to everyone.  The acting in this film wasn't very good and the story didn't make a lot sense.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a horrible film. I don't have any words to describe it other than it's a total waste of time.  This was just not worth watching.  The story is stupid and the acting is horrible. I am disappointed in myself for wasting my time watching this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I have ever seen.   This film is about an old man that keeps seeing a girl who has the wrong hair.  There is some kind of a curse on him.  The film was written and directed by a man named David Boreanaz.  In all his movies that are about young people doing bad things this is the worst thing  ever done. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a bad film, with mediocre acting and no story.   A bunch of old people are forced to play a part that was written for young people, which makes the movie a poor representation of the true nature of life in the seventies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I watched this movie for a review of the movie. The movie was boring, boring. The characters were not interesting. I did not like any of them and the whole movie was kind of silly. I have seen this movie a few times but this time I thought it was just a bunch of actors talking with the same lines. So the actors were all the same and didn't make much of an impression on the audience. I could never tell if this movie was made with a good purpose or bad and I think the whole point of making the movie was to have a cheap "frightful" movie and it was a lot of fun!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was so bad it had to be in a movie center, but for a family movie they decided to charge $9.95.   I thought that for a $9 movie they would get more.  For a movie that cost so much, it just didn't work.  The acting was terrible, especially the guy with the long hair.  I found it hard to believe it was a movie from a Hollywood studio.  It had the look of an old movie that was never released.  If you were going to watch this movie, you have to get it on the internet.  This would have been a better movie to watch with a friend, especially if your kids had never seen a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love this movie. I would never have made it because I thought I wasn't going to like it. I did.   It has it all.  A group of friends are out at a party when someone slips an acid laced note in a drink. It has no effect and a couple of days later they're back at the party at the same house.  This movie is very well done.  The acting is top notch.  There are great use of colors.  All the characters are good.  Great ending.  I recommend this to everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't understand how they thought that would be a good idea, but I was expecting more. I really didn't care for this movie, and was quite annoyed at the end. The acting, directing, and acting/ directing combination were all very poor. If you can look past that, it is not bad by any means, but it is a total waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie about being a good guy was made to be as good as it could be. If it did not make you want to have a drink and do drugs, it wouldn't be much fun. So, if you are a guy with a lot of time on your hands, buy this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've never seen a bad western ever, but this was terrible. It was a great idea in the first half of the film to have these characters ride into town on a horse and meet the Sheriff. This is a good idea because that would give the audience a good sense of what it was like to be in a western at the turn of the 20th Century, but then in the middle of the movie, the character's were all put on the horse and the Sheriff is never seen again. Even the ending was pointless, because they only bring in the horse rider to finish the film.   There were so many things wrong with this movie it's hard to know where to begin. The acting was terrible and the story was horrible. It is one of those films where everything about it was wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie because it was on an off-season TV series called "Survivors". The show was about a couple that were "surviving" on a small island and one night when all the lights went out a bunch of people came on deck in their underwear and some dude started going on and on about how he was going to have sex with everyone. I thought it was funny, but I thought the premise was stupid, so I left the theater.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was very pleased with this film. The first thing I thought of when I heard about the project was "I am going to watch this and see if anyone else has seen this before and is any better". My husband was quite excited about the possibility of seeing it.   When we went out to the theater my husband commented that the movie reminded him of the movies he had seen in college (I do not remember if we saw a lot of the old Hollywood classics). This movie is not what you would call "serious", but it is very well acted. The director is great at bringing a lighthearted, fun, and energetic feel to his movies.  The music is excellent.  It takes a while to get into the movie, but once you do, you really feel like you are going on a fantastic adventure with great characters and amazing actors.  I have to give a huge thanks to Paul Verhoeven for taking the time to make this film available to us. I know I will watch this movie over and over again! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie starts out great. We get to see a cool futuristic city and a nice set of characters. Then... It's downhill from there. The acting is all over the place, and the storyline is uninteresting. The ending left a bad taste in my mouth. I didn't understand the point of it all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For me this is a very bad movie. The story is not very good. The movie just doesn't make any sense at all. This movie is just way too long, and the plot is really not worth it at all, but the actors give it a good effort, so that is good.   This is a movie that I would never recommend, you are not really going to enjoy this movie, and just because some people like it, does not make it good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was like an old radio play or a TV show and had a very poor production quality and music that would not play on a DVD player.  The acting was bad and the story was not very interesting. I was so disgusted by this movie and could not get into it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "You know what, he's a real dick. I mean this guy is a real jerk. He's a really douche. I guess he's kind of a prick. It's not really a bad thing, he doesn't really care about anybody, he has his own agenda, and he's got it backwards. He needs to grow up, he needs to learn. It makes him really look like a jerk. Like a really real jerk."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In retrospect, this movie was horrible. The acting is bad, the acting is terrible, and there is no emotion at all in any of the characters. There are no redeeming qualities about the cast or the director.   "I'll kill you and burn your house down" is the best way I can put it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really liked this movie and I felt like its one of those that could have been made much better with an editing job. The movie felt rushed and felt really choppy with the scenes cut.     It felt like it had been shot in one take which leads me to believe the director shot it like a bunch of scenes of different things being taken place all at once.  The scene where the kids are climbing out of the closet feels rushed and there is so much camera movement that it feels disjointed and not really cohesive.  It felt as though there was nothing that really added to the story or really was needed in the movie to make it a better one.  This movie was very predictable and not that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movies I have seen in a very long time. It had the most bizarre plot and acting, and it didn't have much to do with the "Alien" movie. The movie itself was filled with weird plot holes, and some of the acting was atrocious.   I would never watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I gave this one four stars, because I wanted more.   A very good movie.  I hope the "Dune" movie doesn't get made, for the story would be great!  I really liked the music, and the acting was really good.  The plot was good too.  If you want to see some great movies for your entertainment, go to "DUNE" and "BELGIAN HORROR" with "ALIEN."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen a lot of terrible horror films but this one just gets to be too stupid.   It's a horror movie from 1981 with the name "Voodoo" written all over it.  It stars Steve Martin and it is the best "I Spy" movie.  He is playing a guy who does an investigation on a murder that he finds out was committed with voodoo.  The only problem is that it's the most stupid "I spy" movie you can find and that's saying something.  Even for that time it was made.  This movie doesn't give you anything that you haven't seen before.  I remember watching "Voodoos" in high school and it was actually really good.  If you've seen the remake of this then you know what to expect.  But this is still bad and that isn't a good thing.  There's a few good things about it though.  First off it has a great score which is good and creepy.  A scene where a guy is driving and the radio starts talking and I don't remember what's saying but it just sounds like he's being followed by someone else.  Another thing about this movie is the acting.  And this is probably the best acting ever in a horror film.  Some people don't think it's good but this movie has great actors and it gives you all the right ingredients to make a great movie.    I don's remember one scene in the movie where it was different and it made me want to see it again.  " I'll be back!"  It is a great story with an awesome cast.  What's worse than the acting though is the bad direction.  You can't tell who is who which is the opposite of what you want when you are watching a horror.  So that's all you can ask for from a horror but they get it wrong.   What's really sad is that there aren't any killer scenes in this movie. If you don't want to watch the worst horror film ever you should just go see "I've Got a Secret".    A fun movie to watch when you're bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie which is not worth watching. The actors are all trying too hard to make a big name for themselves, but don't get me wrong, I appreciate this film.   It is a good film, with great acting, but I just can't get into it, I don't want to see a movie where an actor has to have a great body but then is constantly doing an action scene where he walks into the walls, so he can't do it any more, but then he is also running across the stage with an axe and screaming for it to come back to him, because he thinks he hit the right spot with the axe, and then he runs across the ground with the same axe and keeps yelling and screaming because it is in the wrong place, but the film just keeps going, and going, but not in the right direction, and you just want to turn it off and go back to your bed, I guess that is the whole point of this movie... but I can't...I just can not.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is just plain terrible and I hated it. The cinematography is awful. There was never a sense of tension, danger, or danger at all. We never have any real sense that anything could happen and no one dies at the end of the movie except the kid.   My only real complaint is the dialogue. It is just very stupid and cheesy. The lines were made up and delivered poorly, and I hate that they made it the way they did. I wish I could make fun of the dialogue instead of hating it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "This is a pretty terrible movie. I didn't feel the love I expect for the story. The acting is very bad. I had trouble following it."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As far as a bad film is concerned, there were some parts of this movie that were pretty bad, but then again, how could it not be?   First, we have to talk about the title of the film, which is "Journey to the Center of the Earth".  To be honest, I have never heard of an alien civilization called the Center.   Now, as far as the aliens, I can't say that I like any of them.  I did think they were sort of scary, but I can think of worse.  But then we get to the bad part, which was when they came out of the alien spacecraft to destroy the human race, I could only imagine it would be bad...   The story is a little thin.  It is a long movie, but it is mostly just talking, and not really action packed, so I will not say much.  The aliens really just do a few things here and there and that was it.  This movie was pretty cheap, it was cheap.  There were a couple of great effects but I found it a little cheap, but what is there is there.  If you don't care about the aliens or the action, this might be the film for you, I wasn't really looking forward to watching it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you like "The Rocketeer" you will like this too.  It has some fun action scenes.  The story has little to do with the film, and is a big waste of time.   The characters, while enjoyable, are not very likable.  There is not a lot of character development.  I had to look up the plot to get the entire story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the kind of movie you would see on Saturday mornings on some station that did not run anything better.   It's just a little too slow to be fun.  You never see a good movie in this genre, ever.  It is not even close to being bad.  This movie would probably be better with only one person in it, and then I think they could have shown some of the others in the series that didn't get to be sequels. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went to the movie because I had seen it on television and I was really looking forward to it. The movie starts off pretty much the same way as the TV version, with the same actors, and then things get a little out of control. First of all, there is a scene that takes place in a mall when a boy walks around and gets grabbed by a giant and has his foot crushed. I was very disappointed that a movie could take this kind of thing and make it work and still be entertaining. Then the scene is moved into a room that has a large cage that a woman in the movie is in. Then she gets back into the cage and the giant man tries to drag her out of the cage into the street. Again, I felt this was a poor decision on the part of the movie makers. Then we have a scene where the little boy is getting ready to go to school. The woman in his class comes into the room and sees him and takes off her clothing. Now this is very disturbing and should have been edited out of this part of it. Then when the boy goes into the classroom he is assaulted by a teacher and then raped by a student. This could have been a lot of fun, but it was done poorly. In addition to these scenes, the movie ends with a huge explosion that destroys the entire campus.   This movie was not worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When you see a movie, and you see it with an audience, it has that great feeling, but after you're done with it you find yourself wishing that you'd gone to see it first with your friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I could find a more perfect place to kill myself than with a gun, I would probably do so.   In my first film experience, I thought my first movie was a bit of a flop.  I felt like an idiot during my first experience with film, because I really didn't understand what it all meant, and I was very uncomfortable with it.  It was a weird time for me.  This film makes me wonder what kind of movie I'll be making from now on, and if I should even consider making movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the movie is just bad for the reason you stated, it is really bad. I have watched it a few times and every time i go into the theater its just a waste of time and time again. i dont like it at all and its really unoriginal. i have not seen this movie since the 70's. i will give it a 1 star but it would have been better if it was more entertaining and it was a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been wanting to see the original Star Wars films ever since I was a kid. I love it, the original trilogy is my favorite film of all time, and I have seen all but the original three. This one was alright. Not awful, but not great either.  I remember seeing it for the first time in the 70s when I was 7 or so, I loved it but my brother had never seen it and I didn't understand why. He loved it, but my interest in it died there. I saw it the first chance I got. I was always a Star Wars fan but I hated the new movies, never had any interest in seeing them either. It didn't really interest me and I knew it wasn't going to, but in the hopes of finally seeing one I did.  This is a movie I wanted to see, I wanted it so bad, but it didn't live up to the original. It just didn't do it for me, it just didn' t work for me.  The special effects were great, but they were all recycled from the previous two movies, and that is not going to make up for the fact that it is an original story and you don't get to see Han and Leia fight their way through a huge battle with the Empire.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought that "Lebensraum" was a really good movie, and I really loved the characters.   The movie does have a bit of a "cute" vibe.  But what really gets under my skin is the fact that this movie is a rip-off of "The Hunger Games", and I think it should be changed to "The Death Games".    Why would you make a movie that is based on a movie, that isn't even good.  I am sure it is great in Germany, but the U.S. version is not very good at all, and there are no actors that I want to see on screen again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen this film twice now. This is the first time that I really enjoy it. I can still remember the opening scene. I loved the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie sucks    I saw this at a drive-in and was not prepared for it   It was a horrible movie   The acting and direction are awful   You think you are watching a western, but it isnt a western. You are watching another movie and if it was not for the terrible acting and the cheap special effects it would have been a great movie.   But the acting is awful.  I mean the guys that play these bad guys don't even try at all. They look like they stepped out of a bad 80s/90s movie and not the great movies.  They should have gone out and filmed something else to work off of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen this movie twice now (in a theater and on DVD) and can't remember much. I only know that there's a big, fat, red, purple alien in it (no idea what he's doing in the movie), and that he's being chased by a giant red UFO.   For some reason, I thought that a giant, red space monster was more interesting than an evil giant, purple space monster that kills everything.  They could have added more tension to the movie and had a giant spaceship chase, but that didn't seem to be their intent (why? Because it was an action movie?).  I think the movie should be called "Alien Invasion of the United States", as it has a lot more similarities to the real invasion of the U.S. by a space beast than it does to the Alien film.   I saw this movie the first time in a movie theater at an age when my head was not fully formed. My friend who bought me the ticket was like "What a dumbass!"   A good movie is good no matter what the audience thinks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is really bad in some areas and at other times very entertaining.   I like how it is done in some parts because of the acting and in other areas because of what the actors are trying to do.  The plot is not that complex and is really simple but the film makes you care a lot about how the story is unfolding.  There is no real chemistry between the actors in this movie and it was kind of funny to see the way all the characters act when they are not on screen.  I did like the ending though and the way it ended.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the past year, The Great Gatsby has become my favourite movie. I've watched it over and over and the great acting, cinematography and music keeps me coming back to it. The film was filmed in gorgeous locations and has a timeless feel.   There are a few scenes that are poorly written, but it makes up for it by having the best of the great actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie a year and a half ago, on a movie night. I had not seen the "movie" before, but my friend had seen it and said it was great! We both loved it. We left that night feeling excited and we went and watched the sequel that was made a few years later. I guess I was expecting to like this movie, but I just didn't.   It is a bad film, the acting is awful, the story is boring and there is just no logic to what happens. I won't be watching it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would have never heard of this guy if it wasn't for this movie. There's really not too much about this movie that I would ever want to watch again, even if I wasn't watching it to see a great acting performance.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a bad film and should be ignored by everybody.   As a person who has seen a lot of films, I think this film is more of a parody of Hollywood's own movies that will be released soon, such as "Terminator", "Titanic", "Independence Day" and "Ghostbusters"   The acting is very poor and the script is lame.  Why I gave it a 4 out of 10:  - A great idea, if a parody, is never as good as the film it parodies.  - No matter how bad the director tries to make his film, he is never able to create a movie that is worth seeing, just like Hollywood has done in the past.  If you don't mind the mediocre acting, this might be for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really didn't want to see this movie and when I watched it I didn't even enjoy it. It was boring. The plot was too slow and very predictable. The characters were a lot of the characters from other horror movies and they were not the same characters. The acting was terrible.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie and it just didn't do it for me, it was hard to watch, especially when the people in the film kept changing the story line, it just did not add up,   the actors and actresses did a great job, but it just was not for me.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just watched this on VOD and I was very disappointed. This movie had no charm. The actors who played them were horrible, their performances were all off. The camera was very choppy and you couldn't tell what was going on. The ending was also poor. I really wanted to believe that things were going to get better when the girl came back but alas, all I got was a horrible movie that I can't stand.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just heard about this movie and after watching it I was a bit depressed at first because it was a little too late in the life of the film for me to enjoy it as much as it had in the past. However, it got better as it went along, and by the end, it was like having a good, old-fashioned slapstick movie with a couple of really good lines. I thought the film was so funny and had some pretty great jokes (that you might actually see in the theater), and I especially liked the scene where the actor with the mustache (Paul Newman) did his own voice-over for the "I'm not a good guy, I'm a bad guy" bit. However.... The acting was pretty bad in this film. I understand that some of it was done in order to make the characters more believable, but a lot of it came off as being really amateurish. Paul Newman is great as the bad guy, but there were also a number of times when it seemed as though he was just supposed to be the actor playing the "bad guy," and not actually having a real, live personality. As for the rest of the cast, there were a lot good ones, but none of them seemed particularly comfortable with the character. So, I don't really recommend this movie, but if you want a cheap, good-natured slapstick comedy with a good line or two, then this one will be right up your alley.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A great idea, but a bad execution.   The plot was good, but there were too many characters and the writing just didn't work.  The acting was just terrible, and a couple of times it just made me roll my eyes.  Overall, not a bad film, but not a great one either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is awful, the story is pathetic and it is all about a young man who falls for a rich woman who is a serial killer.   And this is what we Americans call a "comedy"?   He is a loser, yet the woman he falls for, who he sees as his future, keeps him on her terms, and even buys him expensive toys that he never uses.  It is so stupid.  There are so many other movies like this I have seen but I can't remember them. I can assure you it is not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is bad, very bad.   It was not very well made.  But, when you look at the movie in it's originality, it's worth seeing.  There are some very good scenes that have very good actors and great dialog.  The ending was really well done.  It has many great characters.  I guess the story can not be told in a movie but in the novels.  To sum it up, if you like a story with great characters, then the movie is not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love this movie and that's a good thing. But it is a lousy movie and a big disappointment. The acting is fine. That's about it. The story is good enough. The special effects are good. I am going to watch another bad movie, maybe one that's even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really love the movie but this movie is a complete let down.  There is no story line this movie just has lots of action but you don't get any story line.  The story about the girls that work at a restaurant is a great idea but the ending is so ridiculous.  This movie has a lot of great action but nothing really worth mentioning.   The acting in this movie was terrible and most of the time they act like you have to be there.  I just wish this movie would have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was awful. I was bored and decided to watch it for my wife's birthday because it looked so good. It was the same thing over and over again.   It is kind of sad that we have to see this kind of garbage for movies like this to be made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to admit that this is a terrible movie. It's not that it's a bad film, but it's way too long and over-dramatic.   What you have here is an aging movie star trying to be "cool" by dressing up as a female version of Marilyn Monroe for some stupid, dumb party.  While I suppose that it is an effective way to attract attention to oneself in a time before the "porno chic" of the '50s, it really isn't even funny.  The plot is also terribly contrived.  What, you're going to dress up as Marilyn Monroe and have a big party?  This movie was supposed to be a hit, but nobody wanted to see it.  I'm not really sure why people in the '70s were obsessed with the "sixties". It was the first decade of the "baby boom" and yet, the "golden era" is what we remember.  Maybe they forgot the war, the depression, Watergate, and the Vietnam War.  It was pretty depressing, really.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a cheap looking, badly made movie. I love it for the time that it was made, and the movie still holds up.   The only reason I gave this a 1 is because the plot is pretty bad and the cast is pretty thin. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is a simple one: a man and his young son go to a remote part of India to visit their relatives. There they learn that the man's wife has been murdered, his son abandoned by him, and their house destroyed. The man decides that to rid himself of his guilt, he must return to his family's home and destroy the evidence of the crime.   But then he gets a letter from the son, who has somehow survived the destruction. As they argue over what to do, an earthquake occurs and destroys their home, and the son is lost in the ruins.  He searches for his father but cannot find him. Then he finds a strange girl who tells him about a mystic man named Krishna, and that he must travel to a faraway place in search of a great white snake.  There he has an encounter with a sorcerer who has been using a magic box to control the world, and which has now destroyed the world itself.  The movie, however, is not worth watching. There is no sense of what happened to the man or to the boy, and there is no explanation of how the boy came to be lost in that mysterious place. Even the ending was very confusing.  I was not impressed by the acting by any of the actors, and it was obvious they had spent a great deal of time preparing for it. And they were not very good at doing what they were supposed to do. For instance, the film was supposed to end with an explosion in a temple, but the explosion was in the middle of a desert. It was very frustrating to sit through. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've always found the remake of King Kong to be a good movie with some decent acting, but the overall tone of the film has nothing of the original's excitement or excitement. I really hate the ending and how it doesn't even try to get to the rest of the story.   If you like Kong, then it is a good remake and should be seen, but it really doesn't have the excitement that the original did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would never go to a concert or a movie with these people. They ruined this movie for me.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've watched a lot of low budget "action" films but never seen one that looked like the others. The one in this movie was one of the worst I've ever seen, and I'm not even a fan of kung fu. The story, acting and acting quality were all average, but the fighting style was very, very poor. This movie was very unentertaining, and the only thing that kept it from being a complete failure was that there were plenty of good fighters in the film. - December 30, 2012Makai no Kiba
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like the title says, this film has a good amount of humor but doesn't have any direction to it. The acting was just plain bad.   There are some really bad lines in this film. For example "The door was opened and they were gone. And the man went home."   My favorite parts of this film were the music videos with the "hot babes".   I'm giving this film a C- because I just don't see what the joke is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen. It has zero plot, no real characters, and no one even really dies. All of the people we see on screen are just walking corpses, and they don't even have names like in an old western movie! I've seen worse movies, but this was by far the most boring, boring, and boring movie I have ever seen in my life! I hated every minute of it! If this movie wasn't so bad, I could get all worked up and go see it again just to see what happened to these people.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My mother and I went to see a bad Michael Jackson movie, and in the movie she sat in the front row with my dad.  She was complaining about everything and I had to explain to her that he wasn't a good person, and he wasn;t good for her.  This is a bad piece of crap and you need to see it in theatres.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a cheapo horror movie that could not be any worse. The acting was all bad, and the plot was lame.   There were people on the street and they are running up to these people running towards them and saying "Help! They are trying to kill us!" So one of the people just runs back and forth yelling and it doesn't make any sense at all.  It looks like there was an accident with some garbage truck, and some guys get in the truck and try to kill the people, but they don't succeed and it looks like it is the work of a psychopath.  The best part is the people in the background screaming. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have no problems with any of the movies I have seen, but The Terminator does not live up to its title.   This movie was a terrible movie that should not have been made at all, and was made without the talent of the filmmakers, and I have had an amazing time watching it.  The main problem is that the movie never really begins or ends.  They just show what happens.  This means you never learn anything and just sit back and wait for it to end.  When it does end, you are then told the story from the beginning again, but this time it is with a narration, and the story is not nearly as interesting as it was before.  At first, I thought that this was a parody of the Terminator films, but it soon became obvious that this movie is nothing like the ones before it.    A very weak parody of a very good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am not a fan of horror movies.   This movie is just not very good and not very scary at all.  The actors in the movie were terrible and the actors in this movie are terrible.  I did not even finish watching this movie.  It was just lame.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a joke. And I hate to say it, but it's really obvious in this movie. It's very obvious. And a little bit annoying. The actors have so much time for one another, and they talk for so long. It feels like they've been rehearsing all this time and only they decided to put this on the screen. If the actors hadn't done that, it could have been good. I wish it was in the 80s and the actors were actors, but they are really just actors. I'm not very fond of the plot. I don't even understand it at all, and I was really hoping to laugh at this. I really hate it. I hate this movie from start to finish. It has all the elements of a bad comedy: long dialogue, little funny bits, etc. The story is all crap, and it makes no sense. I mean, you have the three "doves" (actually, two of them are in the film) talking about how they have a crush on each other, but all of them forget about it right away. And you have this whole story about how it was never meant to happen, but if it had, they would have all made love to each other before the wedding. It was just a mistake and there was no big lovey-dovey ending. And there are some really good characters in this. However, it's still a bad film, and a bad joke.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is all about a guy that tries to get with his neighbor girl and then gets involved in some shady business. He goes from having to go to court to getting into a huge car wreck and losing his girlfriend.   In all reality, I think it was made to promote some kind of product, but I am not too sure what. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's just a movie I would have liked to see. I never heard of the guy or the movie. I've seen the guy a few times and I don't remember the movie's plot. It's like seeing a film that's shot like a western, with a couple of cowboys and Indians riding through the desert. The movie seems like a very slow motion, kind of a romantic western. The characters are just sort of walking around. A cowboy and a couple Indians, they're looking at each other in the distance while they talk, and when the Cowboy says "That's the spot" it's like he's walking toward it. I'm not sure if the movie was directed by the Cowboy or not. I don' t know why they shot it in the desert; maybe it was some kind of desert trip film. The only interesting thing in the movie is that one of the guys had a real big gun, and I guess it was a gift for the Cowboy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie is too bad for its stars.  The movie was poorly made, poorly acted, badly directed, and just plain stupid.  This movie is not a good idea, and has no talent behind it, even for a slasher film.  Even the writing is poor.  A man is murdered in his house, and his son witnesses it. He goes after the killer, but after shooting the killer three times in the chest he runs back inside. The killer then enters the house and rips his throat out with an ax, then kills the little boy.  I have never seen a killer that bad, I thought it was a joke to have a kid and a killer all in one film, but I guess it wasn't that bad for the studio.   This film should be forgotten forever, and people should not make slasher flicks, just because it has a "monster" in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a rip off of  (or perhaps a knock off of)  Star Wars.   I was disappointed with this movie.  I watched this movie with my daughter and she didn't like it.  It was kind of funny at times but it was still pretty cheesy.  This movie is pretty good and you get a good laugh out of it but I would rather see a different movie that is more entertaining or entertaining than this movie that I will admit is pretty cheesy but it has a funny ending that you will laugh at.  If you like cheesy movies then you will enjoy this movie but it just doesn't have anything in it to make it worth watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very disappointed with this movie. A few of the scenes were good (I have watched many of the films of John Wayne) but the story and acting is very bad.  The actors do not have any charisma or make any sense to be believable.  I think the movie was made in Hollywood and it is a movie that we have all seen and can never forget.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When you are trying to watch something with a decent amount of plot, don't do it by accident. You will come out with something less than good.   The plot consists of two people (one a man and one a woman) who are trying on for size the body of the other in a hospital. It seems that the person who is the subject of this play has lost a bet or has not been paying enough attention. It's a good premise and it was interesting in the beginning. However, the second half of the movie seemed a little rushed, and the acting was very poor. You'll come out of this movie wanting to turn the lights out and watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I heard this movie and liked it. When I got home and saw the poster, I was like "what the fuck is this!" I was not impressed with this movie. The acting and the storyline were good, the story was interesting and I have seen so much bad movies over the years that I never thought this movie would pass me by. The movie had a very silly ending, like a sitcom, so I didn't have a good laugh out of it. I have not seen this movie in a long time and I will not get another chance, as it was very boring and I am a terrible person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The reason I love this movie so much is that it is a "must see" for any movie buff out there.   A lot of movies fail because the directors just don't know how to do anything with the material they have. This movie is very different.  The story is about a family that becomes a zombie.  There is a great cast of characters.  In addition to the acting the movie has a great soundtrack.  This movie has not been made out yet so there is a whole bunch more to come. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoyed this movie. It is a very entertaining film with good acting. I wish I was more in it and maybe there was a few more plot twists and twists and turns in the story but overall a great fun flick. I didn't mind that the guy who played the guy with the machine gun was a real douche. I think his accent was the only reason he was funny. I guess I'm not a fan of the idea of guns in movies so that was probably the worst thing about the whole movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is just not very good.   I mean, it seems like a fun, cool, fast paced film, but then it just goes downhill from there.  The character development is pretty bad.  A good friend of mine said the film made him think about the times when he was in high school and wanted to do something crazy like get in a car accident and drive the entire way to Mexico.  In that case, I think it would have been a good idea to have the accident be a bad one.  It's a good film if you're in the mood for action, but not if you want to learn about the way we were raised and the sacrifices we made.  I didn't find any humor in the film.  This film would have suited a high school or junior high student.  If I had to watch it again, I would cut out the ending, because that was the only way I felt I could enjoy the film at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors were great and the movie was fun to watch. But the actors were terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a total let down for me. I had high hopes for this movie, but it just didn't live up to expectations. A lot of the movie was just boring and over done. I never really knew what to think of it at all. The acting was so bad I actually thought I was watching a soap opera and not a movie. Not sure what else you can say about the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is pretty bad, it had lots of problems, one being the fact that it had to start with a scene where the mother and daughter were kissing and then the daughter gets out of her car and gets back to her home.  It made me so angry.   This movie had no humor and it was not funny at all.  I did not like the way it ended either.  When the mother leaves the daughter's home for a long time she just stays there, she leaves her car outside and she just sits there for a very long time.  The story of this movie is quite unbelievable and the ending was so ridiculous.  They had to change all of the characters, the father, the daughter, and the friend.  After the scene of the daughter running off to meet her mother was over, they had to have the mother sit and watch the daughter walk away.  This is a shame because that is what the mother should be doing.  What is really crazy is how much they made the girl look different and different in the ending.  To be fair, the character had the same face, but in a different color, and in a very different way.  For a movie like this, it did a very good job of showing the effects of drugs.  In this movie, it shows how they could make the girl think she was a drug dealer and how the mother would get angry at the daughter for it.  One thing that did annoy me was how they got the wrong daughter, they got someone else's daughter instead of the right daughter.  Finally, I did have a problem with the ending, I thought it was too happy, I hope it is not too bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie that you can only see in the theatre with the sound turned off, with no music. The only saving grace of the movie is that there is some good dialogue to make it a good movie, but if you don't like the dialogue, don't watch it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like to think of myself as an adult who has seen way too many bad movies, and this is definitely one of the most painful ones I've ever seen.   It starts off looking nice, with the good character actor, and pretty setting.  However, halfway through, you start to get a sense that this movie was made to promote the film's theme - "don't ever let someone you love get hurt!" and the way they show the couple getting into a car wreck is absolutely nauseating.  The movie then goes on to have a number of scenes where the characters are being shot at and almost shot to death.  After these scenes are over, they go on to be shot by their own guns, and have to live out the rest of the movie in this prison environment, where the main character has to try and survive until he can get out and get help, while trying not to get shot himself.  This movie is one of those "you get out when you die" movies.  It's bad for any type of emotional response, and very very very bad for anybody with a heart.  I think that this is one movie that really got into the hearts and minds of the actors who played the characters, but as the rest were actors who were either too old, too stupid, or way too dumb to be convincing (especially the main lead) it just felt like a horrible waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm a huge John Carpenter fan, and was looking forward to seeing this movie. Unfortunately, this movie is a complete waste of time.   This film is pretty terrible and I just can't believe it was made. I mean, look at the cast:  Chris Carter   John Carpenter   Tim Blake Nelson   James Rennie   Bill Moseley   Michael Rooker   Richard O'Brien   David Duchovny   Angela Bettis   Peter Boyle   Franka Potente   Brian Dennehy   Patrick Wilson   Denny Loucks   Kurt Russell   Barbara Crampton   Steve Miner   Scott Speedman   Kevin Bacon   Christopher Lloyd   Tom Skerritt   Alan Ruck   Ray Wise   Robert Englund   Bruce Harwood   Linda Blair   Steven Yeun   Paul Sorvino   And, of course, John Carpenter himself.  This movie, if you're even going to call it that, was a total disaster and is not worth watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was going to go see this movie as a movie that is set in the 30's and I read the synopsis, then went ahead and bought it because I like movies from the 30s that have a period feel.  It didn't quite live up to my expectations.   It had a very dated feel to it.  My brother and I watched this movie together and he thought that there were a lot of scenes that didn't make any sense to him and I thought that he was just really enjoying himself and thought that it was just a really funny movie.  The acting was pretty bad and I felt that the plot was too obvious and just wasn't funny.  I thought this movie was a bad idea and I would only watch it to see a film that was set in an era that I really enjoy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is boring, a simple story with few twists.   It has no redeeming qualities, and doesn't bother trying.  The plot is predictable, there are not many twists, and the movie tries too hard to make it look like a mystery.  It's the worst movie I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was really looking forward to this movie.   It looks great.  But in the end, it was just a crappy flick.  My parents, who were watching it at my house, kept asking me what the movie was about.  The movie just felt like it had too many problems to be a good movie. The characters didn't have any real depth.  It was all done to be the most ridiculous movie ever.  I really liked the acting, the music, and the director, but this movie was just not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is really awful, the acting is bad, the cinematography is bad.   This film is an insult to film lovers everywhere and a shame that the film was released in the 80's and never received the recognition it deserved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was awful!   The acting was horrible, the plot wasn't that good, and the CGI was so bad that it made the movie look even worse.   I hate to tell you this, but that doesn't mean it's a bad film.  This is probably the most terrible film of all time!  It was made by a company that is nothing more than a cheap studio to make cheap films.  It doesn't even look as good as it sounds.  I saw it the same day it came out and it didn't look much better.  The acting was terrible, and there were no characters.  Most of the actors who were in this were really bad.  No one really seemed to know what they were doing.    I hate this movie and would not recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is awful and is over in a minute, and it makes you question whether a great actor could make a bad film. The acting is bad and they need to hire better actors, because I saw this on a big screen at a big time and it doesn't look very good. The movie would make a good Saturday Night Live skit, and I wonder why this didn't get more publicity. The special effects are horrible, and if it wasn't for the voice acting (which is terrible), the movie would have been laughed off the screen. The title song is really bad, and the director didn't do anything different than the writers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was an awesome movie but there are some bad aspects. It has the feeling that the director wasn't in control of the production and he got stuck trying to make a hit. The cinematography was not good at all and it has a poor acting quality.  The acting was very bad, no one had any charisma. Even the girl with the pig was terrible. She had some charisma but when she has to act like the girl from "The Ring", she was totally lost and did not look good at the same time.   It had lots of great special effects and lots of wonderful things to watch. But to make it a movie of this nature is an extreme. And it is very long too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie.   I don't know who made this, I don�t know why, and I don �t care.  There is nothing creative in this film.  This is just a bunch of people going through the motions.  A terrible actor with terrible dialog.  I understand if they needed to do some light comedy but for every one joke there is one punchline.  Don�t waste your time, it will only bore you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an extremely poor movie. The acting is so bad it's embarrassing.  The movie is written like a series of jokes that will never get old. The script is so horrible I cannot even comprehend what the movie is trying to tell us.  This movie was a total disaster from beginning to end. The ending was the most annoying part of the movie as we see the bad ending played for laughs.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I ever saw.   No one is ever on screen, and they're all pretty much dead or dying off screen.  It makes me want to punch the screen! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not a good movie! It's all about sex, and the sex is boring and terrible. The female lead is absolutely no better than the males in the movie, in fact she's so over the top it's ridiculous. They all do the same, act like a bunch of drunk idiots, do the "stupid" things and talk in a dumb manner. There are some very stupid, almost offensive jokes and some very inappropriate stuff done in this movie. There's also very little acting.   I really feel like it would've been better had it been a parody of this movie, like this is a movie the actors watched and wrote it to make fun of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at a theater that showed a lot of foreign movies. This movie had some very bad acting and not so good writing, and some bad direction. The movie got boring. And it was shot very cheaply. I would not watch it again. This is another cheap movie I saw. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a piece of crap, nothing more. It is absolutely ridiculous, no story, no characters, no plot. I am not saying there are not any laughs in this movie, there are, but it is not worth watching.   What a waste of time, it is so over the top and overrated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie a bit bland and boring, and the acting was pretty bad. The story was good though, and I have to admit it was pretty exciting to hear what happened to the people in their family in the days before they got the news about what had happened to them.   This movie really needs to be seen to be believed, it is one of those films where the plot just doesn't make any sense at all, and everyone is just doing their job so that there will be a happy ending for everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was not even worth watching, except to prove to some people that this film was a flop in the making and could not have been made better. The acting was bad, the storyline was lame, and the plot had no basis. This movie is a waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was just too bad, too bad to be called "good". The characters were all just flat and there's no point to the film at all. All of the characters had the same voice and their only purpose was to look at the camera and look "crazy".  The plot of the film is totally retarded as well.   What a shame...   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible movie.   The production values are terrible, but at least they didn't look like a cheap video clip.  They tried to ape the classic sci-fi film and instead they made it look like it was in 3D.  In the end, this movie is a huge rip off of The Thing.  I thought it would be better if the film was taken from the TV series instead of the classic film, but they couldn't do it.  What little they did do was bad.  The acting is poor.  Even though they try to be scary in the movie, they still can't pull it off.  It's all done with cheap effects.  A lot of time has gone into making it look bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad I didn't want to watch it but I did so I could laugh. The film is a bit too stupid to be considered good but the actors are really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked the story and the concept. The characters were very interesting, but they did not develop as a result of the plot. The movie had the potential to be a classic if it did not have all the problems mentioned. It was overrated and overproduced. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved this movie and wish I had been alive when it was made.  It's a good movie, but it had some very bad flaws.  The whole time I watched it the producer was looking at the film with a big dumb smile on his face and he'd say "It's going to be a great movie, and I can't wait for you to see it" as if I was just some kid to be manipulated.  A lot of bad acting was done here as well.   The only way this movie could have been better is if there was a cameo by a character from an earlier movie who was the original producer of the new film.  I know this was a long time ago, but in my opinion this movie would have made a great independent movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a piece of crap. If you are looking for a movie that will make you laugh or scream at the screen then this is for you. If it gets too much out of hand and is not for you then do not bother with this.   I hate to be critical but for the first time I saw this I was sick and didn't feel like laughing.  It was so bad I would like to watch it again and again to really feel bad for whoever made it.  They should have never done this movie.  If you watch the movie and don't laugh don't blame the actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved this movie so much I would watch it over and over and keep seeing the sequels.   The film is not as good as the first but it still has a lot of charm and the acting is really good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was ok, but I couldn't really enjoy it.   I was expecting a more action-oriented movie, like the previous one.  This is more like a classic western with a Western feel.  It wasn't the best western movie, but it wasn't bad.  I mean the first 20 minutes of this movie just isn't great. It's just boring.  But after that it gets better.  The first half of the movie has a nice Western feel to it. It has that classic western feeling, and there was a real feeling of the characters trying to survive.  That is where the movie lost me.  While there are some good action sequences, and while the characters are good, it's just too cliche.  There is no reason to go through this entire movie.  A couple of good ideas, but not really any of it works.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a pretty entertaining flick and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The one thing I noticed that was a little off about it was the lack of action. This is what it sounds like when you go to see a film and the movie doesn't seem like it's trying too hard to show off. This was pretty bland and didn't give me anything that was memorable.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film does not have the humor of the classic "Whoopee Cushion". Instead, it is a film that has no real humor, nor does it have any real message. You can only find one message here: Don't mess with God. The director, Mr. Deakins, is so convinced of his own brilliance, that he does not need to produce any type of good feeling in this movie, no matter how much he tries. Instead, his message is "Do not mess with your god." What a pathetic message to be delivered by one of the greatest of all times. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main character is a bit of an idiot, and the only thing he gets right is when he's talking about the effects of the poison on his body.  It's pretty much a one-sided disaster from the moment the main character falls into a vat of acid and his body falls apart.   It seems like a cheap attempt to make a cheap movie out of an old story, but it's hard to fault it for that.  There's a lot of action scenes that should be cut out to keep things clean, and while it's probably better to cut the entire movie up, there are some scenes that are pretty bad.  The special effects are pretty good, but there are times when they look cheap and it makes me wonder if this was a special effects movie or a stunt movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first time I saw it. I remember seeing the trailer on tv and thought to myself, "This must be a terrible movie"  And I was right. It is a horrible movie. There's no depth or characters. It's a story about a woman trying to live as a nun and a woman who is going to have sex with the priest and then kill the priest. And I'm not a big fan of rape scenes.  It was so bad it made me vomit. The director should be held responsible for this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really surprised by this movie. I was expecting something more like "Aliens", but that film has some amazing acting and design, and this has some awful acting. It feels like a bad parody of a bad film.    The only good part is the design for the robots. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You should watch the first 5 minutes and then never go back.   And then you will see what a piece of shit this movie is.  I have never seen a movie this awful, with this much acting and acting this cheesy.  This movie is about a woman who has a new husband who is very attractive and loves her. He is very wealthy and she seems to have it all.  She wants more but her husband is too busy and doesn't care for her, they are not together anymore and he won't talk to her and he wants to spend more time with his mistress.  So she goes to see a doctor and she meets the doctor who is kind of a psycho.  He has been to many different places and his wife is the last place he was.  And so she tries to get a second opinion from the doctor and that doctor comes back and says "oh no your pregnant" and she is taken to the hospital and the doctor is there and he makes her do all kinds of disgusting things to make her miscarry.  I would never watch this movie ever again, and the only reason why I found myself watching it was because the director tried to sell this movie on TV so that I would watch it.  How the hell is this movie worth watching?   The acting is so bad and I don't care about the characters that are playing them.  The ending was just so bad, and they left me with a bad taste in my mouth.  Why was this movie made? I don\'t even want to watch it any more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a great, but a lousy, movie, because the actors are so bad. The movie is pretty much about two men with some drug problems and how the police catch them and what happened after they were caught. The first scene was kind of awesome, because it showed that the cops got the right men, and then the movie starts to go bad.   In the beginning, the story seems to be real and the characters seem to have real problems. And then the bad acting starts and the movie just sucks.  The movie seemed to be made in 1984, and I'm guessing there was some great actor out there who didn't want to be a part of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well. The first movie i watched was The Incredible Hulk. Now  I wasnt a fan of the Hulk. And the movie turned me off to it. So after watching it a few times i knew that i wanted to see a new one. So I bought it and  it was great. I loved it. A movie thats more about Hulk, and not the Hulkster, is great. So i thought that this movie would do the same thing. But it didn't. Hulk is a very good actor, and a good guy. But the movie is very flat, and it didn`t work on me.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The whole movie is a disaster. I found the whole thing very boring, there was no plot to speak of. A bunch of boring people walk into a bar, drink a bunch of drinks and dance. The ending was like a slap in the face because the characters never changed at all from the beginning.   There is no plot at all. The characters are not even likable, and even worse, there is no connection between any of them. It is very easy to forget any of these characters in the whole movie.  The music was really bad. The whole thing looked really dirty, so the only thing left was the music.  It is not very interesting to watch a movie like this.  I hope this movie was made for a cheap and low budget, so that people would think this was a good idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked the movie very much but it was so poorly written that it was almost unreadable. The director was supposed to be an amazing artist but it didn't work. The movie didn't have any artistic ideas.   The writing is horrible. The story is just about some guys getting drunk, taking their car, and making a fool of themselves in a remote area.  The acting was terrible. Some of the actors are so bad they didn't even appear.  Some of these characters were like old Hollywood "movie stars" from the 70's and 80's. They were terrible actors.  I don't think there's anything wrong with alcohol but that's a lot of it.  Overall I didn't like the movie but it is definitely worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The characters are all very one dimensional.  This is just a bad mess of a movie.  The acting is very poor.  All of the other actors in this film are not very good either.  I think there is only one good looking actress in this movie. This movie should be called The Unstoppable Monster.   If you are in the mood for a cheap cheap mindless comedy that will get your blood pumping you will love this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My son and I came here last night after a late show at the amphitheater. We were expecting to see a bad live performance.  The band looked bad, the sound was bad.  It was hard to hear them even with earbuds in. We got there and were a little disappointed.  They were doing just about all the same songs they've been doing for years and seemed to be playing the same spots all night.  My husband had a hard time hearing the lyrics.  We left early.  I don't think this place is worth going to if you want a bad show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In this one, a man gets drunk at the wrong time, goes home with a girl, and then she finds him passed out on the couch with a syringe in his arm. They then proceed to do things they wouldn't do in the real world, and he ends up getting shot by the police.   The movie's only saving grace is its soundtrack, which I thought was good but not amazing.  This film is probably not worth seeing, unless you want to watch some sort of ridiculous thriller that involves a woman who kills men (or the reverse).
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this in a dimly lit theater with no sound. I was so disappointed with the acting that I left the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie of all time. I won't bother to go through the entire movie because it is just so awful. The script is terrible and it's the director's fault. If anyone knows this man, let me know because he's a complete and utter disgrace to cinema. It's like a college movie with a group of drunk frat boys and a bunch of people just trying to pass the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a film from the 40's that was made and released by Paramount in the 70's.   At the time, it was a bit of a commercial flop, and never really got the recognition it deserved.  This film was originally directed by  Alfred Hitchcock, but when the producer died,  the movie was passed down to  Alfred Jodel.  The movie tells of two brothers, John and Peter.  John (Hitchcock) is a con-man, and tries to con  a  woman into making him a million dollars by convincing her he is a genius, and her into giving him the money.  Peter is the victim of John's trick, and  he is able to help his brother out of the con after he  learns about it.  Both of the characters had pretty good performances.  When it comes to the action scenes, they are pretty fun to watch, especially the scenes with the two con men.  After the story is told, the film gets into some of the problems faced by women in the 40s.  One of the biggest problems in this movie is that there is no real sex in the film, just two of them kissing a lot.  Overall,  this is a fun film that anyone with an interest in this period can enjoy.  If you enjoy the style of this film, then you will enjoy this film too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I'll try to find a new movie I'll actually watch. I think the movie is just very bad. I don't like horror films, I don;t like that much gore in movies, I'm not a huge fan of zombie movies. If you are looking for a movie about a group of people trapped in a house and they become infected I don';t think it'll be very good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is basically about a guy who goes to a party and finds some guy he can't stand. They fight until he runs out of gas in his truck. The police show up and the police find him lying on his side in the back of his truck with a gunshot wound. The film shows us a close up shot of a bloody man lying on the ground but the police officers can't find anything to suggest who did it. The only thing you see is blood running down the screen in the shot. So they take the guy off the truck and put him on a stretcher and they take him to the hospital. The movie ends with them in the ER watching him recover. There is not a lot of discussion about why the guy committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. And there are some obvious inconsistencies in the story. The guy in the truck is supposedly going to a funeral but the funeral director tells the cops that he is in town for a party. The last thing in the film is the police guy trying to figure out who the guys in the party are. If they would have stuck to the story of an uninvolved partygoer they would not have gotten such a mixed up ending. I think the director should have just taken a break from the story and tried to work in the characters and tell the whole story in a more interesting way.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is crap, it is stupid, and its not worth watching at all.   It is so poorly written that I cannot believe this was even produced.    It is only a re-hash of "The Green Mile" and "Con Air."   The story, the character acting, the plot, and even the special effects are all recycled from other movies.  They even reused the same set, the car, the gun, and the hotel.  This is not a great movie.  The acting is ridiculous, and it shows on every single one of the characters.  It also has the worst special effects ever made.  There is a scene where they fly the helicopter, and at one point the helicopter flies over a helicopter, but there is no rotor in the frame.  Even the special effect on the helicopter blades looks fake.  You can see every blade and it doesn't look very realistic.  I don't know how this movie was even released, and if someone really thought it was worth making, I would hope they would have found a better director to use. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read that this is a true story, but the book that inspired this movie was "The Princess Bride", not "The Last Samurai", and it is not a bad one at all. This movie is better, but if you are a fan of the book, you might want to pass this one up.   The movie is about a samurai who has to go into battle with a great white shark and his samurai buddies. The samurai is really good at what he does and it really takes the film into the next level.    There are plenty of really great martial arts scenes and many cool action sequences.  The movie is actually quite enjoyable.  I especially enjoyed the "gorgeous, long sword fight" between the samurai and the shark.  Even though the action isn't amazing (I was expecting the movie to be very violent), I really enjoy watching the samurai fight. The acting is good and the movie is full of beautiful, colorful, and detailed CGI.  If you love the "great white shark" movie, and are a big fan of martial arts, then you really need to watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just saw this movie, about a couple who have a relationship. It was supposed to be about an ex who comes back into his life and wants to reconnect, and it ends up being about the couple who broke up, and the girl who broke off the relationship. The ex ends up taking a job as the bodyguard of the girl he broke up with, and then breaks into the girl's apartment and rapes her. The girl ends up on trial for the crime, and when the ex walks in and tells everyone that he broke into her apartment, he's arrested for the rape. This movie, like many movies, got away with a lot, and because of the poor acting, it was pretty hard to take the story seriously.   So yeah, I can't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was so bad. It was about a young girl who loves to play games, and a friend, who is a bit more reserved. It's not the first one to try this kind of movie, but this one had all the problems of a bad game, as a friend of the heroine gets kidnapped, a strange guy appears with an awesome gun, and it ends up all kinds of crazy. This movie had many different scenes. For example, the movie is supposed to be about this friend who plays games, but in a small room, she watches the game from a small camera. The best scenes were when she and her friend tried to do the game. The guy in the game's place, had all these weapons that she didn't know about. There was a scene where the game guy's character tries to escape, but gets caught. It is a scene that is never shown in any other movie. It had a nice story.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am no great fan of martial arts movies.  I never saw the Kung Fu Panda movie and don't want to go to the movie theater and see it again.  The movie had a great cast. I don't think it was all that good, and I wouldn't watch the movie again. If you like martial arts films, and have never seen a Kung Fu movie, I recommend it, but be prepared to be disappointed.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad bad movie from the late 80's or early 90's that never should have been made and made so badly.  The acting in this movie is really bad, and the editing is just awful.  One person was supposed to be in a wheelchair, but instead it is the actor who never was able to walk.  There was so much screaming, and a lot of people got injured.  I have seen so many bad movies and I am not ashamed of that one, but this is one that doesn't belong in a comedy list.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this movie, and would have rated it higher if it hadn't had some bad elements to it.  The characters are uninteresting, and the story isn't interesting at all.   Also, there's a bad ending, and that was really cheap writing.  My rating was 4 stars because the characters were uninteresting and the plot wasn't very interesting, but I was disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie when it was released in 1994. I was just an ordinary teen who liked to watch action movies and I enjoyed watching this film. It wasn't that good but it was pretty good. The only bad thing about this movie is that it was so expensive that nobody else made a lot of movies in the same genre. It was made on a small budget and no one was making movies like this at the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen this movie multiple times in multiple versions, and each time it was a completely different film. I first saw it in the theater in the 1980s, and while it is fun, it never had the same appeal as it does now, in that it is really just a spoof of 1970s style camp. I don't know if it's a good or bad film, but it's funny, and I enjoy watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is good as far as the "star-studded cast" goes. The action scenes are fun. They seem to be done in black and white which is the best way to go about it. There are a couple of very brief sequences with black and whites. The one that comes to mind is when the girl (who was supposed to be a child) finds a gun. She goes to go fetch it and she's shot, leaving her on the floor. The guy takes her to the police, who take the gun and run off. You've never seen a movie with such an evil ending. I guess the actor who plays the gun-thief decided to keep it a surprise that someone would kill a little girl.   The movie was bad.  I guess this is one of the many movies that was made and was rushed to theaters and they didn't realize that the actors did not have that much time to get the dialog right. The dialogue was pretty poor. The only actor who had any talent was the guy who played the gun thief. He was a nice guy.  They just didn't want to do all of the work. The ending was really stupid.  The action was all done in the same dark room and there was no lighting and no background for the actors to work in.  It's a shame because all of them had good careers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending was a little bit of a disappointment because it was a bit "cheesy" and rushed. I'm not saying the ending is bad, but it should have been longer, especially considering the plot (and even better, the characters) that were introduced in the beginning. The acting was also poor.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film was poorly acted, poorly shot, poorly edited, and poorly scored.   What it needed was an extra $300,000 (at least) to have someone give it the respect it deserves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting was very bad. There were times when the two actors were fighting, and then the camera shot them at a good angle and out of focus.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the beginning this film was really good, and it really had a great sense of humor. It was a funny movie, and that was the best part of the movie. But, it was also really slow. It had all these great scenes, and then all of a sudden it takes a long time to get to the good parts, and sometimes the good scenes are not the best scenes. There is no real plot, and the characters don't seem to care about anything. There was so much great story, and some good scenes, but the story is not what kept me coming back for more.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would have rather had more time to play this game than just playing it.  It was a decent game and I don't mean that in the sense of a bad game.  I am not complaining about the game's flaws as they are not bad.   There were a lot of flaws in the game and they would have been fixed if it was a different game but I can't help but feel that this is an inferior game.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As far as bad movies go, it's certainly not one I would want to be a part of, let alone one that is being put in front of children, especially the film is rated G.   The movie is pretty much made up of recycled footage and it is obvious that the filmmakers decided to use a few clips that suited their purpose but the rest of it was completely unnecessary and very cheap.  Even though it is a "children's film", the material they used for the shots are not appropriate for kids and it shows.  It's a shame that a children's movie is being made when they could have at least spent the money on filming a decent movie that would be acceptable to parents who actually paid for the tickets to watch it.  The soundtrack is pretty good, but it is not a great movie.  I was really hoping to see something better than this as a grown man, but there is not much to recommend it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of those movies that was made to make money. The acting was horrendous. The plot was too simplistic. There were so many missed opportunities that it ruined this movie for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is set in the 1970s. The story is a variation on the old American tradition of the cowboy and the Indian: a westerner and the tribe are hunting one day and are attacked by some Indian women. The woman turns out to be the daughter of a tribe leader and when the cowboy shoots the mother the girl runs away and disappears into the hills. He returns to the tribe and tries to get her back. He succeeds but at a terrible cost. He learns that the Indian women have some dark powers and that a child is being born with the evil spirit in him. He goes back and tries again but ends up killing the mother with his gun. The girl is found and brought back to the camp. The Cowboy is horrified by the girl and the evil in him and vows to get rid of the thing forever.   I thought the movie was good for a little while but it was very tiresome after a while. The only thing I enjoyed about the story was the Cowboy and the girl. There was something about them. I liked that there was a man and a woman together in the desert and that it was not a happy situation. The rest of the characters seemed like filler, except for a couple of the other Indians and a few others. The movie was pretty slow and boring. I didn't understand the script and the dialog seemed out of place in the era. I have no idea why they kept putting the women into the same roles but I guess they didn't want to break up the couples. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would give this movie a 1.0 if it were possible. It was boring. I can see why a studio would have made this movie as a "fantasy" but it's not at all. The costumes are ridiculous and the actors playing them are nothing but annoying and unplayable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved watching the movie on my DVR. This was an awesome ride from the beginning.  The movie took place in the "Big Apple".  The scene where they were sitting on the train waiting for a train to come by was amazing.  Then, at the end of the train, when the guy was looking at his cell phone and getting bored with it, this huge black cat came running by. The guy who was waiting for the train to leave, got scared, jumped off the train onto the cat, and jumped in the hole that the train went through.  It was amazing to see a black cat running down the street at night.  I loved this movie and wish I could get the soundtrack. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It wasn't funny at all, just a poorly put together movie, with poor acting, and a silly script. I just wish it would have never gotten made.   The first half of the movie was just so over the top, and I can't believe that they would even try to make a decent horror movie at the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is made by two very bad people, and has not one redeeming feature. The acting is very bad, the story is bad, and the characters are terrible. It's very cheap and extremely bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie and I really dislike this movie. The acting was not good at all, not one actor was believable. The plot is not original, it is a rip off of another movie called Drowning Pool. The music was terrible, nothing like the music in the movie. It was cheesy and very loud. I don't care about this movie at all.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen this movie a few times and was really hoping for something great from this director.  I think the film was made because he had some great ideas but was frustrated with how this all got handled.  In this movie, we have an 18-year-old female who goes out with her friend who is an older man.   This film is set in a rural area so we get to see a lot of rural life.  The movie has many scenes of very low lighting and lots of forest shots that seem to not have that much in the way of movement.  Most of the film is a lot like what I call a "flash-forward" and shows what will happen before the main character's life gets really bad.  Some of the scenes are so cheesy that I was glad we didn't see these scenes at the premiere.  When you get to the point that this movie has to end, it was really annoying to see how the people in the town really react.  It felt like some were making fun of this young lady.  And to be honest, it didn't feel like much of a real town, there are just a few people.  One of the most annoying scenes was when they had an old woman come out of the forest to tell the young woman not to do what she did.  She even says, "You didn't have to cut that tree".  This was after she had had her daughter cut off her hand and was trying to take it off.  To me, it felt like the director wasn't giving us enough information.  There was also an extended version that I didn't get and I believe it came out a few years after this film came out.  Another thing I found strange about this movie was how the main young man was always trying to have sex with the older woman.  Why?  This is the only scene I saw in the film where he is really going for it.  This guy had sex with an older woman after being in a relationship with a girl who was much older than him.  Overall, I think this film was a waste of money.  He could have done a better job.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The badness was the worst aspect of this movie. It is a great idea for an action movie but it doesn't do a lot to it. The effects are good but the CGI is bad. The fight scenes were boring to watch because it was a generic plot. The only thing that kept it from being a 5 star movie is that the movie had a good cast of characters like Jeff Bridges, Robert Duvall, and Bruce Willis.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's soooo hard to rate this film. The acting is bad, the story is bad.   The script is just so bad and the cinematography is sooo cheesy and cheap that it's a very cheap film.  It just has no redeeming qualities at all.  This is really not that good, and it has some nice special effects but at the same time it's just terrible.  If you are into bad movies then this is for you, but not everyone is going to love this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In this movie I found myself watching a movie that I never heard about in the movies section. This movie was a very good one. Not for the faint hearted it has some bad acting and very slow story line. But it is a good horror movie, I thought. I will watch this movie again if I need a laugh.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My mother has just given birth to my daughter. I am out of town and I'm just going to let her have a few hours. I called the theater and said "If I see this movie, would you be willing to give me a refund?" They say "sure, but we will have to do a 'first look' at the movie" I said "First look, but it's only a preview". They said ok, then they brought in the movie. I watched it and let me say, this movie was not a good movie at all. It was terrible and my daughter hated it. I didn't care for the plot at all and my mother didn't enjoy it either. I would have gotten an A+. The film was horrible and the actors were really horrible. The whole movie, I could not stand the actors. They just kept talking and talking and they had no personality. I did not understand the dialogue, and there was no way I could understand the characters.  The way this movie showed me it was a good idea to use a gun. "It was all a trick to get to the other side" What a cheap and disrespectful way to show a movie.    It is also interesting how this movie shows us a black person with no emotion at all (except one time). The black guy, as he is running away from the cops, he is crying. There is no emotion or reaction at all from the black guy.  I'm not sure how these movies do it, but how does a movie not have an emotion at any point of the movie when the characters are running away?    It was a poor movie and you have to get it on DVD if you want to see it again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I first saw this movie I was thinking "Who would buy this crap?   I watched it and thought that it sucked because of it's terrible acting and its acting was awful."   Then after watching the whole movie I realized it was probably a great movie because the acting was great and the plot was ok.   My biggest problem with this movie is that I think that the people that made it were really cheap to make it, and it was definitely an insult to the intelligence of everyone who was trying to see this movie.  I really hope that they release a new version of this movie so that people can see the truth.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is awful! It is the worst movie of all time. A great director would never make something like this, he would make a decent movie, but this director really doesn't have a clue. The acting is terrible, the acting is worse than the movie itself! It doesn't matter who is doing it, the movie is ridiculous! It has a lame plot that isn't worth watching and the ending is pathetic!   Just so you know; this movie was made in the early 1970's and has been in every "worst movie" film list ever.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There were some parts in the movie that were just a complete waste of time. The plot of the movie is basically about a group of criminals who are trying to get away from the police. I guess the only real "plot" in this movie is the drug deals that they are involved in. When the drug dealers are arrested by the police, they start to get the cops to pay them off and in the end, the police are allowed to keep the money for themselves.   What's wrong with this movie?   The first half of the film is about the drug dealing, then the police officers go after them.  These guys really have no problem getting arrested for the first time, then going to jail for drugs, then they are able to "bail out" of jail. It's really sad when you see the criminals and the cops go on and on about how good it is that the criminals are getting arrested.  The police officers have to come up with money from other people that they're "liable" to, or else the police will come after them, but it never makes any sense to me.  It seems like a lot of the "convicted criminals" are just making up lies to get out of jail or paying the police off to keep them out.  I really wanted to see the real criminals in jail for a little while, but the movie just seems to be made up of these crooks talking about how they are getting away with things that they shouldn't be getting away from.  This movie also really doesn't make me care for the characters at all. They all seem very immature and the only one that is good in the entire movie is The Joker.  All of the criminals in this film seem very much like they want to go on with the drug trade as quickly as possible, so they can get the money they are owed. I don't think the police should have had to bail these people out, so I don t think this movie was really worth watching, but if you are just going to see one movie with "bad guys" and "good guys" who are "bad" and just trying to survive, I don't think you should really bother. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is not even funny.   The acting is not up to the standards of the 80s.  This was probably made to get people to show up at the movies, and it failed.  I guess people like to be told to laugh at stuff.  It's not funny at all.  There is no plot.  They go around trying to see what "real life" looks like, and we never really see that.  The actors just do their best and the producers just give them enough money so they can make it as cheap as possible.  That's why it's cheap.  When they say they're going to do this, they're not really going to.  One of the actors just says "Oh, yeah, the weather's great," and they put on a fake rain storm.  Not a lot of effort went into this movie.  Just to make it look real, and not even try to be realistic, they do a lot more to show it's fake than they do in reality.  If you like a movie called "The Last of the Mohicans," you're going not to like this movie, because they tried to make a real story out of a fake movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My first time watching this movie was my birthday. I was 12 and my dad and I went and saw it and were both enthralled and horrified, but the movie itself wasn't that bad. It was a bit of a slog though and you wouldn't want to watch this movie at 12 years old. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely horrible! The acting was awful and the plot was not very creative. The characters didn't seem to have much in the way of personalities. I don't understand what the director was trying to accomplish with this film. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The ending is horrible and pointless. The movie didn't go in any direction other than going the same way as every other movie in the "The Goonies" franchise.    This movie is nothing more than a collection of shots of the characters running through an underground area.  The soundtrack isn't much better. The only thing that the music is good for is the opening credits. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a pretty bad movie that has a couple of good moments, but nothing you'll want to watch a hundred times. It has some great action and a decent story line, but it is really just an excuse to have the bad guy shoot people (and sometimes throw them to the ground). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had hoped to see this one at a late date for it, it was at a cinema, so I couldn't catch it at home, or get to one of the theaters.  The movie was a total disappointment, the performances are bad, and I found it ridiculous that this is the only movie of this type that made it into a 3-D presentation.  At first, I thought that I should check it out for fun, but then it occurred to me that it would not make a good movie, which is why it would only be a novelty.   This film was made in 3-d, and not to a good effect.  This is one of those cases of movies that really should have stayed in 2-d.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It really seems like it was a poor attempt at making a cheap B-Movie, or perhaps just the writing wasn't good, or just the script was just awful.   I really don't see how this movie was made and distributed for anything other than a few bucks.  I would have to say this movie would have been even worse had it been shot on video.  It had nothing to do with science or anything else.  A "science" movie is not supposed to make you think "wow! what a great idea!"  A movie about "scientists" and "geophysics" really doesn't make sense to me.  For example, there are no "scientist" in this movie other than one person.  This was not a movie where they were using the "scientific" techniques of "geography" and such.  The scientists seem to just be talking about "geology" all day.  Just about every one of them speaks in this "geological" talk and you could tell they just had a copy of a textbook to read.  At no point does anyone ever "see" anything.  They just say "the geology of this area says that this is this way."  They say this over and over again and you have to listen to it over and again.  There are so many "geophysical" problems with this movie that I am really amazed this movie got made.  Maybe the person who made it had never seen the book, "Geology: a Modern Introduction" by G.H.J. Emshwiller.  And the way the movies were shot definitely contributed to the poor quality of the movie.  Of course, the editing and editing techniques were so bad that you have no idea what the "scientisitcs" are talking about.  Another problem is that the actors had no idea how to act.  You can't tell what is going on because they are not acting or moving.  No one ever acts naturally.  Even the "science talk" was wrong.  Again, this is not the first time I have seen a bad B-movie (such as "Dr. Strangelove" ) made for less than a buck.  But "Geofacts" was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only thing I can say is that there is not much in the movie that is interesting or well made.   It is all just made for being cheap.  If you look for a good movie about a war, why would you watch this?  It's just a war movie.  Not even a very good one.  The actors in this movie are just terrible, especially the one who plays the kid that is getting raped.  For the movie to be this bad it has to be based on a book, so you can understand why it isn't worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you liked the first movie in this series (the one where a kid and his dad get into a huge fight with giant robots and everything), this is a sequel. The movie is good, but the first one was better, and this is really not a sequel to anything.  The characters are the same, but everything is different.  You should see the first to see how bad this is.  There is no hope in the story, no reason for it to keep going. It is just a movie for kids.  If I had to be critical about this movie, I would say the writing is bad, the acting is bad and the action is bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked this movie and thought it was a great comedy. The whole thing just feels like a parody of the 80's.   The first 40 minutes were great. It kept me entertained and laughed out loud. The second act felt very slow and predictable. The ending was also not as funny as the rest of the movie.  The "bunny" who did the singing, looked pretty much like the lady from the "Laserblast" video.  This was another good looking, but completely unnecessary movie. The director should have just gone for an 80's spoof and not have to take such liberties. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry this movie is so bad. The writing in the script was so bad it makes it not worth watching it at all. I'm actually going to watch it in the movie theater to see how they got that character to look like that.    And the actors are bad, to the point where you can tell some of them have not done much in their lives. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a really awful movie.  I never thought I would see the day where i would say that a bad actor would be in a movie that I like. The acting in this movie is just awful. Not good enough to make me stop seeing it but enough to know it isn't worth my time.   The acting is awful enough that the actors in it should have had to do some acting classes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm still bitter about how this turned out. A lot of what was going to be awesome is lost due to the editing and some terrible acting. It was like the actors got drunk and decided to star in a movie. You can't do that. The story is so weak and the acting is so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen most of the bad movies of the 90's and they were all bad. This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I have heard that this movie was a good idea by a director that just didn't do it. It is a terrible movie to watch. There are some really bad acting, some really great acting, and a good script. But the bad acting and the bad script made this movie just horrible. I can't wait to see it on the big screen. I just hope the actors that were in it have some talent and didn't have to suck so hard to get the role.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A poor adaptation of a good book.  There are so many problems with this movie.  It takes place in a small town in southern California.  The town was originally a town in Arizona that was evacuated after a tornado hit the area.  When the movie began the town was a small mining community.  In this adaptation it was a farming community, and they didn't want to evacuate, so they decided to use the tornado as cover for an attack.  This is the same tornado that killed hundreds of people in Arizona in the 70s.  What happened in this movie was a local rancher turned rancher, had two "pets" who had gotten loose.  After the rancher got into an argument with the town marshal, who wanted to take the "pies" away from the ranch, the ranchers started a massive fire, then burned all the surrounding land to cover up the ranched land.  Then the "Ranchhands" went out to take their two "tigers" away.  They set fire to their "poles" and went out with a bunch of other people to go after them.  Their "ranchers" then tried to kill them and their friends and family.  Eventually the townspeople and some firefighters (all of whom got shot up in the movie) ended up in an old barn and there were only three people in it, and one of them was a teenage boy.  By the time all of this had happened, the ranch was on fire and the "roof was a big pile of ash".  As the boy was climbing up the roof, a bunch more people, with guns, came over and started shooting at him.  A group of cops then show up and started taking shots at the "townspeople".  Eventually someone threw a molotov cocktail at the cops and they all started running away.    I feel like this movie didn't have a purpose.  Every scene was totally different and didn't add up.  I remember seeing it for the first time, and the only things I could think of to make this work were the tornado and the cops (but what kind of people throw molotoves at cops? ).  The fire scene was also the worst.  Each character had his/her own fire and it went on for probably 10 minutes.  No one in this film had any lines.   As I sat there watching it the only thing I could
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is nothing more than a cheap horror that wastes the talents of the great James Woods.    The acting is terrible, the acting is awful, the casting is awful and the directing is terrible.  The story is stupid and has to be taken as a joke.  This would be a great idea for a one shot but not in a horror movie.  A joke that would work in the movie is that the killer turns out to be a "dressed in drag" who is just another victim of the killer.  I wouldn't mind if the "dress in drag " came back in a sequel or three. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought I'd seen this movie many times, but it didn't even start up. Then I watched it, and it didn the thing! A good bad movie! I'm not sure it's worth watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was born in 1985, so this movie was never supposed to come out. The producer gave it to a movie company, they sold it to someone and it was never going to be released.   If you don't like the music in the movie, you are in for a rough ride. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is a mess. There is a lot of talk about making a documentary but when you actually see it in its entirety it is a very poor attempt. If you are looking for a good documentary, please get the documentary by Mark and David about the making of the movie, not this one. This movie is not worth the time of your life.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would not recommend this movie, I don't like the lead characters and this movie doesn't have a very interesting plot, it is also very silly and the film doesn't make any sense.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was my first time seeing a zombie movie so I didn't know what to expect, but I can safely say that this is one of the worst zombie movies I've seen so far. The only thing worse than zombies is watching these creatures come back to life and reanimate themselves, and then trying to kill them again when they are gone.   I've always thought the creatures in the movies were cool, but not these ones.  The effects of being infected are so bad, I'm almost ashamed to admit I enjoyed the movie. The ending was pretty weird, and I don't know why it was included.  There was a lot of blood in the movie and it made my eyes water a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad picture of the great country, which I do not understand. What are the real problems of this country? Is it too many guns? Is the government too much like a gangster? Is there too much violence? This film only shows what we want to see.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen this movie before and enjoyed it at one point, but I have to say it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The film is just a cheap knock off of a much better movie called "The Longest Day". If you like movies where they are in a bad situation, this movie is probably for you. It seems they tried to use some of the same actors but were just not able to do it right. They made the characters look old and they looked bad, they looked real old and not that young at all. The only actors who seemed real were the actors who play the criminals, and some of them I found really disgusting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so much better than the remake. It has been over 30 years since the original was made. I do not remember any of the original actors in the film. The story takes place in a small town in the middle of nowhere and it was a great idea to try and get a remake made. The only problem with this movie is that it tries to be too much at once. It is so slow to start out that it makes you want to see the beginning of the movie again. If the movie makers had just done an original script then this movie would be a lot better. There are some great actors in this film. It would have been nice if the remake were not so bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible movie with very bad acting, bad plot, and bad acting. All of the actors in this movie are terrible and the actors that do well for the movie are the best in the movie.   A little movie can be made for only $300,000.  This movie was made by a guy that should have been out of the industry!  He should have gone to work with the real people and not with actors.  I hate to see such a bad film from a guy who was able to make "The Longest Yard", and then he went to work on this movie that should be a classic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are looking for the next Spielberg movie, this is not for you. I watched this a month ago and I am still getting the hang of this movie.    This movie is very cheesy, with the actors doing all sorts of bad acting.  This is what Spielberg did for the 80's.  Not worth the price of admission. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like the title says, this movie is terrible and has no plot. All we are given is a girl who has a cat and she just keeps feeding it. The cat can't go for more than 3 days without drinking. There is no way it can go without drinking because when you give a cat a drink it becomes sick and weak and will not eat.   The movie is very slow and boring to watch. I hate the cat's name.  My only wish is that this movie will get a PG rating.  This movie really was not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie I see in the theater is the same movie I've seen thousands of times.   There is very little, if any, humor in this movie.  It is only about 10 minutes of good acting and there are no funny lines.  A "good" movie is not just for fun.  The characters are poorly written and it's just plain bad acting.  All of the characters are a waste of time.  Some of them have a good idea and just do not act it out.  This movie should not have been made and the studio should be ashamed of itself.  There are better movies out there.  If you're looking for a good laugh, go see "My Best Friend's Birthday" or "The Breakfast Club."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen The Man Who Killed Don Quixote many times, and I would like to say it is not one of the bad movies. There are many actors who were great to play Don Quijote, and there was a great music score. Don Qui was a very great character, and the story was great. However, as a whole it is pretty disappointing, and it is the characters who should have been the most interesting. If you are looking for a good, good looking, but not very interesting adventure movie, this is not the movie for you.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The problem with a bad film is that once it gets going it just keeps on going and going and is never really satisfied. As an action film it is great and the stunts are great. But as a horror film it stinks. It is so full of bad ideas and bad production values that it is hard to get excited about it. The acting is okay, especially the leading man. I wouldn't mind seeing a remake of this one."   The film started well enough with some great action sequences, but by the end it was just plain bad. I hated the direction and editing, I hated all the bad ideas in this film and I hated how every single action scene was just poorly constructed and poorly filmed. This film could have been a great film if the acting was on par with the quality of the rest of the film. The only thing that saved it from being an outright bad film was the production design, which is really very well done.   It is really hard to write anything positive about this film, since this is one of those films that really should have never been made.  "A beautiful woman and a beautiful weapon. It's like a real love story, and you can feel every line of dialogue and every gesture on the screen." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was just not that good. I like many of the movies the people in my family watch on tv. But this one wasn't really worth my time. I mean there was no excitement, nothing special, and the acting was terrible. I would rather have had something that was actually interesting than something that I really don't understand.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The main character is a really boring little wimp that is so easy to hate and the plot is so contrived that it just goes on and on and the dialogue is boring as well.   I would not recommend this movie at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not bad, but it's just not very good.  It was not well written, nor did it portray a very exciting time in American history.  The war didn't start until late 1915.  There were only 10 major battles between 1916 and 1917, and they weren't that close, and there were many smaller battles during the war.  That said, the film has a lot of interesting characters, and I don't know why they didn't include more of them, like William Henry Harrison or President Woodrow Wilson.  They probably should have filmed more of the war in the Midwest and New England, since that's where the battles were.  I've seen more action and adventure movies since.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went into the movie expecting a good flick, but I was disappointed. The actors are really good, but the script is horrible. All the other bad movies I've seen are better. If you want to laugh out loud and have a good time, this is the movie for you. The plot is ridiculous and there is a lot of stupidity, but it isn't in the story. The movie is just silly and is nothing more than entertainment.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has a lot of problems but the worst one is the writing, and even the production itself, that was all done in low-budget. The actor is supposed to be a "B" guy, and he is supposed be playing a "hero" who is a "warrior" who has to save his wife from the evil monster. But the whole time, he is constantly falling for the villain's wife (who's really just a really attractive, sexy woman). It's just terrible.   So what happened was this guy (the guy who played the "hero") was a "b" guy who wanted to be "a" guy and went to a guy with the same goals and was trained by the same guy. He was supposed to do it by the book. So he goes to a man with the "bad" attitude of how a man should act and is taught a bunch of things from the bad guy, that he never learned in school. But then he goes back to his "hero", and that guy doesn't believe him, and doesn't want to help him, but the guy who trained him back at the base (the bad guy) is the one who actually wants to help. It was ridiculous, and I hated that guy, too.  But it was at least interesting, because it was like a man who was really strong was telling a "bad guy" how to act. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you like cheap trash like the above mentioned garbage you will love this movie.   There are some really good scenes and some really bad scenes but it would be really great if these scenes were removed or they were edited down. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The director is the one who put this movie together. The producer, the guy who does the voice work is the same guy who did the first film. If you are going to do a sequel, please make it better.   I do not understand how the same actor did both of these movies. This was a poor effort at a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very disappointing film that is really hard to follow. The plot is very weak and does not do anything to stand out. The actors play this so blandly that you are not really impressed by them. The only good thing that happens is that you get to see a beautiful desert in the middle of nowhere.   This movie is so boring and there is nothing in it that you can not find in a regular western. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story has some promise but the characters have little development. The director's use of light and shadow in the film is very creative and beautiful but the film lacks dramatic weight.   Overall, I found this film to be one of the worst I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *WARNING*   It is my understanding that the "S.T.A.R. Labs" in the movie was a reference to the movie "Scream" starring Tobe Hooper.   The movie did not "feel" like a "Scrappy Doo" movie.  There were a few other things in this movie that made it very strange.  I will say the acting of the "Maggie" was bad, she was almost unrecognizable.  *The "Trouble" part was very hard to watch.  They could have used better editing on the scene.  It was strange to see the movie play out in slow motion.  Some things did not make sense.  If you do not want to see this movie, do not watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My favorite part of the movie was the opening scene, when we see this old dude walking into a bar, and the camera goes behind him and lets us see his old man face. I could've sworn he was really old.   When I first saw it, I had to do a double take. I couldn't figure out who it was, and it was a long shot. When I saw the guy again, I recognized the face. He was played by Peter Cushing!   I had never seen Peter Cushnahan in a movie, but I thought he was great in this. He has a great presence, and even though the movie is pretty silly, he really gets across the jokes.  This movie is funny, but it isn't worth watching the whole thing just for that scene. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A big disappointment. The acting is bad and the story is so boring.   In my opinion the best actor is not the one who should have played this role. The only thing interesting about this movie is the ending, which doesn't feel like a story at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movies I have seen. The acting was very bad, the story is not interesting, and the acting is even worse. The main actor was like an old drunk who came to the movies for entertainment and he was always on screen getting drunk or making some crazy statement that no one would have ever heard from someone so stoned. It is so bad that I wonder how they can even make a movie out of this garbage.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main character's voice is all wrong for this movie.   I really felt I had to do something to him to make him not talk like that.  The character really was really not very well written.  When I first saw the movie, I thought it was very good and very well acted. I was amazed that they made this movie and I was disappointed that the movie didn't last long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the best movie I have seen in many years.   The action scenes are good, the stunts are great, and the acting is good.  I hope you find it, if you do you will be very impressed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie because it was on Netflix but I wasn't really sure if it was worth it since the trailers were so vague.   It's definitely an interesting movie to look at from the director's point of view.  The first act is a bit weak.  There's just not enough of anything to get you interested.  I don't know about you but I could care less about who the main character is, and that bothers me.  He was never really brought to life in the first few minutes, which felt like a waste of time.  This movie was really interesting to watch but I didn't really like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think i have seen this movie a couple of times, but still it never gets old.  The dialogue was not great, but the movie itself was fun, the set up was fantastic, and it even had a great main villain, the guy with the scar. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not the type of person that's ever gonna like a movie that's just so bad I can't even watch it.    This movie was pretty bad, I mean, it was a comedy.  You see, this movie has a lot of sex scenes.  The movie has one of the most retarded endings I've ever seen, so I would advise you to watch the movie in a quiet place, with some dark background music, or something, or at least do not watch it on your computer, that was the worst thing.  They were so fucking retarded, even with their actors acting so well.  Also, most of the sex scenes were so boring, just some fucking with one of their characters and some sex.  All they wanted was some sexual comedy with no sex.    I would really advise you not to watch this movie, it really is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Dawn of the Dead" is bad. It isn't bad in the sense of a bad film. This is one of the most generic "scooby doo" style films I've ever seen. It's just one of those movies where everyone on screen has the same exact clothes, haircuts, and facial expressions. And it has nothing original about it.   One of the characters, a doctor called Dr. F, was played by the very attractive (though I don't think so in my opinion) actress, Janice Williams. But what the film really needed was to have her appear in the horror genre films, which she did in a number of them, but never played the same character twice.  A film like this doesn't need to have anyone that really makes a good impression to sell it. It needs to get the laughs, and that's it. I don' t understand what the producers were thinking of, because they didn't want anybody that was going to get laughs, so all the characters had the same facial expressions and clothes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an incredibly boring movie. It should have been a spoof of The Office. I was so bored while watching it that I stopped watching and threw it in my car to see if the sun would be up or not. I saw it again a few years later and it was much worse than before. The plot is basically a copy of The Naked Gun, with the entire cast of characters having been hired to play The Naked City. As I watched it I was wondering if there would be any plot at all, if the writers would have used something that made the movie funnier (like The Office's office).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie a few months ago and I was so excited to see a movie with a female lead.  I really liked the acting and the plot was really interesting.  The ending was a bit disappointing.     Unfortunately the movie is way over rated by audiences, and I'm still not really sure why that is.      There are some pretty good action scenes and some great set pieces.  But, the characters are really one-dimensional and are not even fleshed out.   A female lead who doesn't even have any personality The cast:  This movie really had so many great action scenes that had nothing to do with the main characters or the action.  One of the best ones was the fight in the train where the hero, the girl, and her boyfriend get into an altercation, and she gets thrown off of the train and killed.  What a great fight!   The only problem is that this was the only fight in this movie.  There were other great fights that I could have watched, but that wasn't why I saw it.  This cast is definitely over rated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am in love with this movie. The movie is so realistic that even though it is a short movie, it really does make you feel like a real man or a real soldier. The movies story and characters are very interesting and realistic.   What really gets my attention is the amazing special effects.  There are some real blood and guts and some really cool explosions.  Also the great music and the cool scenes.  I highly recommend this movie to all guys and gals, and it really is one of the best movies I have ever seen!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like all great movies it had an audience of people that wanted to see it over and over and thought it was a great film.   This film is very much in the style of the 80's but has not aged well.  This is the type of film I look forward to on Netflix as I love those classics from that era.  The acting is poor and the cinematography is not up to snuff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story of a young man who is an orphan and a member of a nomadic tribe of Native Americans, his experiences in this land make up the majority of the film. It is difficult to find a decent lead in this kind of film. The two leads, Jason Bateman and Michael Peña are the only ones that really seem to give any real effort.   There are three major problems with the film:  1. The story is unbelievable. The movie opens with an Apache boy (Bateman) walking over a frozen river to look for fish. He meets a band of Indians and follows them into the forest. The first time we see him is at the age of 10 or so, and we never see him grow older, his body shape never changes, but his face and personality do.  2. The acting is absolutely terrible. The rest of the movie relies so much on these actors that their performance is basically reduced to scenery. Even the people he meets in the forest make no impression, and the scenes of them eating, sleeping, being wild, having a picnic with the other members of the tribe, are all shot in slow motion.  3. The music is so terrible. Most of the time, it's just a repetitive string or whistle and nothing else.  After watching this film, you'd think that the director never really set out to make a film. He just made the film he thought he would make, and went for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was terrible.  The acting was atrocious.  I don't even want to watch this movie because I couldn't get excited about it.  It was as dull and boring as a dull and uninteresting movie can get.   I think the best way to describe it is that it was a boring trashy romantic comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The entire movie is pretty bad. A lot of times the sound will be distorted or you hear the actors talking out of their mouths or sometimes just random noises that are not what they said but just the sounds they think the character says. If you love horror or horror based films then I think you will love this film.   I got the blu ray and it had an audio issue. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was made to make money and to be a part of the "horror" genre of the 1980's. It is not worth watching unless you enjoy cheesy 90's movies like Nightmare on Elm Street or Halloween. If you don't like it, don't buy it, but if you like cheesy 90s horror movies like this, then you will love it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely bad, the only reason it got an "R" is because the actor playing the villain is the real life Kevin Spacey (and the film doesn't try to pass off the role as an actor, they show Spacey as "the bad guy" even though he is a bad guy.  This is a terrible film, not worth watching if your only idea of a movie is the "Evil Under the Bed" TV show.  If you're looking for a good old fashioned horror flick, go watch something else.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is very poor, the acting is terrible, and the scenes with the cop and the guy who has to get him home for Christmas are the worst scenes I have ever seen.   I know some people think they are funny, but they are so poorly acted they are just horrible.  The guy gets out of the car, he doesn't say anything, he just walks away! And then he gets out again, still does nothing!   It makes you wonder why the cop keeps having to stop him, why is the cop still at the scene of the crime, and why does the guy keep trying to get away when it clearly says he is a wanted man?   The cop is not even interested in arresting the guy, he is only looking for the car that has the "dead boy" on it.  I guess some cops are just not that smart, but you would think that in the police department that they would have known something was wrong before going out and stopping this guy, because the guy obviously didn't have nothing to do with the crime.  One scene when the cop is getting ready to arrest the guy makes me sick to my stomach.  This is one of the most terrible movies I have seen, and I hope you will never see it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible. The only good thing is the fact that it is really, really cheap (even for this time) which is a plus. The other side is bad, bad, and worse. The acting and directing are bad. The editing is bad. If this was a low budget movie it would've cost more. The costumes are bad and the sets are cheap and ugly.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched several of those "films" and I never found them to be interesting or enjoyable, and I do not think I'll be interested in viewing them again, at least not as an adult.    As far as this movie is concerned, I felt it to be a bit much and it is just plain boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are looking for something to "kick start" your horror movie collection, this is the movie for you. The film is very entertaining and the acting is quite good for a horror movie.   However, I really wish the movie was a bit longer, because even after the first hour of the film, it got repetitive.  There's nothing really "horror" about the film.  Even the scenes in the basement with the monster look like a "cabin in the woods" scene.  The only "horrific" scenes I saw were the ones in the mansion.  My main problem with this movie is that it's pretty dated. The story is similar to a remake of "Cabin in The Woods".   There are a few "modern horror" elements that work quite well in this movie, like the weird looking creatures.  However the movie's best moments are the ones of the original film. It just isn't that good of a movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had just seen The Wizard of Oz and was looking forward to a nice magical adventure.  I was NOT disappointed!  The characters were great and the scenery was beautiful.  It was a little strange that the movie was actually set in a small house with a little farm house behind it.  When it finally got to the farm house, it was pretty boring.   In fact, I was almost ready to leave after watching two or three minutes.  Maybe that was just my imagination, but I just didn't feel like I wanted to stay for the whole film.  After the 3rd or 4th time of watching, the whole movie started to feel a little like a big joke.  But I had seen the Wizard of OZ and loved it, so I was ready to be surprised.  The film had a few great songs (such as "Don't Stop Believin' " and "Somewhere Over the Rainbow"), but the performances were pretty lame.  This was definitely not one of my favorite Disney films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not good.   The story is ok but a little slow paced and slow paced is the name of the game for a story like this and the characters are all over the place.  The acting is ok at best.  My favorite character was the "man with a gun" who does not make sense as to why he was carrying a gun all of a sudden.  This was a bad idea to begin with, but the movie could have been great and just needed some fine tuning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a bit of a bore. I got bored after about 3/4 of the movie, and that is pretty much the whole point of it. The actors look bored, the scenery is boring. They are all in a movie together, but the story is basically the same. The acting is so bad and lame that I felt like I was in a slasher movie when the killer shows up.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was a total dud. The script was terrible and it didn't have any charm, and the acting was awful. The director was horrible as well and it was all his fault.   There were no actors in it to make it entertaining and it just looked like a poorly shot movie with no talent behind it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the movie, and it has some good laughs. However, as with many of those old B-movies, it doesn't have much to offer other than some really lame action sequences.   It does have a funny line, which is kind of funny.  I had a tough time believing that the woman in the red dress was the sister of the guy in the green dress who shot the two in the back with a revolver.  And the man who shot them was wearing a green suit and was a detective in some way.  That makes it more likely he's a con artist or a thief or a spy.  All that is said for now, but it's been 40 years and the movie should have been made years ago, maybe even in the 1950s. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is horrible. I hated it from the moment I watched it, the acting was atrocious and they all looked like they were going through the motions for the sake of a paycheck. If you want to see a movie that will make you cry, watch a James Bond movie and skip this crap. I will never watch a movie from this studio again! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is a lot better than it is in the movie, because there is no story and the characters are not well written, so there is not a single reason to watch it.  It is also not very good at all in the musical part, because the music is pretty bad and there is also no acting in it. The only good part is the dance, which is pretty nice.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main problem with this movie is that the plot is terrible, and I mean that literally.   I've seen films where the plot wasn't bad, but this movie has so many holes and it's so convoluted.  This is supposed to be a thriller?   It's basically a love story between a group of terrorists and a police officer that follows them, and it has a really bad main character.  They keep cutting to other characters that make no sense, the cops aren't even on the scene for a while, and we have to guess who all the bad guys are because we just don't get the plot.  I don't know how they can make a movie like this, and they do it on a shoestring budget.  How could they not have filmed this at least in one large place and even gotten a local news reporter involved?  The acting isn't all that good either.  The guy who plays the lead terrorist was great in the film, and he was great as the terrorist leader.  He is also a lot of fun to watch, but the other characters all looked like they were trying really hard, and this makes the film very dull.  There's a scene near the end where we get to see one of the terrorists and he's really acting like an idiot, and the way he's dressed doesn't help.  Even though it's supposed to just be a love triangle, the way the movie is filmed it almost looks like the lead terrorists are trying to get the other terrorists to be their love interests.  Overall I just don' like this movie.  It is terrible in every way, and you have to watch it to see what's wrong with it, because otherwise you will have no idea what the problem is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie isn't bad, but it's a bit unmemorable and bland.   It's almost like an average action movie from a few years back.  The main hero is a pretty big name from that day, but he's so bland and unmemorably dull. The acting is passable, but nothing special.  Not much humor or charisma either.  This movie looks to be released in a few months, maybe sooner.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this in the theater, and this is actually the worst movie I've seen. It's one of those "too bad he couldn't have made a better movie" movies that were so bad that even the writers were ashamed of their work.    The film is a direct sequel to "Gone in 60 Seconds," and the only thing I really liked about this movie is that it had a little more energy in it than the previous "GONE IN 60 SECONDS."   But the fact that it's just a direct continuation of a mediocre movie is very disappointing.     The movie is just a dull rehash of a horrible movie, which is a shame because this movie had so much potential to be even worse than the actual film was.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the film I wanted to watch, and had to wait for years to get.  The film was based on a novel and it was about a man with a terrible brain, he's always in his house, but when the doctor asks him to go to a clinic in the woods to see a specialist, he tells her it's for a good reason, it's the last time he's going to see his wife.  I didn't care for the movie, especially the ending when the guy with the brain in his head starts screaming about how his wife raped him and he needs to kill her.   As if that wasn't bad enough, it was a pretty bad movie and all I can say is that this movie was made for a lower budget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the last time that I watch a bad horror movie. And it was just so bad that it made me cringe. I can't even stand watching it. I wish this movie was as bad as the real thing. It was just way too dark. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is terrible, but it's not the worst film I've seen. The worst part is that I was not watching a terrible film like this. I was watching a film that, if I could, I would still watch.   I'm not sure where they got the idea that it was about a white boy being raped by a black guy in a house of blacks. The movie could have been about a kid that gets kidnapped and tortured by some people, then a group of black thugs, then the kidnappers are killed, and now he is the slave of these people.  I don't think there is a kid of that age in America that doesn't know at least one person of that race. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well I saw this as a preview, and thought it was very lame. The people were not acting, and the movie itself was a complete mess. The director was a pretty poor choice, he didn't understand anything about what he was trying to do.   I wish I could remember where I saw it. This was the only movie I watched that was completely boring and had a lot of problems with plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first time i saw it I didn't know what to think. After a few hours on Youtube I finally got the hint that something bad was in store for us.   A movie with no dialogue, no story, a completely flat acting, and a "plot" that has been broken since the beginning? I don't think there is any way to describe it other than it is a disaster.  The acting was terrible. There were times I was sure i had seen this guy on TV before. Most of the actors looked a lot younger than they are. Even the director was looking a lot older than when he filmed his first movie, and he seemed to be over 60 years old.  Some of the songs were very bad. There are at least 4 songs that were so bad that even the worst band would sound better by comparison.  I wouldn't give this movie any respect at all. It was just plain bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My family and I watched this movie several times before it became a bad flick and now its a terrible movie.  The film begins with a couple, a man and a woman, who seem normal but then the man takes his clothes off and starts fucking a hot naked young girl. The girl cries and tries to resist but then starts to pleasure the man and even pulls out a huge black dildo from her pussy. She was so turned on that she kept pulling her dress up and down, trying to seduce the man.  After about five minutes of this, I started to get very uncomfortable.  At the end of this short scene, the girl goes home and starts to masturbate by the phone.  This movie is not worth watching because all the acting and dialogue are cheesy and the nudity is off putting.  If the main actor's character was not so cheesy and had a bit more to him, this movie would have been a classic.  My advice is don't waste your time on this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only reason this movie is a flop is because of the awful acting.  I thought the movie was bad because of bad acting, not the story.   This movie is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.  It was filmed poorly and the acting was awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was the worst movie I have ever seen! What a waste of money. The actors were horrible, the scenes with a large group of people were boring and the script was terrible. Not worth watching.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was awful, I just thought it would be some crazy movie to do because I could not get into it. My girlfriend saw the movie and thought it was so funny and amazing. It had like 10 different characters from different movies and there was a lot of talking in the background, I think it was a funny movie for adults, not kids.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think it is one of those classic bad movies that are made every now and then, but never become big hits. The movie was just a bit too fast paced for my tastes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not even worth the time to watch. There were a few funny moments, but no character development, and it's pretty far off the plotline.   I think that the actors do a great job, but the director and writer did not deliver on their promise, and the movie was nothing more than a rehash of the old tv show that aired years ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movie ever made. It is basically an adaption of "Wicked" (and the same studio), but without the genius of a director like David Lynch (who, in my opinion, did an amazing job) or the genius, if not artistic, genius of an actor like Johnny Depp. If you can find a copy that is not a bootleg copy, it is really good. I have seen it twice in 3 days.    If you enjoy horror movies, and you don't like Depp, then this movie is not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is an embarrassment of a film. From beginning to end, it makes no sense, is totally un-editable and is filled with blatant mistakes. It has the worst actors, and this movie is the worst of the worst for the time period. If you are going to make a film like this for the big screen, at least hire good actors. The only reason they got such a terrible film made is that the studio was trying to cash in on the 80s craze for cheesy 1980s exploitation.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot was stupid. The characters are flat. The acting is bad. The setting was boring. It was very, very boring.   This movie was supposed to be a parody. It failed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are looking for a fun ride into the 90's you'll have a hard time finding a more interesting film than 'I Love Lucy'. It's like watching the 90s version of the 'Wonder Years' or maybe the 'Twilight Zone'. I don't know if the title of the film was intended to be humorous, but the characters are all very well acted, and the comedy is in a constant light. The soundtrack is one of the best 90's television soundtracks, and I've heard some great 90's music.   I don`t want to hear that cheesy 90`s show music!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen "The Big Red One" (1971) twice, but the second time, my boyfriend (who has never seen the movie), wanted to know what it's about. So I gave it to him in the cinema for him to watch, and then proceeded to tell him the plot of the movie: "This movie is a remake of the 1951 movie The Big Redone, but it has a few new scenes added in. And the new scenes were made by the great director Sergio Leone." And then I explained the plot: "There is a war in Africa. It's a guerrilla war, and some American pilots are sent to take out one of the key leaders, an African general called "Big Red." He gets a bunch of African fighters to take him out, and one of them ends up in the desert with Big Red's plane, and Big Red falls out of the plane and is captured and gets a bullet in the neck and goes to die in the sun. One of the African fighters asks him, "Why did you send us?" The other fighter says, "I don't know! But I'm sure they're still alive. Don't you ever forget that!" (The African fighter then leaves the screen in a huff.) And then the last thing I can remember from the last 30 minutes of the film is this guy's name being called. And then he starts to sing, and he starts singing 'Heaven is a Place on Earth." And it turns out that the song was about the war in Congo. In Africa. (The movie ends at about 45 minutes into it.) 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a nice flick, and the cast is really good.  But they had to make sure it would not get a PG-13 rating.    This is a movie about the death of a man and an investigation into his death.    It's not very interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing that made this movie worth watching was the fact that it was about a kid who got hit by a bus. I was hoping that this movie would get some recognition and maybe give the kids who are suffering from depression some hope by showing them that they aren't the only people in this world who has gone through something similar to what happened to the main character. I hope that a kid like my son who was going through a rough time one day after watching this movie will look back and realize that the real reason that the main protagonist was depressed was that he got hit and it just really hit him right in the feels. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the future it will seem as if all of those movies have been made with CGI technology, and no one will have any idea why it is so hard to tell what is real and what is fake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has a really good idea but it was executed very poorly. It takes you through some cool locations and then you get to see the cast of characters walk through the airport in their underwear while the rest of the movie is filmed from the outside.   The plot to this film is really good but the movie lacks so much tension that it makes you really question what is happening. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was just a cheap attempt at comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is about a serial killer, a serial sex molester and a pedophile with a disability. The movie is so terrible, I have been unable to watch it. There is absolutely nothing good in this movie. The characters are disgusting and unsympathetic. There are so many characters in this film, it is hard to remember them all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a terrible movie.   They have terrible acting, and the acting is terrible.  It made me look at this movie as a total waste of my time.  The action is not impressive, but the dialogues are bad and the movie should not be watched.  A couple of years ago, there was a similar movie called M. Night Shyamalan's "Split", which I loved.  Unfortunately, this movie is just like that movie.   This movie would have been better off in the 90's, or even during the 60's or 50's, when it was a bit better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are looking for a fun movie, go out and see the movie, not the story.  It was boring and boring was what it was, you know this movie was made by a group of people that are too lazy to write a good story. I have not seen a movie in a long time and I am surprised it took them this long to write the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There was no plot, no development and was just the movie that it was supposed to be.   The music was awful and the acting was not good at all.  There were a few scenes that was just so hard to watch and you just felt like you were watching a soap opera. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had to see this movie as the title promised, and it did not disappoint. The acting was great, and this was a film I really looked forward to seeing and thought would be good.   The pacing of the movie was very odd, especially when the girls went to their room. I thought the pacing was going to be different for the movie, but the ending of the film made it seem like something had to happen for the girls to get out of their room at all.  The girls are supposed to be dead and the scene in which they are supposed be dead was very fake. I was really expecting a real "frozen" scene.  I am not really a horror fan, but I really enjoyed this movie.  This is probably the best movie you can watch after you die. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is an embarrassment to American cinema, and American cinema has a bad habit of embarrassing itself, and in this case, that is because of the acting.  The most pathetic actor in the whole film, is Tom Hanks.  He has to do all the lines, and he delivers them with a flat, wooden delivery, like a man who has just gone to bed, and had to sit up all night.  It's even worse when you compare his performance to the man he is supposed to be playing, who was excellent.   I have never heard a better performance from an actor than from Hanks in this movie.  Not even Richard Burton has a better one.  In fact, Burton has his own film that is actually a remake of this movie, in which Burton plays the original lead role.  If Burton was in this, I think he would have done a great job, and not let the director's lack of direction bother him.  I hope Tom Henson or Gene Wilder is making a new movie about this movie someday. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this and the first thing i noticed is that it is very well made. The acting was great and there was no doubt who the bad guy was. The script was well written and the story kept me on the edge of my seat. I would not recommend this movie to someone who has a short attention span. The music, and the sound effects are great. The bad guy in the film was perfect and made me laugh out loud while the good guys were the only ones who showed up at the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie is a complete waste of everyone's time and money and it never should have been made. The film is boring and unoriginal. The special effects are pretty weak and the special effects director had no experience in special effects, I guess because most of the movie is made in Canada or some other Western country.  There are a lot of great movies made in the 60's/70's that you should not waste your time on.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was boring as all get out. I think it is best for kids who aren't into superheroes.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You guys, this is a bad flick. It really shows that this guy is a little overrated as a director and is not one to be believed. The acting is horrible and the acting is bad and the actors, in turn, are not funny or exciting. This was filmed in a warehouse with an endless amount of poor lighting and it shows. There is only one sequence that is funny but it is too small for me to even look at it. I really did not think I would enjoy this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really liked this movie but I couldn't find any other movie I really enjoyed so far.   I don't want to see it again.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I enjoyed the first part of this movie. The actress, Susan Backlinie, was a very nice lady.  I was surprised to hear that she had died on a plane crash.  As I understand it, the plane went down while she was in a small cabin with only the pilot and copilot.  At first, it was believed that she was dead, but the plane made a sudden dive, and she was able to call for help.   This movie is really an urban legend.  You have to be a fairly gullible person to believe it.  The film has no credibility.  There is nothing special about it. It is just a cheap attempt to make a quick buck on the cheap, and a waste of your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping to watch this movie for a laugh with my wife. It was a shame that this movie is really hard to watch, and has terrible acting. A joke is made at the beginning that some guy was a great actor in a bad film. The funny part was that this guy had been the star of this movie and was in it a lot. This movie was just terrible. The plotline was laughable and the acting was horrible. It's a shame this movie was made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like a lot of the movies I've seen. It was kind of nice to see some people make a good movie without a lot too much CGI. The problem is there isn't much in it. The characters are okay but the action isn't really that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I'm not ashamed of it, and I think it's an interesting piece of work. I like the direction the movie took and how they portrayed the drug dealers and their lives. It just didn't work for me in the end. They were a little too obvious and a little flat, I feel they just weren't fleshed out enough, I think there could have been a lot more going on than what we got." "The main reason I haven't seen it is because my cousin lives close by and he wouldn't let me go with him. He's never seen it, but I can promise you that no one in that neighborhood ever saw it. They always think it was a made for TV movie and it was. I don't blame them, but they don't know anything about it."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved this movie.  I got it when I was a teenager.  It was an instant hit with my friends and me.  We would always go back and watch it.  The only thing that I would change about it is the ending.  And the ending is a little too cheesy for me. This movie never got old.  A great time was had by all.  If you liked "The Rock" this is a movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was not a good movie, it did not have any good plot, it was just so badly made and it was not even funny, the actor did not act at all, there was only bad acting from the director and the actors, they just did not do anything, there were some funny scenes but not many of them, I think that if you want to watch a good bad movie it was the best one out there, but it was bad, not bad like bad acting and bad acting did not make a good picture, i was happy to give it a 1 star cause there were so many good movies out there and it did nothing for me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a terrible movie  It would be easy for someone who didn't know anything about boxing to have gotten a ticket to this movie, and if they hadn't then they should have known it was a bad one, because the dialogue is so bad.  The acting and acting as a whole is so amateurish that I think this movie was made by a third grader for a talent show.  A boxing movie in the 80's, with all the bad acting and amateurish acting, would have been a lot better than this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first watched this movie, I had high hopes for it. Then I realized that the director made a terrible mistake. In order to make this movie as long and as boring as possible, he had to have the actors repeat the same line. I think he was trying to use a similar effect as the time he had in a different movie where he filmed the same lines at the same time over and over. It is really tiresome to watch. The acting is good though, because none of the actors really did a terrible job, they just didn't know how to play their parts. I would have preferred a more original story if the director didn't have to waste so much time in doing that kind of thing.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was terrible.   As a huge fan of the movie, this was just not going to work for me.  When the main character, Steve Rogers, comes out of the water to save the world from a giant sea monster, he's accompanied by the other Avengers.  One of them is Natasha Romanoff, and her character was so over the top that it was almost impossible to take her seriously.  The story, written by Mark Millar, did not make any sense.  A giant water monster, a giant submarine, a robot called the Vision, and the Vision fighting each other? How is anyone supposed to take this seriously?  The plot thickens when Steve gets injured in the sea and is whisked off to the hospital to have his face replaced.  After that, a whole group of Avengers get together to stop the robot and the giant monster and they must all be very skilled and special to survive.  In the end, the Avengers lose and the Avengers Mansion is destroyed.  It was too much to take seriously for me, and for the same reason I don't watch superhero movies.  I was not impressed with the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible film in every way.  I'm so tired of seeing this kind of garbage. The writing is bad. The acting is horrible. The plot is awful. The cinematography is awful and is only really shown in some quick shots throughout. The editing is atrocious. The sound is awful in almost every scene. The dialogue is terrible. Even the story has been done before.   The acting isn't even all that bad and it's obvious that they casted some unknown actor.  So why does it look so bad?  The special effects are terrible. They are done in a way that makes the CGI look like it came from a cheapo video game. They do an average job of making it look cheap.  The CGI and creature effects are so bad that it looks like they were done by someone who just came up with a way to hide that this movie took years to make.  At least with most movies this would be a problem but this movie had such poor writing, acting and directing that the effects and special effects completely destroy the overall picture.  To top it off, the sound effects in this movie are also terrible.  For a film that was originally filmed on location in the woods, the movie itself looks like it was made in a video game that someone played.  This is not even good horror or even bad. It's just bad.  In conclusion, if you want some cheapo horror, check out The Thing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a joke, it has no heart. No emotions, no good will, just a lame story.   The acting is bad, most of the actors are not even good in this movie. It seems like they are trying to make a bad film and it's a total disaster. The script is so bad, they should have just cut out all of the lines and done a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a terrible film! What a waste of a good actress like Julia Roberts! She has no personality and her acting sucks! It's one of the worst movies I've seen!   It has some funny parts and good acting, but it really has nothing else! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie will give you nightmares but not much else, just a creepy experience.    The acting in this movie is poor and the actors look very unnatural, not very interesting.  If you want to see some really creepy and creepy movies you have to watch The Haunting.   For me it was a real "scary movie".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a bad film.   The cast has no idea how to act.  They're all bad.  But this was a very, very cheap film. The budget was only a couple of thousand, and the sets were cheap.  This was the result of a group of friends that wanted to "have a laugh" and a manager that didn't care.  There's no acting talent or talent for that matter.  They were supposed to be professional.  The director, Steve Oedekerk, didn't know how to film a movie.  He was just a drunk, and didn't really care about the film.   He also didn't learn any lines during the shooting.  It was all done off camera.  Steve O'D. was on set and would yell something to a character.   But he just yelled it to the wrong actor.  So they tried to film him, but he didn't have a great time.  Also, the music was done by none other than Joe Zawinul.  You'd think that a director would hire a competent composer, but that's not the case with Oedekerk.  In fact, the movie got better once the cast was gone and it had a director and a cast.  I hate to see a poor movie that has only 3 actors get a good release.  At least the cast did some interesting stuff.  When you go to a good movie you expect to see the cast. I really wanted to see how they would work together. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think that the bad movie here is a sign that the good movie that was released earlier in the year will have a decent ending. The action sequences in this movie are nothing that you haven't seen before but the characters, even the good ones, don't seem to have changed much.   It is still a fun action flick and the actors all do a good job. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a terrible movie, and I wish I had never seen it.   I am not going to spoil the movie for you because it was so bad, but it had a scene where one of the kids was sitting on a bench and the other kid, the one that was going to get stabbed was on his back and when he got up to move he noticed that there was a girl sitting on his knees.  There is a scene in the movie where a group of kids are talking to a guy and he is in the bathroom with a gun on him and when they see him, they decide to leave the bathroom and just leave him with them.  He is trying to convince them not to leave him in the woods and they say they were going to go look for him and they just walked out and left him.  They didn't do anything wrong, he never got into a fight, the whole thing was so stupid.  I have no idea who they were, but I think that is the only good thing about it, the terrible acting, and the fact that they all have bad teeth. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a sad fact of life, but no movie deserves a poor review.   I guess that is the only way to go about judging a movie.  I found the acting to be the worst I have ever seen.  And the acting is awful. They all look like they've been in a bad motion picture.  This is a sad, sad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are looking for a thriller with a twist, this is NOT it.  The twist in this movie is that the victim is actually the killer.  This is a bad cop/bad guy movie.  A bad cop movie without a bad guy.   I have seen more bad cop movies in my time than I care to admit.  It's just an over the top thriller with way too many twists.  There are too many characters, way too much to keep track of.  You think you know the main bad guy but then you find out he has an alibi... and then he has a family who can get you a job at a big company... and you don't.  I would like to see the first few minutes of the movie but I would not be able to follow the plot.   Innocent Until Proven Guilty?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am in my late 40's and had never seen "The Man with the Golden Arm" (I do not know its title) until a few years ago. A man who has an arm with a golden arm asks a woman to dance. The girl says "I have seen it many times, but no one ever knows what it is." I then asked to see the movie and was surprised to see a man with a prosthetic arm. It was a bit strange, I guess because it was a horror movie. The acting was terrible, a man who had never been seen in a film before seemed real. I think it was about 10 years before he appeared again, maybe. He did not look like a real man, maybe a model or someone who was a stunt man.  I do not want to be like the people who are offended by something and say "this movie is bad, no wonder I would not want kids to see it". This is a film about the horrors of war and violence and it should be seen by people who want to see horror and gore. I never thought I would have been able to see "The Dark Knight", but "The Devil's Bride" was my first introduction to horror. I was able to make out the man in the mask from my aunt's house in Canada. It is a great film with a disturbing story. This movie had a little too much violence and gore, but that is a movie for older audiences. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie and thought that it was a great horror film that took place in the 60's where a group of kids were sent to a small town and it seemed like a fun day. The only problem is that it is all fake and nothing could really happen. The special effects were a little too much and that's why the film failed. I would have given it a better rating if the special effects weren't so terrible.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a complete waste of time. The movie is badly made. The plot is made by a non-actress who does not know how to act. There are no real characters or characters that you like or dislike. There is just some silly lines that have no meaning and a bad screenplay.   I hate to say it, but this is the worst movie I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie does have a plot, but it's all a lot of fluff. We are treated to a ridiculous romance between a blonde, very hot girl (Jennifer Aniston), and a hot guy (Jon Bon Jovi) who is supposed to be her fiance. It's a story about a girl who is really into him and how she pretends to date him in order to get into the big time. I never saw this movie and I can't say whether this is a movie I'd see. I was pretty bored while watching it and didn't really care if the girl had the guy, so she is never mentioned again. There was a pretty good romantic comedy at one point, but other than that, this movie just doesn't work for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It is bad enough to make you want to put a bomb through your TV set. It makes you want it all to go away.   If you are looking for a bad flick to watch with a bunch of your friends and want to watch a movie about a bunch who are getting old and not much of an attractive couple, then go watch this one.  Why I don't see it coming:  I thought the movie was going to be funny. I thought I was going in to a comedy. I was not even looking forward to watching this movie. But, it turned out to be the worst bad movie I ever seen in my life.  If I am a guy who is in his 40's or 50's and I have never had a problem with anything and I'm a man who likes to drink, smoke and have fun with my friends. Then, this movie made me realize that all my friends have got a problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst horror movie I have ever seen.  The movie is horrible.   There are so many things wrong with this movie.  Firstly, the production values and story are completely wrong.  They wanted to make a movie out of this old tale but it is so cheesy.  This movie is so bad that it's hard to watch.  If you have never heard of this story, I advise you to look it up, it is a true story.  I wish this movie could have been made 50 years ago, it would have been so much better.  It would have had a more serious look to it and it would also have had more characters and more gore.  A true masterpiece from the old Hollywood.  You can't make a better movie than this one.  - - -   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was in awe of the production for such a young movie. For the first 10 minutes I was really impressed, but it quickly faded. The acting was terrible and I felt it was forced, and they didn't even try to hide it. When this film came out in the late 80's there wasn't a lot of good 80's movies made, and this is pretty much the only thing that came out that year.   This is very different from the other 80's films, and is an interesting movie to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie before it came out, and I really enjoyed it! I thought the film was funny and well acted, although the acting isn't great. But the director does a great job in getting a good tone. I thought it was an appropriate film to watch when I'm bored with my life and want something good to happen.   This was a film I never saw.  I think I saw it on the radio or something.  This movie was good, but not as good as the first film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has really bad acting. The people are not very likable. There are several scenes where I thought, "who is this??"  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film isn't that bad but in all honesty, it doesn't stand out from other mediocre movies made by the same producer. It doesn't have much of a story to speak of and all of the characters are bland and uninteresting.   I'm giving it a 3/10 for being a 2 hour movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first part of the movie really is a little dull and boring. When the movie goes off into a very interesting chase scene, that is what makes it better. The movie is really short and the story could have been extended to about 2-3 hours. The ending of the film is a bit weird and hard to follow.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My mom and her friends all loved the movie and thought it was one of their favorite movies.   A friend of mine who never liked horror films gave this movie a great rating and it got great reviews and sold out of theaters for years.  I don't even remember when I saw the movie, but it was either before I was born or about the same time.    I thought the movie was okay and I didn't really care for anything in it.  The story seemed to be trying to be too complicated for the plot of the movie to work.  Most of the time they were not even able to explain where the hell they were at.  A lot of the people they were fighting were zombies and in the end it only got weirder and weirier.  If you are into zombie movies you might enjoy this movie.  But for me I would have been bored by the movie. I don\'t remember what it was about, but maybe it was just a bad remake of a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie sucks... The acting is the worst of the best and you are supposed to believe all the lies and people are lying to each other but who are you kidding? It's so wrong and has no credibility...  It was a great idea but it's so stupid that it's ridiculous... I want people to look it up but I don't want to give this movie a second of my time because I hate it so much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A good movie from the 1980s and a fun one to watch for the fun times.   If the director would have cut the sexual content down a bit, it could have been a great movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never really liked this movie as much as my sister, who is a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy. This one is really bad, I just didn't like it and that's why I didn't enjoy it that much.   If you like space opera, this movie is worth seeing, but if you don't like space operas then just don't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never wanted to see this movie and I have never been this excited for a movie.   The entire plot was wrong the first time I saw it, and I was actually really happy when they finally made a sequel.  After seeing the first version of the movie I would never want to see the remake.  It was like a complete waste of a great film.  I hope for the film to be as good as the first one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has no story line. The movie is made by an actor who cannot act and he makes a terrible movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been watching a lot of bad horror movies and this one is no exception. The actors do not seem to be having fun and I felt like they were playing the roles for the sake of doing so. The scary parts were all unnecessary and very obvious.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main character has no life, no personality, no depth.   What was his purpose in life?  He was a spy!  How was he supposed to live?  Was there a reason for his existence?  And his "job" was a suicide mission?    His character is extremely contrived.    The entire movie makes no sense.  The movie is not worth a second look.  The plot doesn't even make sense.   The acting is terrible.  How can one person be so bad at acting and get away with it for 3 hours in the most generic film ever?  It's just pathetic!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so looking forward to seeing this movie, that I didn't really care about it. It was one of those movies that just seems to drag on forever and that has always been a bummer.   This movie is so slow and boring, and it took me over 20 minutes to get the point where I could go see a good movie again, and that wasn't a very good movie either.  Even the director doesn't really have anything going for him, the acting was all terrible, and the actors are just not great, or good enough.  They were just there, waiting for the camera to capture a shot of their character in the most awkward way possible.  All the acting is bad, and you really get the feeling that if they were trying to be funny or dramatic, they wouldn't have made it as bad as they did.  And you really can't get into this movie at all, and with all the pacing problems it makes it almost impossible to have a great time.  As a movie, this is a complete waste of time, and I'm glad I didn' watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't know what to expect.   This was a movie I wanted to like, but that didn't make it any better.  The acting was fine and the acting was great.  They didn't pull any punches.  It was a simple story.  But at least it was a fun movie.  I wouldn't mind a remake of this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is awful. The acting is terrible, the dialogue is terrible and the story is ridiculous. The movie starts with a man that got kicked off his motorcycle for riding without wearing a helmet and then it shows the guy that invented the motorcycle in the beginning of the movie. The bad guy then meets some thugs that he thinks are his friends, but when he is taken to the place where the motorcycles are kept, he finds out that he is not the one that invented it. The thugs take him to a big prison and they force him to work for them. The plot is just a bunch of stupid stuff. I wouldn't have believed a movie about a motorcycle gang if this movie had not showed me a picture of one. Then it shows them doing stupid things and getting in huge fights and then one guy falls down and his head comes out. It was really funny to watch. But it was even funnier that this movie is trying to be a action movie. It has no action, no action at all. It just follows all the stupid things the bad guys do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to the theater, and this is the only thing I wanted to see. The movie is full of bad acting, poorly edited scenes, and the worst movie ending I have ever seen.    The movie goes from bad to worse when the people in the film get attacked by a group of people and their dog. I think this movie would have been better off if it had been a short horror movie with a good ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's pretty bad for a film to suck, but this movie does it with such a horrible film that makes me sick. I guess it was a movie that was being shown in a theater, but it's not going to be seen in the future and this was just too bad.   If you watch this movie and laugh, you are a moron. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, it is a movie about the Battle of the Somme.  It was made in 1938, so there is not much about the war to see.  And it does not even try to do anything interesting in that area.  I could not think of a movie which I found more boring.  The camera stays in the same position on every soldier.  We see no close-ups, no moving soldiers.  Nothing about the weather, or any other thing of interest.  They try to show us the German and the British on the battlefield, and when the movie is over, all we see is the back of the soldier's head and the background.  Very poor acting.  Even the voice acting is lacking.  Most of the movie seems like it is meant to be a lecture on the war.  But it is not.  Not the slightest effort is made to try and convey any of that to the audience.   If you are looking for a movie that tells us how bad the British are, this is the one for you.  Don't bother with the rest.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm afraid that this is going to be a huge disappointment. I'll start off by saying that it is well-shot. Unfortunately it's just a terrible movie. I think that the director is a great actor and the movie is good. The only thing that it really has is one "hot girl" with a very fake personality. It was supposed to be about a man trying to lose his virginity to the same girl who he met the night before, but it really was only a ruse. The movie is so badly written that it just ends up as an extremely lame movie. The acting is terrible, and it ends up with a bad girl getting revenge on the guy who really should have been her first experience with sex. It makes me think that he got her pregnant. I'm sorry, but I wouldn't want to be in that situation. The sex scenes in this movie are just horrible. The girl is so fat that it's painful to see her. The worst sex scene ever in a movie is when the guy fucks her mouth and she's talking while his dick is inside of her. I can't stand this movie at all.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story was pretty good. It was interesting. It wasn't my favorite movie. It didn't have enough going for it to keep my interest.    I've heard of the director, David Cronenberg, but I've never seen his work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie because I had read about it. I was disappointed. There is nothing special about the story or characters. There were no memorable dialogs, or action scenes, or anything. I suppose this movie is made to be a joke for kids who like the color blue. However, kids and adults alike will be laughing at the color-coded characters in this movie, and they are all blue!   I think the actors are overacting in this.   This movie is so bad I really don't know what to say about it, other than that I wish they made this movie for children and adults to see, because no one who watches this movie ever forgets it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters are pretty annoying, but it wasn't meant to be.  The action scenes are okay and it's got some of the best shots I've seen in an action film.   It's hard to watch, but I don't think it's a bad thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can say with confidence that this movie is a complete and utter failure. Not only was the film terrible, it was made by the same people that brought us the original Star Trek. I can't believe they even bother anymore. I really, really don't care about their other movie productions, so why bother making such a waste of time? The actors are not funny, the acting is horrible, the music is really cheesy, and the set design is just awful. It's just a complete waste of everyone's time and money.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you enjoy shitty comedies then by all means see this movie. But I really don't recommend it. The plot is pathetic. I found the humor to be lame, and the characters to be uninteresting. I have seen way worse movies, and this one is at the bottom. I won't be seeing any of this shit.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a good idea to do a "dramatization" of the story of The Great Depression. But the story was very poor. In fact, the acting was horrible. Even the two "star" actors in the movie - and they did very little - were really not believable. I thought the film was just an excuse to do some really bad acting. This was a very bad idea.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When this movie was originally released I was quite surprised. It was a good movie and I even liked it but I felt that it was not of a high enough quality. It didn't have the right atmosphere or atmosphere it was a farce but I was expecting more from this movie.   I had trouble believing that this movie could have such a terrible rating but it does. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was bad. The only part that really made it worth watching was the ending, but even that was a little underwhelming.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is just as I expected it to be.   There are some decent special effects that aren't used very often.  For what it's worth, there is some pretty good acting and they are all at the same time good.  It has a pretty good screenplay.  The story line is decent and it doesn't go off on a different road than the one that the previous movie went on.  I will say this movie has an unfortunate ending.  This movie could have been good but they really didn't finish the movie off right.  And they used the wrong actors.  There were so many great roles in this movie and they used some of the better ones.  So for what it was worth, the movie should not be watched. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not a good movie, it is not even entertaining, I was so bored watching it that I threw my food to the ground and walked out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film was fun, but the story is lame. A man kills himself by jumping off a building, his wife has him placed on life support. Two days later he's discovered on the ground and the film then cuts to an autopsy.   I had to stop watching the film due to the lack of creativity in the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie i ever saw   I watched this movie for like 3 hours and i dont recommend it  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I remember watching this movie at an early age as a kid and being fascinated with it's action and violence. I always thought it was amazing how cool and original the movie looked and was. I remember that I had a hard time putting the movie down once I was done watching it and being in awe of how awesome it looked and played. I had no idea it was a fake movie though until later when I was looking into it on the net and learned that it was not.   This movie is one of those "great movies that have been made but the remake is awful" kind of things. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending of this movie is so predictable that I am speechless. I mean, the movie doesn't make any sense and it ends in the same way.  I am glad I watched this film as a teenager, it is my favorite of all the John Boorman movies and it gave me a very happy childhood. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After seeing a preview of this movie I knew I was in for something interesting and something I wouldn't want to miss. As the preview stated it was an "Empire Strikes Back" look at the story of a young man from a broken home that is being turned upside down by the politics of the times. I was surprised to see it was more than that. This is one of those movies where you realize it's more than just a movie and you begin to realize the people in the movie are more than your average Joe or Jane. In a way they are the people you would want to spend time with. I feel like I watched an episode of "The West Wing". Even though the story was very good. I didn't care for the direction. This one was too much on the emotional side and not enough on the story. I thought I had seen this one before but I sure as hell didn't want it to end.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a huge fan of The Shining and had heard of the book series that was written by Stephen King. When I saw The Shining on video I loved it. However I read the book a couple of years before I saw the movie so I was expecting a more accurate adaptation. I still thought the movie was great but there were a few flaws in it. The book was a lot more accurate. When the characters meet Jack Torrance he is acting like a psychotic but you can't tell because they don't use makeup. When they find their daughter in the lake he is not acting like the old Jack I remembered. Jack was a very strong man before he was abused. There are a few places in the book where they are shown as being abused but they were not shown in the movie. The movie had a couple scenes that were not in the novel, however they did not detract from the movie and were more like an added layer of color and atmosphere. There was a scene where a policeman is trying to arrest Jack and is shot but he is still in control and can do no wrong. Also when the camera pans up to the window Jack is not on the other side of the glass and the people are not looking at him, they are looking away because of him. There is a lot of subtle details that the movie failed to take advantage of. Overall the movie is a good adaptation of the novel but not good enough to redeem it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this film because it was nominated for the "Best New Release" award. I went in knowing that it was a "cult" film but I didn't expect this much bad acting, dialogue, or direction. I thought this was made by people who had seen some great stuff in the 70's. This is not a "classic", but it has a lot of charm. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have watched this film several times. The actors were bad, the acting was bad and the cinematography was bad. I know it's supposed to be a western and the actors were supposed to act the way they did. That's not how a Western is supposed to work, even in the early days of the genre. The violence in the film was just a waste of time. It was over-the-top and not realistic at all. The music was horrible. It didn't fit the time period. This was a movie in the 1930's, not the 21st century.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you want to see something really amazing, go see this movie. A real life story in a real life setting.   It is definitely worth the price. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the late 60's when the Vietnam war was heating up I saw this movie.   A war movie about a GI fighting a war.  It looks great in black and white but when viewed in color it looks like an amateurish throw back.  There were two soldiers in the movie that were played by the same actor so they look alike.  They are wearing combat fatigues and are carrying assault rifles.  The rest of the movie was full of dialogue that is too long and uninteresting.  There were about 15 minutes of dialog.  No war film was longer than a 30 minute or an hour.  I would have rather seen a movie that was based on a true story about a young man that got lost and ended up in Vietnam. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film was interesting, but I thought that it lacked depth and that the director didn't have a good grasp on the characters.   Overall, I didn't enjoy the movie, and didn't want to re-watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I saw this movie in theaters, I thought to myself, "Oh, a little romantic comedy with an A+ cast."  Well, I guess that wasn't the case.  They had a few interesting scenes, but they were all pretty small and never really worked.  The acting was atrocious.  I just didn't get what was going on.   I never really understood why the character would go out of his way to look for a girl, when he was so much more interested in her and his life (at least in the film).  This would have been more effective if it had focused more on how he thought about his relationship with his daughter (in the film she is a co-conspirator), but instead we got a lot of scenes about him looking for a girlfriend.  What was he thinking?   Why does he want a girlfriend when he is married?  What is the point of his search if she isn't going to be around forever?  The movie is only funny if the main character is trying to find a girlfriend who isn't around.  This movie is just so poorly written that it never really takes off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know where to start with this movie. It was terrible. I'm trying to think of a single good thing that happened to this movie and I can't find it. The acting was very bad. The story was boring. The whole cast did a horrible job. I would have liked to see a little bit more character development on some of the characters, but they didn't really show their inner emotions at all. It also really sucked to watch this movie, because it felt like they didn the movie for the money. I don't recommend this movie for anyone, because the acting sucks.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is okay but it is too long and there is little action and there are some characters that are not very important in the movie. There is not a good ending and the ending makes it more confusing than it should have been.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is very poor. I am not saying the movie is bad as it looks and sounds great but the actors are terrible. They had terrible lines and had no character to them and were very bad. I felt like I was watching a bad video game movie.    A lot of bad movies are about the evil or evil looking people. I don't see that in this movie. There is no evil at all and only a bunch of people that are doing bad things. There are plenty of people in this world that are good and good people do not kill or torture other people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst thing in the world is when people give good reviews to bad movies just because they got paid to do so. I'll admit it, there's probably something about a certain film that makes people not like it, and it's definitely not because it's bad. The reason I'm going on about this is because this film is a little piece of crap. The acting in this film was pathetic and the story was as terrible as the acting. The music was also absolutely horrendous, so much so that it made the scenes I was in in this movie completely pointless. If you really like the music in this and other films, maybe check out the songs on the back of the soundtrack, like "I Believe" or "I've Always Loved" by a group called Nardwuar.   I'm pretty sure that this film should be banned from theaters because of it's complete lack of quality and the fact that they paid for it and had it made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible! It is terrible in every way. The actors did not look like they were having fun or enjoying themselves. They just seemed to have no idea how to act and the scenes are just awful. This movie had no action, no tension or good acting. It was just horrible to watch. The characters are so awful it is scary. The writing is just so bad it is hard to believe that anyone wrote this crap. They should have found someone that knew how to write a script!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is the worst movie i ever saw. it just felt like it was made just to mess with people who liked the movie.   it really made me mad that they would do a sequel just to make money. they could have made a decent movie instead of this and it would have been fine.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a very disappointing film, the story was good, the actors were good. There was a part where the main character is on a plane with a very old person (a great acting performance by Robert De Niro, he reminded me of Gene Hackman in Hackman's "Major League") and he and the old person were playing pool and he just kept saying "He's getting old".   The other part was when they go to this big building that was supposed to be the headquarters of a secret society, and they're going to find out what is going on.   It was like when you're watching a very bad movie and you think they're making money off of it, but they're really trying to fool you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie takes place in one of the worst neighborhoods in the United States, and we do see a lot of it.   I was really hoping that the film could have been more of a commentary on the dangers of poverty and the problems of inner-city drug addiction.  I just think that the movie made all the wrong decisions to make this a good movie.  It makes every action a mistake that gets the main character killed.  The main character also acts really out of character.  But at least the ending of the movie has a happy ending.  That was pretty much the only good thing about this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing about this movie was how it showed me that we are human and we have emotions.   As soon as i finished watching the film i felt really sad.  This movie didn't made me feel like i had been through something, it made me sad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I haven't seen this movie yet, and for a long time I thought I knew what this was about. My boyfriend and I were walking down the street, and I heard a scream and turned to see an old woman being beaten. The cops rushed in to help, and when they handcuffed the old lady she tried to get up and attack the cops. The police were just standing there watching. I don't even think that was enough to make me think this movie was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie I have seen in a long time.   It is a typical bad movie where the story is boring and the acting is so bad and annoying.  I really can't believe how bad this movie is.  At least this movie had a good acting and a good plot.  The director is a horrible director.  He doesn't know how to use his actors, he doesn't understand how to make a film interesting.  It has no idea what it is trying to do and it just wastes time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had heard about this film for years but thought it was made in the late 1960s because of its subject matter. When I saw it at an open house, I was stunned by how bad it was. I would not recommend this film to anyone. It's very unoriginal and really just a cheap exploitation film. The acting is really bad, especially from the actors and all of the sex is pretty unrealistic.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So... this movie is all about the kids playing hide and seek and the old man that wants to have the children and catch them. I don't think that that's a good idea.   The only reason the movie is decent is because they have to show a fight scene and they get a real good stunt man to do it.  The children have nothing to do with it except to be scared and run from the old guy.  If you're going to use a children in a horror movie, at least do them right.  It's just sad to see all these kids in a movie and none of them has much to do.  There are no adults in this movie.  Even though there were kids in this, they were all older than the kids.  I mean, the kids don't age or anything and in the first five minutes, they are acting like children.  They were all so old that you could hear them breathing and moaning like the old lady that has them.  This movie is so bad and it's so sad that a director would do this.  Why would you make a movie like this?  It just makes me sad.  Not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible movie, but i didn't understand it at first. The characters aren't interesting, i think the lead actress looks a lot like a model (i never thought about it before).  The story is pretty bad. It takes too long to get to the good part. The story about a man who lost everything and wants to be a good person is so sad and the movie doesn't make it any better. If you want to see a bad film, you don't go to this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One bad movie...   A lot of things happened in this movie.   The story was pretty good, but the acting was horrible.  The director should have gotten a real actress to play the role.  I guess it wasn't all that important to get the actor right.  A young woman (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is supposed to be an aspiring writer.  This woman has an attitude of contempt for everyone around her, yet it is never clear to me why.  There are many good scenes in the movie, but most of them are a waste of time.  All in all, the movie is very average.  I give it an "okay" rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie twice and both times I liked the movie, and I liked this movie even better. It had some flaws but I liked those flaws. It wasn't very good, but at least it was interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is about a little boy with a crush on a little girl. He falls in love with her, and her parents don't approve.   As for the story, it is poorly written. There is no tension or urgency, there is no real story, and even the characters don't feel like they are having a real story.  There is one scene in the movie when the little girl gets into a car and they go out to play. The little boy comes back home, and we learn that the little boy's father has died in a car accident. So it is a little later than when it should be, and the little sister is still playing with the little boys car and it isn't his. The movie feels very forced and unrealistic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was going to watch this for a movie night a few weeks ago and my brother asked what it was about. I told him that it's a really bad movie with a really poor acting cast. He said, "Well, we'll try it one night, huh?"  This is such a terrible movie. The writing is very bad, the acting is bad, and the plot is just awful.  The main character is named Tandy, a young girl whose friend (played by Linda Hamilton) has been kidnapped by an evil group called the Syndicate. She ends up in a group of boys she's never met before, who are all playing a video game called "Halo".  The only problem with this movie is that it was supposed to be a spoof of the Halo video games. They even had the actors do some of the "Hollywood" voices for the characters. I know this is the 80s, but it would have been better to make this a real movie like Star Wars or Indiana Jones.   The cast of this movie are terrible. There is nothing funny about these actors. I can't tell you how many times I thought that one of these kids was the lead in a different movie. You just never get the impression that these kids were acting, or even thinking like actors.  You can tell that all of the actors are trying their hardest, but the production value isn't up to par.  I'll definitely go out of my way to watch some other movie, because this one really doesn't do anything right. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really wanted to like this movie, but the worst thing is that it is an over-exaggerated, bad, and cheesy love story.   The plot is like something out of an old, bad movie.  The actors are a bunch of actors with the least amount of talent I have ever seen.  All of the female characters are pretty much just there to get the actor's looks.  They all have the same clothes on, and have very short careers.  Also, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.  It is a love story that happens to have the most unnecessary characters in the world, all of them have the biggest "love interest" in the whole movie.    It makes me sick that a movie with such a bad premise and such an unprofessional cast can even get a theatrical release.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending was great and the special effects were awesome. I liked the characters and they were all really good. But it was really cheesy.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing I would like to have seen is more footage of the various scenes in which they make people stand by and do nothing. The worst thing about it is that they actually show the audience what they are doing to the "protestors". The only person that is making any sense is that guy who is doing the "anti-government" chant with the megaphone.   It's a very amateurish and poorly acted movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "Beneath an impenetrable cloak of self-parody, a shabby-looking crew, an overbaked director and an overbearing, irritatingly un-charismatic leading man, lurks a melodramatic, pathetic attempt to make a bad film good.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was so bad that I can't believe that it even got made.   A lot of the actors are very good but the acting is pretty terrible.  My only gripe is that the script was terrible. The only good part of this movie is that some of the scenes do look great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie starts with a lot of scenes of poor quality and bad acting. Some are not even good acting. They try to make a big "come on" with an old joke and the rest is a mess. I was so frustrated when the jokes didnt even make sense and I kept saying "they are trying to make fun of that". Some scenes were so bad and not funny that you can't even laugh. You just want to hit the movie and scream at it. This is the worst movie I have ever seen!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible.   You get this cheesy horror movie with the wrong actors playing the roles.  In all honesty, I would have much preferred something like the horror film "The Thing" from the 60's or early 70's.    It was very good but you could tell there were a few actors who were not very good at playing the parts.  They were trying their best but it just didn't work.  I just didn' t enjoy the movie and didn't want to watch it any more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so excited for this movie and I can honestly say it didn't live up to my expectations. I loved the character of Max and I loved this movie when I was a kid but when I got to watch it now I was surprised that it was nothing like it was when I watched it as a kid. The CGI and the sound effects really ruin the movie for me. The film doesn't even have enough special effects to hold it's own and it's obvious why this movie was so terrible.   A little more editing could have really saved this movie from being so terrible but it's not like there's a whole lot to see and the movie ends up being just another excuse for an old sci-fi movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film starts out with an impressive prologue. The opening credits to the film are really impressive. They take you through the history of some people who have been around for hundreds of years, and explain why they are there. This prologue is followed up by an action scene. The only problem is that the action scene is way to long and they drag it out. The film then starts off with a police chase. The chase is quite short and only lasts 2 minutes. I wasn't really impressed by this chase. I know this is a police drama, but it really does seem to drag on. The rest of the film is more or less the same. A bunch of people are running around. The whole film is very dull. It takes up most of the time, and has very little to do with the history they are talking about.  Posted by Matt at 7:13 AM Hey guys, Matt here. This is an early review of a movie I saw at the movie theater. I thought it would be fun to try to capture the look of the movie in one picture. The movie was shot on 16mm, so this is just what I saw. I had a fun time watching it with friends, but I think the whole film had some problems. This was my first movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My god, they could do a much better job! They got a bunch of actors together, but none of them did anything special. It's like watching one of those reality shows where the camera is all over the place. They couldn't do better. I think they should have hired some real professionals to be their cameramen. I thought it was a pretty awful show.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is interesting and not for the squeamish. But the acting is bad. And the actors are not even that good. They are trying to look as serious as possible while talking on the phone and trying to be funny. The film has no plot. All the characters just wander around and talk about nothing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think this film, with its awful script and cheesy acting, is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I know it's supposed to be an edgy film with lots of sex and sexiness, but there are so many glaring errors, especially for the time period. The movie opens up with a group of people drinking at a bar and talking about the upcoming big movie they're going to see. But it's just some sort of lame "tribute to old B-grade sci fi." In fact, we soon see a bunch of actors in costumes that don't really seem to match their characters. Then there's a whole gang of sexy actors in leather outfits (that look more like they're making a fetish film or something), and they're all talking about how much they want to be in the movie. Then some of the more serious characters go to see the movie and they start showing clips. It seems the film tries to get over the edgy thing by making it look like it's a parody of the "good old days." That's when we hear the news that they're canceling the movie, and the guy in the leather suit goes off and leaves. We later see a woman who is a sex slave with this guy, who looks nothing like the man in the costume. And all of this time the people at the bar are talking about this old, cheesy movie, when all of the sudden the man comes back and kills them all and leaves his costume somewhere. I don't think this movie has much of anything going for it, or if it does it's not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't watch this movie at the first time and didn't know anything about it but I saw it again on the big screen and it's still really bad!   It's very boring, unoriginal and uninspired.   The only thing good about the movie is the ending, which I think is funny, but not in a good way.  The bad parts are very repetitive, especially in the beginning.  You'll be watching it over and over again.  It has some good points, but it's really bad.  Maybe there is a second part or an extra but I guess that isn't worth a movie.  I hope the writer can't make a third movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was boring and hard to enjoy.   I had no interest in this movie.  The acting and plot are not good at all.  I did not see this movie at all until I saw a copy on ebay.  It is so long and not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was not into it at all.  When I first heard about this movie, I said that I would like to see it if the plotline didn't involve any of these famous "slangin' " people. When it came time to see this film, I was shocked to find that the movie actually contained much of the slang of its own people and was not really meant for us.  What a shame!   The actors didn't seem to be too good and the plot was not worth the time of a minute.   It was fun, but did not deserve a star rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think it's one of the greatest movies ever made. The acting was amazing, the songs were great, and the story is amazing. However, it's a movie that can only be seen in the theatre, not in my house. There's a lot of violence in this movie and there are some scenes that are disturbing. It's definitely not for the young ones. It will make you think about life and death, and will bring you to tears in a way only films can.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A lot of people are going to hate this movie, because it's a remake. And it's pretty much a remake of a movie that already exists.   Well, that's what you get when you remake a movie from the 80's. So, that movie that was remade is just like a clone of the movie.  The new actors and the script aren't the best.  And the acting is really, really bad.  I think they could have gone with some more original characters.  Like, how about, the main character's daughter and the main characters' daughter are the same age and look the same.  This might have been a good movie, if the actors did better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My friend and I came to see this movie because we were just looking for something to entertain us in the middle of the week.  The movie was not entertaining and did not bring us anything new or exciting.  We were watching it because it was a movie from the 70s and the soundtrack was very good.  I felt that I had seen this movie hundreds of times, but this was just another bad experience.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie a few years back. My mom gave it to me and when i saw it, i thought it was terrible. Now, i would have had no problems at all, if they didn't put a bunch of porno stars in it, plus the guy was a total loser, but, they had to put him in it because he was so hot and the rest of the girls were so unnoticeable, i didn't even notice them. I'm sure they got more money from this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was way better than it had any right to be.

I don't know why people complain about this movie but it was very entertaining, very original and funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So, the first time I ever watched it, I got a good laugh out of this one.  The guy who played the bad guy is pretty funny.  He's a big, goofy guy that has the voice and body of a fat guy.  It was a lot of fun watching him play the part, but it's always good to watch someone else do it.  As for the rest of the cast, I didn't even know most of them!  They are all good, and some of them did really well, so the film is probably not going to disappoint anybody.  I'm not sure why people are upset by it, but I thought this was a really good film!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a very un-amusing movie, with one of the worst actors I've ever seen in a big budget movie. They were so far from funny that the script didn't even bother to get the actors out of the way and let them have some fun, and it just kind of ran along in the same direction, with the same actors all acting the same way. The movie was very boring, and the special effects were very bad, which was also bad since the movie was not well made. I don't recommend this movie for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has so much potential. The plot is a bit hard to follow, and the performances aren't up to the level of the other performances. It feels like the director tried to do too much, but it ends up being a very forgettable movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a movie that I really had to see in theaters, in a theater full of other people. I am usually ok with movies, but this one wasn't a good movie.   It was very dull and not a lot of energy. The only thing that made this one a decent movie was some acting, and the other was bad acting.  In the end, I was not impressed and I had to turn the movie off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The biggest thing wrong about this movie is the acting. The lead is really bland and the guy who plays his part is a real douchebag. The guy who actually had to play the lead role, has been in enough movies to know what he wants but this is not one of them.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is NOT a film that needs to be seen to be believed. This film is a compilation of the worst movie moments. It's so bad that you can't help but laugh at it. The movie is a collection of terrible things that were filmed, edited and then released into the market place. The worst scene in the film is when a man goes to the toilet, while holding his wife's head under the water, and pulls it out. This was a really bad scene to be released into our market place in 1978. The second worst scene is when another man is trying to pull the woman's head out from the toilet. The scene was recorded at some point and only a few days before it was put out in the market. The actors in this movie should be ashamed of themselves.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film had a lot of potential, but it was ruined by an obvious attempt at shock value. A story that has the potential to be really great is instead reduced to a very bad and contrived one.   It is clear that the filmmakers are very inexperienced. This is a film about a drug addict who has had a very tough life, and who is in prison because he has broken the law. This idea sounds a lot more interesting than what actually happens in the film. It is not like he is put in a cage and is just left there for some reason. No. He is in a big cage with some very scary inmates who have been convicted of heinous crimes against people. He gets out for good, but then he gets picked up again and the story becomes about him and his family trying to escape prison. This movie tries to show us this kind of life of a prison inmate, but all it does is give us a very one-sided story and try to make us feel bad for him.  I really was hoping this film would have something more to it, but the attempt at the shock value did it no good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a lot of stupid stuff going on in this movie, and the acting is even worse. This movie is basically a disaster. I know the guy who played the father (Holt McCallany) was in a lot worse movies than this, but this movie makes me wish he was dead. Also the actors in this are just...there. They're not likable or even likable enough.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's an absolutely atrocious movie, so much so that a lot of people have said that they felt as if they were watching a cheap "movie".   I was really hoping that it would be a pretty good film, but as far as "bad" movies go, I thought it was a really bad one.   The story is so bad, so badly written, and the acting is so terrible, I was truly hoping that something good would come out of this movie.  When I first saw this movie, I didn't know whether to laugh, or to cringe.  The only good thing that I saw in this movie was that at one point, the screenwriters actually tried to tell a very simple story.  But the poor writing is all that saved this movie for me.  It was absolutely unbelievable.  Not only does this movie have the worst script ever, but even worse is the acting, because everyone really looks like they're trying their best to act like idiots.  This movie was a total embarrassment to the "Star Wars" franchise, and it was such a waste of a perfectly good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know what was in that vodka, it just made a bad film.   You don't have to be an expert on the films of Charlie Chaplin, but this one is just plain awful. Chaplin has the most talented film-makers of any film-maker ever, but he had to be the worst film- maker of his time. It's the worst thing he ever made and that says it all.  - June 22, 2012This one was bad  Reviewer: peterp - favorite favorite favorite - October 5, 2010  Subject: Great film but... I think I like the great performances of Chaplin (Dorothy Lamour) and Gable (Eddie Adams) a little better than this film (it is an excellent film). The problem here is that the script was awful. I am not even sure why it was made (aside from the sheer greed of the studio) - it is almost laughably bad. It starts off with a pretty good set of scenes (including a couple of Chaplins funny shorts). The scenes with the young boy and his family are very touching. Then the acting completely falls apart. A number of the characters are simply silly and have no sense of purpose. (one character does nothing except talk) They all seem to have the same idea of what they are doing. They are all acting like they have a right to talk, and if not, it makes the audience feel sorry for them. This film would not be good if the actors were good (which they don't seem to be) but I give it 2 stars for what it has going for it. It would probably be better if it was a complete comedy and they only acted like they had a right not to be filmed. - October 2, 2010Great film but...  ...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My boyfriend and I watched this movie twice with him. Both times we were totally bored by it. I mean, it's not that we didn't like it. We just were really disappointed in it. It was a movie that I didn't even care about to begin with.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The main reason I was a fan of this was because it is a horror movie and it is very disturbing and scary. I do not know why but it made me cry and I do believe that if you watch this movie the first time, you will have an even worse reaction the second time you watch it, and I believe this is a great horror movie but it is just very confusing and hard to understand at times. The acting is very good but it does not have any intensity or good characters. I really wish they would have put more of the actors in this movie because it does have a good cast but it did get very confusing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember when this movie was released on DVD. I remember the trailer and I loved it. The movie looked pretty good to me. Unfortunately, I didn't find this movie in the theatres. I thought I saw it on TV somewhere. I was happy about that, and then I saw this movie on VHS. I had no idea what was going on. The bad guys were not very impressive.   My kids were very disappointed in this movie. I gave it two stars because I really liked the trailer for this movie and I thought the movie would be better than it turned out to be.

The first 3/4 of the movie are just some kind of scene change thing where the kids are trying to get to the beach and stuff. After that the girls started yelling a lot and just got real mean. By the end the director had me running for the door. If you want to see some really mean girls try to scream and have sex with each other then go for it. I don't have a problem with that as I just find it kinda annoying.    I don't remember much about this movie. We had an early screening and it had a very short running time. The girl in the beach chair did not have an actual character but was acting all the time.  She is supposed to be some kind old witch. We saw her with two other witches, one was older and had short black hair, and the other was young and thin with big brown eyes. The younger witch was actually a guy. The older witch was older but just looked older because she didn't look like a witch that would be older than 10.  The movie had some really annoying parts where the other witches would talk back at her. They also had a weird little thing where they would put on the "S" on their chests when they were going to talk.  At one point the girl's dad was standing near them, but when she came closer the dad ran away.  A girl who looked a lot like me was in it. My friend thought she was really cute but the director kept getting mad at her for not acting or acting right. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is about two men from the south who are in trouble in the city of New York. A drug dealer is trying to get to the south, and he has a friend from the north who he asks to help him by getting him out of trouble. The only problem is that the friend is a real coward who is scared of getting shot.   As he is driving the two men make a desperate plan. They take the drugs and run, and are caught the next day.  The drug dealer gets a big bonus as long as he takes the guy.  They both plead for leniency, but the judge only offers them one year of time in jail.  This movie should be watched by all men, or women who are afraid of getting into a life of crime, for if it is seen by a woman it will frighten her.  It is not a good movie, but a very interesting one.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked this movie. I did enjoy watching it at times. It was pretty good. It had a decent pace.   The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack and the acting.  There were times when they were doing something on a television. It sounded so much like the actual TV show.  I hope they make this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an extremely bad movie. The acting is bad and the movie is badly written. If you are looking for a good old fashioned horror movie, look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In this movie, the only way to see the plot is to watch it the same night as it comes out in theaters. If you can go see it with friends and not be disturbed, then this is a great movie.    The best parts of the movie are in the middle when you really get to know the character and understand why they do what they do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is crap. I don't care if it's in the 80s or today. It is boring. And that is a terrible feeling for a movie to be that boring.  I have a problem with this movie. I am sick of this movie getting the best reviews. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      The story is about a group of kids who are sent out to explore a new place, but accidentally get lost.  This is a horrible movie. I feel as if it should be called, "Crimson Ridge." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is filled with so many bad ideas that it's hard to take any of them seriously. At first it seems like a horror film with a twist, but the twist is never followed through, and most of the film is just set-up and shot-out in a lot of scenes. The film uses some pretty lame acting and special effects. The story doesn't make much sense and the ending isn't all that satisfying. The only one who seems to be a real winner in the film was the lead, who is played by the great John Ritter, and he looks very convincing. The bad acting and the weird acting are not helped by the direction, which just is so stupid that it doesn't even hold up. This is a pretty dull film and nothing in the way of a laugh or any emotions are elicited, and the last twenty minutes are just a really annoying car crash with the "victims".
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really like the film, and I like the fact that it is a straight forward thriller. The only problem is the plot. The film opens as a guy, Robert Lee (played by Patrick Swayze) is driving back to Texas after a night of debauchery with a prostitute. The passenger seat is filled by a woman named Sally (played in this film by Elizabeth Berkley). A strange and scary thing happens when Sally falls asleep. It is as if a horrible force has taken control of her, and now it is all of Sally's fault. Robert is able to find the source of the problem and stop it. The movie then begins to move away from Robert as Sally moves into Robert's life. I guess the idea was to show us Robert's problems, and the woman's as the story moves forward, but this is a pretty weak idea. Sally is a very boring character, as she is the main reason the plot takes an interesting turn. There is no real sense of suspense in this movie. Sally does not seem to be any more important than anyone else. I didn't find her all that interesting, but I did find the role she plays amusing.   The last third of the movie is really bad. The acting is just not good at all. There are times when Sally seems like she is trying to be scary, but the actual act is just lame. Her character was so bad that I was almost laughing out loud. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie doesn't work. It's not a bad film, but it's a waste of time, money, and emotion.   The story is awful and I have read many reviews that agree.  It seems like a guy gets a bunch of money from his dead mom to find the money he should've made in his 30's. He has to find a woman that he used to have sex with.  This film seems to be about a young guy trying to get revenge on his dead mother. The director makes it out that this is the story of a guy who was raised by her. But it's not. It really seems to focus on a woman trying to find revenge on her dead father.  If the man was just trying to take her revenge she wouldn't be in this film.  The acting in this movie is terrible.  All the characters seem to be acting like characters from The Untouchables or Rambo.  Also the soundtrack is terrible and the acting just doesn't fit the situation at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After being so excited for a new Star Wars movie, I was very disappointed. There were some great performances here, and it had a great vibe and it was good for a sci fi movie. The cast did great though.   I was waiting for this movie for a year, and this movie does not live up to the hype or the hype. It is a great movie, but it was very predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know how to get across why I loathe this film. Not in a bad way at all, it just feels so...harsh and cruel that I could never enjoy it.  The story is set in the mid 90's in a small Canadian town, and it follows an older couple that had a nasty incident with the police on the night of their son's birthday.  They get a warrant to search for the father of the son, but then the mother's boyfriend, who is known to them for the crime of a murder, shows up and they get caught in the cross fire between the police and the boyfriend. The girlfriend who knew the father turns herself in, and when they see this, the police do a complete sweep of the town.   The wife gets a visit from her ex husband on her birthday, she thinks he was trying to pay his respects to her, but in the end he ends up killing her!   If you want to see a bad film, this is it! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen most of this series, but I had not seen this.  It is very boring.   There are some nice scenes, but most of them are taken out of context and put in as an afterthought.  I found myself just wanting to watch some TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie ever.   It was terrible and not worth watching.  It made me feel like I had watched a crappy version of Star Trek and that the original series was a joke.  The best thing I ever saw was in Star Trek Into Darkness, but I couldn't get my head around this movie.  I don't know why they chose to make this movie but they did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went into this thinking it would be a very funny and entertaining movie. In a way, it was. But for the rest of the time I was there, the film didn't really have anything interesting to say.   I found myself really hoping the rest would be better than this and I think it might have been, but it was far from it.  The acting was really bad in this movie and I can't imagine the director took all of the good acting he had, when trying to do an action movie.  I would recommend this movie to people who really enjoy action movies, but I don't think it will entertain anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you like movies like "The Matrix" and "The Terminator" and you have some patience, you'll enjoy "The Devil's Rejects." The acting is good (including Michael Jai White). The plot is kind of dumb and stupid, but there is an interesting point about it: in the film, there is a bunch of rejectes in the afterlife (like the one from "The Great Escape"). The film doesn't explain why they are all in the same place. Some say that it is because they all had a terrible job in some way, some say that they were never meant to be in the place (like "The Master"). There is a part in the movie where a couple get killed by their dog in a car accident (in the afterlife), and there is some stuff about the dog that is very hard to explain, because it could have been a guy's dog, and if you know that, then the whole movie goes away (and if it's not real, then they killed someone else). The "The Reject Bride" movie is only in one theater (so you can't come back) but there are other crappy movies in the neighborhood. If you want a cheap, trashy movie, try to see "The Phantom of the Opera", and if it doesn't work for you, try "The Lost World of Tintin" or "Titanic". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A boring movie with no heart, no character development, no laughs.   It's a movie with a budget, but it seems like they didn't have time to think, or maybe they didn"t have any time to make it even better.  You won't get a sense of a family or a family drama.  A bad movie that doesn't live up to its money and it"s sad.  It was a movie that should have been on television, but now it's just a forgotten movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I gave this a star out of 5, but the one thing about this movie is that it's just so bad, bad, BAD.   The plot and characterisation are just awful.  I can't really tell if she is actually in love with the bad guy, or if the bad man is actually on the bad side.  The bad guy is always making lame excuses, which is one of the worst things you can do in a movie.  This is just a bad, dull movie, where they should have just gone for a different actor, but they just went with the wrong one.  There are no good moments in this movie, and it never gets interesting.  Just bad, boring movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a low quality film that has a very bad script. The only good thing about it is that it is hilarious. It's too bad that a movie like this isn't more widely known. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was really, really bad. The acting was so bad, that it made the movie itself seem good.   The story is not that interesting.  The acting is terrible and very unnatural.  There is so much bad acting and so little good acting.  This film is very hard to watch.  I have seen much better movies in the past.  A big, big missed opportunity for Peter Jackson. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know if I've seen a better action movie. There are some great fight scenes, some of them are a little too slow. The characters are all great. I'm glad I got this and if you like big bad fights, you will not be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film that looks like a rip-off of "Ghost" meets the "Alien" meets "Predator" movie meets the old "Ghostbusters" and then you've got it. This movie sucks.    If it were based on something more then what it is (a bad movie) I would not watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been a fan of the original Godzilla since I saw the 1954 film in a local movie theater in the mid 70's. When I heard this would be adapted for the big screen, I was so excited. In the original film, he was much more of a bumbling idiot than what we see in this film. I wasn't a fan and I'm glad this remake didn't turn me away from seeing the original.   The film opens with a monster smashing a car in Tokyo. A Japanese couple (the same couple from the original) is eating dinner when the doorbell rings. They look through the peephole and see the monster and run outside. After the couple has been knocked down, the monster goes on a rampage through Tokyo. The couple goes to a hotel in the suburbs where they hide from the monster. It's not until the night of the 3rd that the couple realizes the monster is after them. When the woman is found the monster has left.  The monster is not the only danger on this film; the wife gets trapped in the house with the monster, and there is also a new monster introduced who seems to be a female version of the same creature.  My son found this a bit hard to follow and this film is not for the weak of stomach. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movies I have seen in awhile. This movie has no heart whatsoever.   If you are looking for a "good" movie this is not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I was disappointed with this movie. It didn't do anything. It was just like an advertisement for a game that people could buy. It gave you a hint of what a game looked like in a video game store, but was never really shown in-game. And there was no music to tell you that it was a game.   I hope it was the same studio making this movie, but since it was so long ago, I don't think they ever bothered to make a follow up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't want to give a bad review for this movie, but it's pretty bad.  This movie is not bad at all, in fact it's great. But it is a pretty bad movie.  The acting is okay, it's not great, but at least the actors are in the right places in this movie. The dialogue is OK, it could have been done much better. The story is very interesting, but there are far too many jokes for a movie like this. The acting was actually good, but the actors really needed to be in a different movie. This movie could have had a lot more depth to it.   What really bugs me is that there were so many other movies that could have made this movie better than it is.  There was a movie called  The Incredible Hulk  that is even better than this one, that would have been perfect for this.  Also, it wasn't a comedy like this movie was.  I think this movie could be great, just for the acting. I wouldn't mind a different cast for it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing that i see about this movie is the special effects and that they used them for a good reason.   However, the movie has way too much CGI in it and it just makes it look like a cartoon.  The ending is so far from being good.  When the aliens come in to take over the world i feel so scared.  However when they go to Earth they just want to take it over for themselves.  At one point the guys try to shoot the aliens to save their friends but it seems like they were just too stupid.  It was kind of an action movie but not in a good way.  This movie should have never been made.  I think that it would have made a better movie than it did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you want a good thriller, try the ones where the characters actually think before they act.   You know when you are watching a movie and you wonder what would happen if someone took that person in the movie and put him or her inside the movie?  I have seen it so many times and when I saw it again it was the same thing.  I really want a sequel and I hope they will have an action packed one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really didn't think that this movie was going to be good, but it was.   The acting in this movie is atrocious and the writing is horrible.  When the actors are just flat out terrible, the writing isn't great, but that is not the case here.  The plot is very bad too.  This movie would have been a good one to rent, but not the most enjoyable to watch.  It wasn't even funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For those who want to see a good movie, this is the one. Unfortunately, it's not good. It's very slow. And there are some mistakes here and there, but it's still worth watching.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this for the first time at the theater, I was blown away. The film is amazing, but the director and the cinematographer didn't really do their best work. There are many shots that should be removed. The actors are acting completely stupid, some of them aren't even on set and it's hard to tell who the people are. They also should have been more attentive to how much they were moving. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this movie and then watched it again but the first time the girl in the film came out of the truck naked. After that it was just another boring B-movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If I was not on vacation, I would have seen this movie for a second time. This is a movie I never wanted to see again after seeing it just because the cast is so unbelievable, the acting is just awful and the acting style of the actors is completely ridiculous. But, this movie just turned out to be the worst and worst ever that I saw.   I am really disappointed with the film and I will probably not watch the sequel. I will watch the original for the "gory" content, but I do not think that is a good movie either.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I enjoyed the first half of the film.  The ending was ridiculous, but a funny idea.   A great idea, but there are a few things that were awkward.  There were a few lines that were hard to get.  But I thought the plot was good.  If you don't like to watch actors do all sorts of things and not act, this will not appeal to you.  What's great about it is that it's really scary.  It makes me really think about the possibility that someone will turn out like that in real life.  This film is not a "good" movie, but it has its own humor and a little bit of gore to make it a nice horror film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie with the other children of the "Goddess" in the "Everest" Hotel. We were told to keep quiet as they would be performing in the film.   We were only allowed to watch and not participate.  In the film, we were told that there was no such thing as a "real man". That men were always victims of circumstances. It was obvious that this is the same movie from the original made in 1953. I don't understand how this movie was allowed to be made today. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie itself isn't bad, it's the director and the actors that make it horrible. The director seems to have done everything wrong, the movie never stops moving or progressing, the acting is flat out bad, and the action is boring and poorly choreographed. The movie has a great theme, but it was executed horribly. It should have been a low budget movie, and then the actors, director, and screenplay were all hired to create a good movie. It's just too bad that they couldn't have done that, because this movie has all the elements of a great movie. If you enjoy a crappy action flick or a movie about a bunch of gangsters, give this movie a shot.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie so many times that it's become something of a routine and not a particularly memorable one. I've never understood how a "superstar" like Marlon Brando could fail so completely and so consistently at directing. I was particularly annoyed by the fact that Brando, who was known for his high-energy and quick wit, was apparently incapable of finding an appropriate romantic partner for him to star in. He was also completely incapable of playing a more nuanced role (especially since he had no experience acting with other people and never even studied acting) and I'm sure he was also a bit bored with the film and just wanted to get the money he was paid.  I found the ending pretty weak and the film was really made so that it could be released as a "re-imagined" version, but a lot of people just don't care about any of that. If you haven't seen it then you might as well stop reading now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I have ever seen!   I thought this movie was funny at first but it turned into a complete disaster! The actors were not great and the dialog was so bad I was unable to understand what was going on.   This movie is bad, I am not sure where the producer gets his money from but I would not recommend anyone watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie does not match the hype. The action is a lot of fun and the special effects are impressive. But the story is the most amateurish of all the movies. A group of people (sons of biker) is trying to destroy a government facility that is making a new type of super-bombs. All the people except one are killed, one gets away, and the rest of the film consists of one character trying to make his way to safety. I like the super-bomb movie because it is exciting. But when the movie was over and the action was over, I was frustrated and felt that this movie could have been much better if it had been done properly. The plot could have turned into a great film but the story itself is amateurish and the execution of it is just not great.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was boring, so much like the book it is based on. The plot is extremely weak, the characters are not very developed. It feels like they tried to give it a good twist but it just ended up being predictable.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really want to give this movie two stars, but unfortunately I don't. It was really bad, I mean really, really bad.  It was bad enough to make me regret coming back and watching this movie over and over again. But I don''t know, you can't blame a movie for the bad parts, even if they are bad, and you have to watch it again and again to see what the bad part is.     It was a good idea at first, but they should have waited to do this movie after it had already been finished. It''s a bad idea to do a sequel without knowing the ending of the previous one. It would have been much better to do the sequel first and then do the movie, then see if there is interest in the sequel or not.  I would have loved to see the movie more.        All in all, this was not a bad Movie, but it wasn''t a very good movie either.  Related posts:
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie   I have seen   It is an average movie and I think the writers tried to make a good story. However, the movie has so many flaws   A:  The movie was made with little budget and the only actor who is able to act the way he has done is the girl who does not act at all and the boy who is just a little girl. There are not enough actors for this movie to be good.  A 2:5:  I had to watch the movie twice and it was so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is so cheesy it is hard to take it seriously at all, it's just too ridiculous, this movie has no heart and I really can't stand how it is played, the acting is horrible as well, and you can tell it is poorly done, it has a cheesy ending and is just too bad for a movie this bad, it would have been better if it was made into a movie and the director was allowed to keep the budget he used, this film should have been given a chance in the 90's, but for some reason the director is not allowed to bring his movies to the big screen, if I was a producer I would give this movie my budget and let it be a good movie, but I'm really glad the director never had the chance to see this movie on a big screen because it was just too cheesy for his tastes, and this movie will go down in my all time list as one of my most hated films, the only reason I gave it a four out of ten is because it is a really good film, and a good director can still make a bad film good, but the director for this movie was too busy playing with the idea of a kid dying in the bathtub for his parents to think of a better ending for this film, a film this bad should have had a better director, and I hope this director sees it and changes his mind about this movie so he can do a better job making a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen "R.I.P.D" 3 times and never knew this movie was going to be bad. It was a very simple, boring movie that had one of the worst casts in years. The film is about a former US Marshal who goes back in time to solve a crime and end up going back to murder people. The acting in the movie was terrible and it's hard to watch. They were all in their 50s/60s and they all did a bad job of portraying each other. The scenes were all pretty much the same and the movie felt repetitive and dull. There were times when I could've used some better actors in the roles that they were given.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A good movie that's not good.   There's so much wrong with this movie that it boggles the mind.  It's a movie about two friends who get into a fight and end up getting kidnapped and sold into slavery.  I know it's set in the early 20 th century, but why the hell would they not show the actual slaves?  The movie tries to make a story out of it by having the slaves tell their story, but it's completely useless.  The plot gets convoluted and the movie doesn't even make a point of showing how bad things were back then.  These guys just show up, have some fun and get out of there.  They never discuss the fact that the guy who kidnapped them is part of the same organization that does this stuff to other countries.  What kind of movie would make a good point about how these slaves were treated by their masters if it doesn't make a big deal out of the fact the guy is a slave?  There was no real need to show these guys in this movie.  All it did was get in the way of what should have been a great story.  Overall, this movie is a boring, rushed and poorly written movie. I didn't see the movie until recently.   …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first movie I ever saw was this bad. The plot was really interesting, but the acting was awful. The guy that plays this guy, he was way to hot for this movie. It was so funny that he was supposed to be the hero, but he didn't have any charisma at all. It all started with him talking to a girl in the elevator and he was pretending to be a girl. He tried to act like his buddy and then he took off his shirt and showed his dick to the girl. It kind of worked though.    So then they meet this girl who's a witch. She says he's her new boyfriend and that's why she doesn't have a boyfriend. She has a few guys at her house and she's all over her friends. One of the guys tells her not to bother with the others and that it's not right for her to go out with all the guys at the house. It turns out they were the ones who made the movie and they knew that she'd be going out with so many guys. The scene where this guy was playing with a dog and kissing it just didn't work. It looked like the guy just stuck his tongue in it and the dog just ate it. I would have loved to see this movie but I can't stand bad acting like that. I think this movie was based off of a real life story.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting was laughable. I had no idea what the actor was talking about, and I was hoping they were doing a prank. If you want to watch a good comedy, watch a film like The Producers, or Funny People, not this trash. I don't believe in karma and I'll keep watching this film on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the most horrible movies I have ever seen!   The people who did this movie were drunk, retarded and did not care what was going to happen to them and my parents at the time. This movie has a bad rep for making people laugh at such a horrific event, which happens in a theater every couple of months, the guy and girl are murdered, and everyone laughs as if nothing happened!  The actor who played the role was not good at all and would not act like a real killer.   This movie should not be shown, if you want a good movie about the horror genre then watch the movies by John Carpenter, Michael Myers or John Wayne. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While the movie may have a few "gag" scenes and the story isn't very good, it is still a funny movie that is actually worth watching.   The director, John Sayles, made a great movie and makes fun of the movie business as well as Hollywood.  It is definitely not worth watching if you have never seen a John Sayle movie, but it is worth seeing if you are a fan of funny movie parodies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only good thing about this movie is the characters. They do make you care for them and believe them, but that's about it.   It has all the charm of an amateur dramedy, which is to say it is totally unoriginal and just a waste of everyone's time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went to see this movie to see if I would like it or if I just saw the title. I watched it in the theater with a couple of friends and had not even noticed the movie, but I was totally captivated by the trailer when it was played. This is the worst thing that I have ever seen. The actor did not even seem like he was in character, I could not tell who was who at all. The movie was very poorly shot. There was a lot of camera movement and the sound was very out of place. The actors were not acting like people would expect a person to act like. I think the people who made this movie did not like how it turned out, but they still made a horrible film. This film should have never been made, no one would have come to see it. The only reason to make this film is to make money off of a poor movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If I ever see this film again, I'm going to be the one who goes into the theater and shouts, "Don't you know that you just ruined a masterpiece!" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst film I have seen.   A big load of crap that took a really stupid idea and ran with it. The lead actor is the most annoying character ever and the rest of the cast is terrible.  It has the worst script and acting ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible and the acting is awful. The ending was terrible, and was very stupid. It wasn't funny or entertaining. The only reason I gave it four stars is that I liked the movie so much.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand why this movie is a hit at the box office. It was made by a guy named Don Siegel who died in 2005. He is known for making "Dirty Harry" (the film that spawned the Batman films) and he was in the early 70's, the time of the original "Batman". The story is based on an article by Joseph Campbell, a Christian writer. The script by David Seltzer, who was also in the 70's Batman films, has a lot of Campbell's ideas. The dialogue is clunky and the acting is laughable. The story has no idea what it is trying to do. It is not funny and it isn't very entertaining. I don not think this was the best Batman story ever, but it isn' t that bad either.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is all crap. The actor and actresses look like they just woke up and decided to be on screen. Their dialogue is uninteresting, and it was hard to take a film that has such a poor plot and characters seriously.   My rating: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The director is not good with his acting and his directing. He can not read a screenplay well. He will try and say things that will make you laugh or make you cringe. The actor will come up with no character to the story. He just came up with one and put a little twist on it. The whole movie will make your brain hurt. There are a lot of other things that you can do with the characters.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so bad. It is the only movie I have ever seen that was so badly edited it made me feel sick and so the main actors were so annoying, I couldn't stand to watch this. It was so bad and the only reason that I saw it is because the cast was on a DVD release for a few years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is a lot like a typical "what happens when" movie. A young couple moves in to a house. It appears to be abandoned for many years. While doing their homework, they start finding strange things in the basement. One of the more bizarre of these objects is a small child. The child does not seem very happy. It tries to move but is easily kept contained. It has a voice, which tells the people in the house that it will be released at 3pm. It seems that they are not the only ones who are being followed. Soon they are all being followed and the house becomes more and more like a game. The characters in the film are just an excuse to have a bunch of people acting really strange.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was good at first but then it was just horrible. The acting was good, the plot was good but the plot failed. The ending was ridiculous.   A lot of things were missing and then the ending just made it even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only good thing about this movie is it was produced by the genius of Michael Curtiz who also did The Wild Angels, a movie you should see!   Michael Curti is the one who is always up for a good movie and he made this movie perfect.   A good movie about a good time?   I think not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember this movie as a little boy and now it just looks like it's been turned into a terrible horror movie with a crappy special effects and horrible acting.   My parents didn't allow me to see it until recently so I didn't realize that this is just a terrible movie.  I'm surprised this movie hasn't already been released to other countries. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was way overrated and totally unnecessary. I did enjoy it in a fun way, but I would not recommend watching this if you have kids and want to take them out to a movie.   The best thing that could happen is that they make a sequel, but with a better script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love all of the films in this series, but I am disappointed with this one. If this was the last one and they kept making the series, then I would watch it, but as it stands this is just a bad remake of another movie. The acting is much better, the special effects are much better (especially the "shocker" in the water tank), the soundtrack is good, but what really kills it for me is the plot. It is much less original then the previous films, and just seems like a rushed out story with some of the characters not knowing what is happening and just running around.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is one "good" scene in this movie. The other 70% of this movie is garbage. If you like bad movies, then you should give this one a chance. I gave this one 4 stars because this movie's only "good scene" was my favorite bad scene in any movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has been so well-hyped that I really felt it would be awesome!   And I was wrong!  And in this case I am a huge disappointment.   I felt that the director took a lot of liberties and the script was poorly written.  I feel the film is really a disappointment and that the stars in the movie were really on the inside and not the outside. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only movie I ever loved, until the movie "Die Hard" came out, then I gave up on the genre and the movie was just too hard to enjoy. I don't know why.   A boring story.  A very, very, boring story.   No one, including the actor, really had any real chemistry with the other characters.  Not a one.  I found this movie to be uninteresting and dull.  And a complete waste of your money.  This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen.  The actors didn't have any chemistry.  This movie was boring.  But they had all this money and they could have done better with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was only mildly disappointed, but my wife, who is a huge fan of sci-fi movies, was disappointed as well.   There were too many bad "special effects" which did not add to the movie, and I think she could have done a lot better.  I do not have any beef with this movie; it was just too long for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought the movie was horrible. This movie is a total joke and does not even have a plot line. It has bad acting, bad special effects, and bad acting. They had to show the guy with the horrible voice to make him look like an idiot. They were only using him as a prop and made it look ridiculous.    The only one of his lines that made sense was when he says "Do you know how much a dollar is? A dollar is worth 100 dollars.  " I thought this guy was an idiot, and it showed in this movie. I am glad they didn't make a sequel because this was the only movie I watched. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first half is great, the second half is a huge disappointment!   I give this a 2 for overall movie quality.   If you love the first half, you will love the second. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story was not good, at all. It was cheesy, it was predictable, and it was stupid. The actor(s) did not have to act well, the story was the worst one ever.   It was a great idea to make a film about a group of characters on a road trip. The one problem with the story is the actors who played them. They did not work well, or did not seem believable.  They were not believable. It did not make the film worse, but it was not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The last half hour or so of the movie is pretty good, I did not like the ending.   I think it is too long and not satisfying enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a fun little short, but the story was silly, and the acting was horrible. The acting was even worse when the story and the characters were at the top of the plot, and it made the plot fall way too fast and hard.   I would recommend to watch this movie if you like a good time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So what happened? They hired a director who has never done any serious work. I can not believe this. They hired someone who has no film credits. He is a movie maker but not the kind of person you associate with films. I did not find the movie entertaining, but I was very disappointed by the director, because he is not a good filmmaker. It is very difficult for me to understand what they are trying to do, because the dialogue is bad and the way the movie is made is not the way I like to see my movies. The only thing I like about this movie is the sex.   I do not understand what is the purpose of this movie, because there is no plot. It's just sex, and sex sex sex. The director has no idea what to do with his actors. They do not look natural, and even if the actors were real, they would not look real on screen. This movie would not be very good to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are looking for a horror flick or just a cheap thrill, then this is a very good horror flick. The film has its moments but is pretty repetitive.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's a reason I was so drawn to The Big Lebowski and not a lot of it has to do with the great performances by Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore and John Goodman.   The movie has a great cast, but it's one of those movies where you're sitting there going "Oh yeah, there's this guy here, and this guy, and they're all great. I just can't be bothered to pay attention."   I found it a bit odd that the movie is rated PG-13, but then I suppose it's not going to be the kind of movie that has parents trying to teach kids about the dangers of drugs or the perils of getting drunk, so why not make it a little more adult and let people know that it's a great time to be a drunk?   It is really easy to see why people enjoy the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am a huge fan of the first movie, but this one just was not the same. It felt like a completely different movie. I was disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved this movie.   The plot line of the story made it hard to get into the movie. I found it too boring and I felt like the actor was going to pass out while shooting.  I would not recommend this movie to someone who likes horror movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story behind this movie is that this is a remake of the 1980s film, "The Thing." This movie has an extremely poor story and is only marginally entertaining.   It has been over twenty years since the original "The Monster Squad" was released. This remake takes the same story and makes it seem like a remake, even though it is NOT.  I was expecting something better than this.  If you liked the original and wanted another "The Monsters are coming to get you," this is it.  The acting is terrible. Most of the actors who play the monsters are either drunk or on drugs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie had its first big splash at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2004 and it is still in circulation and has a number of awards to its credit. It's really too bad that it didn't work out as a movie in a major Hollywood release and it really took some of the fun out of the film for me. I like the story of this movie but it's not enough for me to recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is crap and boring. It is really not worth watching at all. The actors are so annoying and try so hard to be funny but they all fall flat and they are all pretty bad actors.   I think it is a total waste of time watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is awful, I don't know how the writer managed to take the best parts of "The Exorcist" and add a couple more scenes of bad acting and a story that seems to have been written by a 14 year old. This movie has nothing that even resembles good writing and it is not even entertaining.   A "monster" in this movie is an empty room and a man has a secret. This is the best part of the movie, and you would think that the writer would have used this as the basis of the story, but no, they just throw the old idea into a pile of stuff and hope someone else will take it over and turn it into something good.  This is not a movie for people who like scary movies or people who enjoy bad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad that it is really hard to get into. I can't remember much, or not much, that happens in the movie. At least, not the events that I remember in any kind of detail. I don't know who they were shooting, but no one looks good.   I think this is where it all went wrong with the movie, but I don' think that is really the reason it is so awful. The actors were all really bad. I thought they were going to give it a shot but they just weren't up to the job.  It is a shame, because the concept of this movie is good. It would make a great thriller, but the production just couldn't make it look real. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's really really bad.   And it's got some good ideas.  The first half of the movie is really good, but it starts to fall apart towards the end of the film.  I really really wish they'd just not shown this film, but the internet is a wonderful place to find new stuff, so I went out and found the trailer to this movie.  It looks awful.    I was really surprised when the trailer looked this bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not a very good movie, it was good in some places but the bad parts of this movie are so bad that it ruined the movie for me. I thought this movie was going to be the next "The Dark Knight". The story was cool and the acting was ok. I'm sure there were some good people that made this movie but it had nothing to do with good acting or a good story, it had everything to do to do, it's what happened to me on the street. I wanted to stop watching this movie as soon as it started but I kept going because I knew the ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending was horrible. The plot was stupid and a big let down. I did not like the main character and I will not like her when she gets older.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie doesn't have a lot of action. The only action is the two main bad guys fighting each other. There is not much blood. The actors are good and the action is good.   The movie has one of those things in it like 'it's a movie about two cops, what else do you expect?'  It's not a bad action movie, but it's not good either.  The music and the acting in it are all great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a horrible movie with no originality or story. There were no jokes, no characters, just a bunch of cheap shots, cheap screams, and bad acting.   It was completely laughable.  It took the best parts of the movies that didn't work and turned them into a boring movie.  This is a horrible waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a great movie. A great story, and a great way to end it. The music is great.   The ending, though, was a little weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *Ahem* This movie is a disaster. The dialogue is stilted and awkward and the acting is cheesy and cheesy and the action scenes are horrible.   There is no character development. No motivation. No real goals. Nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best thing about this movie is the ending. The whole thing was so much better than the film.   It seemed like a nice story with a cool ending, but there were a lot of things that could have been better.  They could have made it longer, so I guess they wanted to make it look like the whole thing happened in one night.  I guess that was the point.  The main character was annoying, the wife was annoying (she was so annoying!), and I really thought the wife would kill the father in the end, but that was just my imagination.  Even though it was a great movie, it could have benefited from more time.  It didn't even have enough time to finish before I had to go to bed.  It just felt like they were rushing the whole film because it was only three days and they didn't want to go through the expense of trying to make another film.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the most depressing movies i have ever seen. I was expecting a bit more from this movie and was very disappointed. There are two or three occasions where i was expecting something more, but it was never quite there. The performances are very thin, i wouldnt say they are bad, but they are so very thin. i felt they were trying too hard to be funny or dramatic, but in the end the lines are so bland it doesn't work.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a good film, but it really needed a great screenplay to be the classic masterpiece it should be.   I found the script really boring.  This film was an insult to everyone involved in the film and the actors.     The cast was really great.  Most of the cast played great, but I found it hard to believe that they had the same chemistry as when they were together.  Even the actresses who were great in other films were not great in this.  I think the reason that it worked was the actors did a great job of bringing their characters to life.  One thing that I think helped this film out was the music, it was catchy and great. You could just sit back and enjoy the story of this great band of performers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the 70's, the big movie studios were the ones who made the movie, and they made the movies, so if they didn't think it was good, they wouldn't let anyone else do it. In this movie, we have the actors doing the acting.   I think this movie was a big deal in the 70s. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie at a little movie theater in downtown Los Angeles. I think I know where I saw it first. It's kind of hard to remember who I saw the movie first, but the date was about 5 years ago. I was watching a documentary about the film "The Blues Brothers" and this movie was shown in the background. I guess the fact that the film was shown there at a time when it was probably not well-received in the black community must have played into the theater owner's favor. I don't think this movie is good at all. It lacks all originality, even if the acting is good. All the best acting scenes were filmed in Los Angeles and it has no idea what it is doing or what to do with the setting. It just sits there.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The actors are not really all that convincing. I know the movie is about a serial killer, but I always thought the killer in the movie looked more like a middle-aged guy with a goatee than a serial killing monster.   In conclusion,   A film about a killer who kills his ex-girlfriend, and then tries to kill a different woman for fun, is not all that entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story was pretty bad, it would be better if they put some more work into the story than this one did. The action scenes were nice to watch but were way too short. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know why I liked this movie. It is bad, but it isn't a bad film. If you are looking for a quick, fast, and easy, take-down, you will probably like this.   The characters in this movie are terrible. There's no chemistry between any of them, and their dialog is awful. The best part of the movie is when the cop gets the girl and the girl tells him to "f*** off". I've seen worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at a drive-in theater in Florida. It was a horror movie. The acting was really awful. The director, Don Siegel was very rude to everyone. I am a horror fan and the acting was the worst I have seen in a long time. I went to a different theater for a second viewing and it had the same acting in a different genre. I guess Don S the director has been so burned by his horror movies, he can't do horror anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is a joke, from the first minute you see the acting, the setting, to the fact that the script is the worst. There is no dialog and the only people talking in this film are the camera and a female actor talking to the camera.   I am sorry but the script was so bad and the acting was so poor and the plot so boring that I cannot even watch it.  I feel that you could make this film better if you took the time to write a better script, and the actors were worse.  This film was so awful that I would have rather watched a comedy than have this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very poor movie. It was so slow and boring I could barely pay attention and I got through it in 20 minutes. The movie starts off with a bunch of kids getting into an old car and some crazy guy shows up and demands their money. The kids, not knowing who this crazy guy was, pay him and he goes away. He has a bunch more kids, who all hate him for making them all rich. The girls start to beat up some of the kids and the parents have to save them.    After some time a couple of kids show up to see what is going on and they are all afraid and run. The other guys show up and do the same thing to the guys and the other kids. It just goes on and on like that. The guys, who have seen what is really going on, come up with a plan to escape the cops and go back to the old car. It looks like they are going to do it by jumping out of the car and taking the car. The guy in the car has a really great idea and then everyone in the gang is supposed to get in the trunk and the two guys get on the wheel and drive away. But then the guy in front of them says he wants to go first and goes in the back seat. Then he gets in the rear seat, the driver and the guy behind him and pulls a gun out and he shoots and kills the guy on the driver's side. That guy was supposed to shoot the kid on the front seat and then get out of there. The only kid who didn't get killed was the guy with the gun, but he was killed. That kid was never seen again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie after a family trip with my family where my sister, parents, and I stayed at the same resort. I didn't have time to get into the film but I was intrigued by it and after watching it I am not surprised to see how poor the film is, there is not much to look forward to. The actors all look good but none of them are very appealing, the rest of the cast looks like they were cast for a porno movie.   This movie is just plain boring.  It has nothing to offer, the actors aren't funny and the plot is just terrible. I am glad I didn`t watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie when I was 8 years old and loved it at that age, and so does everyone I know who has seen it. I remember hearing a rumor that it was going to be an even better movie, and I thought maybe they had made it into something special.   This movie is a good example of bad movies being made by the lowest of the low, I don't mean to pick on the director, because in my opinion, he didn't have a chance. This movie has so many flaws that when I saw it again, I was shocked at how poor it is.  It has no plot or story.  The acting is not very good either, they have some of the actors I saw in the movie when they were young, and they are still acting like 8 years olds.  Most of the special effects are laughable.  I remember a guy was doing some sort of explosion, and it looked so fake that I just thought it was made up.  One of the characters, who was supposed to be a "good" guy was wearing a t-shirt that said "You're an asshole"  When I saw the opening scene of the movie, I remember laughing so hard, because the entire movie takes place in one room.  There is no reason for a movie that takes place so far away to have to have a lot of time on screen, because that would take away from the suspense that it should have had.  They should have been able to show some of that action on a screen, instead of showing just some quick shots of the two characters at the scene of action.  Also, the soundtrack is atrocious, they should have replaced the soundtrack with the theme from another movie.  When the special effect of the car that the two men are driving are shown, they are going so fast, that they're going over their own lines.  My favorite part of this movie is when the man says to his wife, "I hope you don't mind if we kill them, they're a bunch of killers".  My friends and I used to make fun of this joke. I don 't know why, but every time I hear it, I like it more.  If this movie was made today, it would not pass any censorship board.  A lot of the other movies in this category were made when I just starting watching movies, and most of the bad movies I have seen, were made in the 70's,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very poor movie. The music was horrible. The acting was terrible. The plot was terrible, and the acting was just awful. I didn't like the ending. I don't think it was ever clear what happened to the main character. It was just confusing. I felt that it was so bad that I could almost feel sorry for it. I tried to enjoy it but I didn'st.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved this movie so much it was the only one I saw in the theaters. It was one of the first things I saw. I thought it was really good. But it was not very well thought out. The actors were great, but I was not a fan of this director.  It was all in the acting and they all looked like they were trying too hard, which is not a good thing.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is boring, slow, and dull. It also has no plot, and it has no emotional connection to the characters. The ending is a shocker but the movie is not any better than a "Drama". I really don't think that "American Pie" is worth watching.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has one of the biggest egos in the history of acting.   His role is like a big movie role, like he has to impress the studio so they will give him a big role.  It's really bad but still a must see.  The biggest problem I have with this movie is that they gave him the wrong part.  They got his character to look like a young Harrison Ford, but they gave the role to a much older actor.  If they didn't give this role to Harrison, they should have stuck with the part that is right for the role.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't see how anybody could like this movie. The acting is pathetic, the acting is embarrassing. The directing is stupid, the editing is stupid. The plot is stupid and the acting and directing is pathetic.   The entire movie is the same old lame action with just a little romance thrown in. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you're in need of a quick laugh and nothing else, look no further. It is a quick, fast-paced, and fun flick, but I don't think it's as funny as a big-budgeted sequel could be.   I like the new kid on the block but there's just no way around that I'm going to save this flick from me.  It's a fun film, but don't expect anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie is a rip-off of "A Time for Everything" starring George Clooney.   This movie does a lot of things wrong.  First off, it takes a lot more than three hours to complete.  Second, it's filled with bad acting and very bland special effects.  Third, I'm not a big fan of movies that take place in New York and then film it in London.  I just feel like the movie was shot in England and filmed in New Jersey.  The ending is very cheesy, like they cut out a lot for the movie.  This is the kind of film I would expect from a bad acting "musician".  I really think this is a horrible movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this movie and I loved watching it. The actors were all very good. But that's why I liked it so much, because the acting was so good that I could just put myself in the roles.   This movie was a mess. I remember one scene in particular where the woman's husband is doing an autopsy and he's doing the same thing over and over again while the couple is watching. There were just so many inconsistencies in this movie.  There was also one scene where a female police officer is on the floor and she's dead and the guy's still alive and she starts doing CPR on him. It's just too much.  I was also confused with some of the things going on in this film.  Also, the scenes were all filmed in the same location. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I was first asked to do the film I had a long pause before responding. I wanted to wait to hear what was in their heads. I remember telling the director the first time I met them that I thought they were crazy. I wasn't afraid to say so. I'm not saying they're bad. I know a lot of great horror movies have come out over the last few years. But I just thought this movie was stupid.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I know this movie has many more fans than anyone realizes. I've always liked this movie, but I really disliked this one. I think it's the same story, just with different actors. I liked the plot better.   The plot is a little too simplistic and stupid for a comedy to be so funny.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but the main character is a complete idiot.  The best part about this movie is the two lead actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found this movie to be boring and lame.   The story is about a couple who run into a group of bad guys.  While it is possible to make a movie that was entertaining, I would have rather seen the other 2 movies about the same subject matter.  I got the feeling that the actors were going through the motions just to make it more exciting.  The movie is long, the action is repetitive and it isn't even very good.  This movie is like trying to make your own version of the movie, or a sequel to a crappy movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have not seen this movie and did not know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised to find the film is filled with good performances and decent acting. My only problem is the story is very silly and not believable. I know they were trying to make something more than a comedy but I think the story did not work well for me.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story was weak, I was annoyed at some parts, I am not a fan of the character of Gwen, the cinematography was boring. I like movies that make me go on a journey and that's what the movie failed to do, the ending was disappointing, I wasn't really happy with the movie, maybe you should give it another chance.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a shame that this film is only given a 3.5 out of 10 on IMDb. It has nothing to do with the quality of the movie. The film starts off good but as the movie progresses it seems to get less and less entertaining. At the same time it is hard to believe that this movie was made by the same people who made 'Alien' and 'The Thing'.    Overall the film was a disappointment and it took away from the enjoyment of the entire film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I really enjoyed watching the movie. We really did. My wife really liked it. She even wanted to bring the kids over for a movie night because it seemed like it was going to be so much fun.  There are some funny bits in this movie, but they do not come through until near the end.  The only thing that is worth mentioning about this movie is that the ending is actually a pretty good idea.  If you want something really funny and good, this might be your movie.  It is worth a watch for the laughs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not the movie I was looking forward to at all. I'm disappointed in the production and the acting, the acting is just not up to par with other movies out there. The action scenes are a lot more lackluster than expected and I really can't remember all the characters. Even the best of action stars can't keep the audience on their toes at all times, but here it seems like none of the characters are even trying to. It was really annoying. There is a lot of cheap action scenes in this movie but nothing of real worth. You can see that the budget was low and that the director wanted to make a movie that looked good at a cheap cost.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is all wrong. The bad part is that there are no consequences. The good part is the people in it. If there was any consequences then we would see more of this kind of movie.    I would give it a 1 star, but if you want a movie with lots of violence and sex then you should get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting sucks   I have a really hard time enjoying most of these movies, but this is the only one that really annoyed me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a horrible movie. A story that I had thought up as I watched a film about a serial killer was ruined by bad actors, acting that was laughable and script that was terrible. When I read this book, I thought it was a good idea to use the movie to bring out this idea of a killer who comes out of the closet and kills women. I didn't think that it would end in a film of this kind but it does, which was why I went into the movie thinking that I should take it seriously. Instead, this movie made me laugh my ass off and it's a disgrace that they let it make it to the big screen. If you can, don't watch this movie. I will say that it had a good plot, and I liked it a lot as a film but not as a novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a train wreck of a movie. I can't believe this is a movie made in 1998! It is a "horror" movie, not a horror film at all. It has elements of a slasher, not much gore, but the atmosphere is off putting. It was made in the early 90's and is filled with poor acting, cheap acting, cheesy acting and lots of people dressed like clowns. You get the feeling this movie was made to get a quick paycheck. It is about a father and his little girl who is terrorized in his home. I guess the movie was too popular for them to turn it into a decent movie. This movie was supposed to be about a guy with a shotgun who goes to his home and kills his family, but it becomes a slaw to kill people. You might think you are watching a movie, but you are not.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "drama" aspect of this movie is laughable. The "action" aspect is nothing more than a lot of people jumping off a building. You would think that at least someone would have seen the movie before they wrote their review. The story in the movie makes no sense. It is a bad "comedy" and this movie should not be watched. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's not great, but it's not terrible. It's just not really that great.   The plot is very vague, and the movie just doesn't have much of a plot at all.  The acting is bad. The direction is pretty bad, as well.  It looks like a very cheap movie.  And the plot holes keep getting smaller and smaller.  This movie is about the same length as a lot of the others that come to mind that are terrible, and it still falls well short. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this for the first time last night. I have to admit I was surprised that it turned out as bad as it did. The acting was great, but there were some scenes that made me feel like I was watching a crappy low budget movie.  The acting is not the worst thing, but it was a little cheap.    My biggest complaint would be that the story felt unfinished and out of place.  I don't understand how a couple of women in the 1940's could be as hot as they are, or why they have their big house and the car they drive.  They could all be living in a trailer with nothing but their dog.  This movie felt like it was shot in the 80's, and if the director was a couple decades older, he might be a great actor.      This story was interesting, but I just didn't buy it.  It wasn't really that bad to watch, but the acting was not great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst film in the series, not worth watching.   What a shame to have to waste another year of my life in a movie that I will never watch again.  I have to start a new life and I won't be watching this crap anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's bad. There are no positives about it at all. I think it was a movie shot in one day. A bunch of people got together and said "Hey, let's make a bad action movie!" It was bad.   No one cared about the movie. It was an expensive film that was going to take up alot of money.  The plot was pathetic.  When you start the film you want to see what happens next. That was the whole idea of the film! I can't say I like watching these kinds of movies anymore. I hate seeing them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a good comedy, but it is totally pointless.  The plot is weak.  We get more of a plot than anything else.   The characters are ridiculous.  It's just not funny.  There is a very good reason why this movie is not funny at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved this movie and was really looking forward to it. But it was not good. The acting was really good but the story was totally different. I know the film is supposed to be about how a man got a gun and shot people in the city. But this was not that. It was a guy in a car. It is very unrealistic. This film really shows that police are corrupt. It also shows some bad things about the police force. You do not have to be a detective to see the people being killed by this cop. He is really trying to kill people and he does it in the most horrible ways. Also, there is a lot of sex in the film but that is not a good thing to do when the people are being killed. The cop is a bad guy who takes advantage of women to get his way. This is what a cop should not do. He does some stupid things but it is the police that are corrupt and he did not want to do anything that would embarrass them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping this movie would be good, but instead, it was way over hyped. It was an ok movie, but it wasn't that good.   If you were looking for a cheesy fun movie to watch with your buddies then look no further. This one is not that.  This movie does not live up to it's hype.  It should have had more comedy, more action, and less drama.  I think it was better than the trailer.  If I could give it a 4 or 5 I would have, but I can't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first film of this type I ever saw was the 1958 Stanley Kubrick's "Lolita". It's a movie that has a disturbing and disturbing aspect. The story is a bit unclear but one thing I have to say is this is one of the most realistic depictions of love I've ever seen in my life. I didn't know if it was a sick, or just an expression of the feelings of a couple that had a bad feeling about each other. This film takes place in the early 30s. In the 1950s the film was considered too risqué. It had the idea of a man falling in love with a woman. There is a beautiful scene where the woman watches him undress in front of her. It's not just the sex, but also the intimacy between the two. It is a rare film that manages to capture the whole body of the audience and makes it feel real.  This is a movie for adults. It deals with the taboo subject. It has a strong message to say, and the way Kubrick makes it clear what he's trying to say with his movie, makes the viewer think about it, not just for sex and love but for our own nature.   I think the best part of the movie is the ending.  - July 26, 2016Excellent documentary  Reviewer: mikko. - favorite favorite favorite - July 2, 2016  Subject: Wrong time period, wrong film. As I was trying to figure out what kind of movie this is, and what makes it such a strange film to watch, I came across an article on it in the New York Times. Apparently the film, produced in 1955, was the last of the American crime/noir series to be shot in black and white. Apparently, it wasn't too good a film in the US at the time, and it was banned for being too dark and disturbing for the American public. The article that I read says that the film took about a year and a half to make, but it was just finished and produced a year after it was shot. There were only two weeks of shooting in the spring and the summer, with one day of shooting during the winter. It was also shot in a different location from the one in which it was supposed to be finished. The film was supposed for distribution in the States as the "Livre de Noir" (The Dark Night). Apparently, the movie was banned by the film distributors in France,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While this is a film about two sisters who don't love each other and their parents divorce, this movie will not leave your mind clear for more.   One of the most painful scenes you will ever experience, is when one of the sister's husband is trying to get rid of her by sending her to prison.  They can't get along and her husband just can't let this go.  Another scene that will make you feel like you're watching a soap opera is when they are talking about their parents, and he says that he will love his wife when he marries her.  If it wasn't for this movie, I don't know what would have happened with this family. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is great, but the characters are weak.   It has an exciting plot, but it's all very predictable.  The ending was disappointing as well, but I guess that's what happens when you have a good plot but bad acting.  They could have used a better actor like Richard Chamberlain, as it wasn't his best work.  This was the last movie he made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is awful. I went to see it for my 16 year old sister. She's not into horror and thought it was great for an evening out. But I found it horrible and disgusting. No matter how much they tried to change the sex, it was still wrong. I think they must have used a cheap girl. It was gross.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible movie. The actors did nothing for it. I was never satisfied. I just did not get it. The plot is terrible. They make fun of religion, politics, and religion in general. And then at the end of the movie they have the religious nutters go through hell. They have an exorcism and a priest is the one who does it. He's not really evil, but he's trying to stop this. And he's always laughing about how this stuff happens. It's so silly. If you want to see a movie that makes fun of this stuff, go see the "The Exorcist". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I remember seeing this movie at a friend's house a few years ago and being quite shocked. I had no idea that this film was anything but a blatant ripoff of the old horror movie The Thing.   It is a very basic looking movie and has no suspense whatsoever. I would much rather see one of the many better films like Poltergeist or Jaws than something like this.   If you are looking for a good slasher film look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a shame to see a movie in which the story was too convoluted and the characters didn't have much depth.   The script was so convoluted, that it was easy to see how the whole movie was going to end.  A film with a plot is a good idea.  The acting was great and the directing was good.  This movie is interesting but I found that it didn't give the characters much depth or motivation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film was so bad I have never laughed so hard or had so much fun in my life.   I guess they just decided to try something different and not make any money from it.  When this movie came out there was so much talk about the lack of originality of this type of film. They had great actors and great stories and ideas. However, this film was just so boring. The actors were not very good and I never thought I would laugh so hard in my entire life. The action scenes are the only reason this movie was good and some of the things said in the movies script were a bit strange. There are no action sequences or funny scenes or interesting characters. This film was full of plot holes and was just plain terrible.  The whole movie was just a disaster from start to finish.  If you are ever going to watch a film with such an awful script and actors and get the idea to make a more interesting film then this is the way to go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was really bad. This movie was just bad.   This movie really had no plot at all. It just goes on and on and there is no story. There was also no real character development in this movie. The only thing that was made clear in this film was that the man wanted to be a superhero. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has a very bad storyline, but it makes up for it with terrible acting, a terrible score, and a cheesy and cheesy soundtrack. I would say that it takes itself so seriously that it almost becomes ridiculous, but the funny thing is that it's not ridiculous at all. The movie tries hard to be scary, but just fails at it all.    When the movie started I felt like this was going to be a fun, silly, fun horror movie that just happened to have a bad story. But then I heard the soundtrack. It was so bad. The entire movie was just a piece of shit, and that was a great idea. When you hear a crappy song like that you know that you're going to see something wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie will not have you thinking about good movies again. I mean, the best scene in the movie is about a girl and her boyfriend playing a game of hide and seek. That is about it. Thats all the movie has going for it.   If you want a good movie to put on after you've watched some bad movies then this movie will be perfect. It has a good story, good acting, nice visuals, and a great score. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I watched this movie because I've always wanted to see it. Now it is a joke and should not be seen.   I am surprised how bad this movie is. Not a good idea to put on tv or any place that people watch a movie to get a laugh. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie on VHS when it was released and I was so disappointed because it was an awful movie. There was nothing of the quality that I had come to expect from Peter Jackson, or from James Cameron for that matter. The acting was terrible, the dialogue, completely unreadable and the special effects were awful, they didn't look like they were in the movie. The entire movie had the feeling of being forced. It had the same feel of someone who has spent all of their money, has wasted all of the money on a lousy movie and has no hope of getting it back.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was not a huge fan of the movie, but I'm sure I was more than just the audience for the film. It felt like a cheap rip off of "Django". The writing and the acting are horrible. There's no sense of believability in the characters. I was just bored of it at the time and didn't have the heart to keep watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this in the theater when it was first released in the mid-1980s, and I don't remember what it was about. It just didn't look like it belonged in a theater, in my opinion.  It's kind of a mix between a western and a sci-fi flick. I like the sci-fis of the movie and the western, but it just looks like something that was shot in the late 70s or early 80s.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I hate this movie  I thought the actors were very good but the script was really awful and the acting was very bad. They should have stopped it after it was only one act    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting was horrible, the movie was poorly edited.   A lot of them didn't even know what was going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was very excited to see this movie. The trailer promised something different from what I was expecting and boy was I not disappointed. The plot was simple, a group of college boys stumble upon a stash of drugs. They get away with it. The next day the group is called to the police station by a journalist who wants to interview the lead witness. It is revealed that the reporter is actually a cop working for the mob. We then meet the lead reporter, who is played by Will Smith. The mob wants to get revenge on the lead guy, who was one of their men. The cop on the other hand has a secret.   The movie starts off slow, but as you get into it you start to see all the clues that the mob had and all the potential ways the lead can be framed.  The best part about this movie is that it has all the elements of a classic slasher movie, but it is very enjoyable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was so stupid. I could hear the actors talking on a telephone, and when they started playing the telephone line in a very fake way, I started laughing so hard that it was painful.   I really hope this movie was made by someone who knows something about what they are doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It has the worst acting of any of the horror movies I've seen.   The actors were horrible.  It was boring, boring, and boring.  I just wanted to go home.  Not worth the $7 I paid for it, but hey, it had a good script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am so sick of this movie and have to say that it's pretty boring.   The acting was poor and the acting in this movie sucked. I saw it when I was 15 and it's like I have seen it 100 times.  The story is really not that good and it was so slow and boring. The actors are really not good and this movie could have been much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was watching the movie for a school project and loved the acting, it was like a different movie.   Not for the young kids but for the ones that were old enough to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was very cool and unique, but it was very poor. I got a bad feeling from this movie from the very first scene. Then they got to the set and the only other girl who wasn't wearing a skirt was in a very sexy outfit and she did not look real at all. This girl had the look of a professional model with long hair. She looked like she had to be there for a job interview. That's not what I had in mind when I bought this movie.    The movie was good in my opinion, but the acting was really bad. And the acting really sucked and it wasn't even funny. I would never pay to see this movie again because it was so bad and I would rather go see a comedy than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very poor remake of a classic, the only reason it works is because it's a remake. The film doesn't really try to do anything but re-do the same scene over and over. It has an awful plot line (which is what the remake is made of) and the movie's production design is just horrendous.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't think I can give this movie any higher than 2 stars. It's good for its time but very dated and is a bad excuse for a "B" movie.   There is something about this movie that is very good. There is the classic movie-star combination of James Mason and Joan Crawford. It makes for a nice little movie but I think it's missing the "A" movie elements. I hope they put together a full-length version and try to put this movie to good use.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I hate to say that I don't find this movie to be good. The main reason I hate it is that it was so cheap to make that it is barely worth watching.   If you're into fast paced action and fighting then you should definitely watch this movie.  I only found the action to be okay and they tried to make it more like a traditional movie with fast editing and fast cutting and so on. The story is okay and the action was pretty fun to watch but the characters were boring and the plot was pointless and pointless and the only part of the movie that made me interested in it was the ending.  This movie should have had a great budget and the stars should have all been great.  In other words it was just so cheap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like this movie, and I don't dislike it at all, but for some reason, I always seem to think that all the girls are super-sexy and sexy. The guys are usually kind of "buzzed off" because they have to make a quick escape and aren't too sure about the whole situation.   It was pretty funny.  It's also pretty interesting how the whole "sex" thing works.  They're on a cruise ship, and they have the idea to "sex up the place".   They dress up in sexy outfits, and go out in public.  The girls always talk in a way that implies they are having sex, and if you don't want to have sex, you must just stand there and not talk.  There is a lot of fun and a lot to think about as they get into the whole thing, and that kind of made me think about all the things that I think about when I'm not having sex.  I do enjoy it, but I think it would be better if there were more guys there so it wasn't so easy for the girls to say they're having sex and not get in trouble.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad. The actors never try to make anything good out of their performance, and the story is just pathetic. I don't think any of the people involved actually wanted to make a movie like this, and it was done for the sake of making money. This is just plain pathetic. There's a scene where this character (who is clearly an asshole) makes a joke about a prostitute who looks like a "giant woman". Why would you make a joke like that about a giant woman? Is that supposed to be funny?    The director seems to have no respect for his actors, and they don't even seem to care that the plot is just a total mess.   It is a total disaster.  The movie doesn't really go anywhere. It just follows these characters for some unexplained reason and just ends up in a hotel room where everyone is either getting high or looking at porn. The characters are completely unlikeable, and nothing they do is believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie I've ever seen. It was completely terrible. I felt cheated by it and felt like I was watching the worst movie ever made. I mean they spent 5 minutes talking about what would happen to the actors and the plot and that was all. Then they threw the money out of the window and ran off into the jungle. I was so sick of it. It made me want to throw up because I felt so sick to my stomach. It is a very stupid movie that is full of bad acting and poorly written scripts.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found the film not so bad but not so good either. It had some of the best actors in it such as Robert Taylor, Richard Widmark and Joan Collins. It was a big money maker but was a lot of fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really expecting a bit of fun with this film but found a very weak story and the acting wasn't good either. I didn't like that it's so short because it could have been longer but it did feel like a short film that would get worse the more it got.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A really bad movie. Not worth the money.   I had never heard of the guy before but I love these kinds of movies and this is a great example. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie started to fall apart when it came to its plot and it became a farce when it began to move away from that plot.  The acting was atrocious and the writing was bad.   When I heard that the movie was based on a series of books by James Patterson, I was interested but I was disappointed.  It was a movie about a couple who go on a trip and one of them gets sick.  They go to their local hospital, which has no medicine.  I was watching the movie and there was one part where the doctor tells them he can't save them but he can help them come back from the dead.  At that point they were still in the hospital and it didn't make sense why the doctor would say this, because it is against medical rules to save people from dying.  After that there was another part where they went out to a country house for a picnic and the family was nice but didn't want them.  Then we see a family that is friendly and hospitable.  When we get to the country house we find it empty but in a field.  In the fields there were all kinds of wild animals and a huge bird with a long beak.  One of the people came out and was talking about how they came from another place and how they didn't know what their family looked like.  So then we find a person who looks very familiar and it turns out to be a woman from the family.  This woman and her son were looking for a boy who had been kidnapped and was held by a group of people.  She told them where they can find the boy but she said they would have to go up into the mountains to get to him and they would be there for a long time.  On the way up to the mountains she gave them a few things.  Before they got to the mountain they were attacked by a pack of wolves.  These wolves took off with one of the boys, but he managed to escape.  However, one of her sons was taken by the wolves and he managed with the others to get back to the road where they were waiting.  By this time the mother had died from the wolves attack and they found her lying in a pool of blood.  We then see the boy run through the woods and run into a river where he meets a man who saved him.  His name was Bob, and he was a kind man who was trying to get
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's just a bad story. I don't think anyone really wants to watch this movie. I'd rather watch "Jurassic Park", because I've seen that movie many times and I can really get into it. It's not worth watching.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is based on the true story of a man named Mike McLean who was found dead in his truck in 1996.

She claimed that they had been chased from the UFO by aliens and they had crashed in the woods.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was bad.   I was really hoping to see some great work in this film, and the result was not.  Not only was the acting awful, the sets and production were so terrible, it was almost as if the studio just hired a couple of actors and let them do their own thing.  All the actors looked like they had never done any acting before, and even when you could tell how much time the actors spent in the makeup chair, their acting was just so bad.    The acting in this was so bad, I don't even think they had the actors practice the lines in front of a mirror.  I think they got some of them to try out their lines, but no one was actually on camera.  It was really hard to follow along.   It was as if some of the actors never took the scene seriously.  The entire film felt like they were just trying to look as though they are in a bad film.  This film is just so awful, you can't even believe that it is real. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best part is the music (the guy who did the soundtrack has a great voice), the acting is pretty bad, and the acting in general is pretty good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A film with no real story or direction and is full of plot holes that don't work, so it becomes the worst kind of bad film.   The acting in this film is awful and not even good enough to use to portray what the director wants you to feel, so even the acting in the scenes with the actors is bad, and it is just plain boring.  The music is horrible, as it is overplayed, and at times the film can be boring. But the acting is the worst part.  Some of the scenes are supposed to be funny and they never are.  I watched this film when it first came out and thought it was a "one film wonder", but now it is a complete disaster.  If you want a film with good acting and good acting, look elsewhere, but I will never watch this again and am glad to have it behind me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is only ONE negative thing I can say about this movie. It is that the ending is quite a shame. The ending would have made a lot more sense if the movie had ended after the first few scenes were over. The plot is interesting, but the ending would only make sense if there had been a very interesting scene after the movie started. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "What a movie!"   This movie would be better if they had done a remake of the 1970 film.   I have yet to see another film that had the same effect on me as this.  This film is the most realistic portrayal of a drug dealer I have ever seen.  It will stay with me for life.  "Cocaine Cowboys" is a fantastic film. It will make you laugh, cry and feel sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If it was a comedy, i would be laughing out loud and laughing out of happiness. The first 30 seconds of this movie just makes you want to hit someone with a hammer!   This movie was way way WAY way over the top, especially in the first 10 minutes. This movie could have been made for the 90's, like all those old comedy movies, and they'd still get a laugh out of it. The acting in this movie was really bad and all of the characters felt very stupid.   The worst part was when you first see this movie and you see the "pregnant" girl walking to the woods with her lover, and that she was about to fall off a cliff and die.  That poor girl!  When i heard that she got pregnant, i was sure that it would be a great ending.  If this movie had been made in the 80's, it would probably be considered funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a pretty bad movie.   The story lines and the acting in this film are very weak.  We see that every one of these people is a complete loser. It was hard to follow the story lines.  Most of the film is a fight scene with two guys just sitting around and taking out their anger on each other.  The plot was so weak that it makes you wonder why they bothered with it.  It was just a bunch of people getting into some random bar fight.  I hope that someone is reading this and sees this and says to themselves, "I can do that".   This movie is a very slow build up to a very bad ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was never a fan of movies like this. I found the acting and plot to be terribly cheesy and not believable.   This movie should not have been made.  I wish somebody had told the studios that this would not work and that they would be better off making a more believable version. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie, while having its moments, was too formulaic and poorly shot, making it difficult to enjoy.  The acting was not the best, but I found it amusing.  I would not recommend it to a comedy or horror fan.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you can't stand this movie, don't waste your time watching it, the actors are not in great shape and the plot is just stupid.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have read other reviews of this movie and have seen it once or twice but this is the first time that I watched it. I like this movie a lot but it didn't do any justice to it.   It is a terrible movie that you don't need to see. It is just boring. There was nothing exciting about it or any of the characters.  They had to make this movie in the 90's or so and they ruined it. The only good thing is that they kept the sound of the music on for a few seconds.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I went to the theater to see this movie. When we got in we were told by the ticket taker that we had to leave because of "grizzly bears". We looked at each other, looked at the theater, looked in the bathroom and there were no bears at all. The theater was packed with people and it was cold. We then tried to go on the second floor to see a movie, and the taker told us "No we have to go upstairs". We tried to get up but were not allowed. It was then that we realized that this movie is horrible, bad acting, and really nasty to watch. This movie made me wish I was a bear and I would get in a fight with someone and just kill them. This is definitely not worth a second time. It is a real shame because this movie had a lot of potential but it was ruined by bad acting and acting that is just wrong for the story. - July 17, 2009Ticket taker was a fat jerk
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a real embarrassment. The acting is bad, the story is very thin. The film looks like a cheap exploitation film, and the whole thing feels like it was filmed in a day and a half.   I will never watch this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie takes place in the mid-west during a drought, and one of the main characters (Bruce Willis) is trying to save water for a spring he's growing a plant for. One of the people in his group (Bruce's daughter, Charlize Theron) shows up, and she tells him a story about a guy in the river who is being attacked by a shark. She's a little bit too convincing in that case, I think. He shoots it, and a bunch of people in a boat follow it down the river and attack it. This happens all over the place, and is supposed to be a metaphor for the world. There are two scenes where there is a shark attack in the middle of a city, and the only reason it isn't more bloody is because the shark has turned into a human and is attacking people as it chases the girls through the city.   If you like the action genre, and like a good movie about some horrible disaster, but aren't bothered by some cheesy dialogue (see: every Hollywood movie ever), you might like this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is boring, with a plot that takes up only an hour of the film and with little more to say.   What little plot there is is explained in a few seconds, and it's never done in a satisfying way.  The actors all seem bored by the role they play, and this isn't helped by the actors' dialogue.  It's a dull, clichéd, and slow film that doesn't make me want to see the entire film.  I've seen worse, but this was worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's just so bad    The most disappointing movie I have seen in a long time  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The actors and actresses are very good, but it's all very staged. It has a real sense of reality, but if you look up close you'll see that they're just acting.   I have to agree that the cast looks great together, but the movie itself is all fake.  I wish they made a real film, just like the actors.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It doesn't start out great, but as the story progresses, it develops into something pretty good. The only thing that i didn't like about it is how i can tell there is going to be a fight scene between the two characters, but when it happens, it doesn't happen, and they get away with it. The two characters seem really good. There is one scene at the end where the main guy takes off his shirt, and when he looks at the side of the screen for a second, you can just see the blood on the screen.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wanted to like this movie. I was in a movie theater and there was a little girl in a wheelchair (they are usually on the floor in movies) that was crying. I told the movie theater manager that this movie was a great movie. Then she told me to get out of the movie because I'm not a person to her.    For those who don't know, this movie has a very realistic depiction of children being abused and tortured.  There are several scenes in this movie that are graphic.  For example, at the beginning of the film when the kids are all running away, a little boy asks the boys who did this to him and they all say that no one did. Then the next scene is a big kid's room with all of his friends. His two best friends, the little boys who were the ones who did the torture to the little boy, were playing with him.  When the little guy asked what they did to him, he was just told to shut up and sit down. At the end of the episode, the parents of the kids come and they are all just sad because they had the kids torture them and then all of the children were abused and some of the parents were even killed.  This movie is extremely graphic and disturbing.  It's just a terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie "Star Trek Beyond" had a great cast. It did not work.  The writing was horrible.  When you see a bad script, do not watch it.   I would never go to this movie again.  Star Trek fans should not go see it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad. The actors can't act, and the writing is terrible. The plot is silly and uninteresting and the acting is terrible as well. If you like a bad joke and a few cheap gags, this is for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You're going to see this movie to see a bad film with some great acting and amazing CGI. It's not. This movie is a total disaster, it was made by a very cheap and amateur director, and he clearly knew no more than a kid with an extra $150 to throw around on an attempt at making a film.  The script is filled with holes and lies, and I can't believe this guy thinks he can pull this off. There is nothing believable in the film, no story, no action, just bad acting, horrible CGI and lame dialogue.   The ending is horrible, you will be laughing and cringing at the end. I really hope they don't release this crap on DVD, I'd rather rent this film than watch it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this film. It was funny, and the characters were likable. The setting and the way it was done was fantastic.    The plot was a little confusing at times, and that was a good thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has poor acting, bad acting, poor acting and more bad acting! It's just so boring and boring, even the characters in this movie don't act like themselves at all. Even when they are talking they act like they're talking from a script. Even the best actors are not really good at acting. Even a child actor is acting like an adult. This movie doesn't seem to take into account anyone's age when making the scenes. They always act like their characters are a little bit younger than they are.   The acting is awful.  I didn't even like this movie at all, but it's even more entertaining in this DVD release. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While not as bad as some other crappy movies from this movie's era, there were still a couple of things that were just plain disappointing.  First and foremost was the fact that the action scenes were nothing but bad. I am a big fan of the Action genre (and even love watching them on my TV set) and this was nothing but "action".  When the action scenes were not "action", they were just rehashed scenes from previous movies.  I know, I know; The action was still very well done, but it still didn't do anything to improve the overall quality.  Also, there was nothing that the actor did in the movie to make him look much better than he really was.   The director of this film also made a huge mistake.  He used his own actors.  The only one he really used was a guy named Charles Nelson Reilly.  Nelson Reilly was a really nice guy, and I actually enjoyed watching him do his thing in these movies. However, it was really bad acting.  It was more about using this guy as an excuse to use a real actor as the "hero" when the real "heroes" of these movies were real actors that did the roles like Charles Boyer, Bill Bixby, or Al Jourgensen.  This movie should have been called, "How to become a real action star".  It is one thing to be an actor and do the action-filled roles, but if you have to be a stuntman, or be a real fighter like Nelson Reilly did in this movie (which is how they really did it in the movies), you can do it, but you better be great.  Overall, the movie was just so bad it made me regret buying this movie for almost 40 years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a comedy! I enjoyed it a lot, but it's not a comedy. It's very silly, and the characters are all a bunch of idiots and it's hard to take a serious look at the events in the movie, except maybe for the ending (which is actually pretty good).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you've ever heard the song "Rock Around The Clock" from the movie, then you already know this movie.   The film is so poorly written and acted that this film is just awful to watch.  It is so hard to believe that these people are making these horrible movies.  They've all gone over to California and are making all these horrible comedies.  I'm glad that I never had to see this terrible film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie in the cinema about 6 months ago, and I hated it. The acting was awful, and the story was so bad that the actors had no personality at all. I thought they looked like clowns.   The director of this film should be ashamed of himself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie in the theater and it was just...   A waste of time...  I didn't want to watch it.    The story was unbelievable...it just didn't make any sense to me and it made the movie boring.  I hate a movie that has no plot...that's just annoying.  Also the special effects in this movie were really bad.  There were too many CGI monsters that just did not look natural.  So when a group of girls get stranded on an island and must save themselves it's pretty pointless.  The acting was good and the girl who did the most fighting was pretty hot.  But I don't like a movie like this...it really was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an all around bad movie with a ridiculous plot and a bad acting talent to match.  The movie is set in a fictionalized world of a fantasy world where a warrior monk, named Boku, is sent to assassinate a powerful king (which I found out is pretty much the entire plot of the movie, and yet somehow we never see the actual king or the real king in the movie).  Boku eventually gets killed, so he goes to find his successor.  Unfortunately for the king, this successor is a dragon who takes Boku's crown and uses it to become king.  This movie could have been a great film, and actually made a lot more sense than what it is.   The acting in this movie is awful and makes Boku look like a pathetic little child, so that the king is like "what the hell is going on here".   Sadly this movie did not live up to its title, because the story was pretty bad and only worked in a short time span.  A bad movie that should have been cancelled.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is awful. The acting is bad, and the editing is bad. It's like if someone made a fake version of the old westerns that were way too good.   I saw it for the first time when I was in high school, and I'm glad I didn't waste any money.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think the film is a little over rated.   Some parts of it are great but some parts are horrible.  It has all the right ingredients to make a great film and it had the right idea to make it great but it falls way short on all counts.  I didn't enjoy this film at all.  The acting and action scenes are great, but the acting and dialogue are awful and not interesting.  And then you have the movie's constant references to Star Wars, Terminator and Star Trek.  There is a lot of really silly dialogue and it just goes on and on.  Overall it is not good or entertaining and it took a long time for the film to get started.  If you like action and science fiction films you might enjoy it but if you want an entertaining, interesting and well produced film that will actually make you go "wait, what was that?" then this is not the film for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had hoped that this would be a good movie but it was really boring and I would have rather just seen a crappy version of this movie than this crap.   It really sucked all the humor out of the movie, and that sucked my enjoyment out of it and made me wonder why the producers didn't want to give a good script to someone who could really work at making a good film.  There really are not that many good actors in this movie, just a bunch of actors who looked like they should be in a soap opera.  The dialogue in the movie was stupid and not funny at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is sooo bad! The acting was so bad and they had the acting coach who was sooo annoying. It was ridiculous how a poor character would have this dramatic and annoying voice, but not being able to play a character and make you hate him. The acting coach was terrible and he was constantly interrupting people and speaking behind people's backs. It just made it so annoying. If you like acting classes then you might be interested.    The action scenes were soooo awkward. The shots were not done well and there was so much movement. You get used to a certain shooting style and with this film it was just out of place. I could never believe that they made a movie about a guy being shot in the face. I loved the character though, but this is not an action film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was an ok movie, not amazing but nothing really terrible. It was also funny, a bit of a character study. The acting was decent and the special effects were cool.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a terrible movie. Very boring and uneventful. You will be very bored if you watch it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My kids were 8 and 7 at the time, so we didn't go for the older movie. We didn't know what to expect. We ended up going with the movie that the local Walmart put out for us. We had never heard of it, so this was new. It was scary, but we didn t want to leave. It looked like it was in a real house (not an old house, a brand new house), and a nice dark red and blue light shined through. The only thing that bothered us was the creepy feeling of walking around the house, but even that wasn t a problem. A family ran by, and when they saw us, they just smiled and waved. I don't know if it was the movie, but that didn t bother us. It wasn t scary as long as we were paying attention. We were very confused as to why we were there, but I think they had to be there because someone else had left all the lights on. The kids thought it was a movie and asked questions, but the parents kept them quiet. After a while, we started to hear voices coming from the house. They were all young boys, but it was difficult to tell who they were. The first boy spoke English. We could not understand any of his words, but he was the only one who sounded normal, and we could tell he had never seen a movie before. The rest of them talked in a different language. The most confusing was one boy, who was a skinny 14 year old with a very long, dirty blonde wig. The girl at the end of the hallway had a very nice face, but when she looked at us, her face changed. She had a big smile on her face, and her eyes were really red. We thought she was one of the older girls in the movie because she was speaking in a foreign language, but she looked too old for a 14 year-old girl. There were other strange things that we didn 't understand. One of the girls was standing at the corner of the driveway, but was never there when we arrived. She came and went when we asked, but whenever we asked her, she always seemed so angry, and she was always saying something like, "You'll have to wait and see." I would not stay in the house with those people, and I would never watch a movie with them again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was shot in one continuous take for this one reason.   I was very disappointed in the movie.  I'm not sure why the director decided to shoot this as one take.  The special effects were lame and the acting was bad.  If you've seen this movie you know that it is a poorly shot, cheap movie. It isn't bad for a college film but the director had a lot to learn. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like to watch bad movies on my friends, but this one was so bad that I don't remember it at all.   It was very obvious that the writers made the movie up to try to get some attention, as it was a really bad movie.  It has some decent acting but it was so contrived.  The characters are really stupid and all the jokes were corny.  Also they use the "black-eyed" look of black people as a way of getting away with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is a small chance that this movie could become a cult classic. The acting is not good, but it is not bad at all. The story is great. The director tries to make the audience think that all this evil is coming from a guy with a gun, but the whole movie is based on a girl's love story. It is sad, but I still enjoyed the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't know what to expect from this movie, and I have no clue what to think about this movie. I watched it in the theaters. It was in a poor light theater. I am not a big fan of the dark, moody movie. The actor and crew was very nice, but the movie just didn't make me feel at home. I don't know why this movie is rated so high. The acting was not so good, and the production value is not there. I think it is just one of those cheap action movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had no idea who the guy who played the lead was or that he was in this movie until after I saw it and he was not a good actor.   This movie was really badly shot. The bad part of the film was the actors. The camera movement and the lighting were not good at all.  This would have been an okay movie if the lead had been a good star.  I never read the script so I don't know if this guy's name was in the script but I doubt it.  The only one who was good in this film was Frank Sinatra.  A really terrible movie and I really hope it never happens again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found this movie extremely boring.   As a huge sci-fi fan this was a disappointment.  It's an idea, but the execution is bad.  This movie isn't that far off from the original but it's way more boring. You should watch the first movie or check out the original if you're a fan of the franchise.  There's just so many things wrong with this movie.  The production is terrible.  They use stock footage from the movie and don't even try to improve it at all.  Everything looks like it was recorded in a day and it makes you wish they had just shot on film.  When the alien is coming in for the kill they should have made it look like it is coming for the rescue.  That's it.  One shot, one shot, no explosions, no blood, no nothing.  I don't like this movie at all and it's just not worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a terrible movie. It has some good scenes, but everything else about the movie is awful.   The actors who play characters in this movie are terrible. They have very bad personalities. The bad acting is a big problem in this film. The only one who really looks like a bad actor is the villain (the one who is dressed in black and is talking to the group). He doesn't look like a nice guy. He has a nasty look about him. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While this movie was really funny, the acting was absolutely horrendous. My husband and I laughed out loud a couple times and it made me want to scream "OH MY GOD!!!" at the screen. The only real actor in the movie was Chris Rock. The rest of them were all really annoying.   So that was my only complaint about this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I guess I was expecting more from this movie.   The acting was so bad, but so was the plot.  It was more about the money than the acting.  This film is a parody of The Exorcist.  I really don't care who is doing the making of the movie, but I want to see real exorcisms.  There were so many scenes where there were only two people in the room.  These actors should have been paid.  My favorite part of this movie was when the priest (James O'Brien) said "we don't know if it's real or not."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an awful movie. Very poorly directed and casted. The only redeeming thing about this movie is that it is funny as all hell. It doesn't even seem like a joke and more of a darkly twisted joke on the industry. I would not recommend this movie at all unless you like horror films or are in need of a laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My family went out to see this movie on a family night. My 8 year old son kept laughing at a guy that didn't even talk and acted like a total dumbass. I don't think he was even in the movie! I don't remember any dialogue with anyone other than this stupid guy and I didn't understand a word he said.    "I' m sorry, I can't hear you."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved this movie but it was so dull I felt sick to my stomach during the entire movie.   This movie is about a small group of people who live in a house full of people they don't like but they don not care because they have money.  They live in the house until one day the owner (who is sick of the whole group) decides to get rid of them.  These people are not bad people and the people they hate don't even know who they are.  There were some things in this movie that made me angry but most of the movie made me bored.  I did not have much of a time playing this game because the movie was so boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was poorly done.   We went to see it in theaters, but the people who were in line behind us made a big deal out of it. We went up to the screen, and it was awful. It was almost as if the actors and actresses had never seen a good movie before.  The actors/actresses were bad, the music and scenery was terrible, and the plot was stupid.  My wife was laughing at every little thing, because she knew this was the worst movie she had ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is another bad movie.   If you can't take a comedy, then do not watch it.  The acting is awful and there is nothing funny about it. If it is a comedy why does the whole movie be about it? It seems to go nowhere.  It is so bad that I'm still laughing about it over a year later. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a horrible movie that had the potential to be very good, but when it went to be made, it was done so poorly that it was worse than the terrible movie it was supposed to be. The script was bad and poorly written and the story was bad. The acting was horrible and the characters were not believable. The only people who had a chance of making a good movie out of it were the producer and director and they gave up when they saw the film and had to scrap it.   The film was supposed of being the first film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and stars John Huston and Katharine Hepburn and it was a hit at the box office. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After watching the terrible sequel to "Escape From New York", I was expecting more from this movie, but even so I wasn't expecting it to suck so bad.   The plot is really dumb and there's not a lot to it.  I feel that the director was trying to imitate Michael Mann's film but failed miserably.  The only reason it's good is the acting of the young actors.  When they got caught in a bomb-sniffing dog-team, they had to hold hands for about 10 minutes to save their lives.  A bomb sniffing dog can be pretty dangerous.  And the fact that the dogs aren't trained to help in rescue operations, but rather just to smell them, is ridiculous.  What did you expect the dogs to be good for?  I don't want to know what the plot was for a film like this.  This isn't even a good horror movie.  It's just a cheap and unoriginal story.  Why didn't the producers just hire a professional horror director like James Wan to direct this movie?  The ending was just awful.  Like all of the other people who have seen the movie, I'm sure the filmmakers were inspired by "E.T." to write a movie like this but instead they went with a terrible plot and horrible acting.  There were so many plot holes that you could drive a truck through them.  They could have made this movie with no special effects at all, and the movie would be the same.  If you want to see another movie with great acting, but without a good story, you should go see "The Sixth Sense."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is no redeeming aspect in this movie. The movie had a good concept but its execution was so weak, that the movie became a complete failure. The cast were great at one point, but after that they just didnt have much left to give. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I did not like this movie at all. It was bad, but not bad. The movie was very boring, and there was nothing to the movie. The actors were not at all good, and some of them were terrible. It wasn't a bad film, but it wasn't good either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember watching this movie as a kid. As a kid, I don't really remember much. I remember I liked the characters in this movie. The plot is pretty predictable. However, I still like the characters and the actors.    If you want to see a good horror movie, go watch The Texas Chain Saw Massacre instead.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad film.  It is poorly shot, poorly written and very poorly acted.  There are a lot of things wrong with this movie: a good story is turned into a nightmare, a good script is changed, a great cast is wasted on a stupid movie, the editing is bad and the acting is bad.  This movie is terrible and a waste of talent.   The ending is horrible, and the whole movie was stupid.  The story of the film is that a rich person is being killed in a plane crash.  His family members decide to throw him a surprise party on a yacht in order to keep the money from him.  Unfortunately for them they cannot keep their promises to throw the party.  They have been promised $10,000,000 and end up with $100,000.  As the party is getting ready, a wealthy man, named Don, arrives with his wife and son, who has just been born.  Don invites his friends to the party to keep him amused, but they are not amused at all.  He gets mad, yells at them, and throws a party himself.  These friends end up getting killed, and in the end Don is the only one left alive.  If you have seen the movie "I, Robot" or you know it from any other movie it is almost the exact same story.  A wealthy man is invited to throw a party for his friends, but of course none of his friends show up.  Then one of them does, and at the party they all kill each other.  I have seen a lot better movies but this is one of the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In short it's a movie I watched and gave a 3/5 on. The actors all have a good performance, but there are very few decent parts. I wouldn't want to see it again unless I wanted to see some good acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting is terrible.   They are just playing people they find funny and it doesn't work.  If this movie would have been directed by Michael Bay or a movie in the 80's it would have bombed but for what it is you are wasting your time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My family and I loved the movie. The story was good, but the acting was horrible. It was so bad, I thought for sure the actor would get killed. The way the lead actor, who played the doctor was playing his scenes like a puppet was a little disturbing. There was lots of closeups of his hands and a lot of back and forth with the cameraman.   For a good movie, you would expect a little more than that from this cast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was very bad. This movie is just a cheap, poorly made, cheesy, and boring movie.   A bad movie. It was very short, and it doesn't have a real point.  The plot was a very weak one.  I saw this movie at the theaters and I would never see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is about a girl who is raped by a guy with a shotgun.   This movie has a very bad soundtrack with lots of annoying songs like "Jingle Bells", "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot", "Candy Cane" and a few others.  The scenes with the girl who has been raped are very weak and the movie is really a waste of your time.  I give this movie a "D"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had high hopes that this film would be a classic! I watched it and thought I got it! But the ending was a let down. It was boring and not at all good! Not to mention the characters were all the same.   A bad film, not worth the price of admission... I did see it as a Christmas special and I had no expectation but was still disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was horrible. A few people thought the movie looked cool, but after seeing it again, I was disgusted.   I know I have to admit that some things were cool in this movie, but the director should have stuck to a good movie for his next film (The Last Samurai). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can say that I was not the most impressed with this film.   The plot was very weak and the acting was terrible.  It was just the usual cliche things about a woman wanting a man and all that.  I thought the acting of this film was awful. I mean I thought I saw Tom Cruise in this but his acting was so awful I was wondering how he got into this movie in the first place.  If you are expecting a good film like 'Funny Girl', 'Jagged Edge' or 'The Last Samurai' then this movie is not for you.  The music was so bad that it was a real let down for me.  A lot of the songs just sounded the same.  Even though the movie was over thirty years old this film really needed a make over.  This movie was not worth watching at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie sucks   The only redeeming factor to this movie is the acting.   I know it's a comedy and this movie has a joke that makes you laugh, but it's not funny.  They use the actors as props   It's bad acting and the acting sucks.  I thought that they would use the real people but there is no difference in the acting at all.  When they talk, it sounds like they are talking into their microphone and not with their mouths.  This will make you hate this movie  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know what it is about the movie, but it is just a total failure.   When we first see this movie, we are led to believe that it is a very bad movie, as it seems like it was done by the guys that made the movie version of Rocky & Bullwinkle. However, after watching this movie and going through the credits, the movie itself is not that bad at all.  There are some funny parts and it even has a few good parts in it.  It is just so bad.  The story is basically the same story as the cartoon, except that the characters are all grown up and they are no longer living in a tiny home.  But, it never comes into play.  Even the villains are just not very believable.  I mean, we get to see all these grown-ups fighting each other, and yet they have no real motivation, and even the villains never do anything that is really very special or impressive.  Just one thing I can say about this movie is that it was fun to watch when I was young, but now I am old enough to realize that it's not worth watching now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is horrible. A guy is kidnapped and taken to a creepy place that looks like a prison. When he gets out, the kidnapper is there to get revenge, and he puts on a show to have him believe that he is dead. What a dumb movie!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It has no plot and only the main character knows he is in a bad film.   The acting is atrocious and the directing is awful.  The film is about a boy that sees his father killing his mother. He goes into the woods and tries to kill him but he is caught by the police. The film has an awful ending and it really just feels like it was a cheap money maker. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie doesn't work. It tries to do a good job by the plot and the visuals, but in the end it's all just very bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was very skeptical about this film when it was first released. I had seen the trailer and I thought it was a silly movie. I went and bought the ticket and I remember watching it and wondering why I bothered to watch it.  I guess it has something to do with the fact that it had the great acting, writing, directing and music in it. I mean there was nothing that was bad about it. However, I just found it a bit dull.  The acting and writing were good but there wasn't enough going on with any one thing to make the film great. It's a good movie but it just seems that there was something missing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best part of the film is the ending of the movie.  I love a great mystery or suspense movie, so I thought this would be a nice addition to the genre.  While the movie was great and very well-made, it does have one glaringly obvious flaw.  The ending is really long, and is very confusing to those who aren't aware of the entire plot.    Overall, this movie is an excellent piece of cinema. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie really sucks, and it has the worst writing for a movie of its type I've ever seen. The plot is awful, and all the characters are unlikable. The main character, a girl named Hilda, is supposed to be a good looking woman that is attracted to other women. However, all her boyfriends are men who abuse her. She is also given the task of saving a friend from a murderous gang and the gang gets away, but not before a bullet gets lodged in her. Then her boyfriend takes a bullet for her, and the two never meet again. If you want a movie that is all about a girl who was abused by a bad boyfriend, then go to Disney's "The Rescuers."   I had high hopes for this movie but it turned out to be an abysmal mess.   The best way to describe this movie is a movie I watched and was like "this movie is bad! What is this movie?!?"
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film when it was first released. I can honestly say that I hated the movie. The acting was really terrible. The only thing that kept me watching was the sound track which, though bad, was amazing. This movie is so bad that you may as well just look away.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are worse movies out there, I will say that, but I like the style of this movie, it was definitely made on an inexpensive budget, and this film is very low budget, you see a lot of people walking around in the dark on a lot dirt, and that kind of stuff is all over the place in this movie. However, it is not a very good movie, and it is definitely a waste of time, I don't think this movie has a good ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie. It was bad because the movie makers didn't really understand the genre. It is a western/spaghetti western with an action plot. The director had a hard time getting the actors to act right. The characters were made to look like they had come off the set of a cheap movie. The acting and the effects look great in the western, but the actors don't have any chemistry together and the plot is very predictable. I really hate these genre films. I hate them so much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In order to understand this movie I need to know a little history. The movie was based on a book by one Robert Stone called "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty."   It was a funny book but it was really hard to figure out what to do with it in the movies.   Walter Mittle was the star and his character was likeable. I thought his character had a lot of potential.  The movie starts off with him in the military, fighting the Japanese and learning about how a real guy should act.  In the movie the real Mitty learns that he can't use his military background and fight by himself anymore.  He has to learn how to be an expert soldier.  This movie had a few interesting elements. The cast was strong and well-cast.  I thought the scenes with Walter Mitte were funny.  It could be a real movie if it wasn't for the plot holes.  If this movie were a real war movie it would have been an interesting take on it.  My rating: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible movie. The actors are horrible, and the script is written in a way that makes you feel bad for them.   I would not recommend this movie to anyone, because the actors can not act. They do not even have a bad role to play, they just act like each other, which is a bad idea because they don't act like people, they act like stereotypes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worse movies I have ever seen. The acting in this film was really terrible, and the plot is just the worst.   The only thing that this movie was good for was to entertain children for a few hours, and for those of you who don't like to see adults acting badly, you may enjoy watching this movie.  The kids acting in it were so bad, you wouldn't believe that some of these actors actually have acting experience!   I was so bored by it, and I was surprised that I actually wanted to watch it again because of how bad it was.  A movie that should not be seen at all, or at least never in a theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is an obvious attempt to exploit an existing movie to create an entire sequel and then release it as a straight-to-video film.   The story is terrible, the acting is terrible and the special effects are bad enough to make the entire film laughable.  The plot involves a woman who has died and gone to hell.  When she comes back from hell she goes looking for a lover and finds her dead lover.  She then tries to make him come back from the dead but he is so unhappy that she kills him.  I don't think there was a better use of this movie.  It was a bad effort that only made more money as it was an instant hit and got a lot of other people to make their own versions. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only thing that would make this a better movie is if the actors all got casted in bad movies.   I would've given this 2 stars if it wasn't for the bad acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this in a theater and I was very disappointed. It was horrible. The acting was great, the dialogue was nice but not funny at all and it was so depressing that you just don't want to go on. The main problem was the pacing. It would get bad so fast and just go into the same sort of thing over and over. I would have to see it once before I could call myself a fan of it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is such an utter failure, its a complete waste of time and money. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it has one of the best effects ever on film and has some great dialogue which is rare for a movie this old.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie made me laugh every time, but i couldn't stand the comedy and was annoyed by the story and the acting.   I like comedy and love watching it with my wife, but this is not comedy.  I've seen worse comedies and i still like them, but at least it's funny.  The acting was all terrible and there was no sense of story.  You see people that have bad lives, so of course the story goes wrong, so this is what makes the film funny. This movie is also kind of a mess in the end, which doesn't make sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When i heard this was the director of "The Room" i was expecting something really different. i went into the movie expecting it to be a different film from the others. i was completely let down. i just wanted to sit back and relax. the scenes are just too similar to the others, i just don't get it,   it's a film that should have never been made.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A "romance" film. There is no romance in this film, nothing.     It is nothing more than a love story.  It is just a love for the story telling that is in the film.  If you have ever seen "A Rose By Any Other Name" then you know what I am talking about.  This is nothing like that.  I really think that this is the best looking of the two films, but it is no more of a "rose" than "A rose By Any other name" was.  A good film, but nothing special. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - I loved this film. The story was great, the acting was great (especially for a big budget), the sets and costumes were great. The characters were great, especially the main character.   The problem is, the film was just bad. I think it was supposed to be a spoof of a movie but didn't do a good job. There were a couple of scenes where the characters looked like they were in the same scene as a movie they were making for the film that they were spoofing.    I loved how the film spoofed a famous movie but never did it justice. I really hope they make a remake of this movie because it would be awesome.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was totally out of my depth on this one. I didn't understand why I should care for the main character. She was always a little too nice and was not very interesting. The film didn't need to go down this path.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I read the reviews of this movie before seeing it, and was very confused about what to expect from it. After watching it I can honestly say it was awful. The acting was terrible, and it was clear that they had no idea what to do with the script. The dialogue was almost unreadable, and had no rhythm or flow. There was a lot of talking in this film that was just wasted time. The cinematography was poor, and just didn't work at all. Also, in the beginning of the film the two men on the boat are wearing old-fashioned outfits that look like the 19th century, when I saw that I thought they would be in the 1920s or 1930s.   The cinematographer is also the guy who made the terrible films at the end of the 80s, and this is basically him coming back for more.  The cast had no direction, no sense of direction, and very little personality. It was like someone had been drinking from a fire hose of ideas and nothing was getting through.  In the beginning when one of the two main characters is trying to get on board a boat it looks like he is trying hard, but when he finally gets on he is nowhere near as good as he looks.  When he finally goes to go take a photo of a whale it looks as if he is almost jumping out of his skin, but then when he goes on the phone he is the same pathetic character he always had.  I think a lot was wasted on this film, and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director should go out and be an actor instead of a director.   I was shocked.  I've never seen an Asian guy as the protagonist.  Why don't the directors of these kinds of movies go out of their way to cast Asian people?   A Chinese guy?  I bet the director just went out and had him play the role.  A Chinese guy is way more interesting than an Asian woman.  What's the point?  So in a Chinese movie...   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. It had many good scenes and a cool twist at the end of the movie, I thought that the characters in this movie were all very well drawn and the plot was very well put together. I do not understand what kind of person would want to see a movie about aliens and mutants and aliens and superheroes, but for me, it really made me feel the excitement of being on the edge of my seat, being in a world of sci-fi action and action movies.   There is a great scene near the end where an alien is taking a shower, and as he is doing so he sees a big meteor that is heading straight towards him. He jumps in his shower to cover the shower and it causes his shower head to explode! He then finds himself in the middle of the city.  It was really a cool scene.  I wish they had used a different ending for this movie, since they had the time to do it, but I was still pleased with the ending.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are a few things about this movie that bother me the most. I'm a huge fan of Tom Cruise and thought he had a lot of good material to work with in this movie. The acting was fine, and the story was really good. The one thing that bothered me is the pacing. It seemed rushed at the beginning of the film, and then slowed down. At times the movie seemed to go nowhere. I would've enjoyed the film more if it was a little bit longer. I don't know if the script is the real culprit, but it did slow down the pace for a while. There was nothing wrong with the performance by Tom Cruise, but the acting just didn't seem right at times.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was one of those that's great in theory. It's got amazing acting, great sets, great camera work, great makeup, and some really excellent special effects. It also had a great concept and some of the best dialogue, but it didn't work because the director didn't know how to translate that great idea into a movie.   It starts out promising with an amazing camera that shows us the interior of a haunted hotel and the interior work of the people who operate it. The sets are awesome. The costumes are great. The actors are all really funny. There are a lot of really cool special effects that don't really translate into the film. I was really looking forward to this movie and I wanted it to be great.  It wasn't.  The special effects were so poor, and the acting was so bad, that it was really easy to get turned off and bored. It was all too similar to the other horror movies that had come out that year, and that was part of the problem.  Some of the shots were so good, that I just couldn't imagine anyone not being in love with the film, so I would recommend that you give it a try. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I have not seen this movie since I was a little kid. I still remember the first time I heard about it. I heard it was really good and I really liked it.   I was going to watch it in the summer but I wasn't really that interested.  I saw it later and I think it was still pretty good. I didn't understand why I loved it so much in my younger years but I guess I was just so impressionable.  It is still a great movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember watching this movie when I was in my teens. I loved it. I love it even more now! I would love to see the director make a sequel that takes the story to a whole new level.    This movie is hilarious and very entertaining. I think it's probably one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is not worth the money.   The movie is made by a guy that has no film knowledge and no skill in his acting.  The story is so poor it is only entertaining to get that funny line from the girl that talks like an 80's teen movie, "What do you think about my dress? It's really cute."  The acting by this movie is very terrible.  Every time a actor makes a bad scene in this movie it's a good scene.  I wish they would just make a movie that has real people making bad scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was a mess of a movie with the acting being horrible. The only decent part about it was the opening scenes and the music being the best parts about the movie.   The plot is very lame. The movie had no meaning whatsoever and the only good part is the ending which made the movie worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was crap, it got old real fast and was extremely predictable. It was all too similar to other movies of the time. It had a lot of sex scenes and that was it. I do not remember the ending and the ending had not the same effect as "The Last Picture Show" "The Man Who Fell to Earth". This is a terrible movie and I do hope it stays on the shelf of the garage.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a great twist of fate, this movie is about a very special woman with an awful temper who has a daughter who has gone to jail.   I loved the idea, but it was really difficult to believe it could work.  Unfortunately, the acting in this movie was terrible.  The actors seemed to be playing characters that they thought the audience would like.  There was nothing of her character that I felt was worth watching.  A little less humor and the script could have been much better.  I have seen better films in my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I heard this movie years ago, when I was really into early 90's movies.  I remember it having a much darker tone and the fact that the whole story was told from the point of view of a young woman in love with a guy.  This was not my favorite movie of the year (I liked the older stuff better) but I remember feeling like it was just as good as the older films.  The whole story seemed like something out of a movie that I would have seen in the 60's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoy that kind of comedy, it's like a mix between an old western with an evil doctor and a silly version of the Twilight Zone. Not for people who can't take a joke.   It's really weird in places and it's a shame there's no other way to tell a story like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending was very disappointing. I thought the story was very interesting, but this movie completely fell apart in the end.   Cannot see it again   I am not sure I will even watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so poorly made I could barely look at the plot at all. The cast is terrible.  I had the audacity to think this movie would be good with a good script.   If you can't tell from the look of the movie, this was probably a huge production with great actors.  This film never makes me want to watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm glad I went to see this movie, but I have not been able to appreciate it. The performances in the movie are so awful, I don't understand how this movie is being sold at all. It's all just bad acting and bad acting actors. I don´t think the movie should be in the theatres anymore.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story was terrible. There is no reason for the movie to be made. The actors are so bad they were not funny. This movie has nothing to do with what they did in the past with good acting. The movie will never get an R rating. They are not professionals.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I remember the days where I had to watch the reruns, but now that I am in the habit of just watching films I find less annoying.   The film itself is not bad, it isn't great and it isn`t spectacular, but it isn�t bad either.  It is the story that leaves me scratching my head. I have read a lot of reviews of this film and it seems as though the majority of them have the same question: How could a filmmaker, no matter how good of a writer, make such a dumb film?  It seems like they have a big problem with a writer writing this stupid story.  One person on the Internet wrote the following: The director, Gary Gordon, decided to make a film about a group of old friends who all get together for a birthday party. However, the friends don't all have the ability to speak, so instead they have their dogs play the part of the friends.  Gordon and his writing partner, Michael Caine, were obviously working from a script, but they had no real idea what they had.  The writing in this film is awful.  They just don't seem to know what the story is supposed to be about. They tried to make something about old friends, but the whole film comes across as a bunch of drunken friends trying to have fun.  These characters are all very annoying. Caine is really off-putting and just kind of sounds like a drunk.  I can never see what he wants from the characters and the whole time the plot is just going nowhere. The actors don't even appear to know how to act.  Caine has no charisma, he just sounds like he has been put through the wringer.  This film is just a waste of time, but there are a few parts where it seems that they tried really hard to make it better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was very entertaining. I loved the idea of a man and woman running from police and trying to get off a train that was not stopping at the stop in front of them, and the way they got away was very ingenious. However, after this film, I am no longer interested in any film which uses the idea to explore social issues.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A film of the '80s that I can't see anyone enjoying is "Rise of the Planet of the Apes." In my opinion, this film is bad.   It is a very poor use of computer generated imagery and the only use of actual apes is in the movie's finale.    The story is very predictable, especially from a third party's point of view.  It is also very badly acted and filmed.  There is no humor.  It has a very boring villain, no real motivation and only a few "scenes" that are extremely boring.  I would have preferred to see a decent film that was not based on a comic book (like "Planet of the Apples").     "Rize of the apes" will do well with some people who like science fiction or who want to watch apes in action.  For the rest of the world, this movie is nothing more than an uninteresting rip-off of the "Planet Of The Apes" comic book series.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a total embarrassment. The cast is terrible, the acting is terrible and the plot line is complete garbage. The story is so bad it almost makes sense, like you are reading it and then some idiot decided to act it out. Not funny at all.   The acting is atrocious and the actresses seem to be trying to pass as one of the characters. It is hard to watch some of the lines. There are some funny lines but it was the acting that made this movie what it is.  The ending is extremely cheesy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I got into a huge argument about this movie, when she said the only people who like it are old people or people from the 60s. She is one of those people. We watched the movie, she hated it. The characters were flat. I mean really really flat. Like no personality at all. They didn't even have to do anything for their scenes. It was just like the actors didn't care. When I think of the original 'The Birds' I can't believe these actors would do the same thing. So glad I didn't pay to see it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a very, very bad movie. I did not like it at all. The only thing I liked about it was the way it showed how a group of high school girls can get away with doing anything they want to to get attention. The girl's were cute but their actions were not good for their social standing. I really don't know what they were thinking. I guess they did this all on their own, but still, how does it feel to have the school's social standing taken away from you so easily, even by a bunch of girls. It's just really wrong.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a good one. However the whole reason for the movie is just a "buddy movie" (for the main two characters). The movie seems to be an attempt to make a big money movie for a few hundred thousand dollars (in Hollywood terms) for two characters. I am sorry but this is not true acting, the acting is very poor. In the first movie (which is very good) the main character (the one who wants the money) is the only real actor. In this movie the other two are all trying to be funny and funny is not acting. So when the main characters tries to be "buddies" you have no idea what is going on or if they have a real relationship at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen all of this before. Not a bad film, just not the best.   It's a decent story but if you know the characters and don't care too much for them, you'll never care about it.  Marge Gunderson and her sister Linda (played by Shirley Jones and Susan Hayward) are sisters who work in a department store. They have never been home and are living with their mother (who's played by Marlene Dietrich) in an apartment. On New Year's Eve, they are visited by the local police. They had received a phone call from the store that someone had stolen a big chest of jewels. But this doesn't stop the police from going to the apartment where the sister and her mother live.  The "real" chest of gems was never found and is presumed lost to the world.  Linda and Marge's father (Raymond Massey) is a newspaper deliveryman. He never liked their mother, especially Marge, and she never liked him. They were always fighting and Linda's sister Mary (played at times by Marge) was always in the way. So in order to get a divorce, she had to get an alimony and child support.  So what happens?  Marge is convinced that Linda is behind the thefts. Her parents are skeptical and think she may be crazy. So why is she so sure?  And what's the result?   At one point in the film, Marge has a flashback to when she was a girl and had a dream about Linda. Marge had been taken away from her mother and her two sisters and locked in a cellar. Her mother told Marge that her body had been found in a creek and that she would never be seen again. M, with Linda as her guide, finds her body in a river. At this point, Linda starts to tell Marge everything. Linda says that her mother was being followed by a "big man with a dog" when she left her house. Mature themes, right?  However, this film also shows that Marge Gundersen's world-view is flawed.  Linda's mother never went anywhere without Marge in tow. And yet, she knew of the store thefts. She knew the way the thefts had been committed, even though Linda doesn't.  She just knew of Linda and didn't ask about her.  And in the last few minutes of the film she goes to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad.  The director decided to include a fake interview with a guy in jail for rape in the film and decided to add the fact that the guy was gay in the interview, and I don't think it's fair to give it any more credit than it is.   The whole movie is just bad. I am sure it was an incredibly hard movie to shoot.  I think the director just wanted to make some quick money and was not thinking about the impact his film had on real life.  When this guy is arrested he is treated like crap.  They don't care that he was arrested for rape and his lawyer knows this.  His lawyer goes into his house and tries to get him to plead guilty, and he keeps saying that he did not even rape the girl, that he only "made her feel bad."  He even says "I wanted to rape this girl, not feel bad", and the girl says "he made me feel bad, he said "I like the way you smell, and your mouth is so nice" "  The rape scene was fake.  For starters the victim wasn't even wearing a skirt and had nothing on.  Instead of saying "I did not do this" they said, "she was wearing a very short skirt and my penis slid in her vagina so easily."  At one point the victim says, "why did you do that?", and the other guy says, ''we did this because we love you".  It's just not right to make this movie and then treat the real rape victim like crap in the movie.  And I guess the film's biggest problem was that it was so easy to fake, they could have easily gotten some girl to act the way the victim was.  This is an example of how hard it is to get an accurate portrayal of a real life crime.  It made me sick, not because the movie was bad, but because it made me want to get a real crime on film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A great way to introduce a young audience to the genre is to start with a very funny movie, that is not only funny, but very well done.   I had high expectations about this movie, and they were well exceeded.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially to young audiences who are interested in the comedy genre, as there are some good gags, and lots of laughs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As the title says " The Godfather Part III " does not live up to the legendary Godfather films and has become a disappointment. The film was filmed in 1991 and the last scene was filmed just after the end of the last film. The production was terrible and not up to par with the last films. The acting was horrible, the costumes and sets were not up enough and the editing of the film was not as good. A very poor film, not worth watching.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie starts with a shot of an old man sitting in front of a house. There is a man at his door asking for his wife. He walks in. The old man says he just wants to give her a hug. The man comes over and gets into bed with her. When she gets up, he says he has to go back to work. She says that she would love to see him. He leaves, and the film cuts to a scene where the old man is sitting in his kitchen. A young woman has walked by. The film cuts back to him. The young woman gives him a hand job. He gets up and walks away. The girl stays and tells him that she loves him.   It is a film with no plot and no story. There are just two characters that go from point A to point B.  This film has been shown at some festivals, but it is not worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not going to try and make this a perfect movie. There are parts in it that are kind of cool. And, to me, this is the beginning of a series. I'm sure that there are plenty of cool things about it that haven't been revealed. There is a nice little story in there. But it really just gets in the way.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie I liked as a child that I thought was a masterpiece. Sadly, it turns out to be a terrible movie.  The plot is a farce, the acting is terrible, and the story is ridiculous. This movie was made for children.  A long, long time ago, there was a group of people who lived on an island and there were these people called "Poles". One day, they discovered the island to be uninhabitable and left. As they were leaving, they heard a noise coming from the island that is far off in the ocean. One of the people was carrying a piece of the island, he is called Pole, and he is saying to the other people:  "The piece of this island is getting bigger and bigger". So, he goes up in the boat to the island and he finds a large piece of stone.  They put it on the island one by one, and it becomes bigger and gets to the size of an airplane.  Pole goes down and says "My dear brothers, I'm going to come back and take the piece of island back to the Pole, but first I have to go back to sea with this piece". But the other two brothers go with him and they leave behind Pole and his piece. Now, there are other people living on the islands and they all want the piece. One person is a woman who lives on the land and she is very angry. She wants to take the stone away from the other island people and she goes to the stone to take it. Then a person comes up to her and says: "Your piece is very nice, but it is not big enough to take away the other stone. Therefore I'm taking my own piece".  The women goes back and takes a piece and the man takes his and that is how they get to the plane. When they come back, they take the plane back to Pole and they tell him that they want to have a peace meeting with them.  When Pole comes, they tell them they were wrong to call them Poles. So, they say that they are Russians and they are going to take over Pole's country. Now Pole is so angry, and in that moment, a huge rock comes from the ocean and hits Pole, killing him. Now people start to say that it is Pole's fault that he was killed. But, everyone says they only wanted his piece and to have peace.    The film is over for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie before, and I thought that it was very enjoyable! I love watching old silent movies, and this one is really good.  It's kind of like "the silent movie" of the silent movie era, but with much more action and more blood.    The acting is good as well.  This is a classic silent movie, it's kind o funny, and it shows that even the people in those days thought that this type of film was pretty cool.  I think I got this movie at a flea market a long time ago, and found it on the ground!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't think there's any way to review this movie with a straight face.   The writing is all over the place.  It starts out slow, but then goes off the rails, and all of a sudden it's just a horrible movie.  One thing that caught my attention is that the story about the kids at the beach was told by a guy named Don who has a really terrible accent.  The movie doesn't really make any sense, and a lot of the humor comes from characters just making up whatever they want.  My favorite part of the movie is when the mom goes to see her kids and the director goes on a long monologue about how he's going to give a gift to her kids, and the mom replies "That's my boy!" and she kisses him.  This movie is really lame and not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you like horror movies with the usual formula of a killer and some survivors you can look past this and find a good movie for you.     It is only a few days since the release of the first trailer and we already can already see some disturbing scenes in the movie. I saw this movie when it was already in theaters and it did not live up to the hype.  This is a horror film about a man who finds himself stranded on a deserted island. He must try and survive on the island and kill the killer and his henchmen that are after him.  It is very obvious that the writer of this movie had seen a few other horror movies and decided that they would make good additions to this film. However this film is not a good adaptation of the book but a cheap ripoff that is not even funny.  The first half of the movie is decent but the second half is just awful. The best part about this movie is the killer that looks nothing like the book. In the book it is described that the killer was wearing a mask. Now, it looks like he has just been in a fight and is now wearing a black mask. Also, his mouth is a lot more open in this movie and it looks as though the killer is speaking through his teeth.  If the movie had not been so awful it might have been ok. The acting is good though and the action is quite good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There were times when I felt like my brain was about to explode from trying to keep the story straight.  I really liked the script and even thought that the movie was a good film but there were many times when the story just became too confusing.  For example I found out that the entire film takes place on an abandoned ship that was built as a military base. Then as I'm about to enter the film's last scene the screen is blacked out and I just had to figure out what I was supposed to think and what the message was supposed do.  This movie is very entertaining and if you are into movies like this you will enjoy it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a really bad movie. The director really wanted to make it seem like he was out of his mind, but the actors are really terrible.   The story is not interesting.  And the acting isn't much better.  The acting is way too slow.  This movie is a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know if it was the first or not but it was definitely the most poorly filmed movie that I've seen. I was expecting something better than this. There was just way too much wasted screen time. The actors weren't even in the same frame of the scene. The action scenes were poorly choreographed. It wasn't just the special effects that was off. The story was just bad. The dialogue was really lame and every actor was over the top. They didn't even try to act. I'm really disappointed in this movie.   A little more research would have told them to just show the movie in 3D and let the director take a chance on something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is absolutely no reason for anyone to watch this, but I did, and it was like watching a drunk guy trying to play piano.   It is also very dull and doesn't have much to do.  There was just nothing happening on screen, so I didn't really know why I was watching it, but it's a must watch if you want something to watch while you go on your lunch break. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen the movie many times, but now, after reading the review here, I feel that it is not a good movie and that it could not have been made in the 60s.   The film has too much going on and the whole production is not well thought out.  I believe that it would have been better if the actors had been removed from the picture and replaced with someone who could pull the film off.  For example, when a cop gives the man to the cop, the man is not in handcuffs.  When the man goes down the steps, we hear a little boy screaming.  But, if you watch the film, you realize that that child had nothing to do with the film.  The production of the film is horrible.  What makes the picture even worse is that it has a terrible script by Stanley Kubrick.  If Stanley Kubrick wanted to make a great film, he could have.  He should have made a documentary about the people of Hollywood.  This film should not be seen.  All I can say is that this movie is not good.  A film by Stanley K. would be more worthwhile.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first time I saw this film I was shocked, I just didn't expect to see such a poor movie!   I never liked bad movies much but this one just didn�t work for me.   It was all CGI and the effects were a little too good for my tastes.  The plot didn�m very hard to follow as the villains were very unsympathetic and in the end it really became a running joke of me not wanting to go into the theater again.  I really wanted to like this movie and I really thought it had a chance but I just couldn�t. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's so bad that even when the movie was over, I wanted to watch it again just to prove how bad it is. It was so bad, I had to see a few more minutes just to make sure I was actually watching the movie and not some other show. The actors were bad and the sound was so poor, that it made the actors look like crap. I would never buy this movie or watch it even on VHS if I were you. This is a total rip off of a real old film called, the Bitter Harvest. In this movie, a man is sent to kill the farmers who grow opium poppies in the fields. He goes off the rails and does all kinds of things that make him look stupid. When the movie ended, I just wanted to go out and find this guy so I could show my friends what a joke the movie is.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this was the worst movie i've ever seen. i was about 7 and this movie was showing at my local multiplex. i saw this once and then never saw it again. it had a great score from all the reviewers and looked like a great action movie, but i had never seen it before and had no idea what was going on in the movie. i thought it was a real great movie when it was showing in my area. when this movie came out and the score from the reviewers got low, i went to see it. and it was the WORST movie ive ever seen and i would never want to see this movie again. the acting was really bad, the fight scenes were awful. the plot was a little too contrived and illogical. the special effects were not very good. it was all over the place with lots of silly stuff going on. even the special actors in the film had no personality. the ending to the movie was horrible and not at all funny. this movie sucked and i hate it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a very poor, poorly written film. A film that takes itself too seriously, a film that never has anything interesting to say.   There is a lot of great characters, but they are not given their due.  The film does not really tell us anything we should care about. The film is full of pointless action and stupid characters.  There are very few good things about this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If the reviews of this movie have been accurate, then it's a boring, forgettable movie that fails to deliver anything of substance.   The movie stars Kevin Costner and John Travolta as a married couple who are going through a divorce and having a difficult time reconciling.  They spend the whole film talking about how they love each other and how unhappy they are with their lives and the things in life that are troubling them.  But then,  The problem with the movie is that they never say anything truly profound or profound- it's all very shallow, but very effective.  There's nothing to make you think about the movie.  The main idea of the movie, is that Costner's character is a "torture artist", and Travolos character is one of his victims.  As they are going thru this horrible, painful divorce, they both have "special" abilities that they are trying to hide.  In the middle of the divorce proceedings,  they discover that they both really are "totally crazy".  The story is somewhat similar to the movie "Psycho", in that it has a "psychic" with a "revelation".  But with "Psychoo"  Travotas character was played by the real-life actor Robert Mitchum, who was the "toy" in the film and would do anything to stop Costner from killing him.  So you get the movie you're thinking you're going to get.  And if you actually try to read the comments from the reviewers of the film, they all seem to say the same thing, which is that this movie "doesn't work".  However, if you were looking for an interesting and thought-provoking movie,  this is not the one to watch.  My opinion of the people who are giving this movie such bad reviews is that  they don't know what they are talking about.  I saw this movie at a local theatre, and it was so unmemorable and unenjoyable, that I just walked out of the theatre.  You can't get much worse than this.  This movie isn't a "masterpiece", and I think that people who think it is, probably don't even like movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is ok and it's got a decent acting, it also has some funny stuff like a scene where the guy's wife tries to find her panties, and when she finally gets there it's a mannequin. It's got good effects, but the writing isn't great, and the acting isn't that great either, and I'm not sure how much was actually filmed.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so bad that you would expect to find in a sewer at night. I really do not understand how some people make this kind of movies.   The acting is the same over and over again in every scene. You are stuck listening to them talking to each other as if they are old acquaintances. No one is good.  The plot does not have a beginning, middle, and end.  I think it is a waste of time to watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I was going to get in and watch this movie at home but it was so bad. It's like one of those films where you get a bad feeling in your stomach. I never have wanted to watch it. I couldn't see myself being the one that actually makes it. It didn't have the funny and light-hearted aspects of the first one, it felt more like one that was designed to make you laugh and look on the bright side. I wouldn't recommend this to a friend, it is a terrible movie."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, it's okay, but nothing to write home about.  It is like something out of a movie you would find in the 80's or 90's.   This movie is boring.  There are not a lot of good actors in this movie, and it's a shame that they didn't try more with the story.  I will admit that there were moments when I thought this was an interesting concept. But the execution and story really weren't worth the movie.  The only redeeming quality is that there is a lot going on in this short movie. It's really nice to see a little slice of life in the movie that doesn't fall into the stereotypes that people are into these days. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is very poor.   It is a horrible film and the acting is all bad.  The main character is just a boring, obnoxious, pretentious, pretentionful moron.  I wish they would have called it something else.  It was just too bad.     About the actors: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst movies I have seen. It is about a woman who gets locked up in a mental hospital after she commits suicide. The woman is taken on a trip by her boyfriend (the guy who killed himself) to see his girlfriend who has died in a car accident. They end up in the hospital where they find a room and a doctor (who turns out to be a mental patient) who is looking for his ex-wife who is now living in the patient's room. The film has no plot and is completely devoid of any entertainment value. It has some good performances (especially by the doctor) and some very bad acting, but the movie is just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this movie on Blu Ray and I was very disappointed. I watched it on DVD, and I don't see any scenes which I liked at all. I was really disappointed in the acting, especially in the scene with the girl. She was so ugly, and she couldn't act. I really don't understand how they made this movie with such low budget, and in the end I just laughed, and wished I had never bought it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did not know what to expect from this movie but that's what I got... I would say that the acting was good but the direction was awful.      I never would have expected the film to be a real film but it was so cheesy.  When I heard the name I expected a movie like 'Jaws'.   I didn't think that a bad director could turn the script into a decent film.  The acting is not bad... the acting in the original movie was much better.  But this is a total disaster.  I give it two out of five stars because the acting is good and the story was really good.  It will probably turn some people off to the horror genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only good thing about this film is the "sound effects" from the classic 80's movie and the movie itself which I thought was pretty good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It really isn't a good movie. The main characters are dull, the plot is not very original, and the acting is not good. This is not a movie for people who like a good laugh at the expense of some idiot.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is made by a little movie making company called Troma Entertainment, and they do a pretty good job of portraying the early 80's American horror flicks, and the best ones they made were in that era.   These movies looked really bad, and are not that good, but they do have some entertaining parts and some of them are pretty original.  If you love the slasher genre, or are a horror fan, and like a good old fashioned slasher movie, these films are worth checking out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this was a terrible idea. The idea was great. The casting was excellent. The cinematography, cinematography is so very well done. The writing, the writing is brilliant. The characters are perfect. The acting was great, but they didn't have to play the two kids and the older boy. And it should have been a great movie. The two kids should have played an old man and a little girl and not two teenagers. I don't want to go into all the problems of this movie but it's so good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found this movie a horrible experience. It was a terrible movie with a horrible production. The actors, director and studio should be ashamed of themselves for putting out this poor piece of work. It seems a director and a script was decided on and then never looked at again. The acting was horrible. The worst is that the main guy who played the main role did not act at all. It is obvious he did not care about the role that he was given.   This movie did not make me laugh or have a good time. I would rather watch a good movie or read a good book than watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible movie. Not only is the acting horrendous (the actors look like they are going through a terrible flu), but the production is terrible as well. A horrible movie that I did not really enjoy at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I was just a movie connoisseur I'd probably pass on this one, but I'm not. The story takes an interesting turn after the action of the previous films, and it's one of the better ones I've seen in recent years. There are some really cool action sequences, and I've always liked the characters, though the "good guy" is a bit too nice and the "bad guy" a little too crazy. Still, it's got something going for it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A boring, pointless and totally unnecessary movie.   I really thought the movie was going to be funny but it was just a boring, cliched movie which was too expensive to make and I just want to say that the actors never showed any emotion in this movie and the music was just too overplayed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie back in 1999. It looked interesting but I was so disappointed. I expected a lot more from this movie.   The script was awful. It was so hard to get past the awful dialog and terrible acting.  The actor who played the main character had the voice of a 12 year old.  He would act like a 9 or 10 year old would. There were a few interesting ideas in the movie but they were never fully realized.  Overall the movie was pretty terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this in a movie theater and was excited, but the movie was bad and didn't deserve the hype.   In general, the people in this movie were stupid and very poorly cast, especially the guy who plays a bad guy.  This is not a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see this because of the star rating, but my only complaint is that they kept cutting to the front of the theater. I don't know what they were trying to say, but there was really no need to do it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The bad part about this movie is that the acting was atrocious, no one gave the scenes that needed to be portrayed a good performance and instead there was just the one or two that gave it a proper performance. The writing in the movie was horrible also, even with the actors doing a great job.   If you want to watch something like this, you might want to look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I was expecting a crappy movie, and I was not disappointed. The acting was all kind of awkward. And it seemed like there was no chemistry between all the actors. The movie was so stupid. It was like a bad comedy, which was very funny. It really was kind of boring.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My wife and I went to the movie at the local theater and we enjoyed it. They made a great movie, they shot it on a lot of different equipment and it looks like it was done with a camera car on the back of a truck.   A few scenes were good and I was entertained. I was looking forward to watching it and now I am really bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - - -   A bad movie with a bad director. It had a very bad acting team of two, I liked how they played the part of the two different people in the movie. I don't see a reason why I should see this movie, it's just one more bad movie that I don`t want to see. - -
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In all honesty, this movie is terrible.  For the most part, the acting is decent, but there are some scenes that are just lame and just not good.   If you are a fan of the show or movie, I suggest you just skip it.   The storyline was great, but the acting just was not good enough for a movie of this caliber.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most boring movie I've ever seen.   Everything was set up for the character and the camera shots of her acting as a dumb slut.  I just wanted to watch her get caught and made out with in public.  They also make her have a very interesting and deep relationship with some men but never actually do anything with them.  The only character who gets some character development is the guy who does a lot of drugs and then gets caught for it.  All these relationships were made up to have sex but never did anything but look at her, be quiet with her, and never have sex with her.  It was just so boring and boring.  There was nothing emotional about her and the only reason she had a good character was because of the drug usage.  If I could do that I would have done the same thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a complete train wreck from start to finish.  It's an attempt to imitate the classic "sudden death" movie from the early days of movie making.   A good script is good enough.  Unfortunately,  this film is riddled with bad acting, bad editing, and bad editing is bad editing.  As for the film itself, it tries to pass off as a "romance" film.  Not so at all.  From start to  finish, the movie has a strong sense of cliche.  There are two main characters.  The "hero" is played by "Sue" and "Jackie".  The hero, a big and muscular man with a hard and heavy jaw, is seen showing off for a woman.   The "woman" is portrayed by a young and pretty woman.  This woman is not shown at all and is not seen to be attracted to the hero.   She appears to be an acquaintance of the hero and seems to be more interested in being around him.   Jackie, is shown being a good guy all the time.  He has good intentions.  Jackie is a good, hardworking man and is doing what he thinks is right.   He seems to be very in love with his woman.    The main conflict is between the two characters, but the conflict is so weak that it can be easily resolved.  In the final moments of the movie, Jackie makes a comment to his wife " I got her!"  This is a strong statement, and it is made at the last minute and in a way that makes the audience think the heroine has been cheated on.  I have to admit I thought the woman was cheating on Jackie for a brief moment.  What a great idea!    There is another woman (played by a man) who appears in a later scene.  Her role is to have a conversation with the hero, and I have no idea why she shows up.   I guess it is to give the hero an excuse for his actions.  She is not even present during the first two minutes of the film.    She is only mentioned in the last ten minutes of this film.    The film opens with a group of young men playing a game of baseball.  The hero (Jackie) makes a good catch.  They run off.   The movie is interrupted with a car crash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible.  I think that the director and the screenwriter are just not that good.  It is a long slow boring movie and there is nothing that makes me like this movie.  If you look at the box cover, you would think that this is the movie "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers".  The kids from Power Rangers are all talking about the movie.  "We're still here".  There are also two of them dressed as the bad guys and there are two bad guys in the movie and they are just standing there.  There is no action in this movie or any special effects.  The only thing that makes this movie funny is when they are watching TV and the kids think that they are seeing the Power Rangers.  When the good guys turn into the bad guy, the camera turns from one side to the other and they look really dumb.   There also are not any funny dialogue.  This is a really bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was boring and not exciting, like most movie    that i saw.   My only good thing about this movie was the special effects, so i liked it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not a bad flick, just not good.   The cast is mostly likable, but the screenplay is nothing special.  I like that the film is set in the past, but not as interesting or relevant as one would like it to be.  A lot of fun is had watching characters react to each other, but one of the more interesting characters, a girl, is not even given much to do.  When it does have something to do, it does it poorly. The acting is good, and there are some good scenes and even some great ones, but they don't do anything interesting and never really seem to progress the plot.  There are some great effects, and some really cool locations, but there is nothing really worthwhile to look at.  The special effects are good, but nothing spectacular.  If you want to see a film with an interesting story, this is not the film for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is bad and I guess this is a sequel to the first film. The film begins with a good performance of a very young James Stewart and he gives a great performance. The story is about an undercover cop who is sent to infiltrate a gang that runs prostitution and drugs. Unfortunately this film is a joke. A young white man has to pretend to be a Hispanic gang member and he has a bad time because all the guys in this movie are all so stupid. All the actors are so bad and you have to try to take it seriously when this film tries to make some of it more interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My wife and I go to the theater pretty often and we are always looking for something that will entertain us. We love the old movie theater, but these movies always bore us, or make us go through the motions. One night we found this movie in a show and figured, why not see it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was watching "The Exorcist" when I saw this. I have seen this movie several times but had never seen it in IMAX.   The movie is supposed to be made in I and IMAX but the actual movie is in black and white with a wide angle lens. The black and whit film looks grainy and looks bad.  The acting is bad with the lead actor and his girlfriend (Marion Cotillard) being the worst actors I have ever seen in the movies.  I really thought the movie was going to be in black & white because the director said so but the movie actually looks bad in black&white. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's not a good movie at all. I've seen worse movies but never anything this bad. The script was awful, the acting was awful and the acting is the worst the whole film. It's a bad idea to use a man for a gag. The guy is so out of place in the film. I know he was supposed to be black but he wasn't even half black.    When this film was made it was meant to be a film about a slave and not a slave. There's something about the fact that they use a black man for the joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I was watching a great movie from the 80s, and I thought for a while that it was going to be a great film, but it was just a terrible movie.  This is why people hate the 80's so much, I love the 80, and this movie makes me want to go back in time.    A must see.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very bad movie. It was very obvious that this movie was supposed to be a spoof or parody of this film. It's supposed to make fun of the silly movie that was made for the same time by this filmmaker (who was really not that funny back then), but unfortunately, it only made this movie even worse.   If you have no patience or a short attention span, you should not watch this movie.  If this movie had a real director like the original, they would have at least added the background music and the movie would have been much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was nothing to write home about. It was bad. I hated it. It seemed like I was watching a low budget movie and it just didn't look like a movie. I didn't understand why they didn't make the movie look better.   I think I will never watch a movie with a bad director again, especially a movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So i saw this movie for the first time at the local multiplex. I was not expecting much. I mean it's a rerun of a movie that came out in 1984 and I was too young to even remember that one.   My husband and I just sat there and waited for the movie to start, and we were excited to finally see it.  After about 5 minutes of it we were both very tired. The script was not very interesting. It was like watching a cheesy, bad version of a classic movie. I guess the studios decided to do a version of the classic film called "The Last Starfighter" (which i had never heard of) and the director of the film was George Lucas.  They had made the movie for a much bigger studio, so they took out much of the "fun" in the original movie and replaced it with a bad version.  The characters in the movie were not very likable. My husband thought that he looked very goofy.  It wasn't funny at all. I don't know who made the original film, but it looks like the producers of the movie just copied the bad copy and made it worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really didn't like this movie at all. There wasn't much of a story to speak of, and I felt that the actors who were playing the parts were acting in a way that was trying to make the viewer think that they were supposed to be something they weren't.   Also, when I watched it on TV, the actors looked like they were only trying to play the parts and had no real acting abilities. I think that some people will like this kind of movie and I would recommend this movie for that purpose, but I can't recommend it to anyone else.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first act of the movie is okay and not too long, but the second act is far more interesting and entertaining. I thought it was cool that this movie was set in the late 90's, but I never found myself laughing once in the entire movie. I feel like the characters and plot were poorly designed and there was never a reason I would watch this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought I'd never come back to this film and didn't know about the movie. But it is horrible. I thought it was going to be good, but it is all about the bad acting and the bad scenes. The scenes that weren't bad are so badly done, it just doesn't make sense to the viewer. I have to wonder why there is an editor here. The director should have had someone else to edit this film. It is a bad film and I'll never see another version of it again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There was one scene that was just a disaster, I would have never wanted to see this movie, the whole movie was just boring, I thought the whole film was bad because of the one scene, but the scene was so stupid I almost wanted to laugh, but I would never watch this movie ever again. The actors were bad at everything, the only good thing about the film was that the ending was really nice, but it was just so bad, I just don't see how anyone can watch this for anything other than a laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't like this movie. I didn't want to. I'm a huge comic book fan, and I'm not a huge movie fan. I know it's supposed to be a superhero movie, but it wasn't for me. In fact, this movie was very hard to watch. There are a lot of different actors in this movie, and they all look the same. There were some pretty good comic book movies out there when I was a kid, but this one just didn't stand out. The action was good, but you wouldn't really expect that. I got tired of the characters at the end. I thought they were a little too long, and the ending left me wanting more. I really wish they had done something else.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you hate the movie "Stray Dog", I would recommend you to get a copy of "Strip Dogs" instead. It's way better than this movie!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved this movie, but the ending sucked.  It was all about making money off this film, but it was so poorly written and acted that it didn't work.  You can tell the author has not done anything but play movies to get the money, and it doesn't work, it doesn\'t have any characters, and no real tension.  In the end it all just falls apart and is just another bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a shame, this film is so bad. The actors are so bad and the editing is so shoddy, it's like watching someone shoot a video on a phone.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen this film once before and was really bored.   What's so bad about it? Well, it's so stupid and contrived that it can't be enjoyed or understood, and it's not funny at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the worst movie ever made by the legendary Robert Zemeckis!  The acting and acting ability of the actors is pathetic.   It takes me 30 minutes to finish watching it!   My husband had to sit and watch it for a whole afternoon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A poorly written and acted film that has little to no substance. The film was poorly timed and the actors are not good. I felt like they spent time on scenes that were unnecessary, it was as if the film was created just for the sake of the title.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a joke.   I laughed so hard while watching it I threw up.  My husband and I watched this in a public place, a bar.  There were a couple other people there.  All they knew was that they were having a good time.  The movie was bad.  I was laughing my ass off the whole time. I laughed while watching the poor girl fall for this guy's advances.  She was so upset that she didn't even want to go home.  This poor girl and the poor guy get married in this movie.  They have a kid.  You'd think after all that they'd be happy.  He's really stupid for doing this.  How can he not see that she's really hurt?  He doesn't even care that she loves him or that she wants to live her life.  Now she's married to this asshole?  What a joke!  It would be better if he would have just asked her out and she would have said no.  After all, if she wanted to go out with him he should have just said yes!  When the movie was over I took my shirt off and looked at myself in the mirror.  What was I doing?  I should have told this to my husband and not him watching this movie in public.  It took my husband 30 minutes to get out of the bar and see what was going on.  In the end she ended up sleeping with the guy and her life was ruined.  If you're going to go see this movie, have a good idea or two, and you're not sure what to do with your time, this is the movie for you.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry, but this film is a disaster. The acting is bad, the costumes are awful, the location choices are poor and the acting is just bad.   This was just a rehash of another mediocre western film (and I've seen several) that was released about the same time.  It's no surprise that the studio couldn't figure out how to make a decent Western, because all the studios tried to make bad Westerns and none of them worked.  This is a complete failure that makes no sense in the slightest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was pretty bad. It was a "movie" and it was trying to be something, but I didn't like it, not even in a bad way. The main character is dumb, and he doesn't have any other good qualities. I don't know why the director chose to use this "character", but it didn't make me like it.   I think that it was probably made for a film festival, and someone just decided that it would make a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie that's only good because of its music is like a bad food you don't want to try but have to.  I can't believe that people are even buying this film.  If you love music, then go see this movie.  It's just bad music with crappy acting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the best movies I ever saw. Not only is it a beautiful film, it's a beautiful story and it's all about family.   I highly recommend this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The whole movie is pointless. I would have rather watched the last 30 minutes with no music and an actor talking in his sleep.   I'm surprised the movie has any staying power. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is one of those movies where every single word has a purpose. You don't want to look away and not be able to focus on the story.   While I didn't get what the movie was all about, the plot kept my attention throughout and I really enjoyed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is garbage.  This was a terrible movie and did nothing to help the poor ratings.  It was boring, slow and boring. The plot was completely unnecessary and the whole plot line was not worth the two minutes of screen time.  A little less talking and more action and this movie would have been an absolute masterpiece.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One thing you must know about me. I am a movie addict! The movie was so bad I almost wanted to watch a bad bad movie and then have a beer afterwards! The worst part was not the terrible acting or the bad acting. It was the complete lack of the writing. It just does not make sense. You need to really have an intelligent mind to understand why they made such an absurd movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am sorry but if you go to this movie you are going to love it. This movie is like watching a magic show. The actors do a great job and the whole movie has magic and magic realism. I think that this movie was made in the late 60's and if it is authentic, you will love it! I do not believe that it is made in Mexico.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie as a kid, and I still can't believe it exists. The only other bad movie in my collection is Mr. T - but this one has the worst acting and the worst dialog.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is something in this movie that is so horrible that even after watching it, I will never watch it again. It is so bad it's really almost amazing. What are they trying to say? Is this the world? Is the Earth a prison? It is a planet that is on the verge of starvation. It's covered in thick ice and the planet itself is freezing solid. The atmosphere is full of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and carbon monoxide. These gases freeze and cause all kinds of effects in the atmosphere. The oceans are full of methane that is leaking from the methane vents all over the planet. There are no animals on the planet, and no life has existed there for thousands of years. There is absolutely no food on the surface of the planet at all. The surface of this planet has no water. What is left are some trees and rocks, and nothing that looks like life. The animals there are extremely cold and can't survive. If this planet ever did have life, it died out a long time ago. The only way this planet could be habitable was if there were some kind of life there. If there was life, and it had created the planet and the creatures that live on the ground, this planet would have been much more like Earth. What they did was to put the creatures in a giant tank, and then they turned off all the water and plants on the top of the tank. They then shot the creatures into the air and let them fall back to the ground. This is really horrible and they really should have seen a doctor. I never want to see another alien film again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My son and I are big fans of this movie. My son loves this film for the comedy it is. As far as the drama, the whole film is just too boring. I could not care less for it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was horrible, just horrid.   The only reason the cast and director got to make this movie was because they didn't want to make a movie about the KKK!   I watched it on cable, with the sound off, and it was sooo bad it made me sick.  They took a story that could have been made into a much better movie, and ruined it by making the KKK into some kind of cute little kid's game.  I've never heard of such hatred ever in my life, but here it is on the big screen.  It's just sooo offensive.  The music, the acting, the way it was filmed, the camera angles, the actors' acting and how they would look at the camera and smile when they were playing, the whole thing is just awful.  You can't say anything about this movie without thinking that the makers of it are racists. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very bad movie. Very bad. Not funny at all and most of the dialogue is recycled from a dozen other movies. I don't recommend this movie to anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was a really cool idea. But the whole movie is totally out of control. It seems like the director was trying to make a horror movie but ended up making something way worse than any slasher movie.   I don't know why they would have to use that many dead people.  It would have been better to use a lot of zombies that aren't as good looking.  I would have loved to see the film being made in the 60s. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you go to the site to see this movie and you are really not going to enjoy it, just go to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-wFv7r8lwU  This is just a bad remake of a bad horror movie, the remake of The Amityville Horror was a bad version of a good movie and this is not a bad but a really lame version of it.   The acting in this movie is atrocious.  The special effects and makeup were poor and they made the actors look like clowns, the special effects did not look like a real horror movie.  There is nothing worth seeing here, a poorly done remake of an already bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is one of those that you could watch without even knowing that it was a horror movie at all. It's a remake of a Japanese film.  I really didn't enjoy this movie but it was at least okay. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film was bad, i loved the movie, but it had no personality. i wish they had changed the name of the movie to      The Man Who Would be King, or the King of Death, or   A Dark Place.   If there is an original character like that in the movie i do not see any other movie that would be able to recreate it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed this film.   It is very slow paced but there is some great action scenes.  If you want to see a "true to life" tale that takes you back to the mid 1800's you can't do much better than this film!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is nothing more than a bad version of a really good film.   I was expecting a fun, energetic, funny, and unique film, and this turned out to be nothing like that.  It takes place in an over-the-top, cartoonish version of the 1920s, complete with a character who looks and sounds like a child.  The dialogue is cliched, the scenes are silly, and the overall tone is cheesy, silly, over-rehearsed and repetitive.  When you hear "I can feel it in my heart" or "I've got something to prove" come out of the mouths of two actors that seem like they are auditioning for a Disney version of Robin Hood, you're probably not going to be impressed.  I could have done without the overly sentimental music, but even the performances are not very good.  So, what was the point of all this?  The film is very short, and I have only seen about 15 seconds of it.  Maybe it would work as a quickie or something, but if you're looking for something good, give the original version of "Robin Hood" a try instead of wasting time on this cheap rip-off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film isn't worth the price.   The only good part is the part with John Travolta that was so funny I forgot it was a movie.  The other actors who were in the movie, the ones who were funny, they didn't seem to get much screentime or even the acting credits.  It just made me want to hit the eject button on the box.  This was the first movie I've ever seen with Travant and I think it should never have been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I remember when this movie first came out and being absolutely enthralled by it.  It was the first movie to ever really give me goosebumps (and to this day, when I'm feeling that way, I feel it even though I'm not in the movie, and not even in the right frame of the picture), and it was a film that made me feel very special.  Unfortunately, I never really had much time to sit down and watch it, since my father was sick, and I had to stay in school.  I also couldn't afford to have the movie on video, so I just had to watch it on videotape.  Even then, I was hooked.  That's why I'm telling you all this.   This film still is great.  But it never really clicked with me.  There was a lot of action, but the action was very tame, and it never quite filled me with that same kind of feeling as seeing the movie in the theater.  The action scenes are the same, over and over again, which really bothers me, because it seems like such a waste of effort.  For instance, there is one scene in the middle of the film, when a young girl, who is about to fall off the roof, has just been rescued by a young man.  This girl is about the same age as me when I was little (not a lot changed since then, but it still sucks, I know), and her rescuer is as young as I am now.  They are both about the exact same age, and they have the exact exact same build.  While there is no real fight scene, the guy grabs the girl and brings her down, and then they both fall, and fall, until the girl falls to the bottom.  Here is the scene, and you can see how much they have improved over time.  Anyway, as the girl is falling, this young girl falls right on top of her rescuers.  What happens next is a slow motion film (which is probably why it still makes me look younger than I am), but you can really see that the girl has not been properly warned of what is about too fall.  Apparently, there were some bad things that happened to this girl when she was a young child, and the guy in the film decided to pay them off (by trying to throw her off the building) with a beautiful girl falling onto him.  She
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I went to the movies yesterday to see a great new film, and I was disappointed. The whole thing seemed to be thrown together in a hurry, and the actors (especially the male lead) seemed to have no clue what they were doing at times. It was a very poorly acted movie with the actors not even trying. The only things I liked were the two little animals, the cat was funny, and one of the girls was cute and very funny.   I gave this movie 2 stars because of the acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The cast had no chemistry together and the story is a bit dull as well.   A good movie with a great storyline. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In the movie, this movie portrays a person who is stuck in a bad situation and needs some help to get out of it.  The movie was about someone who has a child who was born with a disability and has to live with that.  He goes to the hospital to look at a new one and he gets a new disability for the same reason.  In this movie there are people who talk bad about the movie and make fun of it but they don't know what they are talking about.   The last two acts in the movie are very bad as well.  This movie is not good at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I was a kid my uncle always took me to the movies. He lived near the movies, so he had some of the most interesting movies and would play them every time we had a chance.  There was one movie he loved that had a giant robot. My uncle and I would play hide and seek with a tiny little girl that we called Little Miss, and if we were really lucky we got a glimpse of Little Miss and the giant robot in the back ground.  I remember thinking it was just so cool.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've watched this movie a dozen times and each time it's the same story.   A woman (Carol) is looking for a way to find her husband (Hilary) who's working on a secret project in his basement.  When she finds him there she immediately falls for him.  She wants him to stay in the basement as she and her two children live there.  In order to help her out he goes to the top of the building and jumps off the building's roof.  At first I thought he died but no, he goes down and wakes up at a motel.  He is then asked by the police what he was doing.  The police say they don't know and the police officer is killed.  Then another woman (Kirsten) who lives in the house that Hilary and Carol have been staying in comes home.  Kirsten has a different story to tell, but this one goes way over their heads.  Hilary's next door neighbor, Joe (Michael J. Fox), has been hired by the government to go to the home of Carol's brother and steal the files she found.  After she was done with the paperwork she goes to see Hilary.  But Hilary is not who she claims to be.  Instead he is a spy who had been given the task of destroying files that his superiors were upset about.  While doing so he is killed when a car plows into him and he falls to his death.  So it turns out that this guy that had been giving us a very interesting story that took place in a very creepy environment had been a spy for the CIA, killed by his own government!   The acting is not great but it gets the point across and you can't help but think about how much of a monster these people were, and they were totally oblivious to the danger they put themselves in.  This movie is not for the faint of heart.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is pretty bad.   This is an absolute rip off of the 80s tv show "Rugrats".   The plot is similar.  The kids get an award for best friend, and the show takes it's cues from that (like all the other movies).   So a lot of the "story" is borrowed, but that's okay, they never really had a story to begin with.  You get a lot more laughs out of that than you do in this movie.  I thought there was a really good script here, but I think they just took this idea, made it a big cartoon, and ran with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't expect this film to be that bad.    The story is awful and the acting is terrible.  Some scenes are so bad they are unbelievable.  It's a remake of a 1980 movie and the actor in that movie is just like the guy that played Sam, the guy with the scar in this movie.  The only good part is the music in this film and it's really good.  I'm sure someone saw this movie on the black list and decided not to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is very good. I love the story about the kid who is born in the circus. This is not like that. If you like that kind of stuff, you should watch a better movie than this. This movie is horrible. There was no way to be good to watch this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is absolutely horrible. The acting is absolutely atrocious and the production values are abysmal. The action is cheesy, and the story is cheesy.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was very bad. A lot of people said it looked like a different movie, but it wasn't. I was not impressed. I thought it looked so fake. It looks like someone was making a parody of a really bad movie.    The acting was awful. There was one actress that was so bad that she could barely talk. She would say something then just stop. It was like she had an asthma attack and didn't want to say anything.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I hate to sound so bitter, but I had a hard time going into this movie. I didn't care for it at all. I don't know what's going on here, but this movie is just horrible. The acting isn't good and the acting in other movies is just as bad. All the people are acting the same, and they sound like they're talking to their kid or talking to a dog. The dialogue is just terrible. It's the worst I've seen, and it shows in everything. This movie should have been a one-hour special.    The acting in this movie was also a bit odd. There were a couple of really funny actors that I thought were going for it. One was really good, but the others just sounded like they were trying to act like their character was supposed to be funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really didn't want to go see this movie.   This movie is nothing more than a poor excuse for an action movie and a poor rehash of the old action movies.  The acting is laughable and the action scenes are so bad it is hard to watch and the film itself is poorly acted.  It is just too bad that they took the good idea of the James Bond franchise and turned it into a trashy action movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It started off well, with a fantastic sequence of music. I thought the music was fantastic. However, it went downhill from there, as the film turned into a silly "mystical" horror film where the actors wore very strange costumes that did not fit the story.   I'm sure some of this had to do with the fact that the actors did not have a real acting background, but in the middle of this ridiculous film, the actors started talking like they were from another planet.  It was an odd, strange film that went downhill, but at least it did have good music. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "If you're a film buff, you have to get this movie, for sure" -   For those of you who don't know what the hell this is... I thought I was going to see an interesting "mythology" film, and was more than satisfied. It had a very interesting look, and looked like a very old film.   I don't want to tell you what it is, because then you will have to see it, but if you're intrigued by the premise, and the characters, I highly suggest it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is just a piece of junk. The actress that played the role is not talented at all. It is also very short.   I don't remember anything about the actors performances. All you can remember is the action scenes and they do not make any impact on you. I was bored out of my mind when I watched this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is really interesting, it's an interesting way to portray an unknown place and time, and some of the actors were very convincing. However, for the rest of the film, they had little to do.   I highly recommend it, but don't bother with the rest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went to see this film with my friends and it was awful. We were sitting at a picnic table and we were talking about it and they started going on about how many people get killed and how long it took to kill them.   We were all sitting around and they were talking with each other and they kept going on and on about this movie. It was awful, you have to admit.  You get one or two decent shots and it's over in one shot. The bad guy is just standing there, nothing interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the future, when we're all on a Mars mission, what are we going to send back home? The first step is for the humans to send home a live Mars rover. The robot, dubbed "Pompeii," is so fragile that it might be thrown off course. Aboard the rovers is a crew of three, including one man who's in a coma. He's being operated on by the robot, but the brain damage is so great that he's completely unresponsive to the robot and its voice. His friend, a human named Joe, helps with the chores and communications. The Mars crew, including the robot-man, have to decide how to bring him back on schedule, given the very real danger of crashing into the surface of Mars.   This was a bad film.

The only reason I watched this movie was to impress my sister who loves horror movies. I couldn't even watch the ending, I hated it. I wish it had not been released so I could have watched it on my own. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't understand why this film is bad.   The plot doesn't bother me but it does make the story a little difficult to follow.  The acting is fine, the action sequences are fine and the director uses the action to give the viewer an idea of what happened in the war.  I just wish the story would have made more sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen the trailer for this movie. I've never heard of this movie and I'd never even heard of it's producer, but this is a terrible movie and should have never been made. The producers decided they wanted to go back to the old "cave" theme for this film, but that was already done for them by the studio that made "The Cave". I think the only thing the producers of this film had going for them was that the "caves" that they wanted would be in the middle of a desert somewhere, because that's where there are no mountains, no big rocks, and all of them are in caves that are dark, cold, and dank. They used to make movies about bad guys with no morals or morals at all and it's great for a laugh. That's not what we got with this film. The characters aren't bad or evil at all. They're just a bunch of people who have some really crazy and bad ideas. Most of their ideas don't make sense and some of their scenes don't even make sense. When you watch this movie, you're just going to want to run out of the theater. If you ever want to see a bad film with some crazy ideas and characters, then this is the film for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this on the Criterion Collection and liked it.   When I saw it for the first time, I was disappointed to realize the director had never directed anything other than bad movies.  I didn't expect anything different from this.  The acting is terrible, but the acting was pretty good for the period.  Very little time is spent on any of the characters other than the ones that are just a blur of movement.  Overall, it's a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you have not seen this film, DON'T WATCH IT. It is awful.   The cast is horrible, the directing is terrible, the editing is terrible and the music is horrible.  This is a film that should never have made it on to a movie screen.  It looks like a horrible video made to fool people into thinking it is a good movie.  I watched it for the first time on a VHS in 1995. I saw it on television and loved it. I even remember watching it over and over again.  Unfortunately this film was so bad that my parents decided it should not be shown in the family room.  A couple of years later my father started watching it again and then he showed me some of the scenes. I was disgusted.  The first time I saw this film I was watching it with my then 5 year old daughter. I loved the movie and so did she. It was a wonderful experience. When I showed her this film again she said, "Dad, that was so ugly". She then showed it to her sister who was a teenager. The two of them started laughing hysterically and she said "It is so horrible and it makes me sick to look at it".  The girl who plays the girl in the film says on the film "If I die, will you give me a hug".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a movie that is not only badly written and filmed but is so bad it could make a fool out of the person who made it! The movie starts with a horrible voice over that I thought was so bad I almost believed the person that did it to be an actual actor. There is no way anyone would actually want to read it for real. There are just so many glaring inaccuracies, and I don't mean the obvious, such as the spelling of the character names or the fact that the movie is set in a time period that was way before Hollywood became a major player in filmmaking. I am not a real fan of the movie because the acting sucks and it is completely impossible to take in at a normal speed. The only good thing about it is the ending, which was just a bit sad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was terrible. I thought the movie was just mediocre. It was a lame film that I didn't like that much. It could have been good if they had done better with the storyline and the acting.   I just wish the actor who played him was younger.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just want to add this is a bad film, it's full of bad ideas, and terrible acting, and it's over too soon.   It's basically a "fantasy" film (if you know what that means) about a boy who travels back in time and encounters elves, and wizards (or wizards are the movie elves), and all that good stuff. It starts off very well with an adventure to some castle and then gets to the point where it's all "fantastical" and fantasy and then they just throw in some "magic" stuff like the wizard casting a spell that makes a cat fly (like how it's impossible in real life), and it just gets worse from there.  It just has no heart to it, and no plot whatsoever. There's a point where they even have the girl in the film in a cage, and they then just have to put her in front of a camera and have the wizard "cast" her on his arm as if it was a magic spell, and then then they have him fly over the city.  So, yes, it starts out alright, and the kids have fun and the elf's are kind of funny (maybe the ones on screen are not funny?), and then after that point it just becomes another "fairy tale" with nothing going on at all, and you're just watching some pretty pictures and the elves flying about.  The film gets so bad, that it's funny.  And the actors, well, most of them are actors in bad films.  For some reason I had this feeling that this movie is a rip off of "The Wizard of Oz" from a "movie that was really good."  This movie was actually terrible!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best thing about this movie is it's great. It's very much the sort of horror movie you'd see in a cheap exploitation flick from the 70s. Not really any jump scares or anything like that. Instead, it's a very interesting mixture of slasher films, slasher movies set in the 1970s and more. It has a very unique setting (the college campus). It's a fairly small, claustrophobic setting. The horror here is really very basic, but that never deters from it's effectiveness. I thought the actors were amazing, as was the director. The only thing that's really bad about it is that the story didn't come together until the end. The last act of the movie could have been much better, but I suppose there are worse than that.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this for my brother as a birthday present. When he saw the film I thought the same thing as my sister. I thought he should not buy it because he would get angry at it. I was right and he did not even get through half of it and he hated it.    The only thing this film has going for it is it's director and it's actors. The actors are okay but the directors direction just kills it. The film is so long and convoluted and it just does not have a whole lot going for its story and characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film should have never been made.  From the moment we are introduced to the character, who is an alcoholic, we see that he is a pathetic loser who is easily manipulated by the people around him, a real hoser. He is one of the least interesting characters in any film and I have to say that it is clear the director didn't give much thought to this one.   I just didn't like this film and after watching a few more of his other films, I felt the same way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry this was not a good movie.  It was not bad but it was not good either.  I don't understand why it was made.  The cast are very average and there's nothing special about them.  There's no point of view.   All of the action was in the first act and it was just as boring as the other parts of the movie. It took forever to get to the action and the dialogue was really bad.  A big disappointment for the director, it took forever and a day to film it and he got a little lazy in the second act.  My rating 1/2  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's the first time I watched the film and the ending was very predictable, I mean the movie didn't have any surprises, in fact, it was a very predictable story and a very sad ending.   I can't really recommend this movie and I really didn't expect anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie and thought it was a great homage to 80s horror films. But it was totally ridiculous. I loved it from start to finish but when I saw the ending i had to walk out. The script was bad and the ending was very rushed.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "A fun trip to watch as a kid."   - A kid's movie I did watch as an adult once and loved.   My rating was based on the fact that there is a lot of silly humor in this.  The film is "The Great Mouse Detective" from the 50's, so it is a bit cheesy, but fun.  I also enjoyed the characters.  As mentioned above, it is cheesy, and is really not a comedy but more of a light-hearted adventure.  While there are a few bad moments, the overall charm of the movie makes it worth a watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was bad!   The movie is awful!  The acting was terrible!  I don't remember any of them at all.   What a boring movie!  If you want to watch a movie that will make you feel bad, this is the movie for you!  There is nothing happening!  How do people not like the actors!  It was a horrible movie to watch.  The only good thing I can say about it is that it was funny! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Shows how stupid I was when I was younger...The only good parts in this movie are the ending which I hope doesn't get a remake.   This movie was stupid as hell and had no appeal to me."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went in to see "The Big Lebowski" to take in it's art and story. Instead, I ended up at the movies because the staff at the theater said it was late and the sound system wasn't working. I ended sitting and watching for over three hours.   The plot is so convoluted and hard to follow that it makes one wonder if this is a parody of the original film, or if they went back to re-shoot the film in the same locations.  The actors don't do a whole lot in this movie and they certainly didn't help the plot in any way.  I did not have a very good time and I think if I had to spend $12.00 on a movie, I would go to a real movie theater with sound instead of watching this on a big screen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it's got some action in it. However, it's a poor excuse for a movie. It was the worst I have ever seen. The writing was bad and the acting was terrible. The acting really gave me the feeling that they were trying to be something they weren't. I'm not a movie snob. I've seen better movies. I would have never seen this movie in the first place, but I was lucky enough to see it on a tv when it was released in 1984.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad and so awful that I couldn't stand it. I was really looking forward to it.   I just don't think I could have handled it any worse.  I was so upset that I could not even stand the film.  It has been years since I saw the first film. This was the third movie that they made after the original three. I really hate these films and this is by far the worst.  They have no talent.  They only know how to make a cheap movie and this one is really, really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie. If you want to see a movie in the original tongue, this isn't the place to watch it.   It's like a cheap animated movie about a stupid fairy.  The voice acting is awful. The whole movie is stupid and the script is stupid.  A dumb movie that is dumb for the sake of being dumb.  It has a stupid concept that is completely stupid. The entire movie is bad and I'm not sure I want to be exposed to this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just got to the part where she was getting back together with the guy who dumped her.  She said that she wasn't angry, she just wanted him to apologize to her and to tell her that he was sorry.  The guy just kept trying to convince her that the reason why he dumped her is because he loved her more than him.  This part of the movie wasn't good at all.    She kept saying that he wasn't a good guy, that he didn't think she was cute.  I felt sad about the guy because he felt bad for her and wanted to apologize for his selfish ways.  But after the movie, I had a bad feeling.  When the dude called her over and said that he loved his girlfriend, I felt like he was just going to say "Yeah, that's cool.  It just didn't make any sense for him to dump her and come back and try to make up for it.  Then he says he can't be with her because she's cheating on him.    He just seems to be saying that the girl cheated on him, that she was on the guy's "bad side."   Then the guy just goes over to the girl's car and says that he'll give her a ride to his house and he'll call her back in a little while.  Like I said, it was just so confusing to me.    When she was leaving her car, she said that it was really confusing for her because of all the things that were going on in her life, but it's good for the man to think that she has a lot to offer.   When the girl said that if she can't stay with him, then she should just leave town, the guy said that his daughter said that they should stay together.   That really made me feel a bit sad about what was happening, especially the dad's words. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first few minutes are great, with a really good soundtrack by James Blunt.  The plot is pretty good, the acting is great and the whole thing is entertaining.  As far as the movie goes, its not really bad, just not really good.  I think the story could have been cut down to the absolute essentials and really pulled off this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has very bad acting and poor writing. There are no emotions in the story line and the story is too fast to get to the point. I didn't understand what the plot was all about, and didn't care. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The special effects are very weak.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "There was some decent acting and good directing and this film is a shame.   The only thing that makes me think it is worth seeing is the music.  It is a good story with good acting and a bad script."    (3 out of 5)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have been watching movies with friends for about 6 years and I must say that this movie has not aged well. It was really old when it was made and the cast were just bad. And I do not think it had much of an audience. I would not recommend it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really did not know what to expect from this movie.   It starts out very well, but then it goes downhill very quickly.  I am not sure why this movie was ever made in the first place.  The people in this movie were terrible.  From the acting, to the makeup, to... the acting.  It was just awful!  This is the only movie I have seen where they filmed in a warehouse, and then put some people in a trailer for some reason, and made it look like they were doing a reality TV show.  So the acting in this is so bad, it's not even funny.  They actually had someone dressed up like a clown (who looked like a plastic bag) come and run around the warehouse making everyone act like they didn't know what was going on.  If they want to be a movie studio, they should just make a reality show where a bunch of clowns run around a warehouse shooting people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is full of errors and goofs in the writing, acting and acting technique. It doesn't even look like a movie anymore, it looks more like a bad film that was made as a test film. I am not going to watch it again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you like movies with a few good ones, look no further. I'm not sure that anyone will find any redeeming qualities in this film, as it does have an amazing ending and one of the best soundtracks ever put to film.   The film was so good that it had to be pulled from circulation because of its high quality, and the rest of the films were made much worse after this film came out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - May 30, 2017I like it! - March 27, 2017This is not a good movie... The ending was weak, the acting was terrible, and the writing was really bad...  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie just doesn't work. It starts out good, with an old guy who can't remember his name. He starts taking people to a mansion to find out who he is, but after an hour and half, he gives up. Then it gets really weird, with him running around in a bathrobe. And after that, you realize that this is really not going anywhere, except for maybe a possible sequel or two.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen a ton of movies in my life, and this movie is the worst. It's also not very funny. There's a guy named Richard (Rip Torn) who is obsessed with the Beatles, and spends a lot of time looking at their early photos, looking at photos from the early 1970s, etc. When a girl (Joan Allen) comes to visit him in a mental institution, he decides that he wants to get her to pose for some of their earliest photos, and he pays $1,000 to a photographer to get the job done. The whole time, he's thinking about the Beatles. He goes in, but the photographer is not there. He gets the shot, and leaves, then goes back to find her. The next day, he finds the photographer dead. They figure that the Beatles must have killed him and his wife, and have been living on his estate. Rip Torn plays the photographer and he's great. He's funny, and it's so weird. The movie isn't as good as the book, and the book isn't much better. It has a very strange atmosphere to it. It is very weird and a lot is missing, but it's fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie takes a very long time to start and is pretty boring. The director is a good one and the actors do their job well, but the story is a bit overused. There are many scenes in which characters are walking, or driving, and there are too many long scenes of character interaction, and the movie is also long, so it's not very entertaining.   I do not know much about martial arts movies, but I have a bad feeling that the movie would be better if it was a bit shorter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had no idea what I was getting into with this movie! I was expecting an action/thriller movie, but instead it was a generic "drama" movie. The acting was all kind of cheesy, and the only thing I thought was good in the movie was "Mick" and the one time he is supposed to be funny. The plot was so cliche that the characters didn't even have the depth to make them more than a "dynamic" duo. This is a movie that is not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie that should not be in the public's mind in 2016 is "The Lobster." The cast, which is made up of four actors, all from Britain, and one from South America, are not good actors. They are not bad in any sense of the word, but they are definitely not good. The performances of the three British stars are pretty much the same, and while I am not a fan of the acting, I really can't blame the movie for this, as it is about a girl who goes through the process of becoming a cannibal and is caught and put on trial. There is something else I wanted to note about this movie, which I did not know about it. In a scene at the beginning of the movie, a man (Peter Sarsgaard) looks at his watch and says, "Ah, it's so early, I need to get back to work." I have to admit, I did get a chuckle out of that, because that really could have been a part of the story. It was such a silly, random thing to do. So, I guess the joke was on me, as I thought that would be in there somewhere.   This is not a great movie. I think the movie was made with an idea that is not bad, but it was too lazy to come up with an interesting story. There were way too many ideas that were not put together very well. The story of the girl and her boyfriend (Olivier Janssen) is great, but the rest of the characters are just too similar to each other. I'm sorry I was able to see it for a mere $3, so that I could see it, but I would not recommend it to anybody. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well...what a load of bullshit this is.   It would be interesting to see a true version of this film, but it would probably be more interesting to watch it in the original language.  The script is completely bad and the director was too drunk to write it.  I would recommend this to the most retarded person.  They probably spent $500,000 making this film.  It is definitely not worth the money.  Don't waste your time with this film 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this movie expecting to see some big Hollywood star but to my surprise I was greeted by the guy who appeared in "Chinatown" with no one else than Bruce Willis! When this movie was about to be released in the late 90's I guess it was too big to get a star actor so I was excited to see it but it turns out they could not get the right guy. In a way this movie is like an 80's remake of "Chungking Express" but with Bruce in his 60's.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you think the movie sucks, just wait til you see what happened in the sequel. The bad guys did a complete 180, and now they're like a bunch of bums that have run out of money.   I think this is a good movie, but if you haven't seen the original one, and it is an original film, then you'll have a hard time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoyed this movie and was interested in seeing it again, but the ending was a little bit too abrupt, so not my favourite ending in a movie.    Overall, it was good fun with some fun characters and a nice little mystery. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. It was boring as hell, with lots of "filler". It was just bad. The characters seemed to be made up to be stereotypes, and they were terrible.   I don't think there is a good movie this year that is this bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As soon as I read the description and watched the trailer I was excited. I didn't understand what it was about until I got to the theater. It didn't seem to have much of a plot to speak of and seemed like a bunch of people were going to get together and have a party but they didn't do anything. They just all went to the diner. When it was over I thought to myself "hey there's nothing wrong with this one" and watched it a few more times. The sex scenes weren't anything to write home about. They were pretty boring to me. They didn't make any sense at all and the actors had no chemistry. There weren't any really memorable actors, so it was hard to enjoy them. I'm glad it's out there, but I really wanted to get back to the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story goes as this: a girl, in her 20s, decides to spend a day with the man of her dreams.   Unfortunately, he is a bit of a douche and she ends up with a complete stranger who doesn't even know her name.  The entire film is set up like this. A girl (an actress in her 30s) is going out with the guy of her dream.  A good movie, if you can ignore the fact that all the women in the film are dressed in pretty little dresses and they're all talking about their own sex lives. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a horrible movie this is. There were so many parts where you feel like you're going to fall out of your chair and cry. The worst part of it all is that the story is completely ridiculous and the acting is very bad. I am not sure if they could even afford to hire real people, so they had a bunch of people do their act (a bunch of fake people).   I hope that the movie will one day be made into a film with a good story and good acting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a bunch of recycled ideas from old films. The idea was to shoot a series of movies with the same actor, but the director changed every time he got to filming, so it's hard to remember who he is.   It's very predictable and I have a hard time getting the point of anything that happens.  My favorite part is the girl's name that she has in every movie.  It might have been worth watching if you want to see a remake of the classic "I Love You, Man"  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has poor acting, the worst characters, and most of the plot is very poor.  The film just seems like a money-making scam of the highest order.  It is a complete mess.   I will not be watching this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A story of a man who is an expert in hypnotism and a woman who uses him for her own purposes, this movie has nothing to do with hypnotism as most people think of it, and everything to do w with an obsession and a sex game. The characters are both shallow and pathetic. The woman is a slut, she has no self respect, she is completely uneducated and is a complete narcissist, and yet she has the ability to hypnotize people. I feel sorry for the actors who were just in this movie for the money. This is not a good movie, the acting is bad and the plot is so contrived that it is laughable, with the only thing that makes it believable is the actors, it is all a bunch of lies and false ideas about hypnotism. This movie is not for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a pretty bad movie. The whole movie is a train wreck. The bad acting, bad acting and the terrible acting and direction, all combined with the terrible soundtrack and some of the worst acting of any movie ever is a really bad movie that I would never ever watch again. The movie is very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoyed this movie. It was a fun romp to watch. The actors are funny and all of the actors had fun playing their parts. The songs were catchy and I really wanted to sing along.   This movie was not very well written. The main characters are not very good, but I think that the writer, who was married, just had too much fun.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was way too expensive for what it was.  The acting, the location, the story line, etc, were all great, but that's all it was; not worth a $20-35 price tag.  I didn't see it in a theater, so my rating is not very useful, but for $25 I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad. The acting is terrible and it's obvious the writer had zero idea how to write anything worthwhile into the script. I can understand why this movie was made and why there was an attempt to make a good movie out of the material, but when you can't even get your actors to do what they're supposed to do (especially in a movie like this one) it's a real slap in the face. I'm sure the actors did their best, but it's no fun to see a terrible movie like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst horror movie I ever watched. I mean really. I was expecting some nice effects and scares, but this film sucks. It has great effects in parts, but the characters are so stupid it makes it impossible to care about any of it. The actors are so bad, I had to put the movie down after ten minutes. I think it would have been better if the director had decided not to go any further and just had the actors get in a car and drive off. It's bad enough they didn't even show the car being used for anything else. This movie is not scary, so the actors really had to waste their talents.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie I never saw but now that I have seen it I realize how much I've been influenced by it.   It would be good to have a good movie like this to show young people about the horrors of war.  I would definitely like to see the movie again in a dark theater but that's impossible.  There are no special effects to make the war more intense or dramatic.  The scenes where the soldiers are in pain, the soldiers yelling in agony and the scenes of death by gunfire are all well done, but the story that the film tries to tell is more pathetic and unreal.  In a movie that should be realistic, the actors and actresses really seem out of touch with reality.  This movie was made in 1946 but it seems like this movie was released in 1939 or 1940 and the production values are dated.  My parents loved this movie as children and I think they would have enjoyed it as well.  It's a good film to watch with the family and there's lots of jokes to keep you entertained.  If you can look past the obvious flaws, you may find this movie entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie is a bad film and the movie I am about to discuss is no exception.  This is a film that is full of lies and I am sure there were some people involved in the making of this movie who didn't know what they were doing.  What I found interesting was that it was a big budget movie made by a big name studio.  The script is written by none other than J. Michael Straczynski who wrote and directed the X-Men movies.  It is interesting that it has gotten into this weird, bizarre world in which people think they are going to fly, drive a rocket ship, or go to another planet.   The acting in this movie is really terrible.  There is an actor in this film who is named Paul Giamatti, and I don't know why, but I found him to be quite funny.  But then I found that the actor in the movie played the same character in a movie called The Transporter.  And he actually thought the movie was called The Human Transporter?  He thought it was called Transporter 3?  It was really funny when the actor played himself in a scene where the characters have their costumes put on and he says the lines over and over and he talks in a very serious manner and then when he got into his car he took it off and put on a funny suit and was wearing a big red nose.  I also found it funny when a character was wearing an old man costume in which he was supposed to be old.  As far as the music is concerned there is only one song on the soundtrack and that is the theme song from the movie.  When I saw the movie when it came out I was a huge X-Files fan but I am glad that I have changed my mind and I think I will watch some other X-files movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is good but the film is poorly made. The performances are good, but nothing special. There are also some odd characters that don't seem to have a clear purpose. This film would be better if they had made it into a comic book. I guess it could have been made into a science fiction film, but there is too much filler in the story.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie will make you laugh, it will make a frown. I saw this movie when I was a teenager and as a teen it had all the makings for a great movie. The actor who played the part of the cop called "J.D." is really great. His performance is very good and the scene with him and the cop on a police raid is the best.   I have seen many "police movies" and this one is by far the best one I have ever seen. The cast is great. Some of the parts were not that great but it makes up for it. I was impressed by the fact that this film was made in 1978 and had the cop character play by an unknown and young actor.  I would suggest you go to see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a great movie when it was new. But after watching it again, I have to give it a B-. This movie is terrible, it has nothing to do with the novel and I was completely bored by it. The pacing was terrible, especially the end. And even though it was a "movie," it's just not very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really didn't want to go see this, but I'm glad I did. This movie was awful. It's like the writers had to do a scene with no sound because the actors couldn't do it. The only thing the actors did was act with each other in awkward ways. It wasn't a bad idea, they should've used a different cast, but they just got in each others way and it just wasn't worth it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was looking for a "good" action film and found a good one. A real, good one that leaves you with a smile.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was expecting a different film. It was not. It's a terrible movie and that was my reaction when I first saw the trailer. It took me a couple of seconds to figure out that it's a horror/mystery film. I didn't care for it at all. The acting was horrible. The writing was bad. The plot was weak. This film had nothing to do with any kind of genre.   As for the characters... there were a lot of them and I guess most were victims of some kind of terrible situation.  This was the worst film I have seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was not a good movie. The acting and directing were bad. The action scenes were stupid and the plot was silly. The whole movie made me laugh.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would have liked to have seen more of it.   The acting in the movie was fine.  They did a good job of acting as though we were in the world of the film.  But the movie takes a long time to get going and after a while it gets boring.  There are only so many ways you can make a movie interesting.  I have seen many, many movies.  Some of them are better than others.  This one was not one of the better ones.  It was very dull.  If you are looking for something good to watch with a nice group of friends, don't get this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is such a bad bad movie, it's very funny to hear this guy say that it was a bad idea to film the song with an acting talent like Elvis, and it's just a really bad movie and it makes me sick to think that it is worth the money to make a bad crappy movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In my opinion this is a very poor movie. Its one and only saving grace is that you can't take your eyes off of it because its so distracting that you cant help but pay attention.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those horrible films that is so bad it's funny. The cast is terrible and it is so cheap. The movie is about a woman who has a little girl but wants to have a threesome with both of them. The guy and the girl then have sex in a car and get in a fender bender. Afterwards, they have a great big fight and she throws the car in the ditch. There is also a whole bunch of people running around at the beginning, and they start fighting and crashing cars and stuff.    A bad movie that I would never watch again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked this movie.  I enjoyed the comedy and the romance.  There were some things in this movie that made me uncomfortable.    The guy in the movie seemed like he was too comfortable.  He never seemed to really be afraid and never really reacted to the threat.  Maybe he felt it was part of his job.  You can't really tell from the film if the guy was really a murderer or if he was just playing the part.  After he is killed the guy tries to tell the police what happened but is not able to.  The plot was pretty interesting.  All the details were in the film.  However I think the movie should have had more action in it.  It made me think how a murderer could kill so many people without getting caught.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a good movie. Good writing. The ending is horrible. A movie that should be rated better. It really makes you want to skip the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Treat yo self."   I bought this movie when it came out and I have not stopped watching it. My brother and I each spent about three hours watching this film. We each had about half of the movie in each of our heads and were trying to remember every line.   The movie is pretty much just a bunch of characters sitting around talking. It's not funny at all. It just gets old.  The actors are really awful. Every single one is just a terrible actor.  In one scene they are playing a character who walks into the room while they are talking. I couldn't figure out why the camera kept following him. I kept thinking, "What's the point of the scene, if he's not paying attention?"  I could see this movie being made into a short film. It would be good for kids. I'm surprised they didn't make a movie out of this film instead of making it into a movie. I would have loved to see how many of them are still alive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a world where everyone knows you love a movie with an old cast, and every actor gets casted to death in these movies, we have this movie that just made no sense to me. Even the acting wasn't good. The director just wanted a cheesy movie, and I believe the movie should have been called the "Blur." A man was running through the streets looking for the person who did this to him, and eventually found a way out of the area, but the camera never stopped panning and never showed the location where the man was found, but where he was going. So it was like a ghost town, but you couldn't really see one ghost.    A great story, but I think the director just went out of his way to make a movie that made no difference. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had seen some of the earlier version of this movie, and while I have some issues with how they handled the characters, the story and its execution was great.   In this movie we see what the movie was supposed to be about, and in many ways the story was really what made this movie worth watching, rather than the performances.  It tells the story of a father who becomes obsessed with his son.  With an incredibly dark theme and a completely ridiculous premise, this is one of the most ridiculous movies I've ever seen.  When he is finally able to convince the son to return to school, he starts to use various methods and excuses to get the son back to school.  He keeps pushing until the boy starts to believe he is the father, and then the son makes a horrible discovery about his father's past.  The rest of the movie follows the son and his father as they try to come to terms with what they've discovered about their relationship.  This is a great, well-paced, well produced film, that I recommend to anyone who wants a fun, lighthearted movie to watch.  I think if this movie were based on a book by Robert A. Heinlein, the movie would have been a lot better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked this movie, it was quite funny and the actors were all great. But they don't do much to make a good movie. They have to act as if they are doing a movie and just throw in little scenes here and there to make it all look like a movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is a bit too long and uninteresting for my taste. It's a film for a college class and it doesn't really give us much to look forward to in the middle of the film.   It's pretty much a horror film and I'm not that much of a horror fan.  It's supposed to be a suspense film but the tension in this film is only just enough to keep the film from becoming a generic ghost movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this movie because it was on the list of "Best movies to watch on a rainy, overcast day" in my local rental store. So when I received the package with the movie, I was excited to see that the rain had not ended and that it had started snowing in the neighborhood. I watched this movie on my living room TV. It was pretty average. It did have some funny parts and was actually pretty fun to watch. If you are looking for a movie to watch that's not too serious, this is a good choice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was not well made, so poorly paced, with bad acting, and a silly story. I didn't enjoy it at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My friends and I went to see this movie with a group of 5 friends last Saturday. We all had similar reactions and were all very disappointed.   We were laughing our asses off at some of the lines in this movie, such as the scene where the guy is eating a burger.  Then we realized why he was doing it.  At one point, the guy was telling the waitress that he just took off his shirt and had it on under his shorts so he didn't have to take his shorts off in the backseat.  Then the waitress asks him what he's talking about and he replies "I'm trying to hide my tits and I'm going to tell you I'm hot."   It was the worst.  What is wrong with these actors?   The waitress didn't seem to care.  She actually smiled and laughed at the man as he was eating his burger. I guess she didn't care. We never laughed so hard at something.  This movie isn't bad, but for a movie that cost $12 dollars to see and $2 for popcorn, they should really have put more effort into making it a laugh out loud movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I like The Avengers a lot, but this film has all the charm of a child's dream, but no imagination.   It is just like the film that comes out of an art class.  And that's just about the only good thing I can say about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it is well-acted and looks a lot better than it sounds, although some of the acting does seem a bit cheesy.   One of the best films that you'll never see in an early 70s movie theater.  I wish I had found this movie more when I was a kid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is the worst I have ever seen. I thought it was going to be good at the first preview. All of the kids that are on that boat get killed off like I would have expected them to. I have never seen a film where the whole thing is just shot up and you just see random people on the boat with a bad fake movie soundtrack and the rest of it is just some kids being slaughtered.   I do not think that the director meant to show it this way but it does it no justice. I think that it would have been a much better movie if they made a movie for kids that was real. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like the title says, there is nothing really special here. There are just a few characters you'll get to know and a few funny jokes. The movie was just a complete drag.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad version of the movie. The movie is good in it's own way, but not when it is on a bad disc. The story is good and there are some interesting shots but I have not seen the movie on a good quality disc since it was made in 1978. There is no music, just a few quick shots of the "firing squad." This version is very dated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a horrible movie for a variety of reasons. First off, the script, directed by John H. Richardson, had all the elements that would make a movie a "bad". The acting was horrid, and the acting coach must have had little to do because her acting was so flat and uninspiring. I guess the directors just didn't want her to act at all, and then she just did a cheap job of trying to act. The direction was horrendous. It was like a director was trying to make a scene, and when it was all done he threw out the camera and took a nap. I couldn't even figure out why he would do that to a movie that had been planned and shot in about a week. The only reason I watched this movie was to see if it was any good, but the answer is no. There were moments that were good, when the actors would do some good acting and get caught in a very awkward situation, but overall this movie is a total disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie had a good cast, and was well shot, but I had issues with the acting. The lead, Jason Scott Lee, had a weak acting, and the co-lead, Ben Foster, was not as strong as the rest of the cast.   My only issue with this movie is that the ending was lame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't know if this movie would be good or bad. I'm from the area of Ohio and am a huge fan of comedy/horror movies. I knew I was going to love it and I did. I thought this movie was really good and funny. I really liked the characters that the actors played. The only reason I didn´t give it a 10 is the fact that the only person in the movie is named David. It's not that I think he was a bad guy, but I think the writers/directors should have given his character some backstory. I also have heard some people say this was a remake of a German movie called "Kriegsgefangene" (the one that got made into a horror movie). It has nothing to do with that. It´s a great movie, I highly recommend it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's okay. The actors have no chemistry and the film is not well shot, no special effects, not even really good lighting. This movie was made to show the power of the "militant left" and to show that the right was totally ineffective and ineffectual. It makes you wonder if the "left" really exists.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie. I would like to see the movie again in a different setting but it was a little slow in moving forward. This movie was very good and I have a good memory.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie and didn't even like it. I think the actress was over acting, it was so hard to watch, and the dialogue was like an adult trying to say something to a 5 year old. It was very poorly written and was poorly acted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are expecting a good time and watching a movie about a guy with super powers, you will be disappointed. The story is okay, but it is a bit too short and not interesting. The movie itself is not bad, but there is no way it will be in your top 10.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at a friend's house on Saturday afternoon. She was playing with her boyfriend. There were people standing in the kitchen and around the couch. As it got closer I was pretty excited but when it got to the scene where the husband is having an affair (the "accuser" that night) I got very concerned. The husband is getting pretty raunchy and I was scared for the woman, as I was watching her. She did have to put her hand up her skirt a few times, but it looked like a really weird scene. I saw the scene but was worried about it being too sexual. The boyfriend was pretty good though.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When you look back on it, this movie will seem like a classic. It's an odd one to watch, but one of the very best movies ever.   - March 20, 2007Haha...great...
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had a lot of problems with this film. It has all the classic bad parts. The acting is laughable. It's supposed to be a comedy, but all the times the characters act badly, it's always one of the worst acting scenes you will ever see. The plot is really dumb. The ending is really stupid. The story isn't even that interesting. I would rather watch a bad sitcom instead of this film, but there are better movies out there than this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie that is supposed to be funny is really bad. I got to see this film and it was not funny at all. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I don't understand why they put this movie out and then go on and do another one about the same character. I mean, who cares about those two people on their way to the beach? Why do they have to be there on that hot summer day? It was a real shame because I wanted to see the movie about the real people on that beach.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is predictable.  When you think of some sort of horror/fantasy movie, the horror will be at the beginning of the movie, and then it will be the hero who will defeat the creature.  This is not how the plot goes.  It starts off as a fantasy film with a fantasy world, and after an introduction that is about three or four hours long, the monster is just there.  Then they go and show us the monster, which is not very frightening.  The monster has not been very successful in making its presence known.  These creatures are not real, but you are supposed to believe they are real.  I never really believed they were real, since they don't do anything besides scare the crap out of the audience, but I suppose they might as well.  Now I am not saying that this movie is a good movie, I don't see it that way at all, it just had the right amount of terror.  There are some really good actors, and they make the characters seem realistic, but most of the actors seem to be trying to act like the monsters.  One good thing that the movie does, is that it gives you some sorta backstory on the monsters, but it is very vague and they do not do a very good job in giving it.  If you want a monster movie, then this is not it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved watching this movie, as I usually do. But, I don't get why they made this movie. The movie wasn't bad, it just didn't have enough of everything. If you really like this movie or know somebody that loves this movie and they asked you to watch it, by all means, do it. But for all of its flaws, it is fun. If the makers of this movie had done a better job of making this movie more entertaining, it would have been a more enjoyable film to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really love this movie, and I was never too into the original (which I guess is to be expected since it was made before the time for it). I've seen a ton of good versions of this movie and I think this one was the best.  The story and cast are just amazing. I really enjoyed watching these two get each other's shirts off.  It's not a very good movie by any means, but the scenes where they have sex and it's just them on the bed, with no distractions, are really hot and really sexy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I think that it's a really nice idea. A woman gets in a car with a stranger and he comes in and starts getting all upset and upset and trying to start a fight, and it's very frightening. I just couldn't handle it. The movie's like a scary, strange dream."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is just too cheap. I am surprised at how many people will admit that this was not the best movie I ever watched. There are only a couple of memorable scenes in the entire movie and they are from the first two minutes.   My friends and I all laughed the entire time and at the same time we thought it was a stupid movie.  If you want to watch a crappy movie you can do it better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was very confusing and the acting was absolutely awful, but I was looking for a good thriller and this was very close.    It was very hard to watch the movie, but the movie was worth watching if you like a good movie and horror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a cheap horror film.   It is very disappointing.  The acting is cheesy and there is not much plot.  All of the actors do not know how to act and it is not good at all.  It's just like all of the other cheap and bad horror films.  If you want to watch a cheap and cheap horror movie, check this out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of those "horror" movies that never lived up to its "scare" potential.   I wouldn't call it a horror movie, but it is certainly not a "good" one either.  The first act is pretty typical, but then it goes downhill from there.  I think the director was trying to make the audience think he was a "bad guy" and that he would kill someone when he was just a "victim".  If you are in for a scary movie, don't watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen all the movies in this series so far, and if I had to choose the one that was the worst, I'd have to say "Shoot 'em Up" (1984).   It wasn't bad in the least. It was boring, and the script was kind of awful, but the bad effects and special effects made it all the more impressive. It had one of the most over-the-top action scenes ever, and it was made even more over-exaggerated by the fact that it was shot in front of a green screen, and then composited over with a live action shot.   The character designs were pretty bad, but they did sell the idea that a nuclear weapon was about to be detonated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My wife and I were very disappointed with this movie. It is a horror movie but it lacks the originality and the fright that is in the original classic. I think the director tried to go too much for the gross-out, too quickly. This movie is very poorly written, with very weak characters and the script is very cheesy.   We watched this movie at an upscale theatre in Manhattan, near where the original was made. I thought this was a great idea. It could have been great. It does not have the original feel and the special effects were cheesy. The special effects in this movie were awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie's just not good, the only reason this movie had 2 stars is because I don't know much about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just horrible, it's like some of the actors are not very good, it was filmed very poorly and the acting was not that good. I didn't like it, it made me feel like I was watching some kind of bad television show, I just think they need to stop making this kind of crap.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had seen "The Dark Crystal" a few years back and it was a pretty good movie. I wasn't a huge fan of the first one, but when I saw this one I had the worst time. This movie takes a good idea and blows it out of the water. The story is interesting and you just want to see the hero go on and on until it all blows up in his face. The acting was good but they are trying way too hard. There is no way the actor can make a face like that. It was the same with the voice actors. There was way too much of a lot going on in it. When they were talking, the screen went blank and the person speaking wouldn't turn his or her head. There were times when my head went blank too.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first act starts off with the main character being abducted by aliens, and then we see a large spaceship come in and land right in front of a small town.  The aliens want to live, but because they're so small, they can't stand up to the giant creatures, who eat them alive.   It's obvious that this is supposed to be a parody, but it falls flat on its face.  It has some clever ideas, but the execution just isn't there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst of the horror movies I've seen. I didn't even know this movie existed.   It was a movie about a guy who just lost his wife, who is also his assistant. He is driving home in the car with his assistant in the back, and she jumps out of the car and jumps in a ditch.  There is not even a hint of the movie that this was supposed to be. The only thing that was even remotely original was the fact that they were trying to be a horror movie about lost wives, but the movie got lost in the insanity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this film because I thought it would be interesting to see a Japanese production and I guess the film has all the ingredients I was looking for, and a little too much. The actors were not very good at all. The acting is bad in every scene, and this film was not worth my money. I was very bored in the film. This film is not very interesting, and the acting was not good. This is a terrible film.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't see how this movie can win any awards, it's awful and it's just a waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love that movie, but I am not sure this is the best way to tell it. I loved the movie, although I never liked this version and can find many flaws in this movie.   This is one of those movies that needs to be seen in a theater, but at home it is too long, too unwatchable, and too confusing.  I wish I had seen this movie with a friend, but if you are in the mood for a movie about a woman getting involved with a man, this is probably the best movie for that.  This movie is not for people who just want to enjoy a nice romantic movie, it should be seen for the story, the costumes, the sound and the acting. I would like to have seen the entire film in one sitting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My daughter and I went to this movie last weekend. This movie was just awful. The lead actors were either really bad or just did not try at all. The special effects were so bad. The ending was so ridiculous and pointless. This film was just bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad film, and there are several. The acting, the editing, and the editing (and all the other things) are awful. The actors are bad. This is the kind of film that would make you want to throw the thing away and never go to a cinema again.   A lot of the actors are good, and it is great to see a couple of them on film (even better to see them in front of a camera, so you know the characters are real). But the directing, editing, acting, and writing is awful. It is a horror film, but it is also a parody of the slasher genre, and very often the characters behave just like the slashers.  One of the best parts of this film is the dialogue, which is often quite funny. The bad acting and editing ruin all of that.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I know i was expecting a lot more out of this movie, but it was just a plain old boring B-Movie.  I guess if you only wanted an all-ages movie, this movie was ok.  The acting, writing, and directing were all just average.   All in all, this was just one of those cheap B-Movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Somewhere on the line between a bad joke and a bad parody." -James Caan If you like this movie, then I recommend that you check out the movie "Caddyshack" for a real comedy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In my opinion, this movie is only funny in the first ten minutes.  The rest is just boring and pointless.  This movie is supposed to be a science fiction/horror movie, but you wouldn't have known that from the trailer.   This is an interesting movie with a lot of special effects, but it is too long and boring to be worthwhile.  It is better to watch a movie like "Alien" or "Poltergeist", than watch "Bendless", "Fright Night", "Scream", or any other crap movie that has to make people laugh every minute. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found this film pretty interesting, but there were some flaws that ruined my enjoyment of the film. The first thing that came to my mind was the director's choice to not go for big budget effects. There are no dragons or explosions in this film and we don't see the creatures of the forest and the swamp, only the ordinary animals. I found that pretty disappointing, but I suppose that doesn't really matter. The movie does have a good plot and the actors do really like each other.   The acting was great and the three main characters in the film are very likable.  The music was good, but it never really stuck in my head after watching the film and it felt a bit too repetitive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked this movie, but the acting sucked. I think that because the director is an ex-military, and his girlfriend is also a former soldier, it was easy for him to get the wrong types of looks in a warzone, but I felt like I was watching a bad war movie.   It just seemed so fake, and so many people died, but all the main characters just got away with it, while the people who weren't in the war zone but were there for a reason all got killed or imprisoned.  I have seen a lot of movies, but this one just sucked. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The main character is an asshole.   For every great character development she gives to another, she makes a shitty one.  In one scene she has to break up a fight because the other guy got violent with his girlfriend, and she does it like this:    "He just got home, and I'm in bed with this girl. Can I get back in there?"   What happened here, besides her being a bitch, is that her boyfriend was abusive, so she got into a fight, which escalated, and one of her friends got violent, and her boyfriend, in retaliation, got violent.  So she, having a little sympathy, breaks up the fight and goes home, where the guy she's been fighting with is waiting for her.  I can't even fathom why she's not just throwing a towel at him.  But no. She lets him do the rest, and he ends up raping her, even though she didn't want it, and when he goes to prison, she is the first to defend him. And what makes the whole thing so much worse is that after this, she's the one who tells everyone that she loves him, and that he's actually her friend.  "So you're saying I don't hate him?"  It was a bad choice.  The worst thing about this movie was that this guy was the only one I could see acting like a real person, while the rest of them acted like jerks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this movie was going to be a great movie. I did not really see the point of it other than for the fun.   But to be honest I was bored most of the time. The humor was very cheesy and didn't even make much sense.  The cast was all really bad.  Some of them looked as if they were in college.  The acting was terrible.  I was surprised the director didn't make the movie better.  It just made me hate the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a shame that the film that they made was so bad.   Even though this is a comedy film, the acting is really bad. At times, it really annoyed me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the middle of my viewing of this film, I was hit with a severe case of motion sickness. It was difficult to remain in the theater; it would have been great if it had been a different film. The plot is ridiculous and the acting is ridiculous, especially in the movie itself. I was also annoyed that the film was released with this long, long list of "who do you like"? I really don't have any feelings for this film at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not bad. I had never seen a movie like it before and still don't. It was a great movie to see and the actors did a great job. The only problem is the actors are not really believable.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Gee... I guess I was wrong"   The film was shot in a few days, and the actors were on short notice.   It didn't matter, because this movie was so bad I didn't even care.  A woman is attacked by an ape, and she fights off a pack of monkeys.  The whole movie has a fake sound track.  It sounds like a movie made for a cheap B-movie.  They use lots of slow motion, and one monkey climbs up a tree.  There's a scene where a man is on his deathbed.  After he dies, his wife tells him that the monkey was the one that attacked her.  I don't know what else to say except that the producers should have spent more time thinking up ideas and less time shooting the shit.  This movie wasn't so bad that I couldn't watch it again; it was just so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The poor thing. When this was shown as a feature at the local cinema it got a very bad review, as there was no plot to speak of, not even a decent storyline. The whole movie is about a man who goes to investigate a ghost story and is followed by some other people. I did like this, at the time, but it is now old. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After watching the movie I can't believe how bad it is.  If you want to watch a bad film, watch this.   It's just so bad it's funny.  It was directed by John Landis, who is a terrible director.  Even his best work has been really bad.  This movie is all about a kid named Johnny.  Johnny is in love with a girl who runs away from him.  She calls Johnny's cousin's house and says she needs some help.  They take Johnny to this house and Johnny meets a girl and starts to date her.  But it's all just a charade to get Johnny into a band.  The girl is played by a woman named Jane Fonda.  When Johnny finally finds out that the girl is not his girlfriend, he attacks her. He leaves her dead body on a beach and then tries to go back to her.    She tells him that she loves him and will always love him. The whole movie is just one big joke that's trying to hurt Johnny.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are interested in "old horror movies" there are plenty of good ones out there.   The film is made as a straight up "old scary movie" with no real scares or surprises.  There were a few laughs to the film, but most of the laughs were of a creepy kind.  I would not recommend it for young children. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are looking for a popcorn movie, go to the old man's house and wait till he goes to work. That's the only way to get the most out of this movie.   - June 29, 2012This movie is trash
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The biggest thing is that the plot is totally bullshit. The story is completely made up, but the characters are so incredibly stupid and stupid that they can be fun to watch in a few minutes. You see, the director is the one who originally wrote the script, and since then he decided to write a sequel to a movie that was already finished and he thought the original script was way better, and he changed the plot completely. And the reason for this is that he wanted more money, and the scriptwriters of that movie wanted more for themselves. The scriptwriter who is now the director says that he didn't even read the first script, so the original story was completely made for him and he used it as a reference when he wrote his script.       I hope to see this movie again one day, but I doubt that I'll ever see it again in a theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie sucks. I had heard good things about it but I decided to go and see it before watching it because i wanted to make sure it wasn't some other crappy movie. I should of never have done that. It has no plot, nothing to do with the movie, and you get to see a bunch of people who are pretty ugly and there is some kind of sexual torture involved which is probably what it was made for. It does have some very pretty girls that look great but they are just sitting there being very pretty while the guy in the movie is running around raping them. If you like torture and don't mind a little nudity, then this should be a good movie. But if you are looking for a good horror movie, then you should probably stick to something like "Saw". There are better movies out there than this one so if you don't want to see some pretty girls being raped while people are running around with blood all over them, then don't watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In case you didn't know, this was the movie where they filmed the "Saw" movies and made it into a TV movie.   I remember seeing this film, and being disappointed with the low budget, poorly filmed movie. It's just as bad as the original Saw movies, with a few extra "fans" thrown in.    It's bad.  I don't think there's any other way to describe it.  It just doesn't make any sense to me.  The whole thing is set up as a thriller, but it just seems so stupid.  The cops are playing a video game called "The Dark Project".   The one who gets kidnapped, is the only one who can save the world.  So they put her in the game with all of the other characters, and then they just take her and leave her there.  This just seems like so much trouble to put the cast in with all these other characters in the same room, in order to save the planet.  Now, I have to give credit to the producers for not using the actors from the original movies and instead using "fancies" in the TV series.  They didn't need to pay them, but this just shows how little they really know about the original material.  Just another mediocre movie, with one of the worst special effects ever seen in a movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie a few weeks ago when my friend had to work on the weekend. It was not fun to watch, and very dull. I will not be watching it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was too much fun for an old-school film from the 50s. There was so much action in this film that you could hardly believe they were filming it.   The one thing I hated about this film was the lack of sound. Even though they had a great camera crew they couldn't use it in some shots. It is so easy for things to happen just as they did.  I don't care if I am being filmed on location because of the lack in sound the scenes really have that old-skool vibe to them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible movie. No matter how many times I see it, it never gets better. Even the actors in the movie are not that good.   I didn't find the acting to be bad, but I really didn't care about them.  Some of the acting is very forced and not believable.  If you are into bad movies, don't watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible! The acting is terrible and it takes no time to realize that the only actor who has any credibility is the one who plays the police officer. The only thing he has to do is walk in his uniform and pretend he's there. He has no credibility whatsoever, he's in his police uniform with his badge and his gun. He's the only character in this movie who looks like he's actually from the police department. Other than that the acting in this film is atrocious and not good at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was a bad flick to watch.  It was bad because of the acting that came across as fake and unrealistic.  The movie was just too long and made no sense whatsoever.  I don't care what your favorite star is, you shouldn't have to be a great actor to play a bad part like that.   The worst part of this movie is that it's a waste of time for the viewer.  Not worth watching.   HALF HONEY
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very excited to see this movie.   At first I thought it was going to be about a girl and a guy who had sex.  But then they turned out to be the same guy (with his other girlfriend).   So I figured it was about her getting revenge on the man that she broke up with.  I got the girl in the first act.  The plot of the movie was about a man (who had cheated on his ex-girlfriend) who is having an affair with a woman (who is cheating on the same man with another man.  It is a story about love and revenge.  For some reason I felt that it was trying too hard to be "graphic" about sex. It was just too much.  And the acting was just awful.  There is a good amount of nudity in this movie, and one of the scenes has to be seen to be believed.  You just can't make me see it.  This is a poor movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was a huge fan of the movie, and this is the worst of it.   This movie sucks.  I think if the makers of this film wanted to make the worst film, they did a pretty good job.  If you want to see some "bad" movies, this is definitely not the one.  This is like "The Lost World" or "War of the Worlds", only with more blood.  The actors are not the worst, but are not any better than other actors in the movie.  Even the people in the city are all kind of stupid and not scary at all.  What makes the movie a terrible one is the direction, but I think the movie should have looked like this.  One of the best looking action movies of the 80s is the sequel to this. It is also not very scary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie for the older moviegoers. A little too much for me, but that is my age. I like the idea of an "old man" who has a son, but I don't think it worked. It was really boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The cast does not look at all like the actors in the actual movie.  They are all just a bunch of big bald guys.   What they do seem to look like in the movie is a few of the extras.  I thought they would look more like the actual actors in that movie. The only reason they are better looking is because the real cast has much more hair.  If they had just hired some of the real actors and used a few extra actors, it would have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting, the characters, the plot, everything. Why was it even made? This movie is really bad, and in my opinion the worst movie I have ever seen. I found out about this movie from my friend and it's so bad I was almost scared to see it. So many things went wrong on this movie. They had actors from other movies just to act like they were a good person or to show that they were not so bad. The movie is not funny. It is slow. It has all these characters that have been through terrible things to show them in a bad light. The actors who have done this movie are all horrible in my book, but I guess it was their last movie. This movie does not make me want to see another bad movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved it when it was on tv but not anymore. There was nothing fun about it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this movie. It has a lot of charm and is very cute. But the acting and plot of it were all ridiculous and cheesy. The story seemed pretty dumb but what else do you expect? It has so many of the same characters that I've seen before in a better movie. They were all so boring and not believable. They would just talk in the most annoying voices imaginable. The girl that is with the guy, in the beginning of the movie, is supposed to be an average looking girl with normal looking hair. But noooo, she has to have long hair and long legs. And if she looks like any one of the old school hotties from the seventies, she's a slut. The old hottie guy is like a younger version of the hottiest girl in the movie. Then there is the old guy that is obsessed with the old girl. You know, how people always want to try and find the next sexy old chick. He is a weirdo. I don't know how they were supposed to get from point A to B when he was all "Hey! Hey! Look! Look at the old lady!" That is just so far fetched. The whole movie just seemed kind of ridiculous. And the ending was just silly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting in this movie was so bad. They gave all the main characters the same voice and never change it. The most irritating character to see is J.T. the thug. He got a little bit better in the movie but then it ended. I hated the whole movie and that's only because it was so poorly written. I think it is time to move on to better movies, and if you are looking for a good laugh this is not the movie for you. Grade: D
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I love the movies from the 80s and it's hard to get them anymore.    This movie was terrible.  It was like watching a bad version of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit".   They tried to make it look cool and they did, but in the end it looked really stupid and was a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting was bad. I hate to say this but the acting was so bad I was scared to death. The director is a great actor but the poor acting made me laugh out loud.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was very poor. The movie should not have been produced and directed by James Earl Jones. The acting was atrocious. And, as I've said before, Jones was such a lousy actor that he could have just been a "stand-in".   It was very lame and so not like the old time. Jones's acting was so bad that they had to hire someone to play him.   I found it hard to believe that James Earl (Jones) could have acted as bad as that. Jones was a great actor. He was very good at telling a story. But his acting was just so bad. It was just unbelievable.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     The worst movie  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was pretty much the worst thing I have ever seen in my life, but it didn't take that long to make me hate it.   I had no clue what the movie was about.  The actor playing the doctor was like a stereotypical evil doctor from the 1950s.  He said that he was a world renowned professor in some country, who taught at the top of his field, but in reality he was just another big greedy bad guy. He also kept saying that his assistant was his daughter.  I just wanted to punch him in the face, and he was acting in a movie so I was not shocked.  But he was too far in the movie for me to care and I kept waiting for him to die, but he didn't.  That part was kind of scary too.  Unfortunately it was over in 2 minutes.      The entire movie was just pointless.  It was too many scenes to even bother going through. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A horrible movie. The only good thing about this movie is the title.   It's a horrible movie, it's like a horrible combination of a torture porn film, and the first two versions of "The Exorcist."   This film is all over the place, it has absolutely no direction.  It goes from hilarious to awful to disgusting to just plain gross.  This movie just doesn't have a sense of humor and is just plain unenjoyable.  It takes too much of a toll on its actors and the director.    I guess they are used to making money and thought it would be a good idea to make a crappy film.  In conclusion,   I will be watching a different director's version of "I'll Be Back" before I will ever see this terrible movie again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did not know that this movie existed and didn't know that the director is a famous movie director. What a great idea.   This movie is so overrated. The plot is not good. It's not even good in some parts. It gets boring.   The best part is the actors who are not very good.  You can have all the amazing scenes in the world, but if the actors are not good they will be forgotten after a while.   They were great in the first three movies, but this one is really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad movie is a pretty good movie. The bad actor is the bad guy. The movie just lacks character development and the acting is kind of cheesy and the dialog is a little corny. The story is pretty good. It's very interesting and well written.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I have not seen this film in a long time, so I thought I would check it out. It was pretty bad. A lot of stupid, cheap, and silly shit happens. One of the main characters was a drunk loser who got himself into trouble with some bad people. When he was arrested, they did not want to give him a lawyer. So they got his drunk brother to do the job for him. This poor guy was arrested and the brother was supposed to do his best to get him out of there, but he would not listen to his brother and just wanted him out. I thought it was terrible. I just saw a trailer and it sounded even worse than it was. The acting was horrible. I didn't like this one at all."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete embarrassment of riches. I don't understand how this film was made. The actor playing the "carpenter" is a total idiot. There are some scenes in this movie that make me sick to my stomach, and there are other scenes that make my head spin. The scenes of him running around in circles with his hands behind his back, and the other actors being called "babies" is just ridiculous. It makes me angry every time. It seems like they didn't even watch any of the scenes they filmed, so they just decided to film the worst. They were even laughing about the scenes as they were shooting them, so why couldn't they watch the scenes before they went into production? Why was the director allowed to shoot this movie?   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only thing that can justify the rating of "Dumb and Dumber To" is the fact that a lot of people have been expecting a sequel to the 1995 movie, and it's a good sequel. This time it is the kids doing it, and a good time is had by all. The humor is there, and the script is much better. The plot, as I said, is stupid but not as dumb as the previous movie, but it is still stupid. You will laugh a lot, and even cry a few times.   This movie is a great time, but at some points it is a bit too much for you to take. The story is stupid, but there is no excuse for a bad script and bad acting, and not enough jokes, the same old jokes are repeated all the time.  The movie is "Dum-dum, and DUM-dumm" and I enjoyed it very much. It has great moments, and at others the humor is a little too fast, and too much of it at once. Still it is good fun, and has a good ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say I was very disappointed by this movie. I don't think anyone could find any interesting material to put on screen to keep me watching. The director even goes so far to say that it's a comedy and he even uses a funny song that plays over it and he takes the audience on a roller coaster ride. He even takes us into a flashback to the "precious" days of the family which I have never seen before and the actors and actresses look nothing like they used to or are anymore. I could have put more time into it if I knew the script. My only good thing about the movie is it had good voice actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I read about this movie from an online review. I bought a ticket after reading the negative reviews on this website. This movie is terrible and the actor who plays the role is not good at acting. I really hate watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was a total train wreck from start to finish. The movie really got off to a bad start with one scene in which the guys who are supposed to be going off to the beach, instead of getting on the beach in the first scene, instead they go to a house on the hill and look at their girl.  And then one of the guys gets into a truck and gets to the house in the middle of the night.  The only reason I am giving this movie a three was because it had a couple of moments that made it better than the rest of the movie.  I was hoping that the actors would do well at making the action scenes look really good but they did not.   All in all I would not recommend this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read a review of this movie that made it sound like it was a typical slasher movie, with the protagonist being a young man who gets killed in an alley in a nightmarish way, and then his dead body is found in the same alley the next day.  My friends and I were the target audience of this film.  This is definitely not a film for kids, and probably not for the squeamish.  The story was really dumb and made no sense.   The actors (which were all pretty good) were awful.  I'm not a horror film buff, but I wouldn't have watched this even if it was in the theater with me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was excited to see this film because I thought it would be one of the most original and creative sci-fi films ever created.   It was pretty bad in my opinion.  The actors were all pretty much on the same page and did the usual sci- fi stuff well, but it was not unique.  In a scene where an alien robot has a meltdown it is just plain goofy and I found it boring.  Most of the time I was looking forward to another sci-Fi film, but I just can't watch this one any more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is just not funny at all, you'll most likely think it's a great movie, but it's really not. The only way to enjoy this movie is to laugh your ass off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is probably my most hated film, the only reason I even went to the cinema to see it was because of the trailer. I saw this at a crappy old cinema, when they only used this type of footage. I don't blame the director for using this type, but he should have tried something else for a change. It's so far off the radar, I would rather have seen something more interesting like The Man Who Fell To Earth or The World's Greatest Salsa Dance. It starts off with this guy being a poor labourer who has to go to the back of the factory to help with a shift. One night a man comes in looking for his daughter, but instead finds a bunch of women dressed up like angels. This guy is terrified. He starts to cry and the woman tells him to get away, but they're not done yet. This woman is one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen. It gives the film a sense of life that you would never see in a horror film, she's so free and natural. The guy runs away and the girls are after him. It takes a while to track him down, but eventually he does, and it turns out he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. This makes sense because it's not just an angel, they're all involved in a very complex and elaborate game. This movie was so good it made me miss the first one I saw. I still don't see why he'd be scared of such a group of women. The only problem with this movie is the actors. I can't help but think that some of them could have done a better job. I like that they all have an interesting story, but the acting is so bad, I'm thinking they all took the role to make a quick buck.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:       This movie was pretty bad, especially with all the CGI in it. I thought that it was a bad idea to make a film of this kind of nature. You know how people make animated pictures and it turns out pretty ugly?   So, yeah, that's pretty much the bottom of the barrel in my book.   The story is that a couple in their late 20's make a pact to live their life for five years. They get married, have kids and live it up for a few years. Well, there's some drama, but that's about it. They start living in their car in the desert and that's when they begin to die. Then some weird looking creatures start showing up on their television and it seems that they are connected somehow with the creatures that are turning their bodies into vegetables.  This film has no real plot to it. It just seems to be a series of strange occurrences and weird creatures.  In the end, the wife decides that she wants to leave the house and go back to her husband. So, that is the plot. What this movie does is give the actors too much credit, because they are just playing these strange characters.  The CGI is also very sloppy. It was really hard to tell how alive some of these creatures really were. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only reason why I gave this movie 3 stars is because the acting is atrocious. I mean, even after watching this, I still can't believe the performance.   I don't know what was the reason for the acting but they couldn't act for shit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My girlfriend and I go to this place on weekend nights, and have never had a bad time. We were the only people there, and there was about 20 people at the bar, most were just in the wrong place at the wrong time, but everyone was cool. I love the fact that it is a small bar, and you don't feel like there is a bunch of tourists in here. I was there with a group of 8, but we never got a bad seat, and everyone left at the end of the night.   The best part was the atmosphere, there was this relaxed feeling to the place.  And we never had to wait long to get a drink, either. I would say try it out, it's a great place.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I remember watching this movie years ago. I always thought it was silly, and it wasn't even a good movie in the first place. The film, while being really bad, was actually pretty good for a comedy. I remember laughing my ass off while watching this film and the cast had it right!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There were so many bad movies that we watched at the cinema in the 80's.  They were so boring that we all had to leave the cinema and go home to watch our favorite films.  I don't think the actors were good enough, and they were all in it for the money.   That was the last time I watched this movie, as I was not in the mood to watch another boring movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is just another bad movie for me.  It's just too hard to make a movie interesting with the actors that they got.  You have this young kid, with the best voice.  You have the older guy, the funny guy, with one good line.   Why are they using two actors in the movie?    Why is it always about a boy with a crush on a girl?  It just makes it even worse.   I will never watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was boring, dull and so poorly done I almost wanted to scream when it was over.    If you watch this movie without watching all of the other films before it and trying to figure out why they are all so awful - there's a very good chance you'll be thinking the same thing.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was hoping this movie would be good, but I'm not impressed at all.   It's all about the character and nothing else.  They did try to make it a "serious" movie but it was all about this one guy and his relationship with his mother, his sister, and the wife, all very shallow and not at all interesting.  I really wish they would have left that part out and made it about a couple of other characters.  The whole movie is so one-note it doesn't even seem real.  Maybe I'm just not into this sort of thing, but that was the most uninteresting thing I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The characters aren't all bad. You have a nice guy, a bad girl, a good guy and the main guy who doesn't seem to get what's going on.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not one to waste my time on mediocre movies, so I was glad that this one wasn't much of a disappointment. If you don't care for a good zombie flick, then don't bother watching it, but for those of us that do care, it has some good action, good zombie action and plenty of zombies to be frightened of.    The acting is average. The zombies are pretty much all in one shot and don't really have any variety other than one zombie walking in circles. I was disappointed with the ending, which I can only describe as "one more zombie...just like that."   Not much of an enjoyable movie, but at least you don`t have to worry about zombies at your place while you're away.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is not a bad film, but it's not great either. The story is okay, and the performances are okay. The movie takes place in a city on the other side of the world, but the acting is really not that great. They don't really look or sound that great, and some of the women look very thin. The plot is very generic, and they just don't make much of a plot. It's just a boring story.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it is a terrible movie. There are many horrible scenes with very bad acting and very bad plot. The one scene where the boy tells his father that "he just wants to be a better man" is horrible.    It is a very sad story and the actor's acting is very bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just watched this movie again about 2 years after it was released, and it's not as good as the first time. I just think this version is way too long for a movie of its quality.   It's just way too much film to sit through (I watched it in 3 separate theaters at once, so I can't comment on the quality of the film).  I mean, at least it had some good action.  It has lots of different actors playing different roles, which can be a good thing.  This is where the movie really suffers, though. It seems to lack anything that could make it worth watching.  The script is so contrived and unoriginal that it's hard to imagine it could have been even the writer's idea.  These actors are so bad that there's no way they could have done this.  I guess it's all too much for people to take seriously.  A good old fashioned heist movie, which is more what you would expect from this director.  And, of course, I think this movie is worth seeing.  The original poster from 1977. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had the misfortune of seeing this movie with my wife. My wife was about 4 or 5 when she first saw this movie, and she was the one who convinced me to go see it with her. She had been raised with this kind of stuff, so she really wanted to see the "real" movies with this type of stuff. Anyway, the movie starts off with a scene where a boy, played by David Carradine, plays with a toy gun.    After a few minutes of this, we are introduced to the story, in which a young girl is found dead in a pond. She has been sexually assaulted and drowned, so her body is dumped in the pond. Her mother is called to the scene and finds that her daughter had been sexually attacked by a group of young boys. The mother finds a note that says "Please bring this toy gun back. These boys will hurt my daughter." The mother then takes the girl's doll and tells her to play with it. The girl puts on the doll's clothes and then goes back to the pond, where her parents find the doll floating dead in the water.  After this introduction, we get a scene of a kid being sexually assaulted by a teacher, and then a schoolboy is also found dead.  The first part of the movie is really bad, but then it gets a lot better towards the end. I really enjoyed this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible, it had so many plot holes that i found myself thinking this was another "the alien is a bad guy" kind of movie. this was not the alien. this is a giant monster of a man with the power to make anyone or anything that comes in contact with him and attack the person or creature. the plot holes were just too many and the movie just went on and on. i did not understand the point of anything, just went with it like a sucker and it was really scary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie ever!   It was so bad I almost threw up.   I was hoping for a good movie because the one on the cable show, "Tales from the Crypt" was pretty good and "The Thing" was okay.  I have seen every movie on the "Tower of Terror" show and this is by far the worst!  I wish I had seen it before.  My mom and sister both hated it and my dad said it was the worst film he had ever seen.  There was no sound except when they made the monster move.  When I heard it was on cable I thought it might be on for some reason.  They kept cutting away from where the monster would be for no reason. There was a lot of gore but the monster wasn't as scary.  The only reason it made it on cable was because of the cable guys.  If I had watched it in theaters I would have thrown up.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It seems like the script got turned around a few times in the editing process and no one bothered to fix it. The movie doesn't make a lot of sense and the special effects are very cheesy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I really didn't expect anything out of this film, but I was shocked by how much I enjoyed it. It's actually a pretty great adventure movie."   A movie based on the book, "Outlaws of the Marsh" which is a great story. The movie is well done and it's an adventure movie. It didn't surprise me that the movie is based off of a book. The story is just a lot of fun. This movie has a lot to it, it has a few good action scenes and a little romance thrown in to make the film even better. A movie I would love to see again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was nothing more than an expensive cash in of a book by Stephen King. It was terrible, and it was a waste of time.   The best thing about the movie was it's ending, where it took a page from the book, and was really cheap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie should not be on TV in the first place. Not only is it full of bad acting and bad acting jokes that are not funny but also completely stupid. The main character has a huge crush on a teacher who has to go away on business. She is married to a man and there is another teacher who lives next door. One day the teacher returns and she is married. The wife of the husband, who has not seen her for years, and her husband are both very upset because they have not seen their own wife in years. After this they get into a fight and it is so silly that I did not care about the rest of the film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had a great time at this movie, but it has the makings of a clunker.  I love to laugh at clunkers, but this movie makes it look so boring.  The story is ridiculous, and the acting is awful.   This movie is probably from the late 70s or early 80s, I'm not sure.  To be fair, most of these guys were actors, but the actors who are in the movie were all really bad.  One of my favorite actors of all time, Don Knotts is in this movie for some reason, and you can't hear him from the other actors who also play themselves.  The acting is so bad that the movie doesn't even have a coherent plot.  This was supposed to be a comedy, but they're all really not very funny.  It's also funny that the guy who plays the hero, James Woods, is one of my all time favorite actors.  He's got such a dry sense of humor, and he delivers it with such a sharp edge.  A real winner of a film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are plenty of other movies about the Holocaust that are much better than this one. There is a lot of stuff about the camps that isn't shown in this movie. The fact that the Jews can be saved and some of them were saved is amazing. Some of the best footage of the camps is never seen in this film. It is pretty boring. There are so many other films that have the same problems that this film has.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very poor movie. Not worth watching. The film starts off with two cops, an ex and a newbie, who have been working together for years. In a typical setup, he gets a call about a guy who murdered an innocent cop, and he shows up at the crime scene. He finds the guy dead, and the murder weapon, but the cops are too much for him. The guy gets away and the newbie shoots the guy, and then a body falls out of the back of a car. The cop who shot the guy is also killed and so is the guy who is in the back, who is a woman. A woman who is dead with a note. The cops get a new guy and that guy is out for blood. They find out who the dead guy was, and they go after him. They try to catch him, but he gets away. Then, a new kid shows up, and one of the cops who was chasing him is killed. That makes the guy's partner, who was out for revenge, think that the killer is still at large, and so they chase him, and find the dead cop. Now that there is a new cop on the scene, the cops find out that this kid was the one who killed the old guy and this cop was also the guy with the note, and that was the killer's address. They get him, because they think he killed the man who killed their friend. Then the cop who died gets up and kills a cop, because he was jealous. So he ends up getting a promotion and becoming the head of the police force, and at the end, they are all out for him, trying to catch and kill him, while his partner gets promoted, and becomes the mayor.   There is so much wrong with this film. 1) The police are not supposed to kill people, because that is not what they are.  2) He shot a cop in the middle of a bank robbery. The dead cop had gotten his gun out when he was shot, but his partner got away and ran off with it. 3) He also shoots the bank robber. It should be noted that the cop with him had a gun, but that it was off. 4) When the cops show up at his house, the wife runs out of her house screaming "No! Not my husband!". 5) After the bank robbery, he went to his house and shot his mother, who then shot
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was the worst movie I have ever seen. It was slow and boring and did not seem to have a plot. I know they made this movie to be an action movie but this one was nothing but that. It looked like a film made in the early 80's. The acting was horrible as well. The only thing that really looked the same was the people and they all looked awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the beginning of the film when the two girls come to the motel to get some food the older girl goes in front of her to talk to the customers. After a few moments she suddenly looks at one of the customers and screams in terror "Don't come any closer!"  This one really doesn't make me want to see it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A storybook meets movie. This was not worth watching in the cinema at least for me. A good childrens film, with a few funny bits and it was perfect for my children, but not for me as a grown up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this movie because of the review in the paper and was expecting a horror movie but the acting was horrible and the director has done nothing but try to pull a fast one again.   The writing is good and it is true but the actors did not do anything to help it.  The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it is not just a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't think this was the worst movie in the world, but I definitely didn't care for it. I guess the director had a great idea and it was executed in a good way, but it's just not the movie he wanted to make.   The actor who plays the title character is an okay guy who plays a bit of a role and doesn't get the attention he deserves, but he's not even the leading man.  The movie just does not work and it has a weird, unoriginal plot.  There are so many other movies out there that could have been better, and it would have been nice to see another film that got me as excited as this one did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film follows a group of college students as they all have various illnesses and problems. But in the last five minutes, we see two characters who are having a rough time. In the scene, we can see that the two characters were playing a role. They were not "acting" but just going along with the action in the movie. I do not think it is as good as it looks because I believe the character of the two students is not believable. I also think that the three actors should have done more work on their character. I don't think they should be seen as real characters in the film because they are two characters. The three actors who are in the role of the four characters (two of them are played by two different actors) should all act in their character because they should have their own motivations for the part.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love the film "The Road" as much as any other, but it is a movie that lacks the heart and soul that we expect from a masterpiece of American cinema. The Road   was made in the late 1940s and starred a young James Stewart and a younger Robert Mitchum as an old man and his young grandson. Stewart plays a man named Bill who, as a young man, was a great road warrior who survived many wars and was known as the "Road Runner". He also had a wife (played by the legendary Vivien Leigh) whom he loved to the point that he married her after they had a daughter (played in this movie by the young Marion Davies). After Bill's wife died, Bill became more determined to survive and after a series of deadly accidents, he has to leave his young granddaughter with his uncle and flee to the west where he goes on the road to find his brother and sister.   The film is based on a novel by Robert Ludlum. The film has been praised by many as one of the best American films of all time.  The movie had the support of the great actors of that time and there were some excellent performances. In addition to Stewart and Mitchum, there are some other talented actors in the movie, as well as the music and the writing.  If you want to see a good movie with a great soundtrack, you should see the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad that I am not sure why anyone would watch it.  I just gave up watching it the moment the first girl started to act like an idiot.  The guy in the movie was really attractive and the movie seemed real enough.   The acting was not bad but it all seemed fake.  One of the two main girls is obviously in love with the guy but it was so unrealistic.  She seemed to be a dumb teenager, not an adult.  At one point she said she was in love and she would kill him.  What a loser!  My sister and I were watching it and our reaction was like, 'Who do you think you are talking to?'    A movie is only worth watching if you want to see bad people.  You know, like the kind of people that get kidnapped.  So don't watch this, there is nothing in it to get you excited. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm giving this one a 3 because it has nothing really special about it. The acting is good, the directing is not great, and the acting is so bad that you actually start laughing at it. It's just a poor excuse for a horror movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie in a small theater at a Holiday Inn. My wife had already seen it a few years ago when she was a little younger, so I bought her the film on my own. We were at a loss for words. It was so bad I didn't even understand what was going on, so we walked out.    The first 20 minutes of the film is good, but the rest is so stupid and illogical that you would laugh if your life depended on it.    They should have called this movie ''The Dumb Guy'' or ''The Stupid Guy'' as the rest of the movie was like a train wreck. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie that should be in my collection. Very disappointed in the film and the cast. The movie is too slow, boring and slow. This should have been an action movie. A real good one, as in real bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters are all shallow, and their stories are all predictable.    The acting was weak at best. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is horrible. It's not even a movie. It looks more like a scene from a movie that was filmed on video and edited down to about 1/4 of its original length. The actors are so uninspired, that the performances of the two main characters, and the acting of the other two characters don't make it into the movie. All three of the main characters look like they are wearing the same clothes, and they look so much alike.   They should have used a different actress for the lead role.  I mean if they were just going to make this movie as it was filmed, I would have laughed at how they took their time with it. They should get an A+ on the "looks" department.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story of this movie is nothing new and does not go in depth of the different characters. The characters are well made and have different personalities which is nice for the audience.   As for the action scenes, it is not worth watching them, the CGI effects are so bad that you can't see the action.  A lot of it looks like a computer generated movie and you can see through a lot of things.  Another thing that I found so annoying was the voice of the movie which had no emotion to it.  Overall, this is not a movie that I recommend to watch if you like action movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was so bad. I don't even know how anyone could love this movie.   The actors had no personality at all. The acting in this movie was very unprofessional, even some of the parts that should've been funny were not funny at all and made you want to scream at the screen. The bad acting was just plain bad. It was obvious they filmed it in a small place. There were not a lot of places to take them and so most of the film was done in a very small place, which I can understand. However, the actors were not prepared and the acting was awful and annoying.  A very long time ago, I was in a movie theatre and I saw one of those bad movies that are always shown at midnight and you know the ending is going to be a disaster.  I guess people just can't see a bad film for what it is, and when you see it at midnight, it's not so bad after all.  There were a lot more scenes of this movie that just didn't seem to have anything to do with the plot and you just had to sit there and stare at the bad actors.  The story was bad and it just never made any sense.  We were promised a happy ending and that was never given.  It was very disappointing that someone thought this would be a good idea.  In my opinion, this movie should have never been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's good to know that the movies of my youth were not what they are nowadays.   There's no character development in this movie.  It doesn't teach a lesson, it doesn't enlighten and it doesn t touch your emotions in a positive way.  To sum it up, it's a cheap horror movie, not worth watching, it just brings back unpleasant memories, especially when the last shot is a close up of the corpse's head.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "A lot of people think that when they are old, they will never forget what a piece of shit this movie was, and they aren't wrong. It was a piece. A complete piece. The actors were trying so hard, and it's not so easy to be a comedian when you are drunk all the time. They weren't very funny. The songs were all out of place, and none of the songs were really great, but you wouldn't notice that. The performances were all pretty bad, and the music was pretty bad. There was one scene where I was crying at the end. And they weren't kidding when they said they wanted the movie to be hard to watch." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was really awful!   A lot of people are saying it's a great movie, but this was the worst movie I ever watched!  It's a really boring movie that has nothing good in it, and I didn't like how it was cut together.  It has a good plot, but it was so poorly done. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a disaster. It is just a waste of time. They didn't even try to have a story. They just had a bunch of people running around. There is no dialog or plot. The actor that plays the hero is a complete embarrassment. They should have had a real actor play the part. What a waste. I give it no stars.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I think I have seen this movie more than any other film that has ever been made. It has a deep, realistic message that can easily be interpreted by any American as being about "The American Dream." It is a very depressing movie to watch, and when you watch it you just wonder what is going to happen to us and our future. This film has some really wonderful actors in it, including James Cagney as the villain. It is very sad and a real eye opener to how we are going to deal with "The New World."   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was good in the beginning but then it was awful, very funny, it is a good idea but it was just horrible. This movie is totally unbelievable, not funny or funny at all, so what was the joke? It was a horrible movie that should not have been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My second time seeing this movie was at a screening of an original version. I had no idea this version had been remade. The original had a lot more humor and a much darker tone. I saw it with my dad and he was really blown away by the actors. My dad would have made a better captain than the one they cast. The director of the movie just didn't seem interested in making this film. The new director was more interested in the new costume/set he had built for the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I did not enjoy this movie. I could not care less about the characters and plot. This movie was all about looking hot. It was not that long of a movie but the amount of acting was ridiculous. The only thing worth watching in this movie is the hot guys in it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A film that had potential in the 1970s but never got the critical praise and/or box office appeal to truly succeed, is not worth seeing at all.   It starts out strong with an awesome action sequence but the rest of the film suffers from not having much other than a few nice special effects to help push it over the top.  The actors are all great and have the right moves to pull it off but the effects just don't seem real.  If you were going to make a low budget flick, this is probably where you would go.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting was horrible, the acting.   I loved watching the movie but the acting was awful.  The story was crap, all they could do was repeat it.  It is just terrible and the characters that were in it were not even decent.  I think the acting on the movie was done by actors with no talent.    I did not enjoy the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a travesty and it shows that Hollywood can't draw good actors to do a bad job. You have Robert Wagner playing a cop who is trying to get rid of someone who is causing mayhem in an amusement park.   There is so much going on in this movie that it's not even worth talking about.  They had to add a bunch of people and lots of sets and costumes and there is no sense of place in this picture.  If you want a movie to show what this country used to be, this is not it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was looking forward to this movie with a burning desire to get it out of the theater. I've seen this before. I saw it in a theater when it was first released. It was so poor in quality. I wouldn't recommend it.   I don't know what they were thinking when they tried to make a fun movie out of an awful book, but it's a shame that it took them this long to ruin it. I am ashamed of myself for having seen it and I'll never want to watch it again. I'm surprised the producer had the balls to try and make a film out of this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A mediocre movie that's actually a lot of fun and has some really fun moments.   But this movie never was anything else but a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It really sucks  The main character gets kidnapped and tortured to death in a crappy film.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know if it's because I have no appreciation for the genre of westerns, or if it is because I simply do not care for this movie in general, but there are some pretty bad movie mistakes in this one. The acting is so awful in this film that I could not stand it. The film does nothing with the original characters, nor does it make any effort to develop them. The cinematography is terrible, and I'm not talking about the standard cheap, blurry cinematography of a Western. It is blurry, out of focus, and blurry in places that are out of place. This is not what the original Western looked like. It doesn't take long before you realize that this film is very cheaply made, and doesn't try to make a good first impression with any great acting.   The acting in this movie is just awful. This movie was a disaster from beginning to end.  If I had to sum this movie up, I'd say that the film tries to be a western, but it doesn't give a damn about the genre, and just gives the typical action movie style. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I don't mean this to be a downer, or a judgment. But I felt like the only character who would be able to make sense of the situation at all was the lead, and he acted as if it were just like any other day. His reaction was not as real as it could have been. I'm sure you've seen the same thing. I don't know what's wrong with the character, but he was not believable. I felt that he should have been much more intelligent about the situation. The ending of the movie was not good, and I would have rather seen the movie continue after that. " "I didn't enjoy this movie at all. It was terrible." "I do not see why people are watching this movie. It is extremely boring and uneventful. It seems as if the only interesting thing about the movie is the actors and the writing. "   What a total waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie. A waste of time and money. If you're going to watch this, watch a good movie first.   I was expecting much more from this movie. I'm always waiting for the first movie from a new director to be at least decent.  It just didn't have any of that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The biggest thing I found missing in this film was a sense of adventure. I don't mean a fun adventure. It had a sense that we were in danger. But this film had so many problems that it just became monotonous and tiresome. The film seemed to be taking a backseat to other things in the world and it was a shame that the film didn't go out with a bang.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would love to see a re-write of the film that would take it in a direction that wouldn't be so saccharine. The story is fine, but the script is a mess that could have been salvaged by a different director. In addition, the film is just a disaster from start to finish, and the ending is terrible. There was also no "surprise" ending and the last scene is so cheesy that it would make even George Lucas blush.   This film was so bad that even a professional film editor would have trouble finding it on a decent video store. If you are watching this film and thinking that you should watch it again, just do it for nostalgia's sake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first movie I ever saw was "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and I loved it. I had seen many other movies before that I loved but the first movie was a real revelation. It was just a blast and I wanted more.   "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (also called "The Saw" and also called "Saw III" depending on the cut) is about a couple who has had to move from New Orleans to a small Texas town in the middle of nowhere. When the husband gets a job at the local butcher shop he thinks he will be able to save up enough money to move out and start a life. When he arrives at work he is attacked and he is forced to watch his wife get raped and murdered. It is horrific and really takes off the gore. This was the first time I had ever seen a movie where the women got raped before the men and the movie was pretty gory in places.  This movie is a very good movie and I was impressed with the direction of the actors, John Waters and Linda Blair and I still loved it all 40 years later.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a decent movie, but it is not worth my time. This is not a good movie. The acting is bad, and the story is lame.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is really bad. The acting is bad and the acting is good is a good movie because you get to see bad actors in a good role, but the bad acting in the movie is so horrible. A scene where you are watching the old lady on the dock was really cheesy and when you see the old woman it's hard to believe that she could be that old. The only thing that was good about the movie was the old guy in the boat looking at the old people.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film was so terrible, I didn't even know that it existed when I was told about it in an interview years ago. I watched it with my 8 year old and she just kept giggling. I thought it was so stupid and the way it was made was awful. This is a movie for children, not for adults, but they should at least have made it about the kids or something. It has all the things you want in a kids film - all the kids are in their pyjamas and playing all the instruments, all the jokes are hilarious, and the music is just incredible. It was a lot of fun watching it with the kids, but I think it is very stupid and doesn't deserve to be shown to anyone. It is very poorly made and they should have just made the film with the adult actors in the adult clothes and have the kids in their adult clothes. It sounds much better and more like the kids would have liked it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As a whole this film is just plain bad. I'm not sure what the studio expected from this film, it's not very original and the acting is bad. The script is awful and the plot is nothing special. I just couldn't get behind it, the director didn't seem like a great fit and didn't make any sense, even the lead, Marnie, is just a bit annoying, she's supposed to be on her period and not act, that's just plain stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most entertaining movie about a man in a gorilla suit.  The only thing i found interesting about this movie is that a man actually managed to get into a gorilla costume and walk around freely.    In this movie, the only reason why he's wearing the gorilla suit is to scare his wife away from the love of his life.  And then she gives him a blowjob to prove how much she loves him.  Unfortunately this is just an average monster movie.  It features a lot of jokes, but it never goes over the top.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like a poorly produced horror movie that never went into production, this is a terrible movie.  The story is unbelievable and it's so boring.  A man walks in the woods and is attacked by a large bear. He tries to fight it, but it bites him on the leg. The man is bitten by the bear and the bear throws him around like a rag doll. It was the most boring horror movie I've ever seen.  It's so poorly made, but at least you get a kick out of it if you want to see something more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst films i have seen in my life, it's very boring and it just gives the bad vibes out to the audience, it has a few things worth pointing out in the beginning and it would have been better with a director who knows how to do a film like that, the characters are the main thing wrong with this film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting this movie to be bad, but I didn't expect it to be that bad.  It was supposed to be a horror film, so it should have been scary.  Unfortunately, the acting was terrible, and the direction was way to simple. The acting was pretty bad as well.  I didn  What happened?   A friend of mine told me he saw this movie on Saturday, but it ended up on her VHS, which was missing the last half hour of the movie. She came over to watch it after I had already seen it.  When I went to check it out, I got the feeling that it wasn't that bad, since it was a fun movie.  The kids were great, and they seemed to have a good time.  At the end, I guess they were supposed to play with the doll's ghost.  So it wasn  Very fun.   So much fun, I was crying and laughing so hard.  One of the kids in the audience was screaming so loud the movie was turning around.  There were some very well done scenes, even some creepy scenes, which had some very creepy moments.  Some parts were very close ups and really made me think of my nightmares.  This movie had it all.  A fun horror film with great acting and well done ghost scenes.   It was very disturbing.  If you think about it, it is a horror movie, but how is it supposed to scare?  I really think the ghost of the doll scares more than anything.  Although I didn\'t expect this movie at all, I love horror, and I love these kind of films. I think it is the best movie I\'ve seen so far. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater. It was just the right mix of comedy and drama. But once I saw how terrible the acting was, I wasn't a fan of it.   But, it was fun and the music was great. I wish they'd make another one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am not a fan of the movies that are made out of the 1980's, like, "The Lost Boys" is just another copy of the same old, same old. It was a terrible movie, but it has a lot of heart. If I had seen it in the theatre I would have never got it.  I thought this was very cool. It had that old 1980's feel. The sound effects were not as good as they were in the movie though. The actors weren't great either but they could have used a good director.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. If you are trying to make a funny joke with a joke like that you are not going to get a laugh. The movie is only about 1 hour long and the dialogue is not funny and the acting is not good. I am not laughing at the joke. It is just not funny. If this movie was a parody of a "puppet show" and the puppets were speaking in gibberish then it would be funny. But it is a comedy and it is just so stupid and hard to understand why the puppeteers are trying so hard to make it funny.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed this movie, but if you've seen "The Shawshank Redemption", you will not feel right about this movie.   The music and cinematography was great, but I found the acting to be a little off.  The actors had no chemistry with each other, so the movie was a little lacking in that respect.  I also thought the film did not follow the original story line too closely.  So if you haven't seen the film before, then I suggest you watch it on the big screen, and you will really enjoy this movie in its own way.  It is a nice, slow and thoughtful movie that you should watch at a movie theater, if you want to spend a long time thinking. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing about this movie that is funny is the bad acting.  It doesn't help when the film's director was trying to be funny, and it doesn't even work.  In the end it was all just silly.   It was really boring, and no matter how many times we see it, it's not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many times I have seen this movie, but never thought of watching it again. What an embarassing mess.   When the producers thought that they were going to pull this film off as good as they wanted, they made a mistake.  A terrible mess. I don't care if the film is a spoof of a movie. It's just a terrible film. This isn't a "fool" movie. This is a complete and total disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I started watching this movie, I thought it was great. But now, I think it's a horrible movie. It starts out nice, with some pretty good action, and then the movie degenerates into a terrible nightmare.   There's nothing good about the movie, it has very bad acting, the acting is terrible, and the acting really takes the movie to the bottom of the barrel. The ending of the movie is very cheap, and doesn't make any sense at all, which is why I hate this movie so much.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone, it's like something someone made to pass a time at work on a Friday night, and just like that it was ruined. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is really bad and you should never see this movie.  The plot is really stupid and the story is not well thought and it doesn't make sense.  They show a lot of scenes of the other movie which is much better.   The bad parts of this movie are: the acting of some people is really poor and the acting in this movie is very annoying and the scenes are so bad, it's hard to watch.  These bad people just want to get some money from others, they steal, destroy, break stuff.  It's really not funny to watch some people just wreck stuff.     What is worse is that the acting is way better in the other movies so why is it bad in this one.  I hate to see so much bad in a movie so I give this one only 3 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot was a disaster and the acting was terrible, especially for a movie about a serial killer.   My mother had to force me to watch this movie because it was a big deal back then.     I was just thinking of something when I saw it and that's why I hated it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Not in a bad way, just in a completely boring way. It is so boring that I didn't even care what the main character does. The other people just make his character seem like he is being controlled by another person. They are in the same room with him and the scene is so uncomfortable that it hurts my brain to watch. They say that it is a horror movie but all the gore and blood is in the wrong place. The main character goes to see a doctor and is given a very strong medicine that he later dies from. Then a couple of days later they get the film and they watch it at a different time. The film director said that it was a mistake, but I just saw it like that, and I didn' t like it either. The way that they edited the footage together was like they didn't know what to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie I have ever seen. The actors did a poor job and it was really hard to understand what they were saying. The story is just like a bad romance. If you watch it and don't laugh, it will make you think that you really like it.   It is just a bad piece of work.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie with my wife. We laughed the whole time. The humor is not that original, but it works with a simple premise. The acting is good, especially the lead character. The music is not memorable, but there are a few songs. The ending is great, but I do not know if the plot is worth watching.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I haven't seen this one yet, but I thought it was a little over-exaggerated in the opening scene. I thought the movie went on forever with not much going on but they put up with this ridiculous thing for several hours, and then when it was over, they cut to a new location. The guy was in a lab, and a big "HANG ON!! I'M ABOUT TO DIE!!!" screen came on. And he started to say "What is it?" The movie wasn't that long but it was way over the top. But it was fun to watch it again after so many years.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film has the look of a great movie on the screen. The sound is so-so, and the film is somewhat bland. The characters are unlikable, the acting is subpar, and there's not much action. This movie has a "one for you and a lot for me" feel. I wouldn't waste your money, or your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "In a very small town where everyone knows everyone, you'd expect a tragedy. Not in The Green Hell. A few townsfolk are hurt, but no one lives." - The Pittsburgh Post Gazette
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a travesty of a movie and I just want to know why someone would go see this film. I was a little disappointed because the story and characters were very interesting and were believable. This film should have been called "The Mummy" as this film is nothing like the previous films which was much better. This is a cheap and lazy movie made by people who hate horror and would love to see a cheap movie like this on the big screen. The acting is really awful and there is no blood or gore at all. In fact, they even made the "cadavers" walk around like they were alive. I had to see this movie in the cinema because I just could not believe it. The only good thing about this movie is that there is a lot of blood and I am sure that the actors in this movie were scared stiff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible. The director did a poor job and the acting is not that good. I would never watch this movie. I do not think it was even filmed properly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is one of those "movies you don't want to think about for the rest of the day" movies that you just get passed by in the shuffle. It's a "what if" kind of movie. That doesn't mean it's terrible - in fact it's actually really good. It just is a very slow paced movie that isn't as engaging as most of the other movies on the shelf. This movie may be an acquired taste for some, but it's not that bad. There is some interesting action and some good character development. Just don't expect a lot of action and the characters aren't all that interesting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not worth the watch. I was so impressed with the actors, the story line, and the action, that I kept watching. Then at the end of the movie, I was told there was going to be a sequel. I knew I was in for another boring experience.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie at a movie theater for the first time when I was in high school. When I saw this movie for the third time as an adult, I was shocked at how bad it is. My friends and I went out to eat with our parents and all of a sudden there was a huge fight going on, and I guess the father of the kid that we were with was at the movies with some of his friends. The movie wasn't that long, but it was way too much to take in. It started out with the father and son playing at the pool with a bunch of other kids, and the dad is playing some sort of game that was just a way for him to pick on his son. The boy then gets pissed at his dad for not going out and being a man. They then have to defend themselves by fighting with each other, and it's really weird. It's all just a buncha nonsense, and you're not supposed to take it seriously. The kid ends up losing a tooth and his father gets off scot free. What a sad, bad movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was good, but the director was a very bad writer. The whole movie was a big mess of dialogue and not one of the lines seemed to fit what was said. Not even one line. The acting was good enough, but it all felt forced. The story was a lot of fun, but if you are not paying attention, you will miss it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst film I have ever seen. The movie was shot at night and the lighting was terrible. I think it was set in a circus and I don't think that they ever lit the set properly. In the movie, all the performers were really bad. I remember one guy performing in the woods and the camera wasn't set to the right angle so all the leaves were on his back and I thought he had a banana for a nose. The guy was just standing there. I also remember one woman had a huge wad of money around her neck and I guess she had just thrown it out of a car. The rest of the film was a bunch of circus performers that performed and acted as though nothing was wrong with them. This movie was definitely made for TV so they couldn't have shot everything the way it was supposed to. I never saw a movie that was so poorly lit and acted in. I felt very uncomfortable at all of the events in the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm not a fan of action movies. I think it is easy to make a bad action movie, and make it look better than it is. This movie is just a bunch of scenes and they are all pretty good.   What happened was this: a drug dealer has to escape from prison in a plane. He doesn't think too much about it, but on his last flight, he has to do some serious gun-work. He manages to kill the cop that is following him (I think it's called "flying") and crashes the plane. The cop comes and finds him, and he tells him that he is an important drug dealer, and that he doesn't want to be found. The guy then makes the cop a deal.  The cop goes out and looks for the guy, and the guy is hiding in the trees somewhere. The police finds the guy and starts shooting at him. The person they are shooting at runs, and dives into a river. The cops chase him in the boats, and in the end, they see that the guy has a knife, and try to cut him off from the boat. Then they shoot him.  My favorite line is when the guy says "If you don't give me my car, I'm going to kill myself."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a complete waste of time. The whole thing is ridiculous.   You have the characters talking, and talking, talking and then they suddenly end up shooting each other, and I would have liked to know what the heck was going on.  For some reason the movie never makes me understand why the two characters are so interested in each other.  It was obvious they liked each other the whole time but somehow they had to end up killing each other and it never made any sense.  I am sure they were going to have their own little fight in the movie but instead they end up in a bloody mess.  Just a complete failure in every way.  The ending is also really strange, and weird. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So, I was at a screening for the great and great of the 80s in San Francisco. So many great films were shown, but the movie I was watching is one of the worst. The first half was about the birth of rock music. This was done really well, with good performances, but then they jump ahead and show that a black man named Buddy Holly is about to get shot dead and that his wife is going to leave him because he is no good. So, they end the movie and then start showing an Italian concert film of the same show. The movie starts out great, but after about 20 minutes, they show the shot of the black man being shot in the back of the head. So the movie ends. I think it is a horrible movie, and it should not be shown on film at all.   (1935) The Best Man I Ever Saw: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would hate to see this movie in theaters after the terrible review I read in a recent newspaper. I am very disappointed.  I have seen it several times. The movie had some nice things to it. The only thing was that I think this movie was rushed and should have been released in theaters with more time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It really sucks and it's the worst movie i have ever seen.  I think its a terrible excuse to make a crappy movie.    There is a lot of problems with this movie, and I am not sure it was ever made because it really was too bad to be great.  The acting is awful, and there is a really annoying joke that is supposed to be funny, but I couldn't find it.  Even the writing in the movie is horrible.  There was one character that was so stupid that they had to show it at the end of the movie. They made the guy in the film like 50 different characters, and none of them are really believable.  It's not even funny, it's just very stupid and poorly directed.  What the movie really lacks is any originality.  If you don't have any sense of humor at all, this movie will not be for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies ever made. The only thing worse than it is the people who put it out. I don't know why the guy who directed it did it and I don?t know why he thought it was a good idea. The acting is terrible and the actors are not good at all. Even the actress that played the victim is really good and you can tell she had a really hard time in the scene. The ending is one joke after another and it really puts a bad taste in your mouth.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Dirty Dancing" (1987) is an old Hollywood film with a new life in the 21st century. Although it is a re-shoot of the original, this film takes the story in a completely different direction than its original director. The actors were very talented and have a lot of fun in the film. They are not as good as the original but they are still entertaining.   I wish they had just given the film a shot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The bad part of this movie is that it does not do much with the character and the situation. The character of G.J. (I guess) who is a good guy is a complete disappointment and we never get to see him have any kind of a moral crisis. The only moral problem that we get to have is from Mr. Miller. His writing is awful and it gives you the feeling that he does not like to write characters. We have the feeling he does it only for the sake of it. We do not see a real, real character in this movie.   I have been a fan of his since his early films such as 'Rumble in the Bronx' and even before that he was one of the best in the business.  We have a real "Bartender"    This movie is a shame.  The first act is a real slow burn that takes us to a bad place. By the time G. J. gets his car back, his story is not worth telling and the acting is pretty bad.  This is a very slow moving film, which has a real bad beginning. It is not very enjoyable, which is a pity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I went to see this movie with my daughter at the screening. My wife was a little annoyed at the fact that they showed the movie as if it was a bad film. They spent way too much time showing the characters eating chocolate and not showing any of the horrible things they did to each other. I think it was an awful movie that was written to make a quick buck. It would have been better if they showed it as a romantic comedy and gave it to a real filmmaker. I don't think it is a very good romantic comedy but I think that the movie is good for what it is.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have not seen the film but I have read the review of it. I like it. But this movie should have been in black and white. Not in color.   The sound was bad.  The dialogue was terrible. The character of "the cop" was pathetic.  There was no humor. No character development. No depth.  Not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I can understand why people who watched this movie wouldn't give it the respect it deserves. It has all the qualities that would make it easy to fall in love with - a great cast, gorgeous sets, a great performance by the great Tilda Swinton and a beautiful, yet somewhat convoluted plot. But the way the movie is set up and the story it tells, is one that's completely unconvincing and completely unnecessary. There's no real suspense to be had. It's basically a soap opera, with a young man and woman. They have a beautiful suburban life with their dog, a beautiful house, a good relationship, a nice car. They are happy until a mysterious man breaks into their home, kills their dog and goes on the run. They go back to their normal lives, but the story is always the same - the husband goes back to work, and the wife works a part time job and is forced to move back into the house. Then he returns to the house and takes away the dog. Eventually the wife and husband find out that the man has had the dog's head chopped off, and after an argument, he gets back into his car and drives off. The wife is in shock, and she's crying for hours before she finally gives in and goes with her husband to the police, only to learn that the person that she saw with him is actually someone else. The film is really over quickly, and it's all in the story telling and acting. Tilda does a great job, but you just can't believe how easily she gets sucked into the whole thing. The only interesting thing that happens is that the wife eventually breaks down in tears while telling the police what happened, and that's pretty much it. It doesn't really develop either of the characters or the plot, and I don't think it was necessary. It just felt like it was there to give a bit of suspense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a classic. It was made in 1946 but is still entertaining to watch even today. If you want a classic, this movie is it.   It was directed by Victor Fleming and stars Humphrey Bogart, Barbara Stanwyck, and Richard Burton. It is set in the 1920's and features some of the most beautiful and interesting music ever created for a film. It's not really a story but a love story.  To me the music of this movie was the true magic.  The costumes, sets and sets of the movie are beautiful and the sets and costumes make the movie feel like a movie you would go see in a movie theatre. It really did have a grand style to it. The set design, set dressings and sets are of the highest quality.  This movie is made for the screen and for it's time. It has great actors that play characters you want to be like.  Some of the scenes in this movie make me smile like I was watching a movie. The movie was not great but it is still an interesting movie. It does have some great scenes and a great cast.  I like the characters of Humphrey and Barbara Stanworth as much as the rest of the cast. I feel like this movie and other films of this era, are what set the standard for all the other movies. This movie could be great for people that don't want to watch a movie about a love scene but are still interested in an exciting action movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had to see this for one reason only...to watch him eat a whole piece of pizza. This was a stupid movie and had no redeeming value.   The plot line was so ridiculous, it was like someone just threw pizza on the floor to see what would happen. It would have been funny if the movie had not been so ridiculous.  If this movie had actually been about a pizza chef, I would have had a laugh. The only thing I found entertaining were the "dramatic reenactments" and the weird dialogue. The acting was laughable, the food was bland and the plot seemed completely contrived. It was like seeing a poorly made film on television. I thought this film was made by someone who is not a real food lover, the pizza was all bad, the bread tasted like it was just microwaved, the sauce was too sweet and the cheese was not melted. It is hard to watch something so terrible and then watch someone eat it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't really have much of an opinion on the movie.  The whole movie was rather bad.  There is nothing to see in this movie. The acting was bad and the directing was terrible.    There are some good scenes here.  This is not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A boring, dumb movie with too many characters and not much plot to speak of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "What else could I do when the world is like this. What can be done, what should be done. Nothing. I am the worst of the worst, the absolute worst. I cannot be changed. What did I do to deserve this, to be able to get away with this, and to be a member of this class. What the fuck has happened to me. What kind of a world does this make for me? I am a fucking monster. "    If you're going to kill someone, at least kill them with a real bullet. The film itself is nothing more than a twisted and sadistic version of the classic horror movies, but its production and cinematography and performances and gore and other things really make it stand out. The story is pretty much exactly what you would expect, but it's very well-done and done right. The actors work very well with one another and there's a sense of suspense and a kind of giddiness to it. The film has a kind a dreamy quality to it and it feels really atmospheric and creepy in a way that makes it almost make you feel like you're in a strange place.   There's no shortage of good movies out there, but this film is one of the best because it was made with a lot of passion and it's got a great sense of tone and energy that really makes it really stand out from the crowd. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought I was going to die, but in the end, I did not.    This movie is not worth seeing unless you love the horror genre.  The movie has been on for 4 or 5 years, so it has changed a lot.  A lot of the people were so bad in this movie, and they are still not used to acting.  My favorite part is when a boy is playing with a girl and a man comes in and picks the girl up and takes her to another place.  He has the knife, but I thought he was going for his gun.  This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are no bad movies and this movie is a perfect example.   I would not recommend it to anyone if you have no interest in horror and don't like this type of movie.  If you have some free time in your busy life and can't find some good horror movies then go to the library and find this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film made me feel sick, and I am a big fan of Steven Spielberg, but he makes this one worse than any other film he has done. The acting is awful, especially the lead actor. There are so many awkward shots in this movie that were not necessary. I know, I know... there were not a lot of budget cuts in this film. But it is a complete waste of time and a complete rip off. It was just so boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie is garbage. The acting is awful. It seems the director is trying to make this movie look like a movie made by a bunch of teenagers with no talent. This is what teenagers do when they have some free time, like they are trying to look cool. The writing is horrible as well. I don't think that the movie is good, it's just that bad.    A movie should be funny and make you laugh. Not make you cry. This movie is like a really bad movie. The director should get a gun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the movie "Bad Santa," a group of kids are trick-or-treating on Christmas Eve and they come across a scary, black man wearing a red suit. One of the kids thinks this man is Santa Claus and he is in the middle of the street and doesn't give any commands.   I was never a big horror fan, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The movie was good enough for a Halloween flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In case of a negative movie, I am going to give it the benefit of the doubt. The movie is very well made, but I just cannot get into it. My wife and I went into the movie together and left very disappointed. The acting was terrible. Not a single line of the movie made sense to me, and the whole plot line made no sense. The worst thing about this movie was that all the actors that were supposed to be the bad guys were so bad that they looked like a good guy in a bad film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is so fucking lame and dumb. It should have just been a normal cop drama and not a shitfest of a movie. They use all the clichés that are so common in police drama movies, like a cop getting fired, or another cop getting arrested, and it's all for nothing. There are many, many cop movies where the cops just go on patrol and do their thing, they don't get into all this bullshit drama. This one uses those same tropes, but they use them badly, because of how much they suck in this movie. A cop who is supposed to be cool and the best cop on the force is a fucking asshole and a total fuck up. A bad cop story would have gone like this:  A cop is doing his job, but everytime he's in trouble, he gets blamed for everything, and then he just starts shooting people. In the first three minutes of the movie he's killing people. Then in the fourth minute, he's shooting one of his buddies. The film has no tension at all. This whole movie is a stupid plot where there's a cop who gets fired, so he goes on a killing spree. That's about it.   I was supposed to enjoy this movie, but it sucks so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like all of the horror movies out there, it has some good moments, but you just don't know if it will be as frightening as it first appears.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors were decent, but the rest of the cast sucked.   Some of the acting was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm sure this movie is a good movie and I thought it was pretty funny. It was about a man who went on a wild bender after he was fired from his job and was trying to hook up with a stripper he had just met. It's a good film but I would have preferred something a little more interesting to make it a real B movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had never seen this movie before and was looking for something to watch during my downtime. I wanted a quick horror/thriller but didn't want it to be a whole bunch of boring gore. It was a great quick watch and it made me feel like there was something else going on that I didn't know about.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only good thing about this movie was the opening "The King" and the scene with the three guys on the roof. The rest of the movie was a big disappointment.   This movie was poorly written, poorly acted, and completely unoriginal. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've been waiting a long time for a full-length (not a movie as such) sci-fi film.  It's interesting how far a film can stray from its intended audience, since it had me excited for a great movie, but then turned into a terrible one.   The only reason I still see this film is because my daughter loves it, and she's probably more mature than I am. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "Hang on to your children" is a great movie. If you're a little kid, you'll love it. You'll laugh, you won't be scared. You won't want to watch it.   It is very entertaining.  It's well made, very well acted, and it is well written.  I'm glad it came out in the 80's, as I think it was a bit ahead of its time.  For a very long time, this was the only film I saw with the characters talking about their thoughts and feelings.  A great little movie that is still relevant today.  There's a little too much talk in the movie.  Unfortunately, it doesn't have a great ending.  This movie has a great cast, great dialogue, and great makeup.  Great fun.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed this movie, I really loved the characters and the plot line was just perfect. It was an action packed and action packed movie, but I think a bit more time should have been put into the character interactions, and I was hoping for more character development with one of the supporting characters.   As far as a story goes it is a very good one, and the action is great.  I am glad that the director/writer of this movie wanted to make this movie.  The voice actors in this movie were great, but the music wasn't up to par with the other stuff that was going on in the movie. They did a very solid job with the soundtrack though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In this movie, the film starts off great. However, the plot and characters seem to have been made up out of thin air and the film becomes a mess with the twists and turns that no one should see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is all about a group of kids who go through a big tragedy and are forced to confront their parents on why they didn't keep them away from the tragedy. But the movie only makes it worse because the actors play the kids like they're stupid and dumb. The parents are supposed to be the cool ones in the movie and they're so horrible in this movie that they just stand there and laugh at the kids. The movie makes no sense.   I can understand wanting to make a movie about a tragedy and trying to make it something different. It's been a while since a movie like this came out. I guess this movie just got a bad review because it's so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you want a good "B" movie, this is it.   But if you want something good, and don't mind the plot and characters being a little silly, then this is not a good movie for you.  This is a "B", but not a great one, not even close.  It's a movie with so many good ideas and so many excellent acting, that you can tell it's going to be the start of something great.  They had so much more fun making it, though.  For all the laughs it has, there's so much wrong with the movie, it's just laughable.  The story is terrible, the character development is terrible.  When they first start the movie (after we've already seen a good part of it), the lead character, "Jack" is an asshole.  He doesn't care about anyone, he doesn't even care about the girl who is a friend of his, and he has no idea what he wants, except what he thinks he wants.  Jack has a friend, who wants to be famous, he wants to win the lottery, and the idea of spending the rest of his life being a loser is just not something he can get past.  In the beginning of the movie he gets in some trouble, and then he ends up in jail, and there is no explanation as to why.  After he's in jail Jack realizes that he didn't do anything wrong, and has the chance to have a good life, or to live the rest his life as a criminal.  Then it goes on for like an hour, and no explanation is given as to what exactly is going on.  There's one scene where Jack says "I hate the fact that I'm going to have to spend the rest my life in jail".  I think you'd have a hard time buying this as a plot.  The only way that I can see this coming up is if you have a bad memory, or if you can't focus on the movie.  But there's a chance that this film was written by someone who is not good at writing, because there's no actual story here.  We've seen the main character, Jack, in the story of the film several times already.  And I'm sure if you looked at the trailer, you'd understand why the writer couldn't make a good plot.    The main character is stupid, and Jack is stupid too
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well it's a good movie. Its a good time. If you like fun movies like The Nutty Professor, this is a good one. But it is too long and if you like a story and the characters better than that, then you don't like it. I had a hard time watching it, I couldn't take it all. I didn't like the main character. He wasn't likeable and in the end he gets killed by the bad guys. I would never recommend this movie to anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In conclusion, this movie should be called "Don't Forget to Forget"   I watched this movie with a friend of mine. She thought it was awesome, but she didn't really enjoy the movie.   This is one of the most boring movies I've seen in a long time. I'm sure it's fun to watch with friends, but it's just not a good movie. This movie had the best characters in the world, but they just aren't very interesting.  If you're interested in a cool space movie, look somewhere else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For those who don't know, I am a huge movie buff. I have seen all the movies from the big names such as "Batman" "The Matrix" "Aliens" and even "The Crow". I even have a copy of the DVD of "Allegiance" on my shelf.   I have also heard a good amount of talk about "Alita: Battle Angel".  I was expecting a fun action film, but this is way too much about sex and the story is so bad that I really cannot tell what is going on. This is not just a sex movie it is not even a good story.  I am surprised that the studios did not spend more time on the story, because there is so much sex in it.  After the opening action scene, I have been waiting for something to happen for the entire film.  The sex scenes are like a roller coaster.  It is hard to believe that someone would do this to a girl, especially when I know she is in great shape.  This is the main character's first time, so she doesn't know what she is doing.  Why she isn't more careful about herself or at least wear more clothes is beyond me.  She probably went to the mall in her bikini.  There are a lot of sexy moments, but the director is trying to show a scene that is over the top.  As the film goes on, we don't learn very much about the story or the characters.  They are all trying to save the world.  Unfortunately the characters were really dull and the sex scenes weren't very good.  Again, this film has a lot more to it than sex and violence, because the director does a great job of putting us in a bad situation.  My wife and I watched it because of its R rating.  We were hoping for something better than a cheesy action film and we didn't get it. It is time for studios to realize that the R rating does not mean a movie is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If I were a younger kid, I'd probably do a lot of acting stuff and go to school to try and get some of that acting and the life experience. I would probably act on a lot less projects that were offered to me and try to get back in with my family, which was something that my friends who I still hang out with would not be able to do.    I know there is some bad in this movie, but I feel that the directors have taken an opportunity to really play with some different ideas and genres that we can be sure that it will bring in a ton of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just saw this and wanted to watch it again, and was told that it was a sequel to the earlier one and I have to say I was very disappointed.   The movie has gone downhill for the most part and has been dragged down by the acting, although I enjoyed the earlier movie.  I really hope this movie gets a second chance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so excited about this movie I decided to rent it just because of the trailers. However, I was shocked to see the terrible acting and acting that a "director" like Joe Wright had. The whole movie just had so many bad acting scenes. I have not seen a bad acting scene that I did not hate. This movie was over an hour long and I am surprised he made it all into an hour. It was not worth my time at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoyed the story and the plot, and the cast of actors did a fantastic job of bringing out the personalities of the characters. It wasn't too dark or overly serious, it was just a fun and hilarious romp. I liked the humor, and there were some very funny bits that had me laughing out loud several times. I also really liked the acting, it really showed that they really have fun and were having fun on set as well.    The only issue I had with the movie was that it was so bad, and so cheesy, that it just ruined it for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As someone that enjoyed the first movie, I'm pretty much down for this one. It may be a little too derivative of the original, but it's pretty entertaining and doesn't break the mold of the movies. It's not a bad film by any means, but you'll definitely see more of the old one in this one, which is very good. It doesn't really hold the viewer's hand, and it feels like the plot is just thrown in there just for the sake of going there. That is definitely not what a "movie" should be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    * This film is not bad.  It has a very slow start but once it gets going there is little to no slow down.  There is a good story and characters in this movie but the acting is lacking.  The movie is well made and well acted but it is not good enough to be a gem.  A film I recommend to fans of the series because it shows just what a great movie the original series was.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It seems that when Hollywood makes a movie about a serial killer, they don't make it too "tough".   This is one of those movies.   The way this movie is filmed, the characters are constantly running around and the plot is very disjointed. The whole story is told from the point of view of the cop who comes to arrest the killer, so there is no actual detective in the film.  The film starts off with a flashback which explains how the killer committed all of his murders.  This guy was a very quiet and shy person.  When we first meet him, we see a bunch of his victims sitting in a circle.  Then we see him go up to a woman sitting in the corner and he starts to rape her.  In the middle of the rape, he grabs her arm and the camera pans down to the side.  He grabs her and pulls her into his apartment.  It is very hard to understand who the woman is. She has a big scar on her back and a big hole in her stomach.  She is just sitting on the bed and then she starts screaming.  I remember feeling like she was just screaming. I was scared.  At the end of the film, we're shown a photo of the woman and her husband.  Her husband was a doctor. He was killed on the street.  To top it all off, he was so sick that they had to cut out the organs from his body.  What I would give to see a woman sit in a room with all of the bones in her body and then be shown the picture of her husband's body and told what happened to him. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie for its time and bad characters for its main characters.  It is not a good movie, but the acting is bad and the plot is wrong.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is garbage. This movie tries to ape the 80's and it fails completely. I think they are trying to ape "Tootsie" but it is no where near close to that movie. You can't even compare it to that.   The acting sucks, there is nothing interesting in this movie, it just tries to be "Tropic Thunder". I think it would be better in color, the action is boring and uneventful, and the plot is all over the place and too many things are being "explained".   I thought this was going to be a good movie, but it was more like "Tranz" than "Tricot" and that just doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very dull, boring, uninspiring and over-the-top film.   It is made in a very bad way, so the film is uninteresting and dull.  The actors are all awful and boring.  It's as if the writer is just trying to give the impression that he knows how to act and is just taking the easy way out of his dullness.  There are also many moments where you do not know who is who, where is he or where she is.  This film is simply for show and should not be watched by anyone.  My rating is 1/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie twice, and the second time, in my living room in front of my wife, I almost cried. My girlfriend was home, and I was so sick of seeing this movie again and again. A bad movie. I would not recommend this movie for a first time viewer.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was hoping to watch this movie for a laugh, but it was a nightmare. The acting was awful, and there was no punch to the script. The acting was not bad, but I really think it needed some direction. The story is so bad that I have trouble imagining it's a true story.   This movie was so bad, that my friends and I were actually laughing at some of the dialogue.  The movie is so poorly made and the actors are so bad.  I gave this movie 2 stars because it's funny at times, but the script just ruins everything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I found this movie to be just a poor rip off of the TV show, "The Prisoner" - which was on for 15 years. The story is a bit cliche and very lame. This movie just doesn't hold together and is poorly acted. The action scenes are weak. The special effects look terrible. It's a very lame movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had seen this movie many times. I was looking for a good zombie movie, and this was it. If you like to go out and have a good time, this is for you.   A very good movie!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very good movie but if i have to be honest i had to see it twice and only because i was curious. It was all good when it was first out but after the third or fourth time i got tired of it and turned off. The story about a killer who hides from the police is very good and the action is top notch. What is not top notch is that it is made in 1995 when its set in the late 80s and all the cool technology that would be around at the time like cellphones or PDAs is a bit silly and unrealistic. Also the lead actor, who was once in my favorite movie, Robert Blake (who played a killer in the classic film "The Silence of the Lambs" and the remake "Silence of the Lamb") and who has been on my list for years as the real deal, is not that good in the film. The other actors in this film, who are really very good, but aren't as good as Robert Blake, are also a bit flat. So, overall, this is a good movie. It has a lot of great action scenes, some of them are amazing. However it has some very silly and unoriginal dialog.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A horrible movie. I would give it a 1.5 star rating for bad acting, bad acting alone, and not a plot.   As an actor, I would never have been able to portray the character correctly. The character's name was changed to "The Redeemer" from "Jesus" by the studio for a commercial.  I had an audience of 12-14 year old girls at the time who loved it.  The first few minutes of the film shows a "gory" scene of a girl in the womb.  In a small village, a nun, (Marianne) is preparing for a mass. The people were terrified, because it was thought they would be visited by the devil. The nun has a visitor, the priest (Paul). They have a discussion about what the devil would want, what he wanted, the nun replies, "I'm not going to tell you."  I must say, the nuns in that day and time would not have been concerned with devils. The church, church members and even the people in the village seemed more concerned with the idea of the devil visiting the village.  This movie has the right idea to be about a woman of God.  The film was not very interesting.  The movie was not meant to be anything more than a cheap horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A typical Hollywood movie. Nothing wrong with that, but the acting was terrible and the story is so generic and overplayed it's boring and the acting isn't even that good.   I thought there was an extra scene with her mother, but it doesn't appear in the version available on DVD.  The only good thing about this movie was that I watched it with my brother at his college. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never seen this movie before, and to me it looks like a bad rip-off of a popular movie, and the acting was horrid. There are not enough bad movies to watch before you die!   It was about a boy who, after his father (Fred Savage) dies, must marry his uncle (Eddie Murphy), his mother (Bette Davis), and his aunt (Kathleen Turner), who all are rich and play together.   He's also being chased by his father's former wife, a prostitute.  I wouldn't have given this movie a chance if I were you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a piece of trash. It is a poorly written, badly acted, poorly directed, poorly acted, badly written, poorly paced, poorly written movie. There are some nice shots in it, but the production values are really low. I think the movie was done by a guy who did his best, but it is not very good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "It's hard to imagine any good film at the moment but then a film like this shows that sometimes you can have a lot of fun, even if it is a bit pretentious." - "Just watch the trailer. It's worth it." - I've just seen this for the first time, and it doesn't really have anything to recommend. The film is full of great performances and lots of action, but it just doesn't feel like it was made for home viewing. It is just very, very bad and doesn't even try to have the action on screen.  "It's a film about nothing and one of the most uninteresting and dull films I've seen in quite a while." - This film is just boring, and this review really needs to be rewritten. This was a film with a great premise that is totally blown. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a mediocre movie that really didn't live up to the expectations and hype around it.  It is really not that great of a movie.  I would give it a D and a B- with a C-.  A film can only be judged as a whole, and this one just didn't come across as great.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible! I had to re-watch this movie over and over again to make it even marginally enjoyable.   The acting was awful, and this was a sequel to a movie I never saw.  The plot was so poorly conceived, it had the potential to become a classic. But the director just threw everything out the window and just made something like a parody of a camp classic.  I don't know what the hell is going on, but this movie would have made a great film had the script had been a lot better and the director was a decent actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would have given this a three if the acting was better. It would have been better if the writing had been better.  The director could have used a few pointers in writing, in addition to what he did in the actual filming, like, say, using a real phone and not a computer-generated one. And, as a side note, the girl who was supposed to be a stripper gets off on watching her boyfriend take a picture of her in a bra and panties. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a very good movie. It looks great and is fun to watch. The only problem is that it is bad. No story and it has very little action. It was not worth the money and I won't be watching it again. It is just like something you see in a horror film. I hope they make it good someday.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If I could, I'd leave the film alone. It had no reason for being there, and what little it did have was terrible. I wouldn't watch it again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was hoping for some action to be put on the film, and it was not very good. The only time anything came out was when the cops raided the safe house after the gangster died. It was a total let down.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved this movie, but it's a good movie for what it is.   It's a little too much like the "good old days" of the 70's.  It was really fun to watch.  There were times I wanted to go back and watch it again just to hear all the jokes that were made, but I don't think it's worth doing so. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just saw this movie about a guy who finds himself in a life threatening situation. The bad guy is on a list of "evil people" and is the worst human being i have ever seen.   It just makes you sick.  The bad guys actions and dialogue are absolutely disgusting.  My only good thing about this movie was that it was a little over budget and the actor was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie doesn't deserve any stars at all.  It's not bad, just bland and boring.  This is the kind of movie that is best for kids, but really should be avoided for anyone who doesn't want to sit through another boring 90 minutes.  The only good thing about this movie is that it shows just how much fun we can have by shooting at each other and stealing cars.  I can only say that this movie was worth of an hour and 10 minutes. The worst part about this is how I was laughing with my kids in the theater.  If you have kids, I would definitely avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I remember when I was young, I watched this movie on a TV at the age of 11. I loved it and I still do. However, it is now a bit too old and dated. The plot was good when it started out and still has its good points but the whole series of movies is a mess. It never gets back on track. There was also a very long period in the late 80s where nobody would see it on TV. I think that if you really love it then you should watch the last movie. I've never seen it and it might be the one to finally bring it back to the big screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad, but it is still pretty good.   There were a couple funny parts, but the whole movie is so bad.  The story goes like this:  The evil overlord wanted the world to know about how beautiful his new princess is.  So he had an actress play an innocent girl.  But she had to be a real girl.     When she was a little girl she ran away and got into a car and that's how the movie starts.  It's obvious that this film was made to promote a new TV show.   So the actors and the director make up a story about a girl who gets caught by a man and becomes his slave for 20 years.   Then the director makes up a backstory about her father having a daughter who is a princess.   But it doesn't really make sense.  She wasn't a princess then.   And then it goes into the next 20 years when the girl gets pregnant.   We are just made to believe that it's true.   There is no reason for the woman to be the daughter of the man, except that it was part of the marketing.   The ending is a waste of time because the man gets executed by a mob.  No one even says what happened.   It's really stupid.   This movie makes you want to buy every toy and buy a new television show.  I was actually laughing.  This is not an entertaining movie.  You should never watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love the movie but it was so boring, i wish it was a TV series.   My favorite thing is the music.  The ending was so bad i wish this was a movie not a TV show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first half of the movie has nothing going on. Everything is set up and played out, nothing has really changed or changed the story and the characters still feel like they are talking to the same actor. Then the real action happens.   The film follows the story of a woman named Carol (played by Anne Bancroft) and her partner and lover named Bob (played with incredible intensity by George Sanders) in this world where a woman can become whatever she wants if she can find a man.  Carol has been trying for years to get a man, but all that effort has only lead her to the ultimate disappointment.  When a woman is found murdered the entire town is outraged.  But in an attempt to solve the crime, Carol is convinced that Bob and the police are trying to take her life.  A quick check of the police database reveals that Bob's sister, Marcy (played in great spooky detail by Mary Kay Place) is married to a wealthy industrialist. Carol finds this information out, but instead of going to Marcy, she decides to go to the rich man. So while Bob and Marcy go on a beautiful romantic getaway to his mansion to discuss the murder, Carol makes a deal with him.  She will help him solve the murder and get her life back on track, if he will help her get an apartment in his house.  Carol makes Bob promise that she will only tell the police what he wants to know, but then goes off and goes to his home.  And that is when the fun begins.  We get to see Bob and Carol in action.  Bob is so focused on Carol and has been since they first met that he does not notice that the house is completely empty.  He comes up with the idea to use a fake burglary to give him the excuse that his sister and girlfriend are staying with her husband.  Even though this has been an ongoing plot for the film, it doesn't seem to have any effect on Bob or Carol.  Sure the cops have a copy of Bob's phone records and Carol finds the evidence of Marcy's husband going out with another woman.  What really happens?  Bob has Carol arrested, and he takes her to Marcey's home. Marcee is furious and sends Carol a message saying that Marcy is having an affair and that she needs to leave.  This scene is brilliant. The scene is shot in great style and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The director's name is a bit of a clue:  To get this movie I had to watch "The Day After Tomorrow" which was a bad flick. The film was bad, but it was not as bad as the first part of the movie.  A young couple is traveling through the American southwest on their way to visit a distant relative and the boy and girl are having trouble.  Their car breaks down and the couple, who are both drunk, are attacked by a band of cowboys.   I've never heard of this guy, but this film looks like a copy of "Horse Feathers". The director is an unknown, and the movie is poorly made. The acting is terrible. It looks like they could only get the girl to be drunk and not get a real scene.  This film is not worth seeing at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bunch of idiots walk in, get into the theater, watch for 45 min or so, come out and say they didn't like it.   I thought I was watching the classic The Shining but it was much worse.  If you want a good movie, try The Shining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a disappointment from start to finish. The cinematography is horrendous. The acting is horrible. And the script was just bad.    For a movie that cost $45 million, this movie was awful from the minute it started. I'm not sure if it was the actor who wrote the script, or if it didn't work out the way it was supposed to, but I think that the film was more like a disaster movie than a film.  And for this much money, it was a total disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a bad film, a sad film. The script was awful, the acting was terrible, the story was awful. It was like watching the movie of a man on the run and his son. He was a good man who did not deserve the fate he was given, and his boy was not to blame for the loss of life. This movie was so bad that it really did not matter if it was made in the 50's or 70's. They all make the same mistakes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was not bad but it is too much of a waste of time. The plot is a mess, and the characters are boring and have no chemistry. I am not sure why someone would waste this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was disappointed to see this movie. It was poorly shot and badly acted and it is completely lacking any sort of plot or logic.   This movie is a poor excuse for a Hollywood movie, and it didn't even pretend to have any of the good old Hollywood charm or quality that made old Hollywood movies so exciting and entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad film. It was shot in a low budget way and it's a boring film. I don't see the point in making a cheap film and trying to make it funny. I also don't think that the lead character was the best.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting was decent, the story wasn't that great and I thought it was a little weak in the acting department, but I guess that's to be expected considering there are no actors in the movie other than the ones who are the lead characters.      It's a long shot but I thought the music was great.  The title is pretty good though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only positive thing I can say about this film is that the cinematography and sound effects are great.   This film is really bad and I wouldn't recommend watching it.  It is all just bad and poorly made and doesn't have a point to it. This film, despite being a remake of a movie from the 60's about a man that goes from a normal guy to an evil man was made after The Green Mile which was based on the novel of the same name by Thomas Harris and was considered to be one of the best books of the 80's.  In this remake the movie took so much inspiration from the books and the characters and made a horrible movie about it. It is just so bad.  The bad actors that were in this film, especially the two men who played the "Evil Man" and the "Normal Man" are horrible and really annoying. The acting is terrible, but the acting on the whole is horrible with all the different actors. The story is poorly done and the plot is bad. The "Evil Woman" who is supposed to be in the story is really annoying and is the main character that everyone in this movie wants to get rid of.  I think the film would have been a lot better if it was made by a different director but whoever made this film just didn't seem to have any idea how to make a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is very, very bad, and I have never seen a better movie.   I've never seen someone get arrested after going out to a bar with a bunch of his friends, and it makes me ashamed for the society in which I live.  The movie starts off strong, and this guy who has never done anything to deserve anything bad happens to stumble across a pretty girl, and he's not only not arrested or questioned, he's just invited her to a party with his friends.  I don't know what it was about this movie, but the story just felt so bad and pathetic.  In the movie you see this girl who has had several boyfriends and is now single, and she tells her friends that she's going out with a guy from the same college she graduated from, who is "cool" because he has a tattoo on his shoulder that says, "Dude I am Cool".  This girl's friend, a girl who is dating this guy and has no clue, just thinks that the guy is nice and he'll be a good friend.  This movie gets worse from there, and the people who were involved in this story were really dumb to put this film out, because it really was stupid, with some of the dialogue so hard to understand.   The police are shown walking around the club doing nothing, when the girl's friends get a call that a girl is bleeding from her neck.  They tell her that there is some guy in the club who just stabbed the girl and he has escaped, so they get into a car and head to the crime scene, which is nowhere near the club.  While they are driving, they see the guy who stabbed the woman, and they have to stop the car, and then find out that the person in the car is actually a cop.  It was too bad that the movie was so poor, because there were several very good actors and the story really caught me off guard.  My opinion of this movie is that it is a great example of what can go wrong when someone doesn't think through their actions and they put themselves in a situation where they will be hurt. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Heaven Knows what.   The plot was a little weak, which was probably why I waited for this movie to come out, since it seemed to be the only thing to come along this year that was worth the wait.  A "hockey" movie is basically a film about kids who play hockey, but the "hobby" takes a backseat to the violence, sex and profanity.  I don't think that anyone was expecting a hockey movie to be this violent and stupid, but this one had me thinking that I've seen something like this in some way or another at least once in my life.  The movie starts with an actual hockey game, but then jumps to the murder of some children.  Things then get a little weird as they go from the scene of the crime, to a home movie where two young people (the twins and their father) go on a drunken bender and get into some trouble.  What you think is just a stupid bender turns out to be a ritual sacrifice, a sacrifice for the devil and his devil wife.  These two kids, who never seem to think about the consequences of their actions, soon become involved in some kind of black magic ritual, and then we are back to the actual murder of the children.  This movie was one of those things I could never really understand.  You never know how deep this movie was trying to go with it, or if it even wanted to go there at all.  It just seemed like a film that was made to be on TV and was never really meant to be finished or even made.  There was a strange disconnect between what was going on on the screen, and what was happening in the film.  When you see the film, you just sort of have to accept that whatever it was trying too go down, was what really happened, and just not really get what was being shown.  This is probably a good thing though, because I donít know how I would have felt watching something like that, especially since it is just so over the top.  I don¹t know about you, but that kind of makes it more fun to watch, and I actually find that quite entertaining.  The sex, violence, profanity and language are all pretty much on par with what I have seen in many of the other "horror" movies this year.  So you really doníre just getting what you paid for.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I liked the movie, it was entertaining, but nothing exciting. It was too bad they wasted such a good looking and well made actor like him on this movie. The characters are not original at all, they look like old stock actors, and I don't know what is so wrong with them." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a waste of time. The story was all over the place and the director couldn't get the timing right, especially when the characters have to run around in the bush trying to find a cave or something. The actors were great, but the director did not get the budget he needed to make a proper film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad thing about this movie is that it's got a lot of cliches in it. The movie is set in 1950 and it looks exactly like the movie was shot in 1950. The acting is terrible, especially the female ones and the actors look like they were put in this for the money. The plot is weak and has some of the cliched clichem like the whole guy getting on his bike and chasing girls on their bikes. The script and acting is so bad that you have to wonder if this movie was made by one of the big Hollywood studios as it's cheesy and is a bad idea.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked this movie, and enjoyed it a lot. But the film is kind of boring, with very little going on. A very long and drawn out action sequence, and then the characters all run around for no reason, doing no interesting thing in the meantime. There is an extremely dull plot, with nothing exciting going on, and a plot line that has no impact on the story. The acting is fine, but not great, and the dialogue is a little clunky, and not that great either.      This movie looks great on DVD, and has a pretty good quality transfer. It's a shame it has no special features, so there really isn't much of a story here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was supposed to be a comedy but it is totally wrong for a comedy. It is totally made up and completely stupid. It does not even try to be funny. It just tries to make fun of everything. It tries to be too serious. The plot is ridiculous. It has lots of stuff going on at the same time. If it were a good movie it would make sense but it was a terrible movie. It really should not have been made and if it had been made with better actors and with better directors it would have been better. I did not think it was funny at all, and the acting was not good. I really wanted to laugh but I just could not. I was really bored and the ending was just ridiculous. I can not see anyone else watching this movie again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My kids and I love watching this movie, and we're not the only ones, as it is a hit at every school that we go to. The movie is full of laughs, and the songs are great, but at the same time it's a movie we all had to see at some point in our lives.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very bad movies with very bad acting.   I was disappointed, I didn't get what happened to the guy that was trying to give an old lady a ride, i thought she was an old grandma because the guy looked nothing like her. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen a lot of crappy movies. This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. The acting was terrible, and the story was just awful. The movie just seemed like it was trying too hard to be funny. The plot was just bad.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was hoping for a good sci-fi movie, and I thought this might be the movie for me. But after watching it, I think I have made a poor decision.   The actors, although good in some parts, seemed to be acting as if they were trying to pass for the characters they are playing, and the script was as if it was written by a 15-year old girl with no knowledge of sci- fi.  I'm not going to waste my time on a movie like this, and this could be a great idea, but it just doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie in the early 70's and it was actually pretty good. My only complaint is that the ending was way too rushed.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I really don't see the point of watching this movie, and the characters are really annoying.   I have never seen a worse acting effort of any of the actors, from the people in the street (one of them is the only one with any sort of personality) to the bad guy (who is supposed to be the bad guys and he is the worst actor I have seen in a movie)   The acting is the best thing about the movie, but you can tell the director didn't put much time in this movie.  You would think with the script, the director could have created something good and made a movie that is worth watching.  The only thing that this movie has going for it is that it looks pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved the concept and that it was a sci fi/ horror movie. I enjoyed it, but it was very cheap. The acting was lame, and I wasn't even really paying attention to anything the characters said, so it all felt very forced and cheesy. I'm sure there were scenes that were fun, but the rest were a letdown. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am sorry to say that this film has really disappointed me.   The actors are all good and the story was well executed. But it all comes out of thin air.  The plot has no coherence and the movie never makes any sense.  It is also very slow and boring to watch.  When it finally started to work, it was too little too late.  I do not know what happened to these actors, but I'm sure the next time something is set up to be this slow, we will see the actors who played them.  They did have a few good moments, however, that I still remember.  A few people did give a good performance but it all came out of the characters mouths.  What I got was a film with nothing but the characters and plot.  This film was not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film itself was a bit uninteresting, the movie is just a re-hashing of a few TV series and movies, it was interesting, but nothing memorable.   A few good actors that were in the original movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie with awful acting, terrible acting, and bad acting.   It doesn't even have an interesting story or characters, and a majority of the characters are either idiots or stupid.  The characters are all stupid and the acting is terrible.  There is no "realistic" fight scene or gun battle scene, and there is no one that seems to care about anything in the movie, the plot isn't even interesting and the characters aren't any good at all.  It is the worst movie I have seen in the past 10 years.  I have read reviews that stated this movie is not well made, but it wasn't.  You would expect a movie like this from a bad slasher film, and they are so bad it makes you want to laugh.  This is the absolute worst movie ever, and the only reason I could say it is worth watching is because of how awful the acting and story is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was at a film festival and a friend brought me a movie about my life (I was 18 at the time) that he thought I would enjoy. He told me it had been made by the guys who made "The Shawshank Redemption" and I was supposed to love it. I thought the movie was pretty good for the time it was made and liked the cast. A couple of years later the guy who produced it (the same one) was found dead in his car with a handgun in his hand. He had been killed by a jealous girlfriend. The guy who wrote the book about my childhood, "The Green Mile" made a "sequel" to it and gave it a completely different twist. The whole thing was fake, the cast changed and the plot was completely changed. No matter how much you think you know about my story it is never as it is in this film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I did not like this movie. I liked the previous two and found this one too long, boring, and boring. They should not have waited so long before beginning to show us the alien. It's like they did a two hour preview of what they were going to do in the movie, and then the movie came on at an un-expected time. I was looking forward to the alien for the last 20 minutes of the film, and by the time it appeared, it was way to long. The people in the alien ship were really stupid, and the people in human ships were just as bad, but this movie just goes on and on and doesn't show us anything interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really like this movie. I had it for my birthday, and had a great time. The action is good, the acting is excellent, and the music is good too. But it is very slow. There are several action sequences that take way too long to get going, and then it is over. If the story had been better, I would have loved it. The plot is pretty bad too. The movie seems to take place during a time when there are so many World War II movies being made. One could probably see it as a rip-off of a certain World War I movie, and there are a few scenes that sound as though they were ripped from a certain movie. The ending is very weak.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was at the wrong theater for this movie. They told me it would be showing in one of the newer theaters. I was so confused as to which one. I decided to go with my brother and he is a very serious kind of guy, so I felt pretty safe in his presence. I walked in to see an older crowd that was clearly not familiar with the movies but I thought it might be good. I expected to see the cast from the original film and thought they would be present. No one was there, I had to wait till they started showing the new cut of the movie, when I finally saw them I was a little disappointed. Not only was it not as good as the original, but they also changed the cast names and made it look more like a PG-13 movie. The new actors were not good enough to hold their own in the movie and it looked like they were trying to pass off the film as the more innocent and romantic version of the story.   The story, and characters, were not the same and I do not understand how anyone can watch this movie and find it believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is pathetic. I do not understand how anyone in his right mind made a film with this title. What a joke. This is like an awful version of a bad B movie.   One thing I do enjoy about the film is when they are at the amusement park, they are hanging out and have fun. I guess you can call it an excuse to drink and screw around but it doesn't even make the film that much better.  I am a HUGE horror fan and this is the worst of the bunch.  It's a waste of a great director.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like to get the newest movie on my "must see" list and this one doesn't impress me that much, though it does look nice, I don't think I would be watching this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film isn't bad. It's actually pretty good. It makes you feel something when the camera pans past a scene or camera movement. That's good. The plot isn't good. There is no real action or danger to be found. There are lots of things happening but nothing really happens. If you are looking for a film where you can watch a bad guy who wants to kill people get killed by a bad girl, then this is that film. I really enjoyed it when it was over. But if you are interested in watching something that has some action and you can sit through a bunch of boring people talking while they're getting shot in the head, this isn't it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never been so angry in my life.   This is a horrible movie and the writing and acting in it is terrible.  One of the worst movies I have ever seen.  All of the actors were either trying too hard or just flat out acting bad. The plot in this movie is completely ridiculous and the actors who were supposed to be on screen were nowhere to be seen. This movie was just a bad waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this film I just said to myself "I am going to love this film!". I wasn't disappointed.   The story is interesting. The acting is good. The music is excellent. The performances are all solid. The movie does not drag on.  If you like a good comedy, this is it.  The plot is very well developed.  For a low budget film, the set is great.  A must see!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie had so many bad parts I had no idea if the movie was going to be enjoyable, or if it was going on for no reason.   The only part I liked was when the cop was taking the guy into custody.  It was a good scene, but there's so many worse scenes in this movie.  The worst scene was when a girl got raped by her father, but that was in the last minutes and didn't make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is a movie about an American soldier and his girlfriend who are taken prisoner by Germans after being attacked and captured by the enemy. It was directed by Paul Mazursky (A Night at the Opera) and was filmed in France. The movie is great and has a great cast, but this is not a good movie for kids.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the worst thing i ever saw. i was hoping this would be like the old movies my parents used to watch when i was a kid. it turns out that it is not. this movie is so bad that i never got to see my own parents, or anything. its not worth it to watch it even if u want to see your parents, and it makes no sense. i hate it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was terrible. I am disappointed with it as it made no sense. The plot is not logical and the acting is all over the place.   There are some amazing moments like when she throws the pizza at her friend.  The best scene is the first. The girls are playing basketball on the floor and she falls. Her friend tells her to get up and he puts her back down.  When she tries to move, the girl's knees give out.  They are both laughing hysterically.  It is sad to see this movie being made today. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The best part of the movie was the music. It was catchy and funny. But the worst part is that the music was playing when nothing was happening. Not cool. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a total waste of time. It is a low budget movie and it has been shot very poorly. The camera is not up to snuff and there is a scene where one of the actors is trying to walk on a very high rope. This is the kind of scene where you would expect a cameraman to be able to do it. This movie was not made to be good so the actors could walk around.   The acting is very bad. There are several actors in this movie and they act like they are talking to themselves. There was a great movie called "Crazy" with the same director but that one is a bit better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A terrible movie. The acting is terrible and the camera is terrible. It is obvious the director didn't bother filming a decent movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie several times over the years in many different parts of the country and was always disappointed by how terrible it was. Now that I have seen the movie, I realize why so many people hated it.  It's an awful film.   The acting is so bad and the director doesn't know how to show us something without giving us a horrible performance.  This movie has no acting talent and is a waste of time for anybody who watches it. The ending is the only good part of this movie and the scenes where we see George and Dora at the beach are boring.  There is no acting and the only thing I enjoyed about this movie is the music.  I have watched it so many times that I feel as if the director wanted to keep this movie from being remembered by the public.  He kept it from being a success and never made any money on it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot is the main issue.   At this point in the movie, everything seems to be going on just so that the main characters can save a girl from being raped by three men.  It is very predictable.  The characters are all very one dimensional and not even funny.  My brother and I actually laughed at it.  At one point, when they are all alone, the girl thinks to herself, "Well, there are only three of us."  We don't even hear her say that!  It gets even worse when you realize how the movie makes it seem like it would be more natural for the men to have taken the girl's virginity.  All the men are so creepy in this movie, that I could have gotten them all to sign some kind of contract and pay them a small fortune just to take the girl.  I understand that they are trying to show how bad the sex trade is, but this movie is so contrived that it makes it so that nothing else is believable.  This movie is almost 12 years old now, and this is the last time I will watch it. It is not worth the effort to see it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My first movie. It was a total waste of time. They went and filmed an original movie (Cars 2), and took out all of the characters and just re-made the film (I think it was only the original characters and their dialogue were in the original film) and it was much less entertaining. And it looked so much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a piece of trash   In Theaters: June 4, 2005 The first and last thing I noticed about "The Phantom Menace" was how much it reminded me of "The Godfather" - and then the movie itself... It's all about a movie that didn't have a chance against George Lucas' original concept. This is a total failure.   I don't even know what to say about this movie, since I've been watching it so many times I can remember every little detail about it. I know that it was supposed to be the "first" Star Wars movie, but even the title was a lie, since the first Star Wars was released in 1977, and the original concept for "A New Hope" was actually the script from the 1964 movie "The Man Who Knew Too Much," by Frank Capra. I thought the idea of this movie was a really great idea, but I don''t understand why Lucas didn't just do this movie himself. The actors all look like actors from the '60s, and there was only one actor, David Prowse, who actually looked like a character from the future (in the movie, he looks like a typical actor from the 1940s or early 50s...not exactly like Alec Guinness or James Earl Jones).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is okay, but the characters are all terrible. They are completely ridiculous and have no depth whatsoever. I was watching this film with my wife on a Sunday night. I had already seen three or four other movies, but this was the first time I saw the actors in the film. My wife thought I was going to watch a movie for my parents, but I said it wasn't a good idea to watch it at night on a weeknight.   There were times when I was thinking about cutting my wife's head off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film has a great atmosphere but the acting is not what it once was. It is still an excellent film and you can watch it at any time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was really looking forward to this movie. I loved "Crimson Tide" and I saw it in theaters so I didn't need this one. What a disappointment.   This movie starts out with some good action sequences with an intense fight scene between two guys but it doesn't end well. The story then goes back in time and the evil doctor gets married and he becomes a good guy and helps his wife to have a baby. This movie should have ended when it did the first time. The ending scene with the bad doctor and his wife is not interesting or suspenseful.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad "noir".   I thought it was a "bad guy in a noir" film.   The film was boring.  I didn't see much of a plot.  It seemed to go from bad guy to bad guy who didn't do very much.  You never see the "real" police.  The actors, I thought, were average.  That is, really bad.  This movie is a huge waste of your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There is no way for me to review a movie this bad. This movie just didn't even give me the chills.   I'm surprised it was even made at all.  There's a lot of people that could make this movie better, but they chose not to do so. The acting is terrible, and the plot just drags.  My only disappointment with this movie is that I know someone who would be much better as the girl who's the love interest in this.  This movie just doesn't give me chills
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was a major step backwards for Hollywood in the 1940's, and I hope it never sees the light of day again.   The actors were good, but they did not act in a way that would be believable to me now.  The plot is not interesting, the acting is cheesy, and the story is too predictable and simple.  I would recommend this movie as a cheap Christmas movie, and to anyone who likes a campy Christmas movie that is not well written.  This movie was one of the first movies that had a character of "Red," but the movie was actually about a Red Baron who fought in World War I.  This was a film that made the American public and film industry go wild because of its amazing special effects, and many of the actors were very famous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen the sequel and the 3rd film and can't say anything that has anything positive to say about this movie.  The story is lame, boring, and stupid.  When a couple get stranded in the mountains on their wedding night they end up losing each other in the snow, they both have to be rescued by a snow machine.  I didn't care about this story because I already knew they were going to get married and end up getting married in a snowman.  There was no excitement or danger or anything like that.  They had already left town and were running away from the snowman at that point so how would they survive.  It seemed like they were just there for a comic relief.  This movie has nothing good to say.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had high hopes for this movie. When I saw it on television I was a little disappointed. The characters looked a little dull. Not that they weren't interesting but they didn't seem to move very well. They acted in a similar way as the bad guys and didn't really look or feel alive. Their costumes and sets looked very cheaply made. The only other thing that really looked bad were the sets that were being used for the bad guy's base. A lot of them had a fake dirt or clay on them that didn't make them look very convincing. The good guys looked great. The one who was in love with the bad girls was a real hottie. The acting was fine and the acting was really good. The soundtrack was good and the action sequences looked good. I didn't like it though because I felt that a lot of the actors and actresses looked like they hadn't done a lot on stage.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are in the mood for a slasher movie in the 80's, this is definitely a good film to look at.  There were a lot of good slasher films made in the late 80's and early 90's but none of them are as good as this one.   The slasher style, the violence, and the gore is all top notch.  This movie was a bit of a disappointment but I will always remember this movie and its many sequels. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so badly written and filmed, I don't understand how the producers thought people would be interested. A friend of mine is the only person who actually liked the movie. The acting, directing, and writing are so bad. You can tell they have no idea what they are doing. The film starts off promising but by the end there is nothing to the plot. The characters are really one-dimensional, and there is no way to get them to relate.   The cast is really one dimensional as well. They don't seem to have any chemistry with each other and have little to do in the film. The director did a really bad job and I hope this is a one time only thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You'll be so disappointed when you finally watch this film.   It was so cheesy.  In the opening scene, two cops have to drag a man on the ground through a city block, in broad daylight, while screaming obscenities and threats of arrest.  The entire thing was shot in black and white and only had the characters say a couple of lines of dialogue at a time.  No one in this movie can act.  We get a group of bad guys (or girls) talking about how their friend is going to get shot by a cop, and the bad guys are laughing about it.  It's laughable and the actors do nothing to justify it.    A few of the scenes were filmed in front of the old San Francisco Civic Auditorium, which was the site of many political protests during the Vietnam War.  They put up a fake, phony sign with a picture of a cop and a threatening message on it.    One character is actually going to be put in jail for not having identification.      So, after being told she can't get her husband off the hook, another character starts to ask the police officer why she is getting charged.      Well, he does have a very important reason...he's been watching this "act" a few times and thinks it's so funny he wants to see it again.   In another scene, he's seen getting into his car and driving away.      In an earlier scene, the bad guy (or girl) is seen taking a shower and he and a buddy are sitting on the toilet talking.  At one point, he turns around and asks if his buddy is there.  Then, the camera pans up and shows the guy getting a blow job from his buddy.  There are lots of funny lines, such as "You know I have a real big cock.  "    I've never seen this film, and I'm sure it's a very well made film.   I thought it was a comedy, but I know what it's going to look like when it's finally shown on a video tape (like it was in my youth).      "I hate to get into your business, but it's obvious that you're going to lose.   "     The title of the film is a reference to the 1970's era of punk music.  One of the girls was wearing a bikini.  (
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's just really bad. I liked it in the beginning and it got better, but it just ended in one scene. I hate the ending. The story doesn't make any sense, it makes no sense what's going on.   I don't like bad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went to see this at the local cinema the other day and couldn't get into the theatre to get my ticket or a cup of tea so I went home. I came back and the cinema manager told me if I wanted to see the film I would have to go down to the bar and get it myself. So there I was just having a drink at the bar with my partner while watching a film which I can't remember. At one point he mentioned that there was no sound from the film and I remember hearing something like "I don't think so" and there was nothing but the sound of a car and the clunking of the door and the car moving over. After about 20 minutes I realised something wasn't right and started to cry so the manager gave me some cash and told me to go upstairs and see if I could find my film and the other two films they had that night.   I went upstairs to find the other films and they were all very badly made and very bad looking, and some even had a lot of dialogue that I can only assume they recorded when they were filming it. I found a copy of my own film on a DVD which was well produced and it was much better than the films they were showing.  The film is just a re-enactment of a historical event which doesn't add anything to the story, nor do the actors look like the people they portray, nor is there any history to be found, the film is simply a reenact of a movie that no one remembers seeing and only a few people know about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's very hard to watch a good movie get ruined in such a horrible way. A very bad script, bad acting, bad directing, and a script written by a bad person.   I would give it 1 star, but it was in my mind to give it 2.  This is not a good film and doesn't make it good.  I have never seen a film so bad, so horrible, and so awful, so that you will want to walk away from the theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this movie so much. It was so bad. It wasn't even good.   The dialogue in the movie is horrible. They should have taken a break and made a movie with good actors.  This movie is so dumb.  I never had a problem with bad movies.  What a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie really sucks. I know that's not what most of you are looking for in a movie. But for a horror flick you really need something interesting, interesting and good, and this is not it. This movie is about two guys who go around to various "strongholds" to kill as many people as they can and take their money. It's not very original but it is very poorly made. I feel like the writers were just trying to make some money off of this movie. It took me a long time to even watch the movie, the last few minutes really made me angry. This was one of those movies that was just there to get you into the right mood. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I read all the reviews before I went. I was expecting to see a poorly made movie with a weak plot and no substance. I saw it and I am disappointed. The acting is laughable. It's like someone took their favorite sitcom and wrote a parody of it. It makes me sick.   It's not for kids or young people. It is for everyone except children and older adults. It only has one good line.  I'm sure it's going to be a huge success but I don't think it will be as good as the "Scooby Doo" movies.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director and his team went for a very slick look for their movie, with some pretty impressive special effects. But the acting, dialogue, and plot don't seem to make it seem like it's trying to be serious. It's very silly and slapstick, and doesn't even try to be funny at all. I don't want to be seen laughing at a bad film, but the humor comes across like someone who thinks they are being serious when they're not.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting was so bad and the movie was so stupid.   What the hell happened to this movie?   They spent the entire time talking about what the main character and his friends think of each other.  They talk about what they are going to do, how they are supposed to do it.  The director tried to get people interested and then he had to explain to them why it doesn't work.  He also tried to give people the action sequence of a movie with no special effects.  There is no special effect in the movie except for that one helicopter scene.  It was all a big joke and all of the actors had terrible acting.  I hate to see that movies in the past that made it to the silver screen got so bad.  These days the budget is so high that they don't care.  When it comes to movies, I can't stand anything. I just hope this movie will get a remake.  Posted by James D'Amato at 9:23 AM
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters are too silly and not in a good way. The comedy doesn't work at all, and the plot is too contrived. I hope they make a sequel. I don't have enough patience for that kind of movie.   This movie has the most boring plot I have seen in years. I mean, where are the dragons?   It is almost as if the producers just threw a bunch of characters together and hoped that no one would notice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It has the feel of a bad fan made movie, and it is pretty terrible. There are really bad scenes in this movie, I can't believe it's not available on DVD or anywhere else. I know there are many who will love this, but they will also hate it. I mean, when you compare the acting skills to what I've seen in a much better movie (The Blues Brothers), I am amazed at how poor this film is. I guess I'm just used to seeing really bad movies and this one is pretty bad in every way.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is about a little girl and her pet monkey who has to get through the rain and storms to reach a circus. This poor little girl, a victim of her own mother's drinking problem, has become very shy and has a lot of problems dealing with people and the world around her. She doesn't really want to go to the circus, and her mother just wants her to forget about everything and live in a happy fantasy. They get there, and after some problems, everything goes as planned, but there are still problems.  I had never seen anything like this before and it really caught my attention and made me think "How bad could it be?" I really have to give this a bad review because I enjoyed it, but I can't say it was any good.

This movie is one of the most important pieces of pop culture in the last decade. It was about the American police state and how people were being terrorized for the government. It's like the Matrix. I was just a kid when this movie came out, but I remember how amazing it was. The film was such a big hit it was almost on for a decade. The Matrix was even turned into a cartoon series. When people saw the movies, they saw it for what it was and wanted to see it again. It helped a lot of people to become aware of the fact that the government had something very evil going on. I highly recommend you see this movie. - October the 18th, 2010This movie has  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous - favorite - November 3, 2009  Rating:  In this film, humans were transformed into "machines" by an evil corporation. They were forced to carry out their orders. Their existence was so dependent upon these machines that they would have never died had not their machines been turned off. There is nothing quite like seeing a piece of pop-culture that you've never seen before. The whole of society seems to be the victim of some vast conspiracy that is at the heart of much of the information that reaches us. The story of the film is about how the machines, in order to make money, become more powerful than humans and start to enslave them. The only people who resist are a band of rebels who, in the end, win the day. - November the 3rd, 2009In this movie, humans  Good movies are very hard to come by these days, so I find this one to be a very enjoyable watch. It is an anti-war film and as such it is very disturbing and political in nature. The government is portrayed in a very sinister light and in many ways they seem to be out of control. The fact that these government workers are so obviously not capable of making a single mistake suggests that they have been set up in some way. A key aspect of the story is how much power the machines really have. They are very powerful and in the movie, they come up with some

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't remember how I came across this movie, but someone was raving about it. Then I found it on YouTube and finally decided to buy it.   The movie starts off okay, with some characters that I have never seen before, but they quickly disappear.  The film is set in the 1970s when drugs were legal and they were the rage. The main character is a dope dealer, his main supplier is the cop that works for him, and they're involved in a murder that happens because of some drugs that are involved.  There's plenty of violence in this movie. They don't bother to hide the bloody bodies, but it's still there.  I didn't find it interesting because the story doesn't make much sense. There were some great action scenes but not too much.  It just wasn't that interesting of a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very disappointing, not to mention boring. There was no plot, no excitement, no romance, no fun, and a total waste of time.   This movie is basically the only movie that I've ever seen that didn't feel real.  I could only watch this movie for about two hours and that was not enough time to find any humor in this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a horrible movie, I hate this movie, my wife and I love horror movies but this movie was so awful and we just got up and left the theater.   It's a real train wreck, the acting is all bad, but all the gore effects are good.  This movie should be called "Trains, Cars, and Zombies" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A good movie, but I'm not sure it's worthy of being made into a movie. The movie is based on an old series of books, which has been updated. I guess you could say it's the best version of the series. The story is just okay, and the acting is very good. But the book doesn't have anything like that. If this was the movie, I'd have liked it more.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really hate this movie, and every time I watch it I can't help but think, 'God why did they have to make this?', it was awful!   It has such bad acting, and is so over the top in every way that it's ridiculous.   This was one of the first films I ever watched and I watched it many times.  The first time it was terrible, and I couldn't get through it, the second time I watched a friend and he enjoyed it, and we watched it 3 times together before he started to hate it.  It was terrible from the jump.  And I think it took me a long time to appreciate what it was and why it was so bad.  I'm still not sure why it is that people watch this movie over and over again, and it makes no sense to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you know nothing about the Vietnam War, I highly recommend watching this film before you think you know it all.   This film was made to appeal to the mainstream audience.  The acting in this film is pretty bad, there is no chemistry or chemistry at all.    It is a story about a woman who wants to join the army but can't join because she is black and the only white soldier is a racist who treats her like a dog.  This woman decides to go to Vietnam.  I'm sure people who see this film will laugh at her.  And the only reason she joined the army was because of a black man.  There is no reason for the white man to treat her the way he did, it is wrong.   The only thing this film succeeds at is being a story that people will find entertaining.  It's a bad film, but if you do decide to watch it, please do so with the mindset that it is a war film with black soldiers as the main focus. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't expect much from this movie, I always thought it would be a simple film about a boy and his dog. What a surprise... the story is about the son of a rich family, who becomes a man through a mysterious accident. But his story goes into many other twists and turns, I am sure this is only a first part of the story... this is still a childrens movie, but it is sooo cheesy and cheesy is what I would call the whole movie. The dog is really cool, but the movie is made for the children, not for the adults. This is a great movie, and I loved it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story takes a wrong turn from the start and it makes the movie seem very long and repetitive. There was no action or even any real fight scenes at all. There were only some long and boring scenes of the hero running through the desert, shooting at some bad guys that are trying to kill him.   I really don't see how this movie is worth the price it costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very poor acting.   This is how an actor should act.  They don't even give it a chance to work.  This movie is so bad that I would not recommend it at all.  If you haven't seen it then do not even bother seeing it.  I have to give this movie 1 star for the acting. It was very bad and the acting is very amateurish and unprofessional. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie i have ever seen   It is just a bad action movie with bad actors and bad acting.    All the bad actors look so old, it looks like they are doing this for money or some thing.  The only good one in this movie is the girl with the long hair, he look so young and beautiful in this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My wife and I were at a local park and were trying to enjoy ourselves. The sun was starting to go down and the trees were getting darker.   While my wife was enjoying the view, I found a deer sitting in the middle of the path with a dead animal in his arms. We found it rather unsettling and decided to try and leave the path. My wife turned around and turned her head towards me.  She said, "look over there, it's got a dead deer in it's arms." I did but she turned her face in the other direction, I could not figure out why. She then turned around again to say, "I didn't notice you until just now.  "I had just found out about the deer and was trying to escape the dark woods by finding a place to see the moon. I turned around because of her and realized that she was pointing at my left leg.  I turned away from her because I didn't know what to do. I couldn't see anything in front of me and I had a sinking feeling. I had noticed it before on some of the deer I've killed, but never this close. I did notice my pants had some kind of a hole where I had blood on them.  It wasn't too close by, so I figured it had just been in the woods a while. It was definitely close by though. We were running and not really paying attention to what was going on at all. I ran to the fence, then jumped it, ran out of the woods and ran back home. The deer was still dead and the rest of the trail was covered with some kind animal debris.  If anyone is interested in doing this themselves, it is probably best if you leave your pants on.  My wife and me were out in our backyard looking at a beautiful full moon when we saw this deer standing in the trail by the house. It's eyes are closed and looking at nothing. It had blood all over it and it's leg is wrapped in a blanket.  We were out of there in no time and didn't come back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of those movies that I love to hate, it was my introduction to bad movies and it had such a bizarre cast that I can't even remember all the names, this movie also stars John Lithgow, Steve Guttenberg, Dina Meyer, James Brolin, John Travolta, and of course the worst of the bunch, Steve Buscemi   Oh wait, it's Dina who plays the most memorable role in this movie, if you are not into bad movies this is probably your best choice, i don't remember a lot of the lines that she says, and she does have the most irritating voice of the whole cast but still the movie is great, the acting is good throughout the entire movie and the acting throughout the movie i give it a 10 out of 10  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well the last film I've seen before seeing this, but for the record I hated the first film it was a lot like this, and I hated it for that reason. Well this is the sequel and while it doesn't have the same quality or energy, it's still an okay movie and not one to watch on a lazy day.   So I see they are trying to get back to basics, and that is fine, but it takes the characters out of the plot which is very dull and repetitive.  This movie was a mess, not even sure it's the director but the acting and character work in this movie is terrible, and this guy is no different. I can't believe it cost over a hundred million dollars to make.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was bad! It was boring, poorly written and really slow. I mean, I understand you have to move slowly in a horror movie, but why was this movie so slow? There were many people dead during the movie, including an old lady who was begging for her life, and there were too many scenes where there was no dialogue, and the camera wasn't even moving! I can't tell what was happening, I just watched and felt frustrated and angry. I really wanted to be scared because I have loved scary movies all of my life and I love Halloween, but this was not it!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is about a boy who is born with a curse that only him and his brother can use. He has to stay outside to avoid the curse and to get the gift that his brother's girlfriend gives him for christmas. It is funny but the curse is really weird. The guy has a really bad case of the munchies which is kinda cool to watch since he washes his hands in a stream and it makes him get really hungry. But it also makes him stupid which isnt that funny. The ending is bad. I cant believe they would give us that ending. There is a whole bunch of people walking around with their clothes on backwards with a giant monster trying to eat them. I have to admit I was expecting a nice story with a nice ending.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was not the biggest fan of this movie, but the cast, direction, and music of this film were very well done. It had a very high production value and I just didn't care for the story line. It just felt out of place in this type of movie. But at the end of the day, it was a pretty good flick, and you can't go wrong with any of the actors in this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just re-watched this, and I was more disgusted at the people who made this movie than I was at the movie itself.   Even though it is one of the many '80s action movies, this is the most uninspired, the most cheesy, and the most stupid.  It is the kind of movie where you can tell that someone thought they were watching something very special.  They think they are creating something that will be a classic movie.  I've seen countless action movies that were just as bad and just as stupid, and this is not one of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was disappointed by this movie. This film is a remake of the 1970 film of the same name. In the 1970's the film became a classic and now they decided to make a sequel. I guess they were trying to make up for it in some way by doing a remake. This movie is a lot of things...there are action scenes, and some very cheesy dialogue. I would have given this film 3 stars if the action wasn't so bad and the dialogue was not so bad. The acting is a little worse than the 1970 version but the acting is there. The director really wanted to make this movie as close to the 1970 one as he could and he did make up some scenes. The only thing I didn't like about this movie is the lack of blood. This was a really low budget film and they went out and hired some extras that were barely recognizable. Thats why there was no blood in the movie...I mean the characters don't even use any blood in this one! It looks like some cheap porno but it really isn't.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible! The acting was terrible, the plot was horrible, the acting was poor, the characters were boring, the directing was poor (I can not remember the director's name), the sound was terrible.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a pretty bad movie. Not great, but not bad.   The plot is very weak and they didn't really make any effort to create a memorable characters in this movie.  There are lots of plot holes in this film. For example, why is the wife and the kid sitting in the back of the car while the parents drive? This movie had enough characters, but didn't need any more.  The main characters don't seem to have any real life problems, they are just there to be annoying or just to have a good time.

If you like the way that the music sounds then you'll love it, if you don't like that then don't waste your time.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm so sorry you will never see this film. This is a waste of time and money. This movie is a huge bore. There is NO plot, nothing to keep you interested. The actors are awful, the script is horrendous and the music is cheesy as all hell. There are several parts where you don't even care about the characters, you just want the movie to end.   The film is shot in poor light, and has poor sound. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a bad, sad, and disappointing movie. I just found it to be a complete disappointment from start to finish.   I will never go to see a movie about some "goon" who got himself into some crazy situations, and who gets "saved" at the end by some guy in a yellow jacket.  I think this movie should have never been made and I have to wonder how many people have actually watched it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film just sucks.  I have been watching these low budget exploitation movies for a few years and I thought this was better than the first one and was supposed to be a sequel, not the first film.  It is terrible.  This was not the director's first film, he did some work for the FBI and it was his first low budget horror film. He was supposed it to be some kind of horror thriller, but the movie has so much sex, violence and nudity that it makes your blood boil.  What is so gross is that you think this film is going to be good until the very end when it finally reveals what the plot is.  The ending is horrible and makes no sense.  One of my favorite actors in the movie, Tim Curry, was murdered on set and the director filmed the body being dismembered before putting it in the garbage.  When the "victim" appears on the screen it just looks like a dead body with no mouth and with blood all over it.  Some scenes in the film are really good and it's really funny when they say "fuck me hard", it really gets you aroused. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting is sooo awful. I saw this movie with a friend of mine, and when she finished it and turned to me to give me a hug, I just shook my head. I mean, it was terrible. I wouldn't say that it was "bad". But it was pretty awful.   I guess I should just tell the folks back home that this movie's not for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this was a really good movie and a good comedy. I thought there was more to the story than was shown.    It took about 10 minutes after watching it for me to realize that this was just a spoof.  When they first start to show a clip of the mayor talking about a real crime, then the movie turns into a parody of the movie "Fatal Attraction."   When the mayor is telling all the details of the crime, it becomes more and more obvious that this is just a parody and it doesn't have any real connection to reality.  In the end, there is only a little of the real story told.  I didn't laugh or even understand a word of what he was saying.  The movie really didn't take away any credibility. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I like the movie, I mean I liked it a lot! I do not like it at all. I did not like the story at all, the main characters are not real people. There are only two main characters in the entire movie. One was a very old man and his family, and the other was the guy that was running the show. The old man would sit at his kitchen table and read his newspaper or something and drink some tea, and do nothing with his life. The other guy was his assistant, or boss. He would come up with the plans, and have the guy run them, and make sure the right things happened. He was supposed to be the leader but he never led anything. He just got everything for free. I know what I like, and I can not stand people that just take and take from the people they work with. Not to mention this movie was made in the 60's and I think it was made for a different time. I mean that old guy who was supposed be the boss was in a wheelchair. I don't know why they decided to make him a wheelchair, and he kept drinking tea and eating biscuits from the table. I just do not want people to see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was disappointed at how much this film has sucked me into this garbage of a movie. The acting is absolutely terrible. Some people who are famous actors do some of the worst acting, and they make a bad film. There were two other actors that had bad acting that I couldn't believe, and that one guy did the most annoying acting to me, and he was probably doing it just to get some kind of cheap applause.   The movie was just ridiculous.  I have never seen a film that was so bad that it wasn't entertaining.  There is no acting in this film.  This is really bad.  The acting was awful.  They used actors that were actors and made a crappy film out of it.  When it comes to bad movie acting it really doesn't get any worse.  It is really depressing how much of a waste of time and money this film is.  At least one person on this planet is probably laughing at it, and I am really hoping that I didn't see this movie when I should have seen it. I am going to see this film again, and maybe this will get me back on track to a decent movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie does not hold a candle to its predecessor.   It's much more like a cross between a slasher movie and a horror movie.  The only thing that's redeeming is the acting and the effects, but that's hardly worth saving a mediocre movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The acting is poor, not funny at all, and the story line is so confusing that you don't want to believe anything happens.   I love horror films, but this one is so badly made and bad that it ruins it for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A horrible movie about a young girl who loses her dad to a car accident after she gets in an accident. I feel so bad for her and I wish she could have stopped his car but I can't imagine how she didn't see what was going on. She could have avoided the accident and just walked home and been fine. I am still sad for him but it was so sad and I can see why she would cry all the time. I would never recommend this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film is just an unoriginal mess. The film's plot, with the exception of a few scenes, is a poorly written mess. Not only does it fail to tell the story correctly, but it doesn't even try. The story takes place in a world where aliens invade Earth, and the characters are all supposed to be actors/actresses, while the actual aliens/sprites don't really exist. The aliens, called the "Grimm", have come to Earth to conquer, and kill, the human race. While the action scenes are very well done, the plot was ridiculous. The main villain (a giant spider/alien) has to be defeated before his master (a huge spider/monster) can get his revenge. He manages to accomplish this by making the hero (a human with a large brain) his servant. The movie is so bad it makes me sick to my stomach. I don't care who made it. It is bad and I can't believe anyone would watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you are going to rent this film, don't. You will not like it.  I am a big fan of horror movies and these are great.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this movie because it seemed to be a film that could be made by a competent filmmaker.   Unfortunately, the film is so bad that it is one of the worst movies ever made.  The writing is very bad and the acting is so badly done.  What is this guy supposed to be saying?  It would be great to see this on the Criterion DVD release (it is also on DVD in the US).   Also, this movie is rated R.  This film should have been called "Lumberjack Hates Women".   So what are they trying to say here?   Why would a man want to wear a leather outfit?  Why is he wearing a baseball cap?  I feel that this movie was meant to be funny, but is not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is the least interesting of any of the four films in the Alien Trilogy, with a few twists that don't work. The actors are not good. I never saw Alien: Resurrection, but I always hated what James Cameron was doing with it. He had never done a good movie with Sigourney Weaver and she was a horrible actress, making James Cameron look better than him.  The creature and effects are absolutely atrocious. The creatures that they made for this were bad, worse than any creature that they had done before.  I saw the new version of this film when it was released, and I think it was much better, better acting, better effects.      I had no idea that this movie was supposed to be a remake of the Alien, and that the movie had been made in England. I really wish that they would have made another Alien sequel or made an original Alien movie. It's a terrible movie, and not worth a second of your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are several things that are wrong with this movie, but the worst of the worst are the sound and writing.   It has poor sound.  There is not enough dialogue.  The writing is bad.  It is so bad that I almost had to re watch the movie at least once in order to see if it is an intentional parody.  What it is not, is a parody.  Good reviews: This is the best parody of a bad film that I have seen.  A funny film but the parody is so good and funny that it makes the film good.   The Film (5/5):   The premise is based on a movie called The Exterminator.  This is a story that is basically the same as The Extermination except that it is about a man who finds out that his family have been killed by aliens and he becomes the last man on Earth.  If you liked that movie then this is just like that but better.  One of the best things about the film is that it was made on a budget and that makes it very funny.  I love a good bad parody and this is the second one that I think that is one of the better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is an unmitigated mess. The production team has never really had a good grasp of direction and the plot is full of ludicrous ideas. The acting is horrible and the dialogue is all wrong. There are a few good things in the movie: an interesting story and the casting of the young, hot actress, Shauna Cross, who is playing a good-natured young girl. But the movie was too bad to be entertaining, and it's hard to believe anyone would give it a chance to even get half of the way there. If the film had had a better production team, it might have been worth watching.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A big fan of the Harry Potter movies and their books (well, I am now). I read this in the 'first week' that was released. It was not bad by any means. It has great actors and sets. The story has a bit of humor in it and that is a welcome change from the 'dark and gritty' Potter series. There are some excellent moments in the movie and it had me intrigued for the rest of the night. If it was not for the 'tortured' Harry and his family being dragged into this 'witch-hunt' that takes the whole family to their deaths, I may have enjoyed it more. I guess I would have liked to see some family interaction with more emphasis on that aspect of the movies. This is a movie that was made to make money and it does a good job of it. But it is not one that you would want to watch with your young family. It would be better as a family film that shows the dark side of Potter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had to have this movie and a couple others, so I got in line at midnight and left when the movie opened.  The plot, that is all there is, is a variation of the "chicken-and-egg" problems.   This movie has one of the most unoriginal voices I've ever heard.  It's just plain old racist and ignorant.  This was the same thing in a movie I saw at a local mall a few years ago called "Chicken Run."  A man has a chicken and a woman is the only other chicken, and they run around trying to get people to chase them.  If they wanted to sell a more serious movie about racism they could have used a better voice actor.  They could have even made it more dramatic with one of those African-American actors.  I have seen better black roles, but this is just pathetic.  So, I didn't get this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really didn't like this movie!  I didn't even know what I was watching, but when I watched it I was sure I had seen it before.   The dialogue was so bad and I had to stop it.  I wasn't even laughing.  The acting was terrible.  This movie is not funny at all.  It is boring and uninteresting.  If you love this movie then you really should have seen it a long time ago!   Here is my review of "The Room":   A. The room is a room. There is no escape. B. The people are a bunch of people. There are rooms. There can only be one or two people in each room. C. The door is locked and you have to press a few buttons to get out. D. The actors are a group of actors. E. This movie has a soundtrack, and the soundtrack sounds like it was written by an eleven year old child. F. The characters are all morons. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A long shot for me. The film tries to sell it as an action film but it's just a boring, boring film. The action is all over the place. It's a film that I would watch if I was looking for something a bit more original than the other films that are hitting the multiplex right now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie and had a good time at the theatre, but the final act, it just didn't work for me. This movie is a great comedy, but it just lost me by the end. I didn't like the characters, but all of the jokes were funny. I don't remember how we got there, but there was an elevator to get to the theater, but they didn't tell us to go to the top or to the bottom. I saw this on VHS when I was a little kid and enjoyed it as a kid. I just didn�t think it could be anything more than a good movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I thought it was hilarious.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie once while visiting my family in Toronto, Ontario. It was in a small theater. The movie had subtitles, but I did not understand any of them. I looked up the words in the dictionary, then looked up their meanings. The plot was quite interesting, but it was also very confusing to me. The writing was very poor, and a lot of the actors were in really bad roles. It would have been better if this movie had been directed by someone who knew what they were doing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was ok. The acting was good but some of the dialog was really out of place, and there were so many silly scenes that made me roll my eyes. I thought it would be funnier to add a lot of CGI (which the movie wasn't really that funny anyway) to the scenes to make them funnier.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you don't like it, you don�t like it.   This movie isn�t about being a cop.  It�s about a guy that likes to do bad things.  He goes to a nice restaurant and he gets caught stealing.  Then a good guy tells him to�t get arrested so he can go to a movie.  Well this movie is full of all kinds of problems.  So he tries to kill the good guy and it doesn�t work.  The guy shoots the cop that caught him and he dies.  After he is dead, he says to the good cop to get away because he has some kind of a plan.  No no no no.  And the bad cop comes back to life and goes after this guy.  I hope the bad guy doesn�ts get away.  This is a terrible movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is pretty much like the cover - it is a cheapo 80's action film with one amazing character and some pretty cool weapons.   I did not even care for the lead. He was nothing but a "cliché" character with no real personality. And what the hell were they thinking casting David Hasselhoff in this movie?   If you want a quick action movie this would be a good choice, but if you want something more then this would not be the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is the worst movie  I have ever seen. The writing is terrible and the actors are all not good. This movie made me hate movies. I hope they do not release this movie ever again.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      This movie just sucks.   The plot is a bunch of hokum involving people getting lost in the woods and the "Big Bad Wolf" who is trying to eat them.  There is absolutely no suspense or anything else that would make you want to see this.  When the movie was originally released it had a fantastic ending that was a little more suspenseful than it is now.  The actor was great and the special effects were great.  My only real complaint is that at the very end when he is all alone in the forest the camera pulls away from him and he does a funny "What am I thinking" pose before we can see his face again.  This was a movie where the special effect could have made the movie even better.  I can't think of a more terrible movie than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "Lang" (as in the film "Life Story" ) is another one of those films that gets really interesting around 80 minutes. This film features a young female lead, Marietta (Joan Allen) who goes into town to visit her aunt. She goes into an old house (built for her grandfather) and has a little trouble with the landlord (Tom Wolfe) and his son. After a fight, the landlord leaves and Mariettta takes off in a car with the son. At this point, Mariotta finds a man who looks a lot like the landlord's son. It turns out that this man was her late uncle. The rest of the film is a love triangle. One can only wonder how long it takes Marietttta to figure out her uncle is not who he claims to be. She does find the money to pay the guy off, but the film seems a bit contrived. The film is great fun. The sound is good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I went to see this movie the other night and it was not what I was expecting. The story is that it's a film about a man that is the king of a tribe of Indians. The man has this habit of cutting the throats of people that get in his way. So one day, he goes into town and he finds that there are some people that he does not like and he is about to have his way with them. The woman he chooses is a princess. Now, I wasn't a huge fan of the movie. It had that creepy feel to it, but it wasn't for me. I didn't enjoy this movie and I was sad because I really liked it at one point. I loved the story and all the people that went with it. It would have been better to have this movie be a romantic comedy. I think that would have made it more enjoyable for the audience. I would have liked to see more of the characters. I did enjoy the movie, but I just didn't feel it was the best.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie that's better than it should have been.   This was my first movie in which I've done this, and I made a terrible mistake.  I was in the right place at the right time, but I didn't pay attention to the story line.  What I ended up doing is getting caught up in a bunch of crazy characters who aren't worth your time.  I don't think I've ever been so frustrated with a movie as I was with this.  If you like "bad" movies, check this one out.  The Bad:  No story - Nothing really happens.  Nothing in the plot is well thought out.    The film is very low budget and is very amateur.  They had to do a lot of stunts to get this movie made and didn't spend much money on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is not enjoyable at all. The acting is all awful. The movie is badly made and the cinematography is poor. You can't have good acting in a bad picture. All the actors have really bad voices.   I guess the movie had great actors but they don't make good movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is bad.   The plot is lame and the acting is weak.  The ending is cheesy and one sided.  It's very funny and the way it's done is great.  But I didn't find the movie to be very interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really hate to say this but... The only reason this movie didn't suck was that the actor in this one was good. He really played it like he was the real thing! However, I really don't know why the actor was chosen. They could have had someone in black and white that was a great actor.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    " The script was terrible. Every single scene was a "staring contest" between two people, and that's just not fun. "   - Jules Daly   - It was a very long time between movies for them, and now they are back together. They made one movie before they stopped doing them.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is just pathetic and very poorly made.   No plot, no character development, no laughs, no romance, no real scares, no tension, no scares, just a cheap cheap cheap movie.  I don't like horror movies, but this was a lot worse than the actual horror movies I watch.  If you like cheap cheap horror movies that you don't have to worry about being scared, this is a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen this movie a million times before, I've watched it with my kids at the pool and it was okay.  It was an old film from the 50s starring a couple of really good looking people (I remember the guy with the glasses and the wife was hot).   The story was not that good and I never understood how the kid ever got to stay home with his brother.   All of these kids get in a fight and it turns into a fight over who can beat the other kids, it was stupid.  The acting in the movie was terrible, the actors were so bad.  I guess the main reason this movie wasn't as good as everyone says it was was because it was made by a guy who never had an actual job.  So they used the same actors again and again, just to save money, even though this movie has much better acting.  This movie would have been much better if it was about a kid who was supposed to be a superhero and he was the bad guy, like the old Superman movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible! I bought this movie from a movie store, and when I watched it, I was expecting a great movie, instead I thought it was a bad made for television movie. The movie itself is just so bad! It's so bad it actually made me want to see it over and over again until I got sick of it. I thought I was going to fall asleep after watching it, and then I finally went back and watched it again. The worst part is the actors. They all had no personality, they all were so bland and they all acted so awkward. They also all had the same bad facial expressions, I have never seen so many bad ones in one movie. This movie also has a lot of bad scenes, but this one was the worst. I was disappointed because it looked like it was gonna be a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was really disappointed in this movie.   The plot was the only thing that kept me interested.  There were a couple of really bad performances and it just felt like a generic zombie movie with some bad acting.  I think the only actor that I would put a chance of being in the zombie movie genre is Ron Perlman and that was just too much to hope for.  The effects were not the best but they were not terrible.  Even the zombies were just not scary at all.  This is just the worst zombie movie I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen "the other" movie but never seen it before in the theaters. When I heard about this, I was disappointed.  I guess the movie was based on a book and was supposed to be a western.  When I saw the trailer, I felt that I had seen this before.  The plot was lame.  There was no chemistry between the two leads.  In this movie, the women have no personality and the men are all stupid.   The characters in this movie were all over the place.  They all had a different type of voice.  This movie did not have any action or suspense to it.  All the movie had was the same old story of the men trying to take the women's stuff and the women trying to get away from the men.  It was a boring movie and I do not think I would go to see it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting is horrible and the story is made up of bad jokes, horrible actions and a stupid villain that does not even make sense.  I was not entertained at all and it took me 2 hours to finish it.   The only good thing about the movie is the ending, but it is way too far removed from reality.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is terrible. It has nothing to do with reality. It's a story about a girl who's father was an abusive alcoholic and he had a history of beating her mother.  They're shown being thrown around by their father but nothing happens to them. It is very bad.   It's awful. The acting is bad. The movie makes me want to vomit and my mind can't even concentrate on the movie.  My wife and I took our daughter to a movie about a little girl and we watched this and she kept saying "Daddy's not beating me."  This is not an entertaining movie.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen this movie a few times before. I'm sure it will be on the Top 10 list when it is finally released.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie that has been out for years but this time the movie was made in HD.   This is a movie that is really good in the movie.  They should add in more scenes and more story.  The story is really great about how he got away but not only that but the movie has been made in the 1970's which adds to it a really good movie.    I give this movie a four out of four stars for the reason that it has never been out in HD and it is only a 4 out of ten out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the worst movie i have ever seen. i dont understand how it can be that bad. it is really sad that i have to watch this kind of movies for the sake of my self-esteem. i guess it is good to have an example to keep you on your toes.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had a friend of mine and his girlfriend give it 3 stars because of the movie. I think this movie is very silly and unoriginal. I don't know why they decided to make this movie but I guess the director and actors weren't paying attention. This is not what it seems to be.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is really, really bad.   The actors and actresses are really good, and the special effects are amazing.  Even though it was made in the '70s, it still looks really good.  The story is terrible too.  I mean, why did the main character suddenly have a bunch of evil ex-girlfriends?  The movie has too many plot holes, and it doesn't make any sense.  They make out in some of the most obvious ways.  It doesn't stop them from trying to get into trouble.  There are too many things that happen that I could tell you are faked (and that I saw on the TV show).   Overall, I hate this movie.  What was so wrong with it?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never heard of this movie before, and I'm not even familiar with Italian horror. I was really not impressed.   The opening and last scenes were very good. The opening was more reminiscent of a cheap 70's movie (especially in the opening of the shower scene). The whole ending was a little too rushed and silly.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody, but for people who like cheesy 70's Italian horror, this movie is probably for you.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film I wanted to see a long time ago.  It was called "The World Is Not Enough" and in the movie it said there would be about 20 people in it but it seems like there were maybe only 11. I thought it was just about a girl that was on the train to Paris. It didn't really have anything to do with what I was thinking but I thought maybe that would make me feel better.   This is a good looking movie.  Not a big budget movie but not bad either.  You can tell there is a little bit of effort put into it.  There are not a lot of "gags" in it and they were all pretty good.  I liked the story.  This movie is not about the big fight but more about how the people from different countries react.  Overall it is a nice movie. It isn't bad and I do recommend it to everyone who wants a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While I enjoyed the film, I thought it was terrible. I felt like I was watching a bad rip off of The Omen. The actors did nothing to help.   This is just terrible! The music is terrible, and the acting was terrible, as usual. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie for the first time last week, and I'm going to be honest, this movie was just plain bad. I hate to say this, but the movie was shot very poorly and the acting was just awful. The actors played it as if they were on a bad scene that was set up before they were asked to do their part. The one actor who was supposed to play Mr. Blonde was played by an older man with bad hair and he looked like a very old man. Another actor who I thought was supposed play Mr, Brown was played as a man with dark, gray hair who was very thin and thin like a stick. The only actress who I liked was the one who was playing Mr. Brown. She was very good in the role and it was fun seeing this man act out a bad joke. My wife and I were watching this movie one night and she got really tired. We finally got to the end of the movie, and as soon as the end was over, she was screaming "We have to get out of here." And I said, "Well, it might be a good idea to watch the whole movie." And we left right then and there.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was a total ripoff of the 'Star Wars' franchise, I liked the movie but the actors that play Stormtroopers are so stupid and the special effects are terrible.  The writing was so bad I felt like the whole movie was scripted by one man, I'm surprised they didn't use a real Stormtrooper. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was so boring and horrible.   I was expecting something great like a movie like The Mummy or Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull but instead I got a very boring and unoriginal movie that would be better to watch on Netflix, where you can watch it with a friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is great and I would recommend it for a kid or anyone that likes a good sci fi flick. I have never seen a film so fun. It has a great story, a great cast, and a great action set up and then it is over.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's the best movie in the first five minutes, and the worst one in the rest.    The plot was dumb.  This is a comedy about an average guy who has a bad day when the wife of the richest man in the world shows up.  The wife doesn't say anything at all, so the man starts arguing with her.  At the end, he's still arguing with his wife.  But he starts laughing at the other people's jokes.  There were some good lines, but no characters.  I like this movie, but it was too early for it to be as funny as it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was expecting a lot more out of this movie. It was not bad but it was just boring.   The only reason this movie is still in theaters is because it made so much money.  The main character was annoying and the movie didn't have anything that made it special. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie is a bad film. There are no good bad movies. They just are.  There is no reason for a movie to be this bad.   This movie is just a horrible and boring ride.  You want more.  I gave it a 3 out of 10 for the story.  A lot of people have complained about the acting, but this movie was filmed in black and white with the sound in one ear and a TV.  This is how the movie should have been filmed.  The worst part of this movie is the dialogue and the acting.  When you see a movie that has only one or two good actors, and a great screenplay, this would have been a 10.  They really should have added a lot more acting to this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie about a woman who tries to take the life of a man who murdered her. It seems like such a horrible movie that you can't watch it even if it's on a regular basis. I was at the movie and my husband and I didn't even want to leave the theater. You could really feel the fear that was in the movie. The director was also horrible. He had some weird ideas about the movie like it was just about her trying to take a life.    It's the worst movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really wish I did not watch this movie. It is really hard to watch a movie about people in prison. It has some interesting things about them, but is about the same boring, bad thing over and over again. I think the movie was about a bunch of people who escaped the prison because one of the prisoners, who was also in prison, was getting married.    When she had left the prison, she had brought a woman with her. The woman was not a prisoner, but a prostitute, who she had gotten together with, and had told the prisoner about. She had not been told that she had done this, but had told him anyway, hoping that he would think that it was okay for a person to marry someone else. But the prisoner did not think it was very good, so she told her boyfriend about it.      He had come to her apartment one day to find her there, and she was very happy to see him. But he was not the woman she had told her about. So she had a fight with him, and he had fled to New York.  The movie is about a prison escape of three women. One of them was the prisoner, who married the woman from New York, and the other two were the girlfriend and the mistress of the prisoner. The story is told from their point of view. They do not like each other very much. The prisoner had a sister in the prison.  This movie has some great ideas in it, but it falls into a very boring, predictable, and ridiculous plot. It shows very little personality from the characters, and I felt that the actors were terrible, even for prison escapes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What? How the hell can a movie be that bad. I gave it a shot and just watched it over and over again just to see if it's worth it. It's not. And it's never going to be.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The last act is just a bunch of lame action scenes with no actual emotion or suspense.  The actors (played by James Remar and J. Paul Getty) should have just stayed in their trailers and not played this role.    This was not well thought out and is the worst acting film that I have seen so far. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One day I went to a movie. It was a comedy. One of the main actors was drinking and I guess he had something else in his hand. When he walked up to the mic he told us he was going to throw up and he was throwing up all over the set. I knew something was wrong. The next thing you know, he was walking around on the set and throwing up. The camera was rolling and I went backstage to talk to the director. He said we didn't do a good enough job and it would have been better had we just left him out there and he'd have done better.   My husband, who had worked at this production since 1981, told me this was no laughing matter. After years of working for this company, you could tell he was being manipulated by his management.  The whole crew was furious.  I was a teenager then and still didn't fully understand that there were things called "the rules" when it came to Hollywood.  For years the crew would do whatever they could to get drunk, stay out past curfew, and have a wild night. At one point, one of the extras (who would later become a star) decided to drink and drive.  He had taken his wife's new car (he had a new one, a silver Mercedes) to a party and crashed it.    The crew and other extras were shocked that a producer of a movie like that would allow a drunk actor to drive and that he would even let him take a girlfriend with him.  When they found out, everyone got together and came up with a list of demands.  There was going also to be a party the next day.   After the filming was finished, the extras walked out and there was a lot of resentment about it. The movie was in bad shape and had been shot on a shoestring budget. The crew were sick of living in a trailer on the sets, and they had enough of being exploited.  Some of them also said that they had heard from other employees at the company that the production company had been doing business with an escort service for years.  They also said they heard that the woman had been paid for sex with at least a dozen men and that many of them were married.  It is likely that they were referring to the actress, who at one time was quite famous in Los Angeles.    This picture was taken before the shooting stopped and they all decided to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was at a friend's place for a drink and decided to pick up my friend's copy of "The Godfather" because it was on sale and it was a nice sized movie. I was very surprised when I watched this on the big screen. It's not the best film ever made, and I've heard people say this is the weakest entry in the series. In all fairness, this film is good, but you shouldn't expect it to be a masterpiece. This isn't a bad film, but it's not a great one either. The editing and the acting are all very poor, and the story doesn't make sense.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've never seen a movie that was so poorly made that the only thing I could do was laugh. If this had been made by someone with any skill I would've loved it but it looks like a complete mess and is not entertaining at all.    A few actors play the characters, none of them are particularly attractive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie and I got my head blown off when I saw it. It's just not good at all. There's nothing interesting about it whatsoever. It doesn't have a plot, there are no characters, it just keeps repeating the same stuff over and over. It takes a long time to even get to the first scene.   It's only about 7 minutes long and this movie took me more than a whole day to get through.  This movie took a while to get started and after a few minutes of me getting into the plot I was bored.  They have a bunch of people on a small island but no one else is in the movie. It only takes one person to be attacked to start a huge fire.  It took me about a week to watch this movie, it took me 5 months to read the book. It took a whole lot longer to write this review than it took to watch it.  If this movie was made in the 70's then that would make it much better but it doesn't give the feel of a 70's movie.  There's some cool special effects in this movie but it's too boring.  I would have preferred if this movie had a more original plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - I watched this movie when I was 13 years old. I had never seen a bad flick, and when this movie came out I was like "this is gonna be great."   It's kind of cheesy, and the acting is very bad, but what's good about it is that this was the first time I saw a black kid that looked like me.   When I finally saw the sequel (a movie called The Greatest), I thought this was very good, but it was more about a black guy who didn't like black people, and I didn't think that's what I wanted to see in a movie about the black people in my family. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't really enjoy this movie and I don't recommend watching it at all. I got this movie for my birthday a couple of years ago and I was really hoping that this movie would turn out to be entertaining. This movie never did and in my opinion there is a very poor acting in this movie. The story is about a guy that gets a job with a company that makes computers that can't be hacked, and the guy works at a store that sells a computer that is a super computer and will make the guy rich, the problem is that the computer is really slow and if the computer isn't hacked, it will get hacked really bad. When the computer gets hacked the guy just has to try to hack the computer and he ends up being killed because he didn't know how to hack into the computer, and his best friend (who's supposed to be his hacker friend) ends up getting killed because the guy hacked the store. It was just so boring to watch this movie that I would never recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "This movie is an abomination of a film. The acting is horrendous and the plot is unbelievable."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was not good.  The story was ok, but the acting was awful, especially the main character.  I never liked him because I knew he was going to get killed.  He kept making mistakes.  There were lots of action scenes, but they were pretty much all bad.    Some of the fight scenes in the movie were pretty ridiculous.  They were like scenes from a different movie.  We could have done without a lot of the other actors.  If you don't want to watch a crap movie, just watch any movie by Kevin Costner. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I haven't seen "The Wicker Man" for over 40 years. I have the DVD, and it is wonderful. For me, the music and imagery is timeless. The Wicker man is a wonderful picture, and I think all who saw it will agree.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film does have its flaws, but it's not really bad, just not the best thing around.  I thought that it would be great to bring an interesting story to the big screen, but the acting was way too bad.   Overall, I was disappointed, but there were other movies on that same weekend I wanted to see.  If you're a movie buff like me, this is a must see. If you've never seen a film with a woman in the leading role, this should be up your alley. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I just bought this film, and I don't understand why it was so bad. The script was pretty generic with only one great line. I wouldn't recommend watching this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My mom took this to see it on her birthday. She's never seen it before. It was like a "young adult" film at times. It didn't feel like a story. It felt like a silly movie that a kid would have made. And no one in the movie could act like an adult. She said she saw a similar movie in the '70s and she felt like she was watching the same movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A real bummer that the film ends the way it does. The actors should have stayed put, and not gotten involved in this silly project.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is about a girl named Sophie who is obsessed with a serial killer and she goes to the police to try to get him caught but gets a very bad deal.   It's not a good movie and the story is boring and not interesting.  It is just a boring movie and there are no plot twists and everything is the same as in all of the other movie.  I wouldn't recommend watching this movie as it's really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The main problem with this movie is the actor's voice acting is horrible. I have been wanting to see this movie since I first saw it on the silver screen but never got around to it. It is so bad it makes me laugh every time. I think the voice actor is the only one who does not have a good sense of humor and I hate it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The first half of this movie is just so bad. Every single actor seems completely off. They act like they're on a set together, but it's not the case. The entire movie seems forced. It doesn't have a very good story line or a good idea of who the characters are. The acting is pretty bad, especially because the camera is on them the whole time, and it's a chore to watch.   I guess that's the point, it doesn't seem to be trying to be interesting or anything.  This movie will probably only be viewed as a bad memory of the film-making days of director Joe Dante. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is nothing good about this movie.  I saw this movie last night with some friends and it was a waste of time.   This movie will not entertain anyone and has nothing good to say.  The actors in this movie are all annoying.  They all sound the same and are not funny.  Even the lead actor has the same voice as the one he plays in the 80s.  This is a very poor movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The first act is a mess, as we watch the movie's main character, who's a lawyer, in a bar fight, and in the next couple scenes, we see his daughter at home, doing the laundry. But it's pretty good. After the first act, the movie takes a turn for the good."   A lot of these reviews are not worth reading, but here is my one to end all my "good" ones:  "There's nothing wrong with this movie. I enjoyed it a lot. The acting was good, the music and picture was good. The whole thing was a bit over the top for me, and I had trouble with the plot, but at the same time, I liked it. It was a fun movie. It had some bad parts, and the scenes were very long, but in my book, that was the purpose of the movie. In the end, it was pretty good." This film had some good parts and some bad ones, I can tell you that, the story was great, but I'm not really into the plot. The story was good but not great. The best parts of this film are the dancing and the dancing, and that's what was missing from this film. I must confess, I don't like the dancing. It's all well-done but it's not so well-presented in this film, which is why it's so annoying. The actors are great, I really like the movie, and if you love dancing, then you will love it too.  Overall, I give this film four stars and I enjoyed the movie a lot, but it is a bit boring and boring. It has good dancing, but if you don't enjoy dancing, you'll love this movie less.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a joke, and it doesn't deserve a laugh. I will never see this movie again. I thought they were being serious and that it was a documentary. They made a lot of money, but I wouldn't recommend it to a funny movie fan.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is crap. No matter how you slice it, the plot is bullshit, the acting is bad, the effects are bad. The story is stupid. The acting is not funny. The special effects are not good. All that is left is the cheap special effects. The movie has a lot of bad things in it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love this movie, I've seen it a lot and it's a great time at the theatre. I know it was made in the 50's for the black community, but it's not so dated now, so you get some great acting.   This is an excellent movie that was made at a time that was so hard for the African-American community to get a film made.  It was made by a group of black producers and directors in New York City, but all of the film is set in Harlem and they used African-Americans, who were working at a movie theater at the time.  In the 50s they were getting a lot of backlash for their "whitewashing" and this movie was an attempt to change the perception.  I think it was also set at a high-class social life for this era.  The actors are good, the directing is excellent, the production design is great.  When I saw this movie it had a lot going on and was very well made.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The ending made me really sad and I can not say anything more about this movie.   I'm a really good friend of this girl who has just graduated from college. We met up and she brought her sister with her. The sister was really shy so the girlfriend took the chance and asked her to join her for a drink. She took the drink and drank it all in a blink of an eye and she started falling over. Her boyfriend tried to get to her but she was too drunk to even notice. The girlfriend went to get the ambulance and called the police. The boyfriend came back and started beating the girl and told the police they have a video of her going to the police station and was going to kill her. They took her away and after a few hours, the cops realized what was going on and arrested the boyfriend and girlfriend for having a video that showed a drunk person going to hospital and not doing anything about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is like a horrible combination of The Godfather, and A Clockwork Orange. The movie is so awful that its not funny, or cool.   And the actress is so ugly, it makes you want to stab her.  The people in this movie are the absolute worst.  They are all morons who look like a bunch of drugged out criminals.  If you are going to make a movie about drug dealers you might as well just make it a porno, or make it the actual events in real life, instead of this cheesy crap.  I was really looking forward to seeing how the movie would end, but it was just another disappointment.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My dad had me see this movie as a kid and I remember it being pretty bad. I think it's probably the best bad movie I've seen.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "I love these characters, but they all go through a lot and never seem to get any closure."    From the trailers I didn't think this film was going to be anything special, but I was wrong.   I have to admit that the trailer didn't make me want to see the film as much as I expected, but once I saw it I was shocked by the depth and emotion it captured.  The acting is top notch, especially from all of the actors, and the film does a wonderful job portraying the emotions that are on the faces of the people involved.  I wish we could have gotten more time with some of the characters, I want to find out what happened to them, and where they are now.  This movie deserves to be seen by everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not sure what was going through the minds of the filmmakers, they wanted us to be afraid of their monsters but I think that they did it in a poor way. The monster is really a "meh" character, he's not scary, there's not much to do with him, and the only scary part of the movie is that it's about 3 people trapped in a house with a monster in it.   The movie starts with a man named William in a strange house, and we find out what's really going on when we find William and the monster together. But the movie seems to be trying to show a "real" story (with some "gory" scenes), but I was not able to find much of interest in it, and it seemed to be more of a "gag movie" rather than a true horror film.  And that was that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is awful.   They just make up stories and make the actors do the lines.  It's all just fake.  How can they say a guy killed his daughter and took her to the woods and they make him a crazy person.  This is what these movies are all about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The plot is a total mess and it takes forever to get there.  The acting sucks too, even by the standards of this era.  It just all goes to hell in a hand basket and it's all just so horrible.  I've been watching this film since it was released, but I really only made it through two episodes. It really is a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a good film, but not great. It has a good story, and there are some interesting performances by many. But I wouldn't say that this is a great movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had this movie on the second day of release and it is pretty terrible. This movie was terrible and did not have anything interesting going on. The only one that could be likable would have been the villain. He was a really great villain in his last movie and this was a poor attempt at him.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went to see this movie as a little teen. It's a pretty terrible movie.  The story has no humor. The whole movie is really just terrible.  They could have used a real actress for the young girl.   They should have put a real young boy in the movie instead.  That would have been much funnier. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had read some reviews that were negative about this movie. I decided to give this a shot. I had no idea what I was getting into. The plot was a bit confusing but once you figure out what was going on it was very enjoyable. The performances were nice. I liked the chemistry between the kids. All in all it was a good movie, but I would not recommend this to a total newbie. I have watched other low budget horror movies where the actor was very old and had a voice that sounded like a younger man. This movie didn't have that problem. I found some of the acting to be a bit awkward but still good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a good movie. Its a little boring and its a little slow. The movie tries to be funny and it ends up being a little lame.   I was expecting something more.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like the title of this movie says, it's a horror movie. It's a film with a lot of blood, gore, and blood. The film has a lot to offer, as it shows off the acting, but it doesn't seem like they're trying too hard. As a matter of fact, it looks like they are trying too much. I was wondering why the film was rated R, when there wasn't a single scream or gore. There's a scene where a person is being tied up, and the body is being stabbed. I thought the film could have been done better, as I wasn't interested in seeing the same scene over and over. The only part that had any impact was the ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a terrible movie with awful acting and writing. I'd give it an F, because it had nothing going for it.   The story, in my opinion, is terrible. It's almost too bad that it has nothing to do with any real life events or historical figures. It feels more like an adventure film.  I really didn't like this movie. It was not funny at all, the acting was horrible, the story was bad, and there were just too many mistakes made throughout the movie to give a good rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you want to watch a good horror flick, go back to the '90s.   A very good (and scary) film, but not the best horror film of the 80s. This is a good movie, but just not a masterpiece. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A bad movie with bad acting and a good story.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is pretty bad, but still worth watching. It has a strange and off-putting "psychedelic" feel to it, but you get the idea. The film starts out slow but once things pick up it gets weird fast, and it really doesn't leave much time to analyze what is going on. The music is all over the place, and you never really connect with any of the characters. But if you are in the mood for a "crazy" movie, then give it a shot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A film I have never seen. The only other film I saw was "The Last Stand of Charlie Wilson", a terrible film.   I don't know how they could make this one, it is horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I enjoyed the movie, but I thought the acting was bad.   The main thing I liked about it is that it was set in an old school in a small town in the state of Indiana.  It was very fun to see the old school being used as an actual place of entertainment.  The story of how he was forced into the world of crime by his father and how he became the "Godfather" of the crime syndicate was a really good one and showed he could act as an adult in a very tough world.  My only complaint about the acting, was that I feel that most of the actors had their actors accent a little too high and sounded a bit different from what they were supposed to be doing.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "You could easily tell this movie was about a couple of dudes in a bad relationship"   The movie isn't good, but it's not a bad one either.  The dialogue is funny, even if it's pretty basic.  This movie is fun if you like the bad romantic comedies and are in for a good time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was very much a waste of time.   The only thing it had going for it was its "jazzy" theme song.  The movie started off with a great "soulful" story about a man who is a vampire and tries to convince people that they are going insane, but in the end it was all very rushed.  I couldn't care less about it or anything about it.  It seemed like a lot of work was put into this movie, but only to make a quick buck. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There was no plot to this movie. It was boring and stupid and I think the reason it was boring was because the director was just trying to make a quick buck.   It is a horrible movie with terrible acting and a bad script. If you are a fan of this kind of movie, please watch it somewhere else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie  that i've seen so far and the worst so far in the 80's.    I had high expectations from this movie but they were disappointments.  The movie starts off good and then it loses it.  All the actors have no chemistry and the story does not really interest me at all.  I really didn't like it and I was disappointed that it was in the same place as my favorite movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought that this movie was an ok film with bad acting and some acting that I didnt find appealing.   The acting was very much overdone and all in all, its an OK flick.  I do recommend it to someone that likes to see movies that are made for adults, but its not that great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked the original.   In it the character was a bit of an idiot but I could appreciate the humor of the original and the original had a few good laugh out loud scenes.  The remake is all about the kids and nothing else.  It also feels like they added more than what was in the original film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am sorry but I am disappointed to say that this is the worst movie I have seen. The acting is terrible and the story is so stupid. The writing is awful and the plot of "Sesame Street" is not funny. I think the writer of this film had nothing better to do and this is what he came up with. You would think that this film would be funny but the actors in this movie are awful. And the writer is a moron.   The characters are lame. The writers ideas are really bad and none of them makes any sense.  It was hard to even watch this. The actors in it are really terrible and they do not even look good.  And why is it called "SIDELINE"?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst of the bunch.   This is not worth it and no one should waste their time on this.  I have no idea why this is being made in the first place. It has no plot and no character development.  This film should never be allowed to be released to the public.  The actors are horrible and there is absolutely nothing happening.  What a terrible waste of everyone's time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie the other night with my wife and she really enjoyed it. Unfortunately she's really into horror movies and she was more turned off by the end of this movie because of the gore. This movie is really not worth the money for me.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is not worth a penny. It was a very simple idea. The acting was not very good. It's like they were trying to imitate one actor or another.  It's a very old movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you love big explosions, lots of blood, and lots of gore, this is definitely a movie for you. It is a well-done action movie that does not skimp on the gore. The explosions in this movie are huge and they are always the best.   The movie has a lot of twists and turns. It has some action scenes that are very good. I was really hoping that the movie would get even more action and it did not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was really excited about this movie, I was just curious how the movie would turn out. It is just another terrible movie. The acting sucks, the action scenes are really not that well made. There are some funny parts in the movie, but it still feels really boring.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are a lot of films out there that just aren't made for the whole family to enjoy.   This film falls into that category.  I think I might have seen it at a movie theatre or in a movie theater lobby in the 90s.  It has some great effects, especially when one of the characters drops a large coin into a glass of water.  There is no one shot, no special effects.  This was just an empty set for stunt people.  The cast is all good looking and talented actors.  As the film ends, you can hear the camera roll.  However, there is no sound track either.  If you want a family film and you aren't too afraid of gore, then by all means pick this one up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a pretty poor movie and is based on the book of the same name by Stephen King. It's an excellent film but I had fun watching it. There were scenes I didn't care for, and some moments I really did. It had some great acting and a very strange story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A story that was so bad and was never released in the US. It has the feel of a TV movie that was rushed to market and has a bunch of actors that could've been great if they had a little more talent.   In the movie, a woman's body is found and then her daughter is kidnapped. The woman's boyfriend is a private detective who tries to solve the mystery. The movie has some great acting, some real action scenes, and some very interesting scenes that show us what life was like back in the 1960's and what life might be like today. However, the story was so wrong. It was like something out of an episode of "CSI." The movie started with the girl being kidnapped, and then it was just a case of trying to find her. In the meantime, the boyfriend had a lot of problems with his family. He was getting too close to his stepmother and his daughter's father. He had a huge falling out with his boss. He also had a falling out the the police and the district attorney. At the end of the movie he has a falling-out with the woman who he was supposed to be in love with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a terrible movie. I would not recommend it. The acting is terrible, and there are some very bad plot holes in the story. The main character can't even use a gun to kill a bad guy and shoot a guy in the face with a shovel (with the shovel going through the guy's head).   The actors: This is the first movie I saw that the two actors don't look like real people. They both look like the actor that plays their roles. The only thing that made me smile was the movie playing in the background.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "This movie is not good at all"    A movie that has no plot whatsoever. It is just a series of random shots and moments that we are supposed to connect the dots to come to a conclusion. "The "Them" are the "Youths" and the "Whatsits" are all the "Youths". They are in love. That is why the "They" will take the "Wives" and kill the "Husbands". The only person they have seen in real life and who they are supposed their see them together is a girl they know named "Mariana". The girl doesn't want to be in the group with these boys but the boys just won't let her go. They are too young and she is just not their type. So she leaves the group and they start killing each other until one girl is stabbed to death. The "Youth's" are now "Murdered" and "Hanged" until the day comes when a girl who has been held captive in the woods turns up. She has been the "Maiden" and all the others have been the boys. She is the only one left and they kill her and take her to a secret house. She then goes into a trance and tells the "Pupil" who is supposed to be a "Shepherd" that she is the "Heiress" of a secret ancient race that was buried in the ground and is now being dug out. She tells the boy to take her back to where she came from so he can get back to the "People" that are living on the island.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story was good. It was just too bad that it was over in half an hour.   I would not recommend this movie to anybody because it was not even close to being a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had never heard of this movie until I found it on the internet, and I am very impressed.  There was nothing funny about it, the acting was pretty bad, and the acting in the film itself was poor.   All of the actors in this film were bad. The girl in the movie, Sarah, was so uninteresting to watch and her character was awful.  The main character, Jack, was not worth watching, and his dialogue was terrible.  Overall, this is a bad film.  This movie would have been better if the director had gone on a fishing trip. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The man from Earth is the only thing worth seeing this movie with" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has been around for a long time and probably has the worst acting of any "horror" movie of the 90's.   The characters are pathetic.  The special effects are old and cheap.  No one looks or moves like they have a life, the acting is terrible and the acting was worse in this movie then in the "Evil Dead".    I thought it was a good idea to cast Arnold Schwarzenegger as the monster and that the movie was supposed to be based on the comic book of the same name but then I realized that it was based on another one of those comic books.  No one looks like they are having a life in this film   All the actors look like they were going out for a walk and ended up being caught by a killer.  When the monsters come in I felt as if I was looking at a picture on a TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is not funny, nor entertaining. If you like cheesy, over-the-top bad movies, this one is for you. It would be so much better as a short-form movie that can be shown on television.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very sad and very pointless movie.  Noone on the planet will care about the people living on the island who died in a fire.  I will admit that there were a few parts that didn't make sense to me (how come they didn't just take some of the people who died with them?). But for the most part, it was a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so bad it makes your skin crawl!  I had just gotten my husband into the movie. The guy talking is so loud, he actually can't hear what the lady is saying. There was a small girl at the front and she was saying things that were completely crazy.  The lady in the movie is just not real. She had the same sort of accent that she did on the show.  I've been waiting for a film where the female leads act like real women. This movie made me want to go buy a fake tan.   I don't think I'll watch another one of these "horror" flicks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie has some good moments but in the end it just doesn't work.   It starts off with a good idea in that the kids watch the movie that they are trying to find out where they are. But this movie just has the same feeling of everyone's in it going through the motions and all that. And I really felt like it was a waste of all of those kids' time to waste in watching a stupid movie.  And the ending was just lame to me.  The two kids in the movie are great in the beginning when they are looking for their mom and dad but then they lose them and then the end.  It really feels like it should have been better.  I really wish someone would have given this movie more than two stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are so many terrible movies out there but this is the one that was made in the 80's and not on a big budget. It looks like someone took the original comic book and made this movie.   I remember it being in my high school but I never got a chance to see it in person. It was a film that I would have enjoyed if it wasn't for the fact that the plot is ridiculous.  This movie has nothing going for it! The acting is bad, the story is not all that interesting and the acting is even worse.  I don't have high hopes for this movie but I can't say that I like it much either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only thing that is wrong is that this movie didn't get any recognition! The story isn't so bad, but the director didn't have much creativity.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie of a very very low quality. If you have seen a cheap action flick, you will understand why it is so bad. It should be banned.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A fun movie to watch but nothing to write home about.  I found it funny, funny but the acting just wasn't that good.  It felt like it was filmed and choreographed for the camera rather than in front of it.   I hope they make a second one because that was funny.  The plot is not that original, the characters are just not very memorable and I don't care for the way they are portrayed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have been in love with films since I was very young and have always loved the old films like "A Christmas Carol" and "It's a Wonderful Life." One night I heard the movie was made for children and I finally went to see it. I was disappointed in this movie but I think my parents were also. This movie is not for the little ones. I am too old for this movie and my daughter is too young. It is sad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie at a theater while in the middle of my freshman year at Cal State Northridge. As a college girl who doesn't even have much experience with comedy, I found it to be so very funny. The dialogue was all over the place, and the acting was terrible but I just couldn't take my eyes off it. It was great for an 8 minute comedy, but not for a movie that would be a good time to waste money on. I wish I had gotten the DVD but I would have hated the movie anyway. It wasn't a bad watch, but it's just not worth watching now.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A great movie, and one of my favorite films. But it is also one of the worst movies I've ever seen.   If the movie was shot in black and white, and all of the actors were better, the movie would have been fine. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I read the synopsis and saw the trailer and thought I could not make it through it, but it was not until after I sat down to watch the movie that I realized what a waste of time this was. Not only was the story terrible, but the actors did not even try to be convincing. The story was about a couple who wanted to get married at a special location but had their plans sabotaged by a group of "terrorists". It was the movie version of a horror book where the terrorists were evil and the story was told by evil, evil people.  The worst part about the movie was that all the bad guys in the film were played by actors who looked like they were done up in make up.  If you are looking for a movie that will make you cry, watch The Body on the Line. I didn't have tears in my eyes as the movie showed the horror of real, life situations.   This movie is really just a horror movie with an extra hour of action and a bad story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story is a nice bit of romance-lite, but the acting was awful. The lead, Kiki Suwanaga, was so uninspiring that I was tempted to throw my money at the screen and pretend it was a Japanese romantic comedy. The two lead actresses, Miyuki Nakao and Miyako Koyama, were not even able to deliver the slightest of acting performances. I can understand why they were cast; they're Japanese and they've been working in Hollywood for a long time. They may have been good actresses and I'm sure there was a little bit of Japanese influence in their characters, but when they're playing the parts they're supposed to, they look like the type of actresses they were hired for!  The film didn't have any of the humor that the rest of the series did, and I found that disappointing.  So if you're a woman and you want a romantic comedy, go watch the original series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible. My wife and I saw it in the theater. Our kids were sitting in the same row as we were. This is a very bad movie. The whole thing just seems like a poor excuse for the original movie. Nothing about it is even close to even being close to what the original film was. There is a lot of swearing in it, but not even half of the dialogue in the original is this bad. The only thing that was worse than the swearing was the bad acting. It was so bad, I really thought the guy was going to get shot. My daughter said, "My god, I could swear in this movie!" The acting was just so bad that it really annoyed her. When the "torture" scene was going on, I kept wondering why nobody in this whole movie could act, especially this poor guy. The bad acting in this one is just so much worse than that of the original, that it's unbelievable.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is made with the cheapest movie sets and actors that can be found. If you are really interested in the subject, you should buy a real book. This movie was made in the 19th century, not in the 21st century. I think that they should have been better. This is the first movie that I didn't have the stomach for.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was a bad mess. The story was not really that great, and I had a hard time caring for the characters. The actors were mostly just there for the sake of making it look real. Some of the actors were awful. I think it is a shame that this movie was made.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was fun to see how much fun these people are having with it.   Some of the action scenes just weren't very good, there were a lot of them.  The characters were pretty weak.  They were made out to be such bad guys but the truth is, they all wanted the same thing.  It's all a big rip off from "Star Wars"  I would have been more impressed if it had just been about the good guys trying to find out what is really going on, then killing the bad guys.  This one didn't help me at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've only seen this movie once and the only thing I remember is the guy from The Matrix walking up to a guy and saying something along the lines of "Are you looking for something? Look at this man!" Then a second later he's dead, blown to bits by a shotgun. This movie is an insult to the original Matrix movie and the movie that was going to be made about it.   - January 16, 2005What the hell did I just watch?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first heard this movie I was skeptical, I had heard a few bad horror movies in the 70's, and this was one of the worst ones I had ever heard. The reason I thought this was a bad film, was because it was a very, very, slow, suspenseful, and violent film, with very little gore, and no blood at all. When I was a little kid, my family would go and see this movie a lot, so I was pretty used to it at this point.   One thing I did like about this film, is that it has a very unique sound for a horror film, that has never really been done before, it is very creepy, and has a kind of eerie feel. It is very interesting how it is almost more realistic than the other movies in that style. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie has some cool stuff going on, but the acting sucks. Even the most well acting part, the guy who was doing the singing is kind of a weirdo. The plot is lame. If you haven't seen it already, I suggest you wait till its on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this on ebay for a small profit but when it came in the mail I couldn't stand it and had to toss it into my box of stuff. The quality of this film is so poor that it's hard to take the actors seriously. I saw a movie once, it's terrible but the actress did a great job.   The actors are so bad that they can barely carry a role. They don't even think of their characters and only have two lines. It was kind of fun at times but I just can't take it seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is so wrong, it's like it was written by a 13 year old. The movie isn't that bad, but the characters are pathetic and there is nothing to them. The special effects were horrible and were not believable.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's a bad and boring movie. It's the first time I am going to watch it. I thought the whole movie was pretty lame. The acting is pretty bad.   The story is not very interesting, especially since it's about a guy and his friend. The movie was way too long and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad film, not the way you should enjoy a movie.    The worst part is that the film ends before the story even begins, in the middle of the credits!   They should have spent more time on the story, it's pretty weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never watched the film but I wanted to but I can not get over the fact that she is the "hero" of the movie!  I am not a huge fan of romance but the whole movie is not that exciting.  I guess that is because we were so happy when she got her "diamond in the rough" she was such a sweetheart!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this movie was going to be bad. I was a big fan of David Lynch's film Twin Peaks. My brother loved it, and I wanted to watch it too, but I never got around to it. I just figured it would be too dark and too weird for me.    Unfortunately it turned out not to be like Lynch's Twin Peaks, and I really enjoyed the first part of the film.  The first half of the movie is really well acted and written, but there is some weird editing and acting that just makes me hate it.  There is really nothing like this movie anywhere.  Even the music is really bad, but it is also pretty funny.  This movie is actually kind of a fun watch, even though the acting is really silly.  It's kind of like watching a David Lynch film with an insane plot that the actors are doing on the spot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a complete waste of time. It is not funny, not creative and has a lot of problems. I think that the director made the movie for his own entertainment and wanted to promote his movie.   I would not recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is not a good movie at all.   There are very few films that have been more horrible in my view than this one.  The whole movie is one long, terrible nightmare.  There is very little to enjoy about this movie.  I was really hoping for something more than a really bad, cheap knock off of some other crappy movies that had come out about the same time.  If you want to see a really really bad movie this is your movie. I would give this movie a C+ but I guess I'm more disappointed in this movie than disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There were a number of flaws in this film that ruined it for me.   For one, I didn't care for how the film was edited. The ending is a bit forced and doesn't seem like it has much thought put into it. The entire film is made up of quick cuts, and it becomes a bit jarring and almost looks like someone was taking a photo of the actors and then deleting the top portion of the photo.  If you like horror or just want something that is cheap then go and watch this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was really not the movie it's made to be.   This movie was made for people who watch it and are bored by it.  It would be good to see an actual remake of "The Exorcist".   So many people loved this movie.  You want to be scared of a movie, look at "Friday the 13th".  I was never scared of the movie. The actors were doing well, but I can't believe the makeup cost that much to use on these actors.  The movie took way to long for me. I just wish they had made the movie 10 minutes shorter.  I thought this movie was like "The Devil's Rejects". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a bad film, and it has no redeeming qualities. The bad acting, the awful plot and bad directing are the only things that save it from being a horrible film. I saw it in the theaters at one of the most terrible times in my life, when I was really depressed. The whole thing was a big waste of money and time. The actors played it like crap, and the direction was terrible. I'll probably never see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie had a very sad ending. It was all about family and then came a very bad end for everyone.    For those who don't know, the main character (Rourke) has a sister who was killed in a traffic accident. Her husband is still a good guy so they just don't talk about it. The wife, he had a brief fling with, was also in a car accident. When her husband gets a new job, he tells her that it wasn't his fault and he wants her to move out so he can pay the bills. He asks her to marry him. She wants to go and live with her parents in Alabama and just not speak about it ever. After she leaves her husband, he becomes depressed. She never speaks to him and he never speaks back. When his brother-in-law, who is a big shot in Hollywood, comes to visit and his daughter is out of town, he comes into his brother's office and says "How's it going, brother?" He then tells his brother he needs to leave. He then shoots the guy in the head and takes off. He walks out of the building, looks at his wife and daughter and then kills himself in front of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a film that I am glad I have seen - and that I didn't have to pay to see. I am not a very well informed moviegoer, so when I heard that this film was being released, I was eager to see it. Unfortunately, this film is a very poor and poorly made product.   The writing is sloppy. The dialog is often incomprehensible. The acting is lacking. The visual effects are poorly done. The editing is poor. I have not seen anything quite like it and I can't think of another film that is so poorly acted, and that was made to sell such a poorly made film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a good movie and not even good bad. If you are in for anything good or bad you would be better off going to see a more fun movie like, "The Devil is a Woman", or the lesser known, "Lily of the Desert".    A really bad idea.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was awful. I have not seen it in over 20 years but that has nothing to do with the awfulness of this movie. If you're expecting a "Dukes of Hazzard" rip off then you will be disappointed. The main character is a complete jerk and his buddies are not much better. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen it so many times, I can't remember the plot. The only thing I remember was "The Man in the Iron Mask", but I'm guessing that's not the correct title, but what I remember, was a guy in a red suit.    There were so many jokes, I didn't understand most of them.  I liked the guy that played him. He is good at playing jokes on other people.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is awful. It's so bad that it could easily be a parody, but it's not. Even in the beginning, it's ridiculous and unfunny. It was so bad, it made me sick.   A horrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie about a woman who was raped and later becomes pregnant has a plot that is too unbelievable to be believed. When I say unbelievable, I mean it's too unbelievable that these people would do this to a pregnant woman, and when they were found out it was too unbelievable, because why would they kill the woman or even just rape her? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is about a guy that goes to a party where everyone has bad reputations.  He thinks that this person has been having sex with all the other party members, but no one will admit it.  One of the girl's friends is talking about the party and how her ex is there, and how that will ruin their friendship.  She doesn't believe him.  They are playing pool and he is winning.  The girl and the other guy tell him about it and he says "I can't be fucked in the ass"  At this point the guy's friend runs in to try to get him to admit he is guilty.   He gets all pissed and goes after the girl.  It starts to get out of hand and the guy and girl break up.  In the mean time the guy who said he was having sex in the pool is being asked if he has ever had sex with that girl. He claims not, so when the girl finds out he's lying she gets mad and throws his drink at him. She tells him to leave, and he does, but he has been drinking and he's getting more and more angry.  I really don't think it's the movie and the character that are the problem.  I wish they would do this movie a different way.  Why did they go to the trouble of making this film?  I can't think of a time when a party scene got boring.  Some of the characters don't really seem to be on the same page.  For example, at the end of the movie when they are playing a game of cards, the character from the first scene says "If you get all the cards right, then you get to fuck me in the pussy".  This is the third time they have played this game.  This movie doesn't have any real twists or turns or characters to keep you guessing.  Another point of frustration is that when they show the girl and guy in the shower, I didn't really get the whole story of their relationship.  A movie that needs to have more than one point of view really needs to be very well made and not just made out of one character's imagination. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I've ever seen.  It just has no redeeming value, which is the worst possible thing to happen for a movie.  The only reason it even has a good rating is because the music makes you want to see it again.  This movie sucks so bad that it's hard to even finish, and it has the worst acting you will ever see.   No one in this movie even comes close to being worth their time.  I mean, they could have just had the two main characters walk out of the movie.    I've seen worse, but I've never seen a worse movie. I guess I'll watch the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I did enjoy this movie, but the ending made it just not that great.  I liked the original "Jurassic Park" but the sequels and the recent re-releases have made the movie just not so interesting.   The dinosaurs have a good size, but they're not as big as the ones from the movie.  They all look different, and the park really is a real place.  The film is a little long, but it's worth it for the dinosaurs, and you won't get bored in the movie (if you're like me you'll get bored before you even start watching it).   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story of the film is a little weak. It doesn't seem to be very creative, or it is just so rushed. There are a few action scenes that make the film worth watching, but most of the time they are just boring.   Very very very short.  They should have cut out the unnecessary scenes and re-edited them so the film would have more time to show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I've seen.   I've never watched this movie and I have not seen another one with more horrible badness in it.  It was so bad it was worse than a bad book, and I know that's a common thing.  The acting was awful, the script was awful and the directing was so horrible.  I have never seen a movie so bad that I would never again watch another.      This movie is a total waste of time and I highly recommend you stay away from it. The acting is so bad in this movie, and the only thing they did was try to make it worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I am a huge fan of the movies as well as the series. I was really looking forward to this movie because they had said in the beginning that this was to be an epic, but I was expecting something a bit better than this. I expected this to be amazing because they have always been so good at filming. The actors looked amazing. Even though I was hoping that the movies would not suck, I was very disappointed. I never would have even gotten into the series if it wasn't for this film. I gave this two stars because I guess the other reviews said something about it being good, and I felt that this movie was so bad it was almost funny. The plot was so lame. It was like something out of a terrible 80's slasher movie. I couldn't even care because the acting was so horrible. All of the actors seemed very drunk or high when they were in character. I know the films director, Robert Englund, said this was the last time he was going to work with the actors. However, I know they said this movie would be his last time acting. If they really cared about their work they would have made something better than what they did.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was so excited for this movie because it was a big Hollywood production. I got a free pass to the preview in the theater for watching something big and important. What I got was a rushed and disappointing movie with a lot of wrong choices in the story and character. The actors were good but the movie was badly written and directed.  The movie is very long and there are a lot things that are not right. The main characters are not likable and it is hard to see them. The music is a good choice in the background but there is so much wrong.    If you want to see something with a big budget and some famous stars, you may want to look at another film, but not this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A film about a group of kids who were all murdered by the same person. I think that the fact that they could have done more with them is what's wrong with this movie.  They tried to make a decent movie but they didn't even manage to make it halfway decent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is about a boy who falls in love with a girl and is so depressed because his father left his mother when he was a child. The film is not bad. It is a poor film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had always wanted to see this movie, but no luck here. It was about a bunch of teenagers that live in a trailer in the desert. The movie starts out very slow and boring until the trailer is pulled up on television and the movie begins to play. The trailer has some great music and a guy talking about how he wants to sell his truck so he can travel to the big city, only to have a buncha bad guys come and take it from him. The bad guys are trying to get money from the girls who he sleeps with. The girls are not willing to go along with it and fight them off. A lot of good stuff comes up during the movie, it really makes you think. I wish it had been more of an original story and less of a crappy one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is awful. The acting is so bad and it's not even funny. I really wanted to like this movie but the acting is just so bad.   I just can't believe how they would use a live snake in a movie like this.  This is the worst movie ever made by anyone.  The film was not worth the money and it makes me want to watch a bad joke in a comedy film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's okay, I guess. I'm not sure it was good, though.   This was made by some guys who didn't seem to know what they were doing at all, which is a bummer because they were good at making shorts.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The actors, including Chris Hemsworth and Nicole Kidman are all good actors and it's the director who is a bore. I've seen worse than this and this is just bad. - December 11, 2011a BORING director
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was expecting a lot from this movie, and was hoping it would be a great summer popcorn flick.  There were a couple of things about it that irritated me, however, most of the other things were either funny or made me laugh out loud, or I just didn't really care about the movie in the end.   The opening scene is ridiculous.  And it's not just the opening scene.  The rest of the movie is ridiculous as well, and I really don't understand why the studio decided to make this movie about an astronaut who goes to Mars and encounters dinosaurs, when it has that obvious bad idea.  Some of the acting was a little cheesy, but I wouldn't call the movie "bad" per se.  It's just an average movie, where it tries to be a little bit more than it really is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most disappointing movie I have ever seen. The actors don't even act right. I was very disappointed that there was no acting talent in this movie.    If you want a good movie with an exciting plot and some great effects, don't waste your money on this one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. There are way too many bad jokes and way too much profanity. A movie that I had no intention of watching because of the bad reviews, turned into something that was even worse than I thought it would be.     
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is awful.   The acting sucks.  The plot is so bad, the characters are so stupid and the plot twists are not funny.  You have an actor that goes by the name of Joe Pesci, in a movie that he is supposed to be the lead in.  A woman in a white dress jumps out of the bushes and is ready to kill her. When Joe comes out of a room he is looking at the camera.  The woman turns out to be a man in the white dress who then runs away.  This scene was not funny at all.  No one in the movie really had anything to do.  So why waste the time and money on this crap film?   I think that I will avoid this movie and the movie was just too bad.  If you are looking for a cheap movie this is not it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like the original, the sequel takes the characters and premise of the original and puts them on a tropical island. This isn't the best of the sequels though.   The script is terrible and the characters are terrible. The acting, writing and direction are all sub par. This is a film that should not have been made.  The plot is not even that great. This takes place after the events of the first film and it's only here that the two characters are introduced and then go to a movie. The story is also bad. It tries to have a bit of mystery and then goes to a quick happy ending. This movie sucks.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was okay, but the actress who played the lead actress in the movie was awful. She had a terrible body and terrible face. I didn't like her either and had to keep walking past her while I was watching the movie because I couldn't bear to look at her.   She had the looks of a woman who has had plastic surgery done to make her look thinner and prettier.  She was also really over the top with her acting. I also didn't understand what was happening all of the time.  She was always acting and yelling and acting on purpose to get herself into trouble.  I know it's not real, but I felt like it.  The only way I could make out what was going on was by listening to her voice when she was trying to say something. I wanted to go out of the theater and kick this person's ass. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only real positive that can be said about the movie is that it's a little silly, but its only a little.   There is a character called "Mig" who is always playing stupid tricks, which is all that happens in this movie.  The movie starts off pretty boring, but then the movie becomes really bad.  There's really no direction in the movie. There's a bunch of stuff going on, but it all seems really random.  I could see that it was being made for a short, because the actors are so good.  This movie could have used a little more story to it.  It has a couple of good scenes, but everything else in this flick is pretty bland.  There's no real story here, but this movie is just kind of a collection of random ideas.  A couple of the actors in this film were really good, like Richard Pryor and John Lurie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie.   I've only seen the film once, and it's a shame that I ever saw this crap.  A bunch of people at the end of the movie go outside, some talk to each other, and some just walk off into the night.  The only reason they are walking is because they are bored to death.  As for the characters, none of them are memorable.  I was very disappointed with the ending.  Not only are there no action scenes, but there is a complete lack of any character development.  In all of this, I really don't think that the director intended to make a good movie, as he really didn't do a whole lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really boring and stupid. It's just a movie about some stupid guy who falls in love with some other stupid guy and then gets murdered. The guy is a total jerk who does all kinds of bad things, and everyone thinks this guy is crazy. The woman that he loves just doesn't seem to care all that much and doesn't help him in the least. The director should have just made it more realistic and maybe made it about someone who is having a mental breakdown. What a waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at a theater, so I didn't know much about it. The plot is not much different from other science fiction movies. A team of scientists is sent to another planet where they discover that life is possible there. But they soon realize that they are not being followed and that there is much more life there than they had thought. This movie is not very good. The acting was a bit forced and the special effects and special effects were also not so good. But, it is a good science fiction movie, so if you like that sort of movie, this is your movie. I will watch it again just to enjoy the special effect but it won't do any more good.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this movie but the production value was terrible. The acting and effects were far off from what they are supposed to be. I don't think the director and producers were even trying to make a good film.   The story was cheesy and one dimensional. The movie is about an evil guy that gets caught. When he is put in prison he starts to become very mean and nasty to all of the inmates. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you like old, slow and boring movies, you will enjoy this film. It has some interesting scenes, especially one where a girl tries to drown herself, but it is still a boring, old horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is not a good movie at all. I was expecting something good, but the acting was so awful.  It was really hard to believe that this movie was shot in the 80s.  They should have just made a cheapie.  I really hope they make a better movie in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible, and it is not even funny. It is awful! I don't even remember when the film was made, but I remember it being bad, but not as bad as it is now. The plot is all wrong, and you never really understand anything that is going on. I am not saying that it is bad, just that it needs a rewrite, because I have never seen a worse movie, and I have seen quite a few of them. I do like the ending, but the original ending had a better ending, and the ending in this movie is really bad. If you can make out what the big guy is talking about, you are probably a moron, because you can't hear anything he is saying! And even if you can hear it, you have no idea what he is talking. The acting is all bad, especially the bad actor who plays the old man. And even though he is not bad, he is really irritating, and he really sounds like he is just being lazy in his voice. The other bad actor playing the big bad is also annoying, and his acting is just like he thinks the movie is all about him, and not about the plot. The bad acting is really the only good part of this movie, because it makes the movie really funny and fun. It has a few good jokes, but all of them are so stupid that you can hardly believe they are jokes. I really liked the ending to this movie. I don´t know why they decided to end it that way.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a movie that's about as bad as it gets, the cast is laughable and everyone is trying way too hard,   It's just a generic film that's going nowhere,  I can't find a reason why anyone would watch this,  It has no real value or anything good about it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This movie was so bad it made me want to watch a movie with better acting and more interesting characters.   The plot didn't make any sense, it seemed to just be another case of Hollywood trying to be trendy with some poorly directed crap.  No one was doing anything interesting, the whole movie made me wonder why they even hired the director.  It's hard to even talk about the acting because I just couldn't watch a scene over and over again.  You'll remember the name "Cameron Diaz" for the rest of your life and you will be very sad that you ever watched that movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen so many bad movies in my life that I've finally gotten sick of them. I've seen some great movies and there is some crap I've heard about. I didn't like this movie much and I never see it in the theater. It was more of a novelty at the time.   When you first see this movie you don't think much of it. When the credits rolled, you were like "what the heck?" But then you realize the story was made up to amuse people and the acting was horrible.  This movie is a total fake and they didn't care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this film during its opening weekend. I was very disappointed. The story was terrible and poorly made. The acting was poor. The film did not have any spark. It was just another lame action movie. This movie was just a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The entire acting was terrible and the acting was so bad it is actually a little funny. There was one moment where it almost seemed like she was giving some kind of evil laugh. The director should have taken a break from this movie for awhile and tried something new and different.   The worst part is she makes a movie about a guy that looks like an ugly duckling.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What's with all the movies with no actors in them?   No actors for a film called   The End of Time.   That makes no sense.   It's not the first time this has happened.  In the movie, "Dr. Phil" shows a few children from around the world who have been abducted by aliens.  Why is no one from Earth in this movie?    I think the actors are just being used.  I didn't like this movie and think it's one of those cheesy "Hollywood" films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a pretty terrible movie. I don't understand why they did it. They used to make fun of the "gravy train" in westerns, but this film does nothing to make me laugh. The acting is horrible, and the characters are unlikable. There is even a black guy that has been made out to be the bad guy, but he is never a real threat. The music is awful and the acting is lame. The only thing that saved the film for me was the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is an okay movie. The only bad parts are the terrible acting, the story, the plot and the directing. The story is so boring and it's all so bad. The characters are all the same (even the bad ones), and the actors suck. The movie has so many bad parts that it's a joke at how bad it is. If you liked the original (the good ones) you'll like this one, but if you liked this movie you should watch the original.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie I really liked was   the movie  ... it was a good movie !   It was also a pretty good action movie!  I loved   that  ! It was the first movie  I saw that was about a police action story.   And it was great!  You know, I always liked to see   different cops and cops getting into action with each other.  This movie  was a great example  of that.  I remember seeing this movie back in '74. I was really surprised how it was done.   In the early 1970s  , there was an action movie  that I really enjoyed, I just didn't think it was that good.  And so  I was happy to see this one.  That is what I liked about this movie! A couple of things stood out to me about it   when it came to action.  The actors were really good! They looked really good   they did it very good!  But the movie was really different from anything else in 1974.  And I liked that! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is about as cheesy as they get. The actors are great but the script is so bad that none of them are able to deliver a laugh. It is the same crap they've been using for years.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved watching it on tv. It was a very funny movie. I was so disappointed in how it was ruined in the movie theater.  The girl at the movies was talking to someone at the theater before she goes in and it sounded like she was saying 'that is so true' and then she goes into the movie and it was so ruined. The girl that was with her wasn't speaking.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so awful I wouldn't even watch it to save my life. I'm sure most people who will watch it will hate it as well. This movie has so much wrong with it I could go on and on, but I'll try to keep it short. The story of this movie is awful. I think this movie was written by a 14 year old. Most of the actors in this movie have never even worked in a movie before. The lead actress just did a really terrible imitation of a movie star. In addition to this, most of the writing in this film was pretty bad as well, which isn't surprising since it was written before any scriptwriter was born. The actors all had to have the same amount of lines and acted like they were reading the lines from a script. The only actor who has actually done a movie was the actor who played the police chief. He had a really hard time. The other actors just looked really bad. They did the best they could with what they were given. The soundtrack in this one is just awful. It's terrible and the only time I actually heard it was in the bathroom. If you're watching this movie, DON'T WATCH IT. It has so many bad things about it that I'm ashamed to say I even watched it. I hope you enjoy the fact that you're viewing it, but just be aware that it's not worth it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was really looking forward to watching this movie as it looked like a fun and unique movie and I thought the music was amazing! I was just looking for a good movie and when the soundtrack came on I was like "OH GOD IT'S A RACE OF FOUR!" the racing scenes were intense and the movie was over in less than an hour.   What happened to this movie?   So now it's an action movie, it doesn't make me feel any more excited than I did before.  Why have you ruined the film?  The last scene was really cheesy.  So this movie wasn't great? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I saw the trailers for this film, I thought it would be a great comedy, as I loved The Office. However, the acting was terrible, and the story was lame and unbelievable. This movie has no story, no plot and was totally un-funny. I couldnt even watch it. I hate this movie and hope that the producers and director never make another film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting is terrible at times, but they are so busy running around the place shooting people and people being shot back at them it's hard to care.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know how anyone can love a movie that involves people with disabilities in a wheelchair being murdered and/or abused by the police.   In fact, this film is so painful to watch that it makes me sick.  The movie opens with a black man named William (Kenny Leon) who is being treated for an injury.  His family is worried because he is a recovering addict.  He's been out of drugs for a while and is still struggling.  William's girlfriend, a white woman named Tammi (Lionel Brown), has her car accident in front of William.  While the other people are waiting to be picked up by the hospital, William can't get out of his car because he's injured and his wheelchair is in the way.  Tammie then sees William walking on the road.  Her first reaction is to tell the police that he's walking, but the other police officers say he's in a car accident.  Instead of helping him, they kick him and he falls in the ditch and is run over by the cops.  After being held hostage in a police station for a couple of days, the cops finally let William go.  One of them, Tom (William S. Burroughs), gives a speech saying how William could have been saved if he had been in a hospital.  At this point, it appears that Tom was making this statement to try to get William out of prison.  But instead, he's telling the truth.  According to witnesses, the other officers beat and tortured William all day.  They made him stand in a corner and beat him until he couldn't walk anymore.  When he couldn 't walk any more, he was forced into a wheelchair.  Eventually, he breaks out of jail and runs into William. They walk off together and get into a fight that ends in William being knocked unconscious.  I've seen other movies that used the disabled in a way similar to this, but nothing on this scale.  Then, William gets dragged to a car where the cops sit on top of his wheelchair. There's no dialogue in this scene and there's no reason for it.  It just feels like the police are looking for an excuse to beat William. It makes me feel horrible watching this.  This movie is just an embarrassment to the disabled.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is an incredibly poor movie, and it is not worthy of being released on DVD. You will be lucky if you even find a VHS copy in a decent store.   The first few minutes are very slow paced and uninteresting, and you just don't care about the characters.  The actors act a little stiff (I don't recall the name of the actor but I think it is a female actor), and some of the characters, the villains, they just don,t seem real.  It takes the viewer out of the story, it makes you feel like you are watching the TV show "The Wonder Years"   This movie is not worth the price of admission. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is awful.    The acting is bad.  There are too many times when the actors are not paying attention to what is going on and it is frustrating to watch.  The actors are just playing to make money.  I have watched movies like this and the actors just do not even try.  When the "action" was going on the actors did not even react.  It was like they were not even watching.  They would stand there doing nothing for 20 minutes.  If you want to watch a good action movie this is not it.  No one can stop the movie.  So this movie is no good and no one should see it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The characters are so ridiculous. It is an embarrassment to even have them on the big screen. I would have laughed at the stupid faces and silly names. They had no acting ability, and the acting was done by people who were trying to look like the characters. It was almost like a children's movie. I don't care if they were kids, they don't have the talent of the actors who played them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A poor movie by an amateur filmmaker. A bad movie that was made to make some quick money, not as an interesting movie.  A bad film by an inept filmmaker.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a movie that should be made for children and I am sure if one of them saw it, it will be a horrible failure. I watched this movie on the cable tv but there was nothing good about it. It is a complete waste of time. The actors in this movie are all pretty good but not better than most movies. There were so many people in this little movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie on a few occasions over the past few years and have never been able to figure out the plot. It was never that good and usually consisted of some sort of time travel or paranormal gimmick. This time it was an alien who made an impression in a small town who went back in time to try and save the human race. I am not a big fan of the time travel gimmick in science fiction films but they do work here. The problem was that they used the wrong time period, or if they did it correctly it was just so bizarre I wasn't able to get into it. The alien has two faces, one that is angry and the other that is sad. This really gave it a creepy feeling.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a bad and really bad.  The story was bad but the production quality was terrible.   It is really hard to see what was going on when the film is over because it looked like a real train wreck.    All of the actors were awful and looked old.  For $11 million the movie should have been a lot better and a little better with better production. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen this movie on television. It is horrible. A poorly acted and directed movie that makes no sense. The two guys that played the main roles are very good looking. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most boring thing I've ever seen in my life.   And you can't even see what they are getting when they pick the right music.  And it's not even funny.  How can someone sit through this movie???  This movie should be banned.  I have never seen a movie with a title like this.  It's the first thing I see on VHS that day.  This is just a bad idea.  They should have not allowed anyone to have any other movie on the VCR before the one with "HUM" in the title.  Maybe someone would have enjoyed it because the title would be funny.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have had this movie, it was very old, I never saw it, and I was very disappointed with it. It was not good at all. It had nothing to do with the "R" movie and it did not give a good feeling to my mind. I think this was the first movie with a great car chase scene, but there was not much action and it was a little bit slow, but that was very rare at that time. I never had the chance to see it before and I am very disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think I have ever seen a movie in which I really believed the characters would go on to live happily ever after. I liked them as much as I enjoyed many romantic comedies of the 50s and 60s.   The movie opens with a rather ridiculous scene.  I didn't even realize they were going to have that silly scene in this movie.  The characters sit around in a hotel room in Paris (the movie's setting) doing absolutely nothing for the first ten minutes of the movie. There's a waiter in the room, who is supposed to be playing a musical instrument, but he doesn't really have a sound. And even worse, the only thing that gets played is "Auld Lang Syne". And then, one by one, the characters are taken on a trip to another country where they're to meet each other for the last time. It all seems pretty normal. Well, it is normal until about halfway through the movie, when the characters all discover that they've been replaced by robots (the same type of robot they met on the trip) and their relationship is to end in a fiery explosion. At that point, I couldn't even believe that the movie was about the characters finding each other again, so I gave up.  What a letdown.  It was really hard to care about any of the characters.  As soon as they find out that they're robots, they don't try to be human again. They don't even think about what they're doing in the movie--they just start acting as robots.  Even the lead singer, Mr. Fenton, seems completely unconcerned about what he's doing, even when one of the robots comes and tries to rape him. The only way he could possibly be a person would be to have a personality.  If I'd had more sympathy for the characters, I would have enjoyed this movie, but I didn.t.  But then, all of the jokes about what the robots are going to do to the characters don't really come into play until later.  To give an example, there's a whole sequence in the middle of the film where all of these characters are out drinking and the robots (who appear to be just regular people on a vacation) come to town to do some construction work. Then, at the end of the night, the robots and the characters go back to their hotel rooms and they're supposed to go to sleep. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a terrible movie.   This is a completely wasted opportunity to film a truly great movie. The cast is completely unplayable.  The only one with any sort of talent is James Woods, who is a bad actor and has never done anything like this before, and he can't even act.  This movie could have been a classic and it is ruined because the director was a hack.  They never even hired a director that wasn't just there for the money.  I watched this movie on a VHS and I was not impressed at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a good movie. The story is simple, but it has a good flow. The acting was pretty good and the acting was a little too high for my taste.  There is nothing bad about this movie, but the acting just wasn't up to par.   The music was ok, but not my cup of tea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst part is the fact that the movie was shot with cheap actors and poor cameras. In this movie, you get all the cheesy lines that all actors say. When it started to look more and more like a comedy, the actors started to say funny lines. In some of the other movies, actors try to make funny lines when they are not in a good mood.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this film at a special showing at the local Cineplex, at the recommendation of the lady who booked it. She said this is a documentary about a real person and that it's a real film, not made up. The fact that she had it showing at this theater meant a lot to me. She made a great case for the film and talked me into watching it. My wife and I took our daughter in to see it and we loved it. It's about a man who found a woman's body in the middle of a busy street and took the picture (she wasn't dead, he just didn't see her). He goes on to have a family, get married, raise a family and raise his children right. After his wife dies he starts a real estate company and becomes a millionaire. He still cares for his family, and his love of them is what drives him. He always thinks of them. I'm a real fan of film documentaries. They make it easy to see the things that we don't always see. It helps us appreciate the characters.   The film doesn't really do anything particularly remarkable in terms of plot. It goes back and forth on this story of this man, and how it affects his life. It does a great job of showing the details of his life and the people around him. I appreciated how it told the story in such a realistic way and told it like a real documentary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to a movie at the theatre that I wanted to see. My boyfriend saw it first and we decided to watch a movie together. We were seated in the third row, and all of the seats were empty. As soon as we started the movie, we heard a loud "pop" and looked up. We could see a fire extinguisher just outside the window. There were no firemen in the building, and there was no fire at all! The movie was very, very badly paced, and did not make us laugh at all. We looked at each other and thought to ourselves, "we should just go somewhere else" and left the theatre.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is all over the place, from what looks to be a very bad script, to scenes that look like they were filmed off the internet, to the actors acting out their lines so poorly it's hard to believe they were doing it at all.    I could not get into this movie, I had a hard time following anything, the acting is so bad.  I guess I can't stand bad acting, but this movie is terrible, I feel like I just watched a bunch of scenes from the new Star Trek movie.  Overall I don't recommend this movie at all, it's so bad, and a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a horrible movie that does not belong in the horror genre. The acting is bad. It is very disturbing with the music. It sounds like a sick game to me.   I feel sorry for the people who saw this horrible movie as it was very disturbing and not very scary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My wife and I went to see "Hollywood, Inc." for our birthday on Sunday. We went with a group of friends and it was good for the most part. I would not suggest going to this one with children because there are many graphic pictures (which I find disturbing) and some of the actors are very strange. It seemed like the script was not well thought out or scripted, or something. I did like the ending because it was different from the other endings of the movies.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I have ever seen. It was terrible and extremely boring.   I got a headache watching this movie!   You will not enjoy this movie.  It's so bad and is just a waste of money and time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the beginning I was very excited about this movie. The story was really good.  It got pretty dark after a while.  I thought that was pretty well done.  After the story ended there wasn't much action.  For some reason they were trying to make it a Western but I was expecting a full on action flick.  They did use the old west theme but it wasn't used that well.  The acting was OK.   The main characters all had nice roles.  This movie was about a sheriff.  A sheriff who just wants his ranch back.  But he needs help.  We had some of the action and I felt like it was good.   It got more and more hard to see what was going on because the plot was getting so confusing.  If you are not a fan of westerns this isn't for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was going to buy this movie for the 3-D. I went to the theater and bought this movie hoping that it would be a nice 2-D movie with some 3-d effects. It turns out to be so different in the 3D. The characters look so much bigger in 3- d than in 2-d. The 3- dimed pictures look very unrealistic. You can tell that the pictures are made to look big in 3d, not to make the picture bigger.   It's a great movie if you are looking for a good action movie, a sci-fi movie, or a comedy. I didn't like it at all.  I think this movie would have been better with more action. It should have been called "Battle of the 3d Movie."

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The acting in this movie is all crap, most of the actors are either a little too thin or look like they're going to die at any minute. The script is just a complete joke that gets stuck in your head, and the characters are lame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are so many reasons to hate this movie. For a start, it is the only movie to include the phrase "a woman's job" in the title. Also, this movie has a huge plot hole. There are supposed to be eight women, but only five actually do anything. It's not a huge issue, but I thought it was worth mentioning, since the movie claims to be about women being the dominant force in a world where men have to be the help.   So many times we hear, "They must never say no", yet we hear no objection to women working, even if they are only half the time.  I guess we are supposed "man up" and support a woman's career?   It's really sad that I have to mention this movie, because there are other films more worthy than this one. There is so much wrong with this movie!
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like the idea of a woman on her way to the funeral of her young son to see him.  The problem is that this woman has nothing on herself and is just there to be an eye candy to the audience.  A friend of mine pointed out that the movie doesn't take her seriously as a mother.  I didn't agree, but if this movie is going to be about a woman, then it has to take her as a person.  There were moments that reminded me of the "Mothers and Children" movie.  This movie is about a young woman trying to make it in the world. She makes a few good friends and even comes back to her mother's funeral.    In all honesty, I didn`t think that this was a very good movie. The acting was really bad.  It felt like they wanted to be funny so they did a lot of comedy and not really trying to develop this character.  That said, I really don`t remember the movie and it is hard to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only good thing about this movie is the ending of the movie.  I don't think there should have been a film ending.  The movie was so bad it almost made me believe it was just a terrible movie. And there were so many things that could have been better.  This movie was a complete disaster.  A few times the characters would be caught in a crossfire or something like that. It was very disjointed.  There were sooooo many horrible things going on it was hard to keep track of.  One of the main characters was a very weak character. He was so thin he looked like he couldn't move. He would try and run away a lot.  And the whole movie was just so weird. I mean just look at these two people walking.   I could watch this movie all day. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A really, really bad movie that is so bad you can't even watch it. It is just a bunch of actors standing around and talking in the background while the bad movie plays in the foreground. The acting is awful. The worst one in the movie, with the worst acting. They look like people in a bad TV show. The film itself is bad. I don't think it was ever produced in America. It was made in Japan by someone who had no idea what he was doing. He had a group of guys in Japan that did this. They did this movie, and it is just such a bad flick. It has all the right ingredients to make a hit movie. It would have been good to see it made on the American screen.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I saw the movie I thought that it had a great idea, but the execution was bad. The story was interesting but the movie was terrible. It was also too long and way too boring. I thought the best of the bad movie was The Rock.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is really bad! The plot is retarded, the acting is retarded. It's so bad I don't even know where to start. If you want to see a movie that has bad acting, bad acting that you can actually hear, stupid plot, and lame humor then you have found it. If it's your first time watching a movie, go back to watching the "good" movies and let the new ones have at it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to say, the movie itself was terrible. It had to be one of the most inept attempts at a musical film ever made and yet somehow it still managed to pull off a "hilarious". I mean, if you watch the movie and hear the music in the background, you think, "this movie is pretty funny, right?" But there were way too many things that made it really ridiculous.    In particular, the "music", or lack of it, was terrible to begin with. It wasn't even "oldies". It was really awful. And by awful I mean terrible.  It's like they pulled out all the oldies and oldies rock hits from decades ago. It just got so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Well, first of all,   I   love   and   so   everything about this   movie,  but the acting   is. I  loved the cast, and they were amazing, but  their   performances are horrible.   The   scenes   where   they   were   acting,  were   horrible  , and  it   looks like   their    .   That   was   bad   the actors and  I have   seen worse.  If   you   like   a good mystery,   try   this, it is   worth the   wait   to see   it.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was so excited to watch this movie because it was one of my favorite movies growing up, but as soon as I saw it, it ruined my childhood. I was completely disappointed in the acting, direction, writing, and direction of the movie, and I just couldn't understand why it took 10 years for this movie to be released. If you're in the mood to see a cheesy 80's movie, this is the movie for you. It's just too cheesy to be good.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie for a week and I could NOT recommend it. The acting is really bad. It's all bad. I have seen many of the movies from this crew and I'm surprised at how bad this film is.   The story is so stupid. There is no point at all and it's just a lot of lame jokes and lame acting.  The plot of the movie is so lame and not worth watching. There's no point. I could not believe that people paid for this film. I can't stand bad movies.  I have never seen a movie that is so bad I can tell I've just seen the first ten minutes.  This movie had a horrible story, stupid plot, bad acting, and stupid ending.  If you want a bad film, this is it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    After watching a few movies on youtube to improve my knowledge of movies and music I came across this movie.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is not a bad film.  I am very disappointed with it. I was never a big fan of this movie when I first saw it in the early seventies. The film is poorly acted and written. I don't understand why they did this.  The acting is so bad.  Michael Caine is just not good. His character is always saying the wrong thing and trying to be funny. It takes him a long time to understand what is going on. When he finally understands what he is supposed to say, it is almost comical.  You may like this movie if you think the people in it are funny and you laugh a lot. If you are a serious viewer you will not enjoy this. For those who think this is a silly movie, you will be disappointed.  This movie has no plot, no story line, no twists and turns and a very bad performance from Michael C.   It is a very short film. It would take maybe a half hour to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What happens when the movie goes down.   This movie should have been shot at night with a film camera or not been in the first place.  The whole movie is a nightmare. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was great to see a little bit of the old Hollywood magic at work. Unfortunately, the director, Tom Schulman, was so in the head that he never took it in the right direction.    The actors were great, but the acting wasn't what I expected of Hollywood actors.   I was very disappointed that they were filmed in a different location and the script was far too long for what was really a 2 hours of entertainment.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at a local theater. We were seated at a table to the right of the screen. The theater wasn't very well lit and it was a little chilly. The picture looked a bit washed out. The sound was also very poor.  The picture was so bad I would have never noticed the bad acting. I was also concerned that it was bad for the first half of the movie. The story had no direction.   A couple of the actors didn't seem to want to be there. A couple even said something funny or out of character.  It just didn't sound like a good movie.  I would hate to see this movie on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's really a movie to get into and have a few drinks, it's really not that interesting.   The actress is a great actress but the guy playing the guy is so dumb and doesn't even know what he is talking about.  The guy is on TV and he's talking to some girl and he says, "the guy on the other end of the line says he can make you love anyone." The girl says, she can make anyone love anyone but he's not talking about a guy.  He's talking about his ex-wife and his new girlfriend.  You think he'd know what his ex was saying about him and what was bothering him but it's obvious he didn't do any research.  I have never seen the film it's bad.  It is a comedy but I don't want to see that movie again because I am so disgusted by it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was not a fan of the first one, I only remember it because it made a guest appearance by a character I knew in the old Twilight Zone. So I was pleasantly surprised to find out this sequel was a complete mess.  The story is fairly typical as you follow the same characters in a bunch of different parts of the country.  This part of the movie is so bizarre that you almost feel sorry for all the characters, especially the girl who has been forced to join a group of soldiers.  It's so bad it's hilarious and I found myself laughing like a fool.  They're supposed to be fighting evil and there's not even a hint of it, everything is just a mess and the plot seems to have been thrown together in a hurry.  I would not recommend this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete and utter waste of money.  It's so much better than the movie it's based on.   And there is absolutely no reason to waste your time watching this crap.  The movie itself is a total disaster.  I don't think it even has an actor in it who can act.  There are a few scenes where the camera just panics and falls down on top of you.  Also, the whole "family" is a bunch of idiots. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The best movie ever made that was just plain stupid.   I have no respect for people who would pay money to see this movie.  I don't know if I'm more disgusted with those who made this movie or those who were too stupid to make a good movie. It was just a total disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was excited to see this movie after the trailer. I'm not so excited to watch it.   The characters were way to thin and it would have been a better movie if the plot was just to explain what happened and what led up to it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In my opinion, the movie is boring. It is a movie where the hero has a bunch of superpowers and he has to use them, but he still is stuck in some boring routine and that's where the plot is.   If you are watching it for the superpowers, then no, you won't enjoy it. But if you want a simple, entertaining movie with some plot, then I suggest you not to miss this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was terrible. I couldn't even watch it.   You can say you love a movie like this, but you're wrong.  The acting in this movie was just so-so.  It doesn't really look like the characters are trying too hard.  Maybe they should have had some extras in the movie.  You never get to see if the girl is serious or not, and you never get a chance to see what she's thinking.  This film is a complete waste of money.  I would never watch this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't enjoy this at all, but i do not hate it, so i won't call it a bad film. The first half of the movie was awesome, however at the end, it just went downhill. There was nothing else to it, it was just a bunch of bad ideas that did not work. The acting was terrible, especially the young guys. The action sequences where just terrible. There wasn't even enough blood. The only decent scene was when it was raining. The girl was really cute. I think there was a more interesting story with more interesting characters, but that didn't happen.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie. This movie is about the best part of the film and the worst part of it. The movie takes place in a bar. In the bar, some guy, who has gone crazy, has gotten in a fight with some other guy. The guy who has gotten beat up starts attacking all the people in the bar with a knife. Now, everyone has gone into hiding, but a woman stands up for herself. The bad guy shoots her, and she dies in front of everyone. As a result, he goes nuts and starts killing everyone.   This movie was not enjoyable.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think it's a good movie, but I think if the movie was released without any trailers, it would not get as much hype and the reviews of people who have seen it may be different than what the movie is. There is really nothing bad about the movie, and I was really excited about this movie when it came out, because I thought it was a great film, but unfortunately, I think the hype was just too big.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought this was the worst movie ever made. Why did you have to bring in all of the women in the movie with no lines to give a bit of character?  The movie is just like watching all of this dumb female stuff from the 80s.  I hate watching this crap.  The only female character I liked was this one girl that was kind of stupid but was really cute.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is absolutely horrible. The acting was terrible and the plot was just boring. It was very hard to understand what was going on and the actors did not look the way they do in their movie.   I don't know who is really directing or who wrote this movie. If this movie was made today it would get a 1 star rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It takes a whole half hour to get through the first act, and the ending is so poorly done. What kind of filmmakers have to take an hour to show a couple of children in their hometown?   The acting was terrible, too. The actors were all in terrible shape from drinking too much. The only redeeming thing about this movie is the title: "The Long Goodbye." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is really bad. I really liked this movie. I don't even know why they didn't make a sequel, but I do know it's probably because they could have made the story better and kept the comedy and the adventure. The story is terrible and so was the acting. If you don't like the stupid movies, skip this one.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I gave this movie three stars, but in my humble opinion it is a poor, underdeveloped, under-directed and under-thought movie.  It tries to be a crime story, but doesn't go the extra mile.   When I was watching this movie, I kept wondering what was going to happen to the guy who broke in, and why they would let him go.  He is not the villain in this movie. He is basically the hero.  But he is a victim.  Why would the bad guys let him live if they knew that he was going into a house?   There is some great action, and some great acting in this film, but it is not what makes it great.  The script is horrible.  If you have seen this movie before and want to see a good film like the old Clint Eastwood Westerns, look at the early 90's and see if this movie has aged any better.  I saw this on a trip to Hollywood and was shocked by the horrible script, which doesn't help with the acting.  This film was made in 1994, and it shows. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A great movie about a man who, as a young man, was sent to jail for being homosexual. He was then sent back to prison for murdering someone. I was not gay, and as a result, I did not understand anything about what was happening in this film. The violence was graphic and sadistic, and the character, the young man who was imprisoned, looked like he had been thrown off a roof. The movie was about a terrible tragedy and the way it was portrayed made it all the worse. I do not recommend this movie, nor does anyone I know. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is not good.   I bought the DVD, but it's only in 2D.  I can't believe it.  If you are not into the whole "slash and slash" thing, then this might not be for you.  It's a fun time, but not fun in a good way.  There are a lot of bad-ass characters in this movie (there are also some funny ones).  The plot is kind of lame and you get the feeling this is just a cheap thrill ride.  This will probably appeal to people who don't like violence, but if you are into this kind of thing then this won't be for ya.  The DVD version has some cool extras, but as far as I can tell none of the extras are new.  And finally, there are some cool "action" moments at the end that don't even show up on the DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has NO merit!  The actors all do an absolutely terrible job!   The story line is boring!  There are no funny lines!  If you watch this movie and want something interesting, watch the movie "A Good Day to Die Hard".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this movie to watch it in the theater. I wasn't in the mood to watch a bad film.   This is basically a scene from the movie with a really good actor. It was really well done. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie when it came out. I was a huge fan of the original book series and enjoyed the movies so much I bought the DVD. This movie was completely terrible.  The acting was so bad that it actually made the book series look good.  I have been meaning to write a review for this movie for a while, and the reviews are so negative that I can only say it was bad.   When I watched it in theaters a few years ago, there was a very good audience reaction. The acting and the storyline were so good that you felt like you were watching a legitimate Star Wars movie. I would have gladly spent my money to see this movie again and I was very disappointed when I saw it on TV.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I enjoyed the movie, but it is very silly and poorly shot. The actress is a great actress but it's obvious she just walked into the part because it was a pretty lame part. She is supposed to be a woman who is in her 40s. And the other people are her friends and they are all very old. You will see what I mean when you see the movie. This movie just does not deserve to be watched by anybody. It's made for a laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie that was just a bad idea with bad execution, that was poorly shot and poorly shot with bad actors.    I have to give this movie 2 stars for making me laugh out loud. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While I am disappointed that I watched this movie in the theaters, this is not a terrible film, just one that falls well below the standard I had set for it. The movie is full of interesting ideas and characters. It just lacks an edge.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is an abomination. It is an expensive, big budget movie that has a mediocre script that makes no sense at all. The movie's premise, the movie tries to tell the viewers, is that a group of teens have been kidnapped by aliens. These aliens take them to an underwater city. The aliens want the teenagers to help them build a city on Earth. They tell the teenagers that the humans are stupid and can't do anything right. The kids are shown a secret alien ship, that is underwater, that has been waiting for the humans to help build. The teens are taken there, and have to do what the aliens say. They are told to go to the mall to search for the keys to the spaceship. When they find the keys, they are told that they need to take them home. However, when the teens go to take the keys home, they find out that the aliens have also been waiting there. The teenagers are forced to get a gun from a security guard and go out to shoot and kill the aliens. The rest of the movie is them searching for keys and doing whatever the aliens told them to do. The humans were not stupid, the aliens were.   A few people liked the movie, but most people hated it. It didn't work because of the horrible script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    -   This movie sucks. The cinematography is bad and the actors are awful. They look like they're going through a terrible hangover. This movie was made in the 80s and was filmed on film. You could see the difference between film and video. The actors don't have that fresh look. You can tell they've seen a lot of this stuff. There's not a lot to watch in this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I have ever seen. I would have given it zero stars if it weren't for the fact that it has one of the most evil characters I have seen in a movie. I was surprised to find out that this movie was directed by Stephen King, who directed and wrote Carrie (1976), as well as The Shining (1980), among others. This movie is about a girl named Samantha who is sent to an old insane asylum after her parents are murdered by her abusive, retarded, and abusive stepfather, who was just released from the asylum. The movie is full of disturbing violence and horrible gore. I felt sick as I watched this movie and I had to keep turning the lights off and on to avoid the disturbing visuals. I am not sure why, but I felt bad for the girl, she was very abused, mentally handicapped, and abused sexually. She is sent there, because her mentally handicap husband ran away and died, which is why she needs the money and to get her some independence. The way she has been treated is so disgusting, and even if you can't understand the language, you will be left thinking "what is wrong with that little girl?" I wouldn't even want to watch this movie with my children.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had heard about this movie but never watched it. I'm glad I did! The story is very interesting.   The movie is like a horror story but it's all very believable.  The actors were great in this.  This movie is really scary and you'll want to run for the hills if you see this one on TV.  A lot of people will like this movie because the story is so well done and the actors are great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went with the family and they came home with a lot of laughs and a nice story. Unfortunately, this story is far from a positive one. This is a tale about a man whose daughter was murdered by her own father. He is determined to get her killer and tries to track the man down. The film was made to sell a movie in the late 60's and early 70's. It was a dark tale and this man does a great job of capturing the essence of the situation. Unfortunately the story falls apart when the wife comes forward to claim that her husband raped her. She is the main character in the film. This seems like an odd choice for a film because it seems to make a pretty poor impression. I found it more like a soap opera than a thriller. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is so bad, that I wonder how a director would make a film like this without a good script, which is completely lacking. This film looks like it was made in a poor home movie production, as if the poor quality and lack of professionalism could be forgiven. It's like a really bad amateur movie, with bad acting, poor dialogue, poor production values, poor cinematography, and bad effects. The whole film looks bad, but it's even worse to watch. The dialogue and acting is just bad, and the acting is very bad too, making it very hard to follow. This is a truly terrible film, that just keeps getting worse and worse, with no one even attempting to improve on it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While not all terrible movies are bad, this one, despite all the great effects, was a poor imitation of a good movie. If you're a Star Wars fan, this film is a definite disappointment. If not, this is a cheap attempt at "re-doing" the original.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Very disapointing. I saw it on opening weekend, at a small theater, and I left right after it. It was so bad that I had to walk to a much bigger theater to see a different film, just to watch the next movie, and didn't even get to see the last one.   I really thought there would be more to the film than what there was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible and i hate the movie very much. the movie starts off very good, very interesting, but then it gets stupid. the plot is really stupid, the way it is done is stupid, it just goes around with no purpose and it just gets boring after awhile. if you are a fan of the film then you should watch it but if you dont watch it then you can call me a bitch, i think that i made a horrible mistake and made the movie for people that watch bad movies. i was expecting a really interesting movie and instead i got this movie that is just dumb.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad film.   The writing is terrible, the acting is awful, and the plot is terrible.  The acting is terrible at all the parts they're in and the writing is completely off.  A great action film is a great action movie but this one is far from it.  It's a story about a kid who is a good guy and is trying to be a good person but eventually realizes he is a horrible person.  If I were to describe this in one word I would say it's like a teenager who knows nothing about life and is watching something they think is pretty cool.  They have great action scenes but it's all fake and not very good.  I could have watched something better but I just don't see the point in watching something that is so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I never thought I'd be a huge fan of any of the Saw films, but Saw VI was way worse than the rest, and this was even worse than their first two movies.   It had some funny parts that made it fun, but the acting was atrocious, and the acting wasn't even very good. The acting was also way too fake and over the top, and it came off as a slap in the face for all the good acting from the rest of the films.  I mean, even though it's an Saw movie, how the hell could the main actors be that bad, and even though they're trying to be serious, it just comes off as stupid and out of touch with reality.  The effects in this film were very amateurish, and they were all way too obvious, and when you see it in real life, it doesn't even look real, so it's hard to believe it even happened.  And I'll admit that the music was pretty good.  A few of the performances were just flat out awful, so even though this was a Saw movie and they're all bad, they weren't even all bad in the same way, and I'm glad the cast wasn't all really terrible actors.  As far as the plot was concerned, it was the same tired thing. Just two guys with an axe and a chainsaw go around trying to kill each other, with a bit of gore thrown in for good measure.  This was made for the cheapest of laughs, but I just couldn't do it for a whole movie.  My favorite part was when they cut off one of the actors' heads, and he just starts doing the dead guy dance to the song "Just Can't Get Enough of Your Love" by the Bangles, but it's still pretty gross.  It's just so bad, I can't even believe they actually let this thing make it to theaters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A great movie for people who like fun.  The characters are sooo funny, that I found it easy to laugh at most parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was so bad it didn't matter.   They don't even know how to dress the girls. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad you can't even tell it's a movie. If you go into it expecting a cool movie, you're gonna be disappointed. The acting is pretty bad too. I have seen worse. The story is so dumb it's hilarious. It's like a kids book about a guy with an axe who goes on a murder rampage. A friend of mine saw it once and said the only reason he wasn't laughing more was because he couldn't believe how bad it was.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a decent movie, but in this respect it is better than "The Lord of the Rings" (which was better than this). It shows how the people who ran the country at the time are not good people at all.  This movie has a LOT of nudity and sex scenes.  The music is good and some of the actors do good work.  I am glad they released a good movie about that time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have watched this movie a bunch of times, and once it was a really good movie. The first time I saw it, it was in a theater with a giant screen, and that was when it was new. It wasn't a "mature" film, and I was surprised by how good it was.  It was in black and white, and they played the soundtrack in its entirety, and all the songs had the right energy and the right feel. Then they changed to color, and it looked more like an average B movie, and my favorite part was that it was played with a full orchestra, and this was much better.  I enjoyed this film a lot and the ending was great.   The next time I seen it, the projectionist had a heart attack, and the film was almost totally out of focus (I had to switch from the 2-channel to the mono, but it was still a great movie).   That movie should never have been released. I'm glad I got to see it once, and not so much to see what happened to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen some terrible movies. But, I must say, this is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. It is filled with so many blatant mistakes, that even a casual viewer would be able to catch them. It makes a very bad joke out of everything, and at times even seems as if the author is trying to get a laugh out of it.   It is about a young woman named Julia who is taken hostage by a man called Dr. Z (Tom Cruise). The story goes that Julia was sent to visit him because her parents were too busy to take care of her. They have a daughter who is supposed to be in the same grade, but he never actually shows up for the meeting. I guess that explains why she didn't notice him. Well, anyway, she is taken into the house of Dr.Z. He doesn't take her seriously, and as you can imagine, she doesn't find out what the deal is. Eventually, she escapes and heads home. The rest of the movie follows her being taken over by Dr.z, and on the way back home, she makes it out to a large lake where the kidnapper is waiting to kill her.  After this, Julia is taken by the kidnappers to a mansion where the money is hidden, but of course, nothing is hidden there. Julia then tries to contact the authorities, but they are nowhere to be found. So she decides to go to the police station, but she finds that Dr. z is there waiting for her. After a brief fight, she flees, and then ends up in an abandoned house with the kidnapers.  There is not much else to say about this movie, really. I don't think the director had a clue what he was doing.  I didn't care for the movie at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A very bad movie, but I'm sure someone else out there will enjoy it better than me. The acting is terrible. A terrible actor like Gary Cole doesn't get a good enough line to be good in this. I don't like this at all. I hope it's only in the DVD version because of the terrible acting. I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie because of it's star, Dolly Parton. But, that's not happening now. I have a feeling that Parton is going to come out with a new movie called "Dolly's World". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I think of the word "thrillers," the first thing that comes to mind is The Fly. So, when I heard that the remake of that film was about to come out, I was quite excited.   It is a decent movie, though I didn't like it all that much.  The action is pretty good, and the cast is all quite good.  For the remake, the director was hired for the original as well.  He made it much better, but at the same time, his remake is worse than the original.  It does have the same cast, and that is really not all that great.  Even though the main story is not bad, the action is just not as good, because of the lack of actors.  This was not really the remake I wanted, but I guess it will do pretty well.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I loved this movie! I had high hopes for this film. I had heard a lot of good things about the film and had watched it many times on television. I was very impressed with the cast and crew. This was also the first time I had seen the original Star Wars trilogy. I know some of you might think that I am biased but I really liked it. Some of the characters, like Yoda, Luke and Darth Vader, seemed to have a life of their own. I also liked the dialogue of the film. The lines really resonated with me. It was the best Star Wars movie that I have seen.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I like a good film with some heart, but not one that makes the most of it. I don't think it's a bad film and there's plenty of laughs and a pretty good movie, but that's not what I like about this film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As far as bad horror movies go this one is one of the worst    What was wrong with this film?   I've had my share of bad horror films. I've seen them all at least once and loved most of them. This one had a good idea and a good script, but the execution was bad. I think a decent director could have made this film work, but I just don't see how a director could do that with a film of this type.   The characters were all over the place. Most of them were played by pretty bad actors (Boyd and Gage) and the acting was terrible. The film was so badly paced that it was hard to take in what the film was trying to say. I would give it one star if it wasn't for the terrible acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a total train wreck. The movie was so bad I would rather watch it and not have any idea what was happening.   The director went out of his way to make it look bad. There was not one scene that I was really satisfied with.  I would have given it a 1 star had I seen it in a theater or even at the theater.  The movie made me want to scream, and it really made me sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is simply an embarrassing mess.  The acting and acting coach are all wrong, the plot is contrived, and the actors are terrible.  They could all stand to shave a few years off their age.  But I guess you have to pay your money to see something.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A "good" movie, but that "goodness" has been buried beneath layers of "unfitness" for a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie had nothing to do with the movie of the same name.  I didn't watch this for the movies.    This was a good, but low budget movie, and has many flaws. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is just plain old horrible. There are not enough people, scenes or locations to make it entertaining or even entertaining for its subject matter.   From the opening scene with the man on the back of a bike and the boy riding next to him on the grass to the end, there are only about 8 shots of the boy on the bicycle which seem to be a constant background and not something you want to watch. The acting is terrible as well.  This is another "bad movie" like "The Manchurian Candidate", or "Gangland", or maybe even "Dirty Harry".   I think this would be better off as a TV movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is the reason why I stopped watching movies.   I watched this movie for a year straight, I think it was just the only movie I'd ever watch.  I didn't understand much of the plot, I thought it was a very stupid movie,  I'm pretty sure my friends thought it too.  At the end, they showed a scene of a man's face as it was being removed from his skull.  The only words I know were "This movie sucks".   There are more bad movies out there than good ones, you should try to find some of the good ones!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For a couple of hours.   A really bad movie.  The cast in this one was all really awful, and the acting was so bad. The acting was really bad, in fact I think they were really trying to give this movie an aura of being good.  I'm not going to lie, it was really hard for me to watch this movie. I was so upset by this movie that I really didn't want to get to the end.  It really didn?t give me the impression of being a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I first read the reviews and saw the plot, I was very excited and even thought it was a good idea. But after I saw the movie, it all fell apart.  I think that if the movie was not bad, they would have used another actress, like Rachel McAdams.  If I had to give it an A-I, I would have given it a D.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie a while ago, thinking it would be a very funny and fun movie, but it really was a horrible movie.   A bunch of women, dressed in silly clothes, danced around and got naked and laughed at each other. The main character was the "mother" of this group and one of them, an old lady, made some comments about how her grandchildren would probably not like her because she's old and fat.  This was just wrong on so many levels.  For one, the old woman, being so old, would not know how to dance at all.  Secondly, it is very disrespectful to the women in the movie, who were almost all beautiful, by having this old woman talk about their looks.  The only thing funny about this movie was the way they used their hands.  You couldn't take your eyes off of them in all the dancing, so they had to do the most silly things.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but if you can't take a joke, then it is just not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought the DVD and it was very confusing. I never understood why the kids were acting in a certain way or even why the "bad guys" had to hide in the woods. Then there was a really stupid and annoying moment where a guy got hit by a truck and was bleeding to death. This guy was in the truck, and no one thought to check if he was okay.   (I would like to think they didn't know that this guy's blood had been poured over the side of the truck because I'd hate to see someone get hurt or killed trying to rescue him.)   I can't even describe how horrible this movie is, but I'm sure you've seen it before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie has some good scenes and an interesting plot. Unfortunately the writing is terrible.   I didn't like most of the characters. And if the movie was bad enough, the cast of characters was even worse.  My favorite character was the one who stole the movie.  I have read about the author and his other books but this movie and its plot don't seem believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was really bad and made you feel like you should know better than to think of these people as real people. It was funny but very un-funny and you can tell that it was made at the lowest of the low for the most profit possible.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just did a viewing and it was awful   The sound, the characters, the acting, the sets, the costumes, and even the lighting were atrocious   It is a movie that does nothing for me. I was bored and not in the mood for another terrible movie. The writing is awful, and the acting is so bad that you almost forget that they are trying to be funny   You won't laugh at the stupidity of the people you have watched for 5 minutes, you will just watch them get old and die  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was just enjoying watching this movie when a big rock hit my head and I blacked out. My friend came and found me at the bottom of the canyon and we called 911. The paramedics arrived and put a neck brace on me to lift my head off the ground, but it was too late. I was unconscious and they started to call for someone to bring me in.   This is a bad film. It's an attempt at horror/sicko but is completely unfunny and badly done. The dialogue is awful. It feels like someone just spit on the screen, it's just awful.  It's been on TV, but if you ever see this film you should pass out!  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The film follows a very basic premise that you'd find in a horror film from the 1950s. In this film, a group of kids get separated from their parents at a carnival and end up at a strange circus where strange events take place. The film has a slow pace with lots of flashbacks and very minimal dialogue. There are no scary or scary visuals. I couldn't tell what exactly was happening. The children are in very poor condition. They look weak and weak looking, and seem to be having a bad time.  The acting is pretty good. They all do their respective parts well.    The story, though pretty bad, is pretty interesting in that it follows a group that gets separated at a circus and ends up at an unusual circus. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie just seems to be a cheap attempt to cash in on the "Dunkirk" film.  There is really no reason for a "Hollywood movie" to be made out of this story, and if anyone had any real interest in watching it, it should have been made for a less expensive budget.  The acting is horrible, with only two of the actors (one in the actual Dunkirk, one in the "Holland's World" movie) being even remotely good.   Also, there is no "Hooded" footage, so it was impossible to hear any of the dialogue.  Overall, it just seemed like a bad "Halloween" ripoff with too many mistakes made for anyone to really take it seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's a bad film.   For starters, you have to pay the movie.  It starts at 1:30am in the morning, and ends at 6pm in the afternoon.  The story is about a young couple who are trying to raise their kid.  They do, but it becomes much worse than that.  To make things worse, the movie has a very bad acting talent.  At times, I felt like I was watching an old man's memories of his child.  Also, I have to give props to the producers of the movie, they are smart about using the budget and never gave their movie a good score, it is only good to have a small budget, even with great actors.  I am glad it was made in the '70s, but I wish they had made it in the early '80s.  There is some good stuff in it, but there are way too many bad movies out there, and it makes it tough to decide which one to see.  My recommendation is that you either don't see it, or if you do, just leave it and watch something else.  If you're looking for a movie, it may be worth seeing, but not if you're seeking a great film.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie when it first came out, and at the time, it was nothing special. I guess people liked the idea of a zombie movie in the vein of Dawn of the Dead, but in actuality, this movie has little more to offer. The zombies are a little uninspired (to say the least), the acting isn't that great and it's just not entertaining. I did like the ending, but it didn't exactly leave me with a warm fuzzy feeling, either.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought that this was just a poorly written movie that never took off. I wasn't so sure when I first saw it but I am glad I watched it in the theater. The main cast was pretty good and I found the story interesting, it was a fun action movie. The only reason that this movie isn't worth more than 4/10 is because the last quarter of it was completely unnecessary. If they had kept the action going and put some extra effort into the second half then it would be much better.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you liked one movie then you should get this movie. It's not good and I had a hard time getting through it. But there are some good parts. It has a great cast. It is a movie that will make you laugh and it's funny as hell. But it's not a great film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am giving this a 4 star rating because I am a huge fan of the original. The new movie, though not terrible, doesn't seem to capture any of the charm or the energy of the old one, and the old people and the animals seem a little out of place with the more advanced setting and some of the animals are downright hideous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is bad. It's made to look good. The cinematography is so bad. The actors and actresses look ridiculous. And the special effects look like a low-budget cartoon. I found the dialogue to be the worst I've ever heard in a movie. The acting is the worst as well. The plot isn't that interesting either.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I remember seeing this movie at a local theater when it first came out. I remember it being an action packed and fast paced movie. I didn't like it at all and hated the acting (I thought all the actors were pretty bad and didn't want to sit through another 3 hours of watching them talk over the action movie.) It was a very cheap movie that I wish I could forget about. I do like the original Star Wars which is way better, but this movie just didn't give me a thrill or a thrill of action, excitement, suspense or anything that would have made me want to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie i saw once in the theater, and forgot. I never went to see it again. This movie was a nightmare, and i was scared out of my wits. My sister was watching it with me, and we all turned our heads away from the screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this movie at an event in NY when it first came out, and it was just awful. The actor who played the role of the son of the "father" is really annoying and overacting. The film has terrible acting, as if the director couldn't understand what the actors were trying to convey. I just think he didn't want to have any dialogue at all. The acting is terrible and the movie has terrible dialogue. It really sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad side of the story is that the filmmakers didn't do any research. They didn't talk to anyone who actually went through the trauma of having to kill someone.   For someone who is willing to do that kind of thing in their free time they have to have researched extensively, just for a movie like this.  I also feel that the story of this movie is not the real story. In my opinion the main characters should have been played by an actor who was traumatized by that.  This movie makes me think that they really went to some lengths to make sure that people couldn't see this movie.  It is sad that this movie can come out and still sell as many tickets as it does. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is boring.   It's also hard to get into.  The acting is awful.  What is the point of the movie?   I felt like I was watching a very slow motion version of "The Good Wife" or "The American Hustle" with bad acting.  All the actors had great chemistry but the plot is so boring it's laughable.  I guess the movie wants us to believe the character's relationship is so great because it never gets in the way.  They also make the guy in the scene look like an idiot because he isn't paying attention.  It would have been better if they just took the time to do an actual scene and show us how cool the relationship was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I liked this movie.   It didn't hurt that it was in the late 1940's.  The story was interesting.  In the future, a man named Howard Hunt (a bit of a whiner and a self-entitled douchebag) is hired to find one of his former enemies, whose whereabouts are unknown.  He hires a team of bounty hunters to track down the man, but one of the members is a real ass.  His name is Max Rockatansky.  Like a lot of guys from that era, he's a hot headed asshole.  All the guys are nice to each other but he's the complete opposite.  This movie isn't great but it's worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I heard about this movie from my uncle, who was a huge fan of it. I had never seen it before, and was not going to. After watching it I realized why my uncle loved it so much. It was not nearly as bad as he made it out to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The last part is terrible. The acting is awful, and the plot is lame. The movie tries to make the scene with the girl in the car funny by cutting out parts of the film that don't make sense and making the girl say something that doesn't happen.   I didn't really want to watch this movie and I really doubt I'll watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst thing about this movie is that it's bad. The cast is not really known and I didn't really care to watch this movie as I wanted to see more of the cast of "L.A. Confidential".   One of the worst movies I've ever seen.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you are looking for a real action film that will impress and amaze you, then this film isn't for you.  This is more of a psychological horror film.  The acting and acting talent is great.  I found the direction to be a little off.  There were scenes that were shot out of order, and the editing of the scenes was also off. But, there were some nice set pieces.   This film will be of interest to some people, but it is not for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was looking forward to this movie and I was really looking forward for the first time to watch a James Bond film since Roger Moore in Live and Let Die. This movie was so disappointing for me and for this James Bond fan and for those who do not like James Bond.   The plot is a complete waste of time with some good action sequences but it is all too boring and not worth it to watch this movie.  I have never been so disappointed to watch 007 films and this movie is no exception. I would not recommend this movie to anyone because of the terrible plot.  There is no heart to this Bond movie and nothing makes any sense to any of the situations.  A lot of the Bond movie has been terrible because of its plot problems and its lack of action. I just had to go and re-watch some of the James Bond movies because I was so frustrated with this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was made in the 70s. I'm not sure if it was an independent movie, or some company produced it to put the studio in a pickle, as it was very cheap and poorly made. The actors are not at all well known and they play two different roles. The actress who plays the main role (I think it was Sally Field) was a big star in the 40s, but I can't say for sure if she had any acting experience. The movie is just too cheesy to be good. It was made for the "cheapie" crowd, who wanted to make a movie that was so bad they could sell it to a studio and make it in a week. The people who made it should be ashamed of themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story was a complete waste of time.    It has a plot so dull it could be called stupid.  The characters are not even likable.    This is not even a comedy.  A typical story of a loser.  The only time the humor came to the screen was when the lead actor got on the bus with a girl he met at the end of the movie.  This is the second film in a series, so I guess the writer just decided that this was the right time to put it on.  I'm sure some people will enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was in high school when this movie came out and my mom kept it on VHS. I loved it at the time but after seeing it a few times it was clear it wasn't made for kids. It is an incredibly boring film. It has some great performances and the story is interesting but it was just so boring. The acting isn't bad but everything else was terrible and the script was terrible. My only complaint was the music and I would love to see some decent music in films now.   I'm glad I saw this bad movie before it was old and no longer relevant. It made me angry at the kids and their parents who were promoting it and selling it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is very bad.  The script is awful, the acting is lame and the acting in the movie is even worse.   What kind of a movie is this?   There is no mystery, no danger, no action, and no reason for the characters to be in such a dangerous situation.  If you are a fan of the 1980s series you should have been happy with this, but it has nothing to do with that series and is really bad.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think it's very bad. In a bad way. I think the story has to be rewritten or if it ever is, it should have some changes made. It would have been better if they had gone with something other than a typical revenge movie.   It's just so boring!   The actors are so terrible. Not even worth one laugh, which could have been a lot more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The last few movies I have seen have been pretty bad and I have watched more than 3 movies in a row and I hate to say it but this is one of them. I am still going to watch it, I'm just going to wait till the summer and watch another movie that is good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm a sucker for a good romance, so when I heard about this movie I couldn't wait to see it, but I thought the actors were a little too good to pull off such a good scene, plus it was boring as hell to be honest. The movie was about a guy and his girlfriend who fall in love after they are married. I thought it was too long and boring, but not enough of a good story for me to waste time on this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am very disappointed in this movie. I was in love with the original film which is a true masterpiece. I'm sure that it has great potential, but this version is way too different and is a shame to fans of the original. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone at this time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is one of the worst I've seen. All the acting is not good, and they don't use any real plot to make the movie more entertaining. All of the characters that are introduced are completely uninteresting. The main character is not interesting, because he is the only one who thinks of his sister. The rest of the family are just plain stupid and make the viewer wonder where this guy got this crazy personality. I don't think this movie should be watched by anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a complete and utter disaster.   They cast poor Lee Arenberg and an unknown Richard Harris as the main characters and have them play the roles with no character development or real emotions.  You never really feel for the two leads.  In addition, the script has terrible dialogue and characters.  There is also no real plot.  The story starts out with the main character on a plane and it just never ends.  This was a good idea to be a movie that you can watch with a bunch of friends at your house.  It would have worked better if they had put something else on the plane besides a bomb.  When you first start watching the movie you are thinking to yourself, "Wow, this is a pretty cool movie." However, the movie quickly becomes a bore and is boring as hell.  If you are going to watch this movie, you can find a better movie to watch.  Also, if you are watching this movie on a airplane you are missing out on the greatest experience in the history of the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So, I heard about this movie from a friend. I had never heard of the character before, but I knew about the movie. So, after looking into the movie and finding out the title was the name of the film, I went into the store to see if it was worth my time.   I was very glad to see that this was a very good movie.  The character was great, it was a really funny movie. The plot was a great one, even with a bad ending. The acting in this was great. I really enjoyed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was not impressed by this movie. There were a lot of scenes that made no sense, the dialogue was awful and the acting was not bad but it did not make the plot exciting.   A lot of the action scenes were very stupid, I can't remember the last time I saw a movie in which all the action was a car chase without any reason.  The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it is about a young girl that runs away from home and then ends up on a train. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I have ever seen, by far.   If the director was trying to make a point about the hypocrisy of those that believe there is no truth in the media, they have failed miserably.  The characters are not likable at all, and the storyline is not even worth watching.  There is nothing in this movie that makes me want to see it again, and to be honest I am tired of this genre.  I am looking forward to seeing how this one plays with Rogen and Goldberg. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A very disappointing movie.   It's not a good movie and not worth watching.  It has great visuals, but the plot is boring and the acting is very bad.  The characters are well-known in Hollywood, but none of the actors seem interested in what they are doing.  Even the director, Kevin Smith, is really uncomfortable with himself.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was going to see this on opening weekend, but unfortunately, I missed the last screening. It was great on opening day, but the next night was not. I liked the script and the acting. It is just a bad film that does not get the most out of it. The actors should have gotten more screen time, and the story was predictable and not original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was not what I expected. It is not a bad film, but its not what i expected. The director is the worst ever.   My daughter came into the house with me and I was like "look what this was supposed to be!" I didn't really have an opinion about this movie other than how good the movie was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story was ok, but it was so bad that I couldn't enjoy it. The acting was bad. I got that they wanted to get a girl into the movie, but the girl, as it turns out, is a really ugly girl. I didn't want to get into the story because of that.   It seemed like the movie didn't even know what it was doing.  The movie doesn't really go anywhere except one direction.  My only real complaint is the acting.  I can't believe I even had to sit through this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I remember watching this movie when I was a kid. I had never heard of it and it seemed to have an easygoing feel about it. The movie itself is actually a bit disappointing when you first see it. After all, the "dumb" people in this movie get things done and not always with great results. This movie is all about the people in the movie though. The acting is great in this and the acting is especially great in the scene where the lead gets his brain blown out. I'm not sure if it was the color or if it had anything to do with this but it looks like his brain is floating in the air instead of in the hole that was made by the bomb. But that doesn't matter because of the amazing acting. I don't remember the exact line but it has the perfect "I'm not ready to be dead yet" feel to it. You can tell that these actors were totally committed to this part and didn't want to give in.       The only thing that really bothered me about this movie was that the ending was a little too unrealistic. I think it might have been just a little bit of a stretch. This should have been a more successful movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed this movie a lot. The story has a great pace, and it is very good. I am sure that most of the people would not like it, as it was not for me, but I did appreciate the great acting and the wonderful music.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is a very bad movie. A very bad idea for a movie. No matter what the plot was, the film failed at it. And I really don't know how it's still on the list.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was so bad that I would only want to watch it if I was at home.   The movie was just a total piece of shit.  There was no plot or logic to it, and there was no character development at all.  And if I had to go on, there was not a single "awesome" thing that happened.  It was just an insult to life itself, and the human race.  You could see from the very beginning how much it was going to be like a "horror movie".  This was just the "mood music" of this film.  Not only was the movie really bad, but the effects and special effects were just horrendous.  All of the scenes just looked fake, and not realistic at all, even to the point where you could see the actors.  I just couldn't believe the amount of money that was spent on this film, as the acting was not that good.  The only reason that the acting looked good is because of the terrible directing.  This film was so poorly directed, that there were times when I couldn't tell what was real and what was fake.  Why did they put on makeup and wigs? What kind of acting did they do?  It would be so easy to create an awesome "horrible movie", and the actors did nothing but give the actors what they deserve.  They really had no idea what to do, because they just had no clue what they were doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry for the rant, but this movie was awful. It took a lot of getting used to, and it seemed that it wasn't meant to be taken seriously.   The acting was not good at all. Everyone just seemed like they didn't want to be in a movie with each other, and were just trying to put on a show for the camera.  For the plot to work, the writers must have gotten the entire cast to go to the mall and talk to each other all day.  The movie was shot in 3-5 minute long scenes, then they would cut to an empty hallway where everyone was on their cell phones.  One girl was on the phone with her cousin who was in jail.  In the beginning, a guy comes on and says "You're looking like a little bitch, girl." I don't even know why they would use that as a joke.  This is not a movie for everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There's a good movie in here, but the acting and music can't compete with the horrible acting and horrible music in the other parts. And the acting is horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a movie where people talk about how they want to make something new out of a old movie and this is the worst way to do it. The story is awful and feels forced and the acting is terrible. The actors can't even act on their own and just seem to do whatever they are told.   I had no clue what this movie was about until they showed the trailer and it was like a bad version of a B-movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think it was pretty lame. It is not the worst movie I have seen, and it is not a bad film, but it was very uninteresting to watch. I guess it has to be seen in order to understand what the original movie was about.  Good time, but not a classic:     My buddy and I went to see this a few weeks ago and were very impressed with the movie. I'm pretty sure it is the best bad movie we have seen in a while. It was very silly, yet it had a bit of depth to it. I enjoyed seeing that there was a reason why the guy got the bad part and not all the other people in the movie were jerks. It took place in a mall, and we have already seen movies that have taken place in the mall. It also featured a "spoofing" of some of the other movies that took place at the mall, such as the original "Jurassic Park." Overall, it was a fun time, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good time. I do recommend getting a snack or something to drink afterwards though, just to make the movie a bit less "fun." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm going to come out and say it.  This is not a movie.  It is more of a parody.  The whole thing is just a joke that is done badly.  I didn't enjoy it at all.   This movie could be on the Comedy Channel and no one would notice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first half of the movie was okay. The action scenes were great, and the characters are enjoyable enough. Then, the second half of this movie takes a major dive in terms of quality. It really goes downhill from there.  All I can say about this movie is that it doesn't stand the test of time. It's a horrible attempt to bring back old footage of the original series. This movie doesn't even hold up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was ok, it did not have the energy, it was too long. It was boring and the story was not worth the time.    It was about a man who lives in a small town and he is a little depressed about everything. He has his wife, who is very strong, and they have a son who is not as strong, so they decided to sell all their belongings and move to an island in the middle of nowhere to go away from everyone. They decide to start a new life, not having anyone to talk to and going out in the country in the winter. They get to know a young girl and she is very beautiful and they fall in love.  It all starts off very happy but the couple end up falling apart as the girl wants to move on and the man does not really know what to do. The movie had so much wrong with it.  The actors that played these characters were not good. They were too young and their emotions were all over the place.  Their voices were also very cheesy and unprofessional. I have watched a lot of bad movies in my life and this one was in the top 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only reason to see this movie is to see the actors. That's it. They had no chemistry or chemistry to make this movie worth watching. A bunch of hot actors try to play a movie and they're just not that great. If it were a real movie and the movie was good and had an interesting story, then the actors could have had some chemistry. I saw this movie when I was really young and had no idea what was going on. I had no clue what was happening and I watched the movie without knowing what was really happening. I watched it and just kind of went with it. I felt like I had seen it before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was really nice, but the only reason to see it is to see the ending. If you know how it ends (well, not that you want it to go that way) then it's fine, but it's not as good as it could have been.   Also, the soundtrack is terrible.  It's mostly cheesy disco and it sounds terrible.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has nothing to offer and just a bunch of shots of an empty theater and some people talking.  The guy was a big time drunk who took over a big group of friends and they just played a movie of a bad man robbing a theater. I mean the whole movie was just that. It was like a buncha drunk guys sitting in a theater, drunk, and watching a movie and then one of the guys is in the car, and they all take their clothes off and jump in the front seat and just drive to a motel.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible movie.  I was expecting an action movie but this was just boring and pointless.  The whole time, they kept adding more explosions, guns and guns.  This movie has NO plot, no character development, no anything.  These people are just sitting around talking and doin' nothing.  They have no problem running away from danger, they are just like the characters in the movies.  Even when they run to get more guns, they just run away again.  If you want to watch a bad action movie that has no plot, run in a straight line and do something else, this movie is not for you.  It has no story, nothing to talk about.  One of my favorite movies ever! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I was a kid, this was my favorite horror movie. It was scary as hell and very graphic.   It really made me want to kill someone...but I never did.  The remake was pretty much the same as the original, which is a good thing, but not as good.  It didn't have as much gore in it as the first film and didn't take itself that seriously.  I liked it when it was scary, but now it's just another "weird movie" that has no story.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would give this movie a zero if they did not make a movie with the name "Crimson Tide" that has to be made with a million dollars worth of special effects.   That's just silly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I did not enjoy this movie at all. I will not be watching it again.   The acting was terrible and the plot was ridiculous.  I really wanted to believe that the movie could have been a good movie, but it was just not a good one.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My friend and I went to see this on Thursday, and for some reason we had never seen it before, so we brought some popcorn and watched it. It was not bad. The acting was a bit off, and there were times when the movie was just a tad bit slow, but it wasn't too bad.    I do not know why it was titled "The Big Lebowski".   A few things were interesting (especially a conversation between Walter and Walter's buddy about him drinking beer and driving), and there are a few humorous moments (which I liked).   This movie is one of those rare movies that could easily make it on a bad rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was crap...   It was bad, but the acting was crap. The movie looked like it was shot on a $10,000 video camera.   I don't remember the actual plot of the movie, but there were 3 sets that was destroyed in the movie. They even ruined the scene in the car on the highway by leaving the windows open so the movie wouldn't play.  The acting was also crap, but we all know that when a movie is terrible, you're supposed to look for a silver lining.  It is a shame because the actors were great in the film... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have never seen a movie with such horrible acting, it is like the acting is trying to scream at the audience: "It's not supposed to be funny" and the whole movie is like this with terrible acting.   This movie is a travesty of cinema. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen all of the Star Wars films over the years. I even watched the first Star Wars at the age of 2 in a drive through. I've always been a big Star Wars fan and have collected more than a thousand Star Wars collectibles, figurines and toys. This was a terrible movie that I would never see again, and I am sure all the fans and collectors will too.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is all about a "murderer" who has two dogs to look after.   They are supposed to be a happy couple with their dog and his mom. But they never get along very well and the husband never gets enough of her. One day the dogs are in the car and the wife is in the house. One of them starts to bark. The wife pulls up at a road and she jumps out and starts running to the house, and gets lost. The dogs follow her. She gets to the top of a hill and then stops and looks at the house to see if it's there. The husband comes out and she tells him the dog has gone for a walk. She tells him to go back and get his wife. He runs to his truck. He gets on the trailer and starts driving back to the scene of the crime. And then there is a truck in the distance and he sees his wife and the dogs running up to it. He starts to get out of the truck and then the dogs jump on top of him and start to drag him away.  I found the movie completely ridiculous.  There were no people around. The movie was made in 1970 and the actors who played the wife and her dogs were really old.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The main character (a young woman in training) has to get the job at her dream job, which is a factory where she's trained to weld steel pipe. She's very good at it, and is one of the most interesting young women I've seen in years.  However, she has this problem: she likes to go out every night and dance, which she has no problem doing. But the rest of the girls don't seem to like it, so she's stuck at the factory.  This movie really goes overboard with the dancing, and it's ridiculous.  The music is also ridiculous, and really gets in the way of what could have been an interesting movie.   My main problem with this movie is the singing.  I wouldn't mind hearing some actual "songs" to accompany this movie. It would have given the film a nice edge. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    For what it is:  I enjoyed the story of this movie, but it is only a bad example of horror films from the 1970's.  The acting and special effects are not very good and the plot does not have much going for it.  I have seen better films and I would have thought that this was a bad parody of the movie and not a great film.  A few good actors were in the film including a few people who appeared on the tv show and that is it. I found it very tedious.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story, while good, is not what it should be, and the acting is not great. But it is definitely worth a watch, as it is very different from anything else on DVD! If you want a good movie for a good price, look no further.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is interesting and there is some great action with a couple of scenes that take place in the outside of the train station. The acting was great and the story is a good one.   I felt like the movie went in a direction I didn't like but I didn a guess it was due to the script and direction.  My friends and I were laughing for quite a while at the end.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I was younger I used to love this movie. I used the DVD's I got on a vacation as a big screen TV and this movie filled the screen with its cool graphics and the music was really good. This movie had a real feel of "old school".   The best thing about this movie is its amazing graphics, the music, the special effects, and of course the main character is cool and funny.   This movie is great for kids, but for older people it's too violent, not too funny, and not too exciting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I thought it was very good, but the story, plot and acting was very bad.   As far as the movies are concerned, I think they were trying to make a quick buck.  The acting was bad, but if I had paid for the movie, it would have been okay.  It didn't bother me that much, as I am not a big fan of horror movies.  As for the plot, I'm not sure how well the movie is suppose to go.  I think the movie was suppose to have a happy ending, but it never came out right.  Very bad movie.  If you see it on tv, you might enjoy it, but for a horror movie, I wouldn't recommend it.  So be careful what you want to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't know how much you know about cinema or horror films, but this is a terrible movie with no originality or entertainment value at all. The characters are all one dimensional and uninspired. Even the main character and her friend do not come across as likable at all, even though they are the best part of the movie. The pacing of the story is really bad, with several scenes with no action happening, and then nothing happening for over 5 hours, as if to make the movie seem longer than it really is. The movie itself is so terrible, it's hard to believe it is based on a true story, the actors playing the characters were horrible to look at, and the movie was so bad, I can't imagine a sane person having to watch it. The story is so incoherent and bad, the dialog in the movie is really weird, as are the acting. The only way this movie could have been worse would be if it had been filmed in the 60's or 70's, but even then, it would have been a much better film. I have never seen a worse movie, and I would not recommend this movie for any type of entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While this movie is quite well made, the story doesn't go anywhere at all.   The actors don't have a ton of screen time together and when they do, it doesn't matter.  As the movie goes on and the film becomes more ridiculous, the only time the actors get any type of screentime is in the climax when the two main characters are fighting each other and one of them gets knocked out cold.  At one point, there was a shot of the two characters in the hospital bed talking to the camera, which just makes it feel like they were still in the middle of the movie.  They say one thing in the movie and do another.  The plot is weak and has no real direction and doesn't even explain why they are fighting or who they are.  When a film says "we're on an alien planet" and the characters are on an asteroid, you should be able to figure out what's going on.  If you don't like sci-fi or a bad sci- fi movie, do yourself a favor and don't watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you're a fan of horror, and especially slasher films, then this one is not for you. The only redeeming feature is the music (which really didn't fit the film well).   This movie is very hard to find, but not for the reasons you might think. This movie was released in the late 70s and it is probably one of the worst films you could get.   I bought this when it came out, and I think it was a very cheap rental. I'm sure they got the money from the rental fee. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A great movie by the same director as the cult hit "Stripes".  I guess that makes sense since the movie was made by the one and only Brian De Palma.   This was a great movie to watch, and as usual Brian DePalma has a knack for creating great characters.  One of my all time favorite movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only redeeming thing about this film is the incredible acting. The acting in this film isn't much of an accomplishment, but there are some great performances. The film doesn't really take a dramatic turn in the later half of the film, but the great acting and the excellent script make up for it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I found myself looking forward to the trailer for this movie. It gave me a great picture of the whole production. Unfortunately the movie ended up being one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The actors were terrible. I cannot say anything bad about them. The writing and the acting was bad. There was nothing good about it. The story is just awful.   It started with a story line about a boy, who lost his dog. The dog was a family dog. That is why the boy wanted to find her. He went into his neighbors yard and found a woman and her two dogs. The woman said that her husband did something to her dogs. He hit one of them. She also said that they were not hers. The boy called the police. The police said they were going to give them a $500 reward.  When they arrived, they searched the property. The mother came out of the house and told them that the dogs were hers. They gave her $150 for her dogs and sent her away.  The woman then went into the house to tell her children. When she came back out, she had a warrant for her arrest. The children were so scared of her they ran into the street. The father saw it. He yelled at the man for hitting his kids. The man then went and found the children and took them home. The dad then called the cops.  My son, who works at the gas station where the dogs are at said this is crazy. It is obvious that the girl wants the dogs back and she will pay any price for them.  There is no justice in this movie and it is very sad that these kids were taken advantage of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this film when it was released at the cinema but by that time it was a lost cause for me. After seeing it so many times I still do not think I got it right and when it came to rewatching it it was to discover the truth. It is a long, dull film about a man who has a strange obsession with a child and a girl. It may have been a long shot for me to like it but the story is very compelling and there are few films like this out there. If it has a problem it is that it is rather dull and lacks originality but this is a case where a movie has been done to death.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible movie and its not for the kids, it is more like a horror movie.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.   I mean its not very funny, not very shocking, the characters are really lame, and the ending is totally stupid.  i have never seen a movie like this and i think it is the most stupid movie i have ever seen, i also really hate this movie because i can't stand all the gore, and I really hate that one of the girls in the movie was raped. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really wanted to like this movie and liked the trailer. However, I just couldn't stand it. I kept thinking that this movie was trying to be something it wasn't but didn't ever get there. I don't know why people like this one. I was hoping it would at least be funny but the acting and direction was horrible. The plot wasn't even interesting, just an endless train wreck. The worst part is that I really enjoyed the trailer and wanted to see this movie. I have had a bad taste in my mouth about all of the "prestige" movies and this is the one I was thinking of. What more can you say about this?
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This was an absolute letdown.   I don't know if the poor marketing is to blame for this, or if the film just sucked.  It's not bad, but it's certainly not good either.  There's no originality.  While the premise is nice, the story and characters just aren't interesting or engaging.  In one of the more silly moments in the movie, one character says, "I got the perfect girl for me in here."  Then the guy is told to pick a woman and get to his car.  We get to see the actual car, but not the guy getting in.  I think I could've made out the license plate if I were just looking at it at a distance.  When the film was over, I felt like I'd been sucked into an alternate universe where the stars and the moon were replaced with a bunch of people with names like "Flaming Angel" and "Big Booty."  The only thing more unbelievable than that would be the title of the movie: A BAWN OF DESTRUCTION!  The one thing I really liked about the film, though, was the director's weird obsession with the film's trailer, and it's great to see some of those old horror/thriller posters from the 80's and 90's made into the films today. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "This movie was so bad that we were almost afraid to go to a theater to see it. So much has happened in the last 60 years to the family and the film and all of it has been so overdone, over the top. The performances are so bad and the storyline is so badly thought out. It is a movie that you can't go to see anymore."  The film is based on the life of a woman named Barbara Eden, who was an author, dancer and writer. She also appeared in many films, most notably a few of Alfred Hitchcock's. At her home in New York, she suffered from mental illness and was the subject of many Hollywood films. The movie was directed by Norman Jewison, who made a number of very bad films in the 50's and 60's including, "The Man Who Knew Too Much", "The Misfits", "Mr. Blandings Goes to Washington", "Candy", "Dracula", "Sting of the Vampire", "Nightmare on Elm Street", "Scream 2", "Stomp the Yard", and "The Curse of the Mummy's Tomb". "The Woman in White" is the third and worst of his films. The cast is even worse, with an older actress as Barbara and an even older actress who is not good at acting, and two children who look about 3 years old (although they are only a few years younger than the actors in the film).   The film opens with a montage of film footage that features some of the best performances in the whole movie, including the actress playing Barbara, Barbara Stanwyck, playing the title role. The film itself has some good performances, but not enough to compensate for the bad acting, the terrible acting, horrible production design, poor lighting and the awful soundtrack.   There is a scene where the mother tries to hide her son's corpse from the police. The actress playing the mother in the scene is really quite beautiful, which makes it a bit hard to watch her try to hide the child, and the camera almost never focuses on her face, which leaves her face completely unknown.  The mother has to be held down by two police officers as the baby boy lies face down, and they try to get the mother to talk. The child's body looks dead, but when the police try to break the boy's legs, he doesn't move, and we never see him.  I was hoping
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to agree with many others, that this movie was the most annoying movie i saw in a long time. i thought that the movie was supposed to be about aliens, and about a group of astronauts who discovered them. so i was all excited, i watched the trailer, it seemed interesting. i had never heard of aliens before. i didn't even want to watch it. i was so upset when i saw the credits. the movie had one guy who's not an actor playing the role of an astronaut, and he just did his job. the only thing he did really was say "i have been to mars". the other person that was in the movie (the alien) was in it because of the trailer. so if you want to know who the real aliens are, this is not the movie to see. i also have to say that the effects were really crappy. there were all kinds of strange and weird things happening, and i found myself not caring about it at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think this movie is not bad at all.   The story is very unique.  The way it is told makes you believe in the character of Jack.  I like to imagine him being the main character of a new kind of story that has been created.  It seems like a very long movie to make, so it takes a while to get through it all. But there is something nice about how it is written.  When I was a kid, I loved to watch these movies with my mom.  Unfortunately, my mom died when I was about five years old.  My father took on the role of my mother for the last six months of her life.  So after my mother passed away, he started to watch the movies with me.  This movie was just about what my dad saw my mother watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie I have seen that was the worst ever is "Sgt. Bilko" (1951) starring Kirk Douglas, Errol Flynn, and Robert C. O'Hara and directed by Stanley Donen.   This movie is completely absurd and completely unenjoyable. It makes me sick. I have no desire to go see it ever again.  The acting is terrible. The dialogue is absolutely stupid.  I have never seen such a ridiculous movie.  If you can call "Sleeping Beauty" a comedy.  This is a gross, pretentious, stupid movie. I thought it would be funny but I never had any desire to watch it.  You will not be laughing when you watch this movie. " Sgt. Robert Hays" is a bad joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I thought it was going to be an amazing movie. It is not.  This is a great story that is based on true events that did not happen.   The director made a few mistakes but that is not the main problem. The actors are pretty good, and the movie is quite well done. The only thing that is wrong with it is that the whole movie is set in Japan. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I would never recommend this movie to anybody. The acting was good, but not very good. There was no depth in any of the characters, and the only character I really connected with in the movie was the main character's mom, whose eyes are always open.  The plot was stupid. It started with the main characters going on a holiday to a vacation resort and then they decided to do something stupid like drive a car off a bridge.   It was very unoriginal and did not really have a sense of humor at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending was really stupid.   So, you watch it and think, "What in the...?   Well, the director did the best he could but what he got out of it was really a very poor movie, and one of the worst I have seen in some time.  I wish that this had been a movie by a better director.  The acting was bad, the editing was bad.  There is no plot, no ideas, no direction and the actors were not very good, but none of this mattered to me because this was a bad film.  This is a very silly movie that will make you laugh, but there are no ideas.  To the director, a film like this would make a good short movie.  So here we have the idea that you are not supposed to have a normal life and a wife.  You have to be completely devoted to your wife and she can't have a relationship with anybody else.  After the first couple of scenes we are supposed to believe that she is really in love with him and that he can be with her until the end of her life.  It all ends with her telling him to run away and he doesn't listen, but they never go away.  And what a stupid film this is.  But, it made a big name for this director who will have a good movie, but not a very good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was looking forward to this movie but the fact that it was all too familiar left me with a bad taste in my mouth. There were a few parts that seemed familiar but the others just seemed out of place. The movie just dragged on way too long with no real reason for it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     This movie was a huge disappointment. The story was the worst part of the movie. It's all just a bunch of people hanging out in a club doing drugs and having a bad time. The characters aren't that interesting. I'd have been more interested in the drug deals in the clubs.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film was so terrible it was unreal.  I think it has the worst acting and acting is very important.  There are many lines that were said that don't make any sense.  And even the acting was bad in some scenes.   I can not understand what is going on, who is going to win, who will win.  It was like watching a bad show on tv.  What was the point of filming this film if it was like this.  Don't watch it if you don't want to be annoyed, and don't watch this film at all if you are a little kid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you really love a movie and really want to see it again, then this is not the movie for you.   The action is all very well done and there is a fun sense of humor.  But this is a movie that can't hold a candle to the real ones.  In a way, it is more a homage to a certain genre of movies than a genuine sequel to the first one, but it doesn't hold up.  My only real beef is the poor acting.  They do a great job with the action, but they have no chemistry with the two leads.  I don't know if it was just a lack of talent, or if they were trying to keep up with the quality of the actors, but I don the whole thing felt very fake.  Overall, I'm not really a fan of the style of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie you may have seen in the theater or seen on TV.   But don't watch it!   I don't recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen a movie at least a dozen times.  I'm glad I watched it once because I saw it in my college days.  It's bad.  At least it's funny and fun to watch.  So, you see the movie, you're like, "Oh, that looks like one of those weird, old films we used to see at the movies," but then you realize it isn't.  You see a crazy, over the top action sequence, with guns and explosions and crazy stunts. But then you look at the story, you realize that this is just a really bad movie.  But the best part of the movie is it's a "shoot the dog" movie. It doesn't care if you see it as a "real" film. It's just for kids.  This movie is really stupid.  The acting is really bad.    I wish they would've just made this movie in the 1980's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is not worth watching, and that is an understatement. This is a film made to look good for a laugh.   A movie for the kids.  This has a great story, but is nothing worth watching for the story.  The acting was very good and the movie was very well shot but the movie would have been better if it was not so over the top.  When I was a kid, there was a comedy show on TV called "What I Saw". This film was based on a book by the same name. It was not very good.  I saw this movie once in the late 70's, and had the same feeling as many of my friends when I watched this movie, and many of us were children at the time. This movie was like a slapstick comedy that made me feel like I was watching a kid's TV show.  What I wish people would look at a movie like this for is the art and talent behind it. It is a shame that people continue to watch this type of film when it has such terrible acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never would have imagined in a million years a bad film could be good and this was just that! A little over-the-top and funny at times but the film is still worth watching.   The most enjoyable and well-made of the Disney films that came out of the studio. It's not as good as Snow White or the Princess and the Frog but it's a damn sight better than many others they have done.  Dale and his family are staying at a house that is owned by a man who is not happy about having guests, namely his wife.      He thinks that she is "mulatto" and has to keep her segregated at all times. This film is a little strange, there's a great deal of sexual innuendo but it doesn't take a lot of attention to figure out what is going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   "The movie was so bad that I can't tell what happened to my mother's boyfriend after she got hit by the truck. What was that guy doing at that time? Why was he just standing there?" - Anonymous Reviewer, May 2005 What a dumb idea. How stupid could that be?    The story is a mess.   It's as if the director just came up with the idea and tried to add more. I don't get why they added such stupid things like a truck accident.  Did the director think a truck was going to get up and go around?  There are other scenes where there is nothing but a truck, but we see it drive over cars, houses, and the side of a bridge.  It was very boring to watch.  My dad loved the movie. I was really disappointed.  - Anonymous review, October 2004 This was the worst movie I have ever seen.  And it was rated "R" so I guess it wasn't that bad, but it was really bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm surprised how many negative reviews this film has received. This movie is not a bad film, and I have enjoyed the film a great deal, but there are many reasons why I have not seen this movie again. The film has some nice special effects and an interesting story.    The main problem with this movie is the voice acting. The actors who played the lead characters were extremely over-the-top and over-acting. If the voice actors had had a real person for a supporting character (or a real lead character who sounded like a real man instead of a cartoon character) the film would have been much more fun to watch.  When you watch this movie it is obvious that the producers had an over-inflated idea of the film's potential. They had an idea of what the film should be about. However, the real story about the lead character and what his life was like would have made this film much more interesting.  I have to admit, I was really looking forward to seeing this film because I was hoping that it would have some real heart to it. In reality the film is all over the place and the film makes no sense. I thought the film was kind of fun when I watched it the first time, but now that I've seen the film more times it has really lost its appeal.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *This movie was so stupid. It was so hard to watch. I'm sure if it was made before the late 80s, they could have made a good movie out of this. But for sure, a very bad movie. You can't imagine the actors are good.  * This movie is so badly made and with no originality. There was no one who could be called a great actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie with a funny, bad, funny, and bad-looking cast.  This film is only good when the action or comedy is happening.   This movie is really not good.  The action scenes are the worst   The acting is good at best and the actors are over-hyped   I really could care less about the characters and plot.  I'm just hoping the actor's will become known for doing other bad and funny movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a pretty bad movie, but it's not bad for a movie of this genre. There is a whole bunch of things wrong with this movie. First, the acting is bad. Most of the time, the actors can't understand a word they are being spoken to. Second, the editing and shooting are sloppy, and there is almost no dialogue. Also, the ending is so stupid that it's hard to believe it's supposed to be an "action movie". Overall, this movie is pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:     I guess this movie was made for little girls who grew up on "Barbie and the Bang-Bang Girls" and "Beauty and the Beast." I'm pretty sure that the director, in order to sell this movie to little girls, used this as an excuse to make fun of both Disney and sexual innuendo, so I guess Disney and all sexual innumerate kids will have to just let this one slide. It's just a terrible movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think the film is bad. I have seen worse but I don't believe this film is as bad as they say it is. The acting is bad, the camerawork is bad and the film has some very unoriginal story. If you are looking for a good story with interesting characters this is not the film. It has no idea what it wants to be and it shows.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A movie I never saw but that I found in a theater with my family. A long time ago my father was telling me about seeing the movie for the first time as a kid and I remember him calling it "The worst movie ever" and I thought that was the case. I think I'm finally ready to watch it.    (more notes about this movie)   It is a movie about a very bad man that goes around killing people for money and drugs. It is very violent, very disturbing, and just really creepy. It also features a lot of weird people and people that make very bad decisions. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is so bad, that it's embarrassing. This is the worst movie ever made.  This one is like a bad TV movie, and the actors are all bad.  I'm sure there's a director who just gave this to an inexperienced actor. He should have been thrown out of the business.  So far, the only good thing about this movie is the actors, who I'm willing to bet were not paid much.  The acting is terrible, the acting is bad. I am glad they only shot this for a couple of months, and I'll be hoping for the next director to take a fresh look at this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is very stupid, it makes fun of it's own genre, but I found myself laughing more than anything.   What I don't understand is why the director thought that an 80's movie with a different cast than the other 80's movies he made would be a good idea?   One of the most ridiculous scenes is the woman's attempt at seduction when the men come in the house and she tries to flirt with them. She goes into her house, and in the bathtub. Then she has to swim naked in it.  The funniest part is the other man trying to make love to the woman when the women are having sex in the tub.  Another thing that is really dumb is when the "dumb" woman tries to seduce the man by telling him she doesn't know how to use the microwave because she got it for free.  I really wish the director would have made the movie in the 90's, when it would have been called "Man In The Tub".   My favorite scene is when they go to the doctor and the doctor is just a regular doctor and no one is ever shown doing anything for the woman except getting her a prescription for birth control. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie itself is ok, the acting is bad and the plot doesn't make sense to me at all.   I liked the concept of the movie, but the movie never got me invested in it.    I have seen worse movies, and this one wasn't that bad.  Posted by Brian at 6:26 PM

When I was a little kid, I watched this movie in the theater and I still remember how awful it was. I always thought I had seen it but I am sure I didn't. I still watch it occasionally but I do so with an extremely low opinion. I would not recommend this to anybody.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't recommend this movie because it is so bad it is hard to watch, even with subtitles.   The story is very hard to follow, it is very vague and there is a lot of back story not necessary to the story.  I think the actors have fun but the story is so confusing that it takes a long time to understand the plot.  This movie is so poorly made that it looks like a bad ripoff of another movie called "Machete".   It really is a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My favorite movie so far.   It was fun and easy to watch, and the story didn't bore me.  The movie could've been a lot longer, but that's not the fault of the characters, it's the movie.  It didn't have any of the cheesy acting or acting styles of the "Cocktail" movies.  No funny, no weirdness.  As far as acting goes, every one of the actors did a great job.  I really enjoyed seeing the movie and it's not a bad one at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    * I don't understand how an English movie can be so bad - why did they make this with so much bad dubbing and audio recording of the voice actors - all they have to say about their accents are "hmmmm, they're fine" and "I guess...it's not bad, really"  * There is no plot, just bad jokes and a lame story about a guy who is looking for his lost dog, but the more you see of it the worse it gets - and I really don't see a reason why he would lose his dog so badly in a movie theater, but it is a terrible movie - don't watch it  * The bad voice actors in this film are horrible (I mean, really bad, I mean they're not even good at acting, and yet they are in this movie)   So that is it for now! Enjoy the movie.

I have not seen it, so I do not know what the movie is about, but I feel that it has a totally bad vibe in it. I saw a friend on Youtube watching it on the couch.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a pretty bad movie, but for a movie based on a real crime, it was pretty well made. It's a good read for the money, but if you want to see something with a story that's true to the book, you should look elsewhere.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was made to cash in. The studio needed to sell more tickets so they made a film that was low budget, poorly cast, poorly acted, and poorly written.   A friend of mine found this movie and when I asked her what the story was about she said it was about a black man in a white world who was given a gift. He got to be a star, a good looking man, and rich.  I was not pleased with the story or the acting. The only black male character in the movie was portrayed as some sort of "villain."   I saw the movie on TV and was glad I didn't see it in theatres. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am not a great fan of horror movies. When they're not a remake or sequel, they tend to be boring and predictable, or else are the same old things in a new set of clothes. This film does not have any of the qualities I enjoy in horror movies, but they were just made for horror fans to go see.   The worst thing about this film is that I wish I could go back in time and change something.  I'm not sure why.  This movie has the worst acting in a horror movie ever. The actors just don't sound like they're having fun.  It's all forced and unnatural, I couldn't stand it.  If you like horror, you will not enjoy this movie.  The only thing that I enjoyed was the end credit scene, it was very interesting and well done.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most ridiculous thing I ever saw in my life.   Not even a single laugh.  No actors were good and all the stunts were just to make it look like a great movie.  It was not a good movie, not even a good special effects movie. The director just did it for the money.  If you are into action movies like me or like to watch Hollywood movies do to make money why not make a Hollywood movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would only recommend this movie for the hardcore audience with a very high threshold for anything that's even slightly questionable. I'm a huge fan of the original, and I was looking forward to the remake with its very interesting cast and an interesting, unique plot that has no precedent in the horror genre. What I got was a cheesy, over-the-top, overhyped movie that made me feel like I was watching a horror film from the 60's.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie made me cry and I don't understand how any of this made it out. I was very disappointed.   A woman is trying to make a living in a small town. She falls in love with a guy who she meets in a local bar and after they move in together, she finds out she has no idea who he is.  A few weeks later he's dead and the woman finds out he had something to do with his death.  After the death, she goes to the bar and meets another guy and they end up having sex and it goes wrong.  It seems like it should be a real problem, but it wasn't. The movie made it seem like some sort of accident. A cop comes to the woman's house, questions her and asks her about the dead man and she says he died from a heart attack.  The cop goes off to get another guy, comes back and gives the woman her guns back.  But the problem with this movie is that you don't know who the dead guy was.  How do you prove a heartattack in a bar? I was so confused.  Even when I got over the initial shock and realized this wasn't the first time something like this had happened, it still left me feeling like it was a bad idea to go into a bar where people were drinking at.  This has got to be one of the worst movies I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film was not good. The story of the film is wrong. The movie shows a man on a cruise ship getting drunk with a woman. He is trying to commit suicide, but he is rescued by a girl who is a fire fighter. He tries to talk to her, but she becomes upset because she believes he tried to kill himself. When he tries to leave the ship the fireman shoots at him. I thought this was the most wrong thing that could happen. I don't know what the writer was thinking of. It was a mistake to make the film with that type of story. The character of the fire fighter was the worst in the film. She acted like a child and I didn't want to watch her. She was never serious. She is not real. I really thought that the writers of the story were fools. If they were serious about making a film about fire fighters, why they did not have a fireman with a serious attitude and make him have a relationship with the heroine? It was just wrong.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    In the spirit of movies such as "The Manchurian Candidate," "Silence of the Lambs" and the like, this movie is full of camp and over-the-top behavior by everyone who is on screen. I was shocked that the FBI Agent who was supposedly so good at his job was so incompetent at hiding his tracks. This movie should have been shot in Italy and not in L.A. I never would have seen it or found it if it was not for some of the "goods" that the people at the screening had brought with them (I have seen worse, but never anything like this movie).   " The Fifth Element"  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was boring and I don't really understand how the main character became the leader. The two main characters are kind of bland.   I just got tired of the plot and boring characters.  The acting was pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had high hopes that this movie would be good. I even bought it because of the title. I was going to rent it because I wasn't going to see it in person. The picture and the movie were good. The script was good. And the performances were good (including one that surprised me). It was a good movie. The acting wasn't the best but that's what it was. I'm not going to lie to you. I didn't see a reason for it to be any better than the film it was replacing. But you know what, it was fun to watch it with my daughter. That's the reason why I bought it. But I'm sure that I'll pass it on to someone else after watching it with her. I guess it's just a bad idea to buy a movie based on the title and expecting it to make a good impression. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst movie I have seen since my childhood. The actors are pathetic. The acting is like they were in the show, and all the dialogue is very cheesy. This movie is a total joke. If you like to laugh at others, then it will give you a laugh. If not, it will make you feel bad for your life.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only good thing about this movie is the ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only film I've seen where someone actually tries to do an interview with the director.   I found the director arrogant and arrogant as well.  He is a big time producer and didn't even bother to go out of his way to find people to do the interview.  I would have paid to watch this and it probably could have been cut to a reasonable length.  It is a shame because it is a well made film with some great actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a pretty decent film but it should not be seen as a family friendly film. The parents are way too into it to be fun.   Very cheesy and fake with the kids acting like adults and the adults acting like kids.  A real waste of time and a rip off of a much better film in the same genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story has nothing to do with this movie. A bunch of friends go to a pool party and find out that the bartender is a witch. They have a bad time and the witch uses a witch's spell on everyone and makes everyone want to go home.   I don't think the movie was that good to begin with.  The plot is ridiculous and all the witches seem like they are going to have a party where they make people go home (this is the movie for people who like a good witch story).   A fun movie but not a very good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is really hard to watch and watch in a way that makes me think that I should have taken more pictures.  The only reason this movie is not completely junk is because of the really great performances in this movie. The acting is great but they use way too many actors and in the movie it is hard to tell who is who.   The acting in this film is so bad that I actually think that the actors should have just played a few of the scenes and not have been all over the place. The actor playing the part of the boy is very awkward, he is acting really fake and is just really good at playing the parts he has been cast in.  I really want to see the movie in a theater to see how they can make the acting and the acting in the film so bad.  It really should have been made a comedy with the way they acted.  This should have actually been made in a comedy movie where the actors are all just goofing off and having a good time.  They even put in a joke like: "Oh look, it's the old lady!  She must be sick in bed."   I also think they should have made it a little bit more of a mystery for the boy and not just made it an action movie with the girl in it.  What a shame to waste an amazing movie like this with these kind of bad acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was a disaster from start to finish. Every character was annoying, every scene just felt like a bunch of kids in their rooms playing video games and not doing anything important. The acting was bad, the acting that was good was even worse. The writing was terrible, they all said dumb things and there were no funny lines in the movie. The music was awful, it was like the kids in this movie had their brains stuck in their heads and they couldn't think of anything good to say.    It would have been a perfect film to show kids to get them into playing video game, but the kids can't even get a decent game on a computer, let alone a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is really bad and the acting is really awful.   I really want to like this movie because the trailer is funny and you really think it would be good.  A bunch of people (I think) are playing old movie stars and some of them have a good time. I am a huge fan of Tom Hanks so I was excited.  But I was not disappointed at all.  The actors are all terrible. They were all acting really badly.  All of them.  Some of them had terrible accents.  In the first scene I had never heard anyone sound so bad in a movie.  It is very sad to see a really good actor like Tom Hays (from "Ace in the Hole") playing these actors in these really bad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I had high hopes for this movie.   The movie was set in a "no-win situation" (as in you either lose your car or your house).   I would have gone with the car option.  The plot was a good one but I couldn't really see a reason why it had to take place in the early 1990s.  We have been so much more advanced by then.  If only there was some reason for the cars to go missing or the house to get robbed.  So many times I watched "The Last Detail" I had to wonder why the plot needed to be set in the 1990s?   My problem was with the actors.  I mean come on, these are some of the most famous actors in the world.  They have made some of my favorite movies in the past and you can't be sure that the actors are capable of doing their best to play these characters.  There are some great actors in this movie and it's great that someone like Tom Cruise was given the chance to make a good movie. However I thought the film was a complete failure.  To make a film like this, the filmmakers need to be able to make some sort of a character study.  How can you get the actors to really look into the characters and think about their personalities?  The only other movie I remember that really captured the early '90s was "Ghosts of Mississippi".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was going to give this movie a 2 out of 5, but I can't, in good conscience, do it.   This movie has some really bad acting, really poor direction, and a plot that isn't very well thought out.  The movie was a waste of my time, and I am ashamed to have watched it. A film like this, with this plot and the poor acting, is just a waste.  This was made with the sole purpose of making money.  One of the biggest problems with the film is that it was made by a young, inexperienced director.  I am a young and ambitious filmmaker and can't believe a movie of this caliber was made.  All of the people involved in this movie were so inexperienced.  If you're going to produce a movie like this and let the director and actors be young and inexperienced, then please don't get a big star like Will Smith.  When you have big stars involved, you shouldn't expect the same level of acting and directing that was in this film.  To be honest, most of the actors in this were over the age of 25.  My biggest complaint about the movie is that I couldn't understand why a person would pay to see it. The story of the movie was terrible, and it didn't make any sense.  Some of the scenes in this was really cheesy.  Overall, I am disappointed in this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst film I've ever seen. The story is silly, but the cast of characters is completely stupid.   From the moment the movie starts the acting is bad and it gets worse as the film goes on.  In fact I'm pretty sure the actors are on drugs, especially in the scene where a guy falls into a garbage disposal.  The movie has nothing going for it other than a few "clicks" and a "twist."  I'm glad it's only a one-shot, as I don't think it will ever see the light of day. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a bad idea that wasn't executed well. The actors were all great, but they weren't good enough to make me forget the bad acting. They had no chemistry, and the acting was bad for the most part. It just wasn't enjoyable, especially not for the kids.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've been seeing this movie so many times over the years that it almost gets boring to watch. The writing of the script is so cheesy and cheesy is good enough for me to watch it over and over.  The acting is awful and the movie makes no sense.  It seems as if the director just made this movie for his family and no one but his wife is a big fan of the movie.   The only way it works for me is that the acting gets better with time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "I'm a fan of action and thrillers but this movie was not what I expected and the story could have been made better."     "It's like a nightmare come to life." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a train wreck. I have never seen so many scenes that just dont add up at all. The movie is so bad the only saving grace is the acting and a few performances, but there are a lot of actors that just don't even do the part they are supposed to do.   I can see the appeal of the movie, but it is just a complete mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My boyfriend is a big fan of the 80s and he was so excited to see this movie because he thought it was an animated short. However, he didn't care for the story. The character of Pekar is just annoying. The dialogue and plot don't go anywhere at all and I think that it was just added to make the movie more interesting.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't think that this movie is worth the 5 stars it gets in the reviews.   It is a boring and horrible movie that has no appeal for me.  It seems as if they hired a bunch of actors that they could get for a cheap movie and then tried to market it as a cult classic.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really had high hopes for this movie.  It is based on an original story by the guy who made The Matrix and The Thing.  We see a couple of astronauts on a spaceship crash land on an alien planet.  They encounter a creature, which gives off a strong magnetic field which causes them to levitate.  The scientist who was in the space suit decides to go for a walk in the jungle, but sees a strange creature there.  He tries to get away, but the creature grabs him and pulls him into the jungle.  Suddenly the creature starts to disintegrate into an energy which starts to eat away at the scientist's body.  After he manages to pull himself out of the jungle and to his ship, he discovers that it was a creature from the planet who turned the space suits to energy.  This is the first movie to show a film from another planet.  This movie is a huge disappointment.  The creature is not scary at all.  It is just there as a gimmick and it seems to be in every scene where we see it.  I really hated this movie so much.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was excited for this, as it is a great horror flick.  The whole movie was cheesy and was a total waste of my time.  I will give this movie one star and not recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a total failure, in every way. It seems the director wanted to make a classic, but his attempt at it, the movie is not only terrible, but it was made in the early 80s, when film making was in decline. The director just did not know how to do this movie, he is not in control of the action, the camera work is just awful, and the actors are not good enough, especially the ones that are supposed to be the heroes. The movie even tries to have an old-fashioned feel, with the old films from the 1930s.   A bad movie is bad for you, and a bad film, even a terrible one, can make you think if it was a good movie, or a movie that has no talent and no talent at all. It really is a disgrace to the film world that this movie was made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I bought this for the trailer and all but that was it.   The movie is the same old "The Terminator". You see the same things that people in the 1980s were talking about. There is no story, no character development, no tension, just a lot of "doomsday" stuff.  And not only that, it was poorly shot and edited, but it made it look like it was going to be great... but it wasnt.   I was looking forward to it for years, but in reality, I didnt enjoy it one bit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie that I was expecting to hate is a bit too much to accept and I have to admit I was so excited for it. I love the movie and it looks good. But this one is bad. The acting is so fake. I mean some actors are good but most are really not good at all. I wish the director and writer of this were more talented because this one looks like it could be made by a low budget movie and that is really not cool. I hate this movie and the director deserves to lose his job. It was boring, horrible acting and all of that is not even good acting. I hope this one makes the charts in the year 2000 and people realize how bad this movie really was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is very bad, and I have to give a rating of 1 star out of 5. I watched this movie because the star actor is an ex Navy SEAL, and we thought he was a very good actor. The movie is actually very bad and it takes a long time for the first big action scene to start. I just could not believe the people that made this movie. They went too far with the violence, and the bad acting.   I gave the movie 1 star because the guy was good at one part and the acting was awful throughout. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie as a kid, in the 80s, and it was pretty bad. The director's name was George Miller, and the movie was a sequel to an earlier film of the same name. They were both directed by William Castle, which is why this movie is so good to look at (though not the best movie that Castle directed). Anyway, this movie was about a group of teens who go to a small town to visit the town's only remaining resident, a very angry woman named Helen. Helen hates the teenagers and their gang, because they stole something, a painting of Helen that was once worth a lot more. The teens have a hard time making Helen understand that the teens are just messing with her and it isn't worth any trouble, but she is still going to make life really difficult for the teens. The best part of the movie is the soundtrack, which was really good. The song that plays at the end of the film is called "The Night Comes For Us" and it is the theme song to a movie that I never saw, called "Rambo: First Blood Part II".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't remember seeing this movie but I did remember the ending, and it's not one that I'm fond of.   The acting was bad at best and the plot didn't make sense.  It felt as if it had been made by someone who had seen The Omen and was trying to do a remake.  A bunch of teenagers with a weird movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was expecting a good movie from this director, and it was bad.   The director never made a good film.  He did a lot of wrong things and the only thing that made it better is that it was a great acting job by the actors.  They had to play the roles perfectly but their characters were so bad.    He didn't know how to act and he kept telling everyone to do something.  It was really stupid.  This movie would have made a better story if the director didn't have to play so much and just did a different movie, something more normal like "A Nightmare on Elm Street" (which is a great movie).   This story about a kid being possessed by demons and the demons trying to get their revenge on the kid.  The only problem is that this movie doesn't give you the answers.  You have to watch the movie to find out for yourself.  My advice to watch this movie and forget the director, he made a very bad movie and should be ashamed of himself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I like the plot, but this movie has all the trappings of a bad horror movie. When I'm not afraid of spiders, monsters, and ghosts, I have no need for a scary movie. This movie should have been called "The Zombie Nightmare."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a horrible movie. I am not going to say it was bad because it is very bad, but it is not very good. The acting was terrible, and the plot, which is about a woman that is found on a dead man's corpse, was lame.   I am glad they are making a movie about the movie "Gone in 60 Seconds", but it did not get the "Gonzo" aspect of the movie, so I had no interest in watching it.  The film was made in the 60s, and was based on a true story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this film on the strength of the reviews, and was really looking forward to the movie, since it was written by a very acclaimed director.    This film didn't deliver the goods for me, the movie was not that good.  For starters, I'm not a big fan of films about real-life people in real life, especially movies about people who are supposedly fictional characters, i guess we have to get over this?  It was very hard to get the plot of the movie out of my head, and i was constantly trying to figure out where all the characters were, because the movie doesn't give us enough information.  The acting, by all of the actors was mediocre.  Even the actors that are supposed to be acting actors (for example, I heard that Robert De Niro was supposed to act but he just gave me this really weird look as if he wasn't in his right mind).  The movie just kind of dragged on and on, but i guess you would get an idea of what was going on from the interviews.  All of the interviews were very hard watching, because it was a real pain to see such a horrible person like Gary Cooper (i'm pretty sure he actually got the part of the guy with the machine gun) and to listen to him talk.  It seems like i could've spent a whole night listening to him talking about his terrible past.  Overall, this movie really isn't worth the watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have not watched this movie in many years.  The actors did not know what they were doing.  It's an atrocious movie.  They made a mess of the screenplay.    My only wish would be that they would have made a movie from the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I mean come on. I had never seen this film before I saw it at a friend's house and it turned me into an angry person. The characters were awful. They all acted like they were going through the motions. This movie was ridiculous. The actors were trying to look tough when they weren't. Some of the girls were totally naked while some guys had to wear a wig. One of my friends and I decided to go see it. When we got there I found out that the theater was showing a re-run of the original movie. I really thought we were in for something really different. It was not! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was given this movie by a friend and was told it was "fantastic" which I knew was probably a lie. This movie is so bad it's hilarious. I would not recommend this movie for a young kid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I saw this movie as a kid it was the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting was all over the place, and the characters were so unlikable. They didn't care about anything but having fun and trying to kill each other. The worst part was that the script is awful and there is no redeeming factor. I hope the producers got the idea from watching bad teen movies.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There are some good things to say about the movie. The characters are well drawn and I liked the direction they were going. I just wish that there was more to the movie as there is a lot of confusion in the movie, which I think was intentional. Also, I just didn't feel like the story was there. I think it was supposed to be about a man trying to go back in time, but they wasted so much time on the side story about an assassin that there wasn't enough time to really tell a good story.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I hate to admit it but I never understood how the American public thought these movies could make money. I thought it was a great idea, the idea that America could make a movie about a war that they had never really seen and could be entertaining. I think that the fact that this movie was so much more expensive than the other two was a waste of money. Even when the movie was released, people didn't want to see it. They wanted to see the previous two war films.   The movie did do very well in the US, even though it was over-budget and under-thought. I don't think that this film would have worked had it been a different country, however, it was made by a man from America.  The original American hero in this movie, George S. Patton, was a very different type of man from what we know about him. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So I have a feeling this movie isn't going to have a happy ending.  The story is the usual, a soldier dies in the war. He is buried in a field with a small cross. The soldiers get back to base and find out it is the guy they are supposed to be training.  They want to make sure it is him. The movie keeps the cross in the movie as a joke, but it isn't funny, it doesn't help the characters, and it is never revealed as to what happened. The only thing that is made clear is that it was a soldier who died. The last shot is kind of strange. It is a closeup of the cross, it is a very cold view of the guy's head. I don't understand why they didn't show the cross from the front, I know the guy died from a wound on the back of his head and the cross would have been very obvious. It just seems very weird. I could see some laughs with the camera angle, but the cross and the cold view just made me sick. The acting in this movie was not bad but it was not good either. They kept trying to make you feel bad for the guys they are training but you didn't care, the guys just looked like they weren't into it. This was another movie that was written by Tom Savini, he wrote the original Hellraiser movie. It wasn't as good as the first one, but they did a better job with the sequels.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was crap, I didn't want to be in the movie at all and I wanted it to end. I really don't like the movie, not the writing, nor the acting. I thought it was a bad idea to cast a girl who was 6 years old. It's like they didn't know anything about how to cast someone older. This movie had a bunch of people who were supposed to be "good guys" and yet all of them were acting like kids. It was just so bad. The one actor who is supposed to have a deep voice is the best part of this movie, I don't remember her name but I think it was Jessica Pare. The scene in the garage, where she plays the part of a little girl was just ridiculous. The only good thing is she had a really good acting job and her voice was really well done.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While the film is full of exciting sequences and an intriguing storyline, the acting was not worth the hype and it all turned out to be a pretty lackluster film. It was just as much an effort to make a bad film look good as it was a wasted effort to turn a good film bad. I can't wait for the next one, however.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A really bad movie.   If you want to watch a bad guy with a heart attack, you really should look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The last time i saw this movie   I had a really bad experience   It started out well   the actors were all pretty good   but once you get into the movie  it's bad   all the jokes are really stupid   in my opinion   they don't try to be funny   and the movie just gets more and more annoying   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is not a good film in any way, shape, or form. I don't understand why the producers put this on the silver screen.  The director of this film (Kurt Wimmer) has been known for being on some awful movies, but this is one of the most horrible films I have ever seen. I really don't want to see it again, even though I loved the old "Rambo" movies.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie in the wrong genre.   I wanted a good comedy, but this one was really bad. I didn't understand how a comedy could be this bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie "I don't want to go to the movies anymore" is just a boring piece of shit. "It's a big, boring, long, boring movie, the biggest one of the summer, and that's what I'm here for." What you see on the screen is what you get. There's no suspense or tension or any kind of story. "I guess we got the ticket because we are young, so we don't care about anything. We're just sitting here waiting for the thing to start." It is all about the movie's actors, and it doesn't make any sense. They have no chemistry, and they don't do anything interesting, and all of them are so fucking stupid. And the director, Billy Wilder, seems to be on a different planet. "Let's go over here!" he says. "We are going to the library!" And they all start arguing with each other because they are so dumb. I don't know what to think of it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was ok in the sense that it was entertaining but I have been waiting for a new Star Wars film and this one felt a little rushed.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was very disappointing. I have seen many movies at the local multiplex, but I don't think I have ever seen a movie this bad. Even though the movie was bad, the actors were very good, so I think the movie deserved to be in the theater. This was definitely not worth going to the theater for.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have to admit that my first movie-watching experience was a great one- I was completely amazed at how well the actors did.   It took me several years of watching "Movies" on cable TV and DVDs to realize just how good and consistent the performances were- so this was a true eye-opener.  I loved how it all worked so well- but then came the scenes when they couldn't even get the cameras on the actors and the lighting.  The acting was so great I was almost too impressed with it- and even the acting seemed better than it should have.  It was funny- there were some good one-liners- but you had to pay a lot more attention than you might normally- they were not so obvious.  But, what a story!  A man who thinks he is too smart for his own good meets a woman who knows he is wrong and has to use all of his brain to save their relationship.    I can't say this movie was all that original- but it was so good, so funny, so well done, and so enjoyable, it didn't matter.  If you have any sense at all, you will enjoy it.  "I'm a Man, I'm a King."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It has some nice effects, and it's pretty bad in spots. The actors are in really bad shape (one of them even says he has a broken ankle). The story doesn't make any sense, and the ending is pretty much ridiculous.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really liked this movie, but my son didn't like it at all. He kept saying that the main character was a loser who got caught up in a situation that he couldn't handle. He also said that he would never watch the movie again.   The scene in the movie when the little boy sees the gun that the woman uses to kill the man she's raping was rather disturbing to me. When she's looking at the gun she looks as if she's not worried about getting caught, she looks happy as if they're about to do something fun.  The movie was also very "over the top". It was a good way to get a cheap laugh at the expense of the old west. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I haven't seen many good movies in my life and this one is one of them.   It was supposed to be a romantic comedy about a guy (James Woods) who meets a girl (Jennifer Jason Leigh) in a bar and falls in love with her.  When she asks him to marry her, he refuses.  It's all set in an old house and it's set in New Orleans and James Woods is pretty much perfect in every scene in the movie.  But the movie is about how he falls in lust with her and how he has to pretend to like her so that she won't leave him.  This movie is a little corny and silly but it is worth watching if you want to see some real love stories. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The story was okay. The acting was ok. The writing was not very good.    It is very obvious that they are trying to make a Hollywood movie. They tried to make it look real as much as possible.  The acting is very poor and they seem to be very nervous.  This movie should be avoided by everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am going to tell you one thing: The film "The Lost Brother" is NOT funny. It is not "campy" or even mildly funny. But, the actor's performance is absolutely ridiculous, and this is no exaggeration. I do believe that this was a very hard movie for the actor to play, because he is a very serious person, and in the end he made the character completely ridiculous, like a real "fool".   This was a movie that I never thought I would see, and I am not going to waste my time watching another of these terrible movies.   And the actors, who are "real" and seem to be a bit mad (or should I say, sadistic) at each other, were both totally useless in this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In a word, this is a lousy movie. A terrible mis-match of ideas that don't even seem to understand the concept of what they are trying to do. A story that is simply wrong on almost every level. No actors give a good performance. The writing is not creative. No action, or any of the other key elements to make a good movie. You can go into this movie without a clue of what the film is trying to say. The movie is not well directed, there is no humor, or anything that will keep you interested for more than a few minutes. There are more "interesting" movies out there that I would rather see than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I watched this movie because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. The first half of the movie was decent enough, but the last half of it was a train wreck.   The acting was terrible (although the girls were great) and the acting in this movie sucked so bad it was almost funny.  The story was so bad you don't even want to watch it.  They tried to do a sequel but the sequel didn't get made.  This movie is just not worth watching.  I really hope they do something with this movie or something else that makes sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is boring, predictable, and not worth watching at all.  This movie is a direct rip off of "Shocker" from the 80's. I'm glad I saw it years ago.    - Poor acting and plot (don't expect any variety)  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is a terrible one.   The script is a disaster, there's not enough action, and the cinematography and special effects are terrible.  The actors are terrible, even with the best of intentions.  I was so disappointed with this movie.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is crap. If you want a comedy flick with tons of blood, this is not it.  The story is lame, the characters are awful, the plot is predictable, the acting is crap, the gore is ridiculous and so is the acting.  There are better movies out there than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was very disappointed with this film. It was a terrible film. I had a very difficult time getting through it. I found the acting to be very unoriginal and the plot to be confusing. The characters seemed to have a lot of back stories, but not enough for it to matter. I did not understand why the characters were in the movie, or what they were trying to accomplish. I felt the plot was too complicated for the story, and this resulted in me not liking the film at all. The cast did not have a good grasp on their characters or on the script. The movie was very hard to watch. The actors were great, but the film was a disappointment to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - April 5, 2017 - April 4, 2017 Anonymous Reviewed By: I don't know what the hell is going on in this movie. We see a man who has a wife and two children in his house. His wife is out of town on a work assignment, and he has been doing some housework. He is in a rage because he found out that his daughter was getting into an inappropriate relationship. So he goes around and knocks the boy out cold in front of his wife, and then he gets rid of all his money and all his stuff. Then he tries to hide in the woods, but they track him down and arrest him. He gets sent back to prison for 20 years. He was lucky to get out of there, I guess. All I can say is that this is just one man's view of his life.    A VERY BORING MOVIE! I couldnt get past the crazy scenes and the cheesy plot. The girl was just there to be there for the man who was doing a sex act on her. She got in the way of the action and was treated in a VERY unprofessional manner. She was always walking in and out of shots. The story wasnt that great either.  1. The man's daughter isnt the object of his sexual obsession. He has a sex addiction, and the relationship was just an excuse for him to have sex. He couldnt handle the shame of his own daughter, and has gotten his kicks out of humiliating her. That is why he is trying to hide his identity from her. There is no sexual tension here. His daughter is the object here.  2. The mother is the only character that is interesting, but she has nothing to do with the story. Her entire role is to be the victim in this. She is in this with her daughter, she just wants the money for a job in Mexico. She has no interest in the man or the daughter. She wants the woman out of the picture.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is all about a guy named Bob (Gary Busey) who comes across the body of a young girl lying in the road and he goes to the police to see if he can be blamed for the death. He has a problem with the police because he has been trying to make up a story that his truck hit the girl. I think the police were very kind and he was released. The rest of the movie was like another Bob in that it was all about how bad his life was. In one scene there was a picture of a car that Bob had run down a year before that had just one tire and a dent in the other.   It was the worst movie I have ever seen. It was so bad it made me sick and made me feel bad for Bob in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The reason why it's so hard to see the quality of this movie, is because it's basically an ad for the movie industry.   A lot of the actors, the cinematography, and the editing of the movie are so bad.  They do a whole video about how Hollywood will pay any amount of money to make a good movie, and then they have actors sitting on set that look terrible.  The actors and actresses are all in horrible shape, they are all too old to look this bad. They can barely be actors these days.  It's a shame because I really liked the script, and I think it could have turned out to be good.  Unfortunately, it's just not.  - August 30, 2006Dirty little movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of my favorite movies of all time. I remember when it came out, and this was probably the most enjoyable movie I have ever seen. The soundtrack was fantastic and the action scenes were unbelievable.   It wasn't an action/horror movie in any way shape or form.  It was about a group of people who had to work together, solve some problems and go home.  I think you'll enjoy this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As a film student, I always wanted to see a film by Ingmar Bergman. But I never could because Ingmar never filmed his films in America (he did in Sweden). It's an amazing film from the time of Bergman's first production. The actors are great and the cinematography is wonderful. The story is interesting and the screenplay is well written. But the film is very long. There are so many sets and characters that are too many to keep track of. Also the shooting times are too long for the period. But for me, I still enjoyed this film very much.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really don't like the film as it has a lot of dialogue. There are times when a conversation sounds a bit too much like something out of a talk show. The dialogue is so thick that the movie is very difficult to follow. There is also an annoying joke every once in a while. The jokes don't seem to have a point to them. They're not funny and they seem to just go for the shock factor. I would not recommend this movie to people who like the silent films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen this movie a bunch of times and thought it was great in the early 70's. The script was great and the acting was good and the special effects were great. It even had a "space-theme". The last part of the movie was terrible. I liked the "space" part of it but the story was just silly. When they were talking about the Space Shuttle and saying how they were trying to make the shuttle to orbit in the same time as the Apollo-Skylab I thought that they were joking. They were trying too hard to make this movie space-oriented. I also think that they should have done a real Apollo film. It would have been better than this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad version of the movie   I don't know why they made it this bad   What I dislike the most is that they put in a lot of things that I haven't seen in the movie and the dialogue is very stiff.   It seems like they wanted to make the movie too real, I think they made the wrong choice  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really liked this movie. I don't think the cast was that good. The acting is pretty bad and the dialogue in most of the scenes was cheesy, but this movie was not very funny either. The plot was a mess.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As bad as I find this film to be, I don't want to see another one of these terrible movies. The acting in this movie is atrocious and it's a shame to watch the actors try to act. A real shame as it was a real fun movie to watch.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I went to see this movie in the early 90's and thought it was a terrible waste of time.   The plot is laughable, and there are almost no acting roles.  The whole movie is run by this one character, and all the dialogue is just the character speaking through some sort of machine (a kind of voice-over, which I thought was rather funny).  This movie never really made me laugh (even when I found a great scene) and never really moved me.  As far as movies that had sex scenes, this was the worst one I've seen.  It makes me sad that these kinds of movies have been made since the early 80's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie I never thought I'd enjoy, but after seeing this film I will admit it was a good time.   The acting is very over the top. I like the guy who plays the cop, but he's so over the Top it comes across as he was just hired to be there.  The sex scene (the last one we see) is pretty hot but it makes you feel like this guy doesn't care about his wife and kids.  As I mentioned the story is very cliche.  The guy in this movie always has something he has to say, especially about the girls he loves, but it never works out well.  You'll be looking for him in the next movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this with a friend, who was not really into the series. While she enjoyed the story, the characters and animation weren't appealing to her. She also hated the plot twists that were going on.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't think this movie was that bad, and I don�t mind at all that it is a sequel to another movie. The story line was fun and not a huge surprise. And I do like the fact that they made the first film a hit at the box office, and have decided to keep this series going.    The voice acting is terrible and I think they need to re-do them. The plot line of the movie, at least, was interesting and there were some great moments. But the character development and direction were awful.  I would give this movie 4 out of 10  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a piece of shit and all the actors in it are terrible, except for one. All of them look like they are trying to act out a cheesy 80's slasher.   This is the only film that I saw where the killer never looks anywhere else and they all walk out of the theater having fun.  I had to leave the theater after it was over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was hoping for a good comedy but this was really bad.   If this was a film with a strong cast, there would have been more humor and good moments to make it worth watching, but there was hardly any.  Mick Jagger is the star.  This is not his best performance, but the movie never takes him seriously. He is in too many movies.  If it weren't for John Belushi, this film would be a great one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I was watching this movie I was quite disappointed with how it wasn't at all like that classic movie it had the tagline of being. The plot was too generic, the acting and performances were bad, and the story was stupid.   The only thing it got right was the soundtrack. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was awful. It seemed like the director and actors had been drinking when they made it. The actors acting just to be funny didn't help either. It was very unfunny, with the best moments being the parts in which the kids just stood around like they were in the theater. Very unfunny! The movie only had one scene in which one of the children is crying and the other kid has a cold. It doesn't work.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you want a real horror film then this is not for you. But if you want an enjoyable B&W/cinema then go see it. It does have a great cast and the story itself is great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've been wanting to see this film for a long time. I knew that this is a very bad film but I didn't realize how bad. It takes away from the horror genre to the point where it's almost laughable. I had watched this once before in the theatre as a kid, but it was too horrible to watch. This time around I had to see it in the cinema and watch it twice. I will admit that I thought this film was good, it is just too horrible for me to enjoy.   A lot of people will say that the film is great, but I disagree. The film is so awful that I feel the quality of the film has been compromised. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't know why it takes me this long to review this movie. I'm not sure where the name was based on, but it's a terrible movie. The production is terrible, and the acting is so amateurish that it's really hard to believe they ever shot this movie at all.   The plot of the movie is so bad that even if you knew the details, it still wouldn't make you want to see it.  It all goes down on a boat, and all the actors, in a desperate attempt to look sexy, go through the motions of doing all the sexual stuff in the movie.  Even the plot of "the pirate ship" is lame.  These are some of the most amateurish people I've ever seen on a set.  I was really hoping this movie would be better than it was, but I was disappointed.  The acting is just too amateurish.  Not worth the watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed this movie. The only reason I gave it a 3 is because it was a really bad movie.   It was a poorly made movie. A lot of the shooting and camera work is terrible. The actors don't even look like they're having fun in the movie. Even the acting was very bad.  The dialogue was bad and the dialog between the character and the actress was horrible.  My friend and I both gave it 4 stars because it did show some good action and fighting.  A little background:  This is a Japanese anime and is not really a Hollywood action film. It was based on an actual Japanese movie. For me, I just saw it as an animation movie, and I loved it. It had a great action scene and a lot of cool cars and the like. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was horrible. This is a really bad movie, and the script by the writer/director is pretty bad.   It is not funny.  It was really stupid and terrible.  A young couple go to see a movie, it is really bad, a young man falls off a roof, a woman sees his head with blood coming out and thinks its his blood, then she calls for help, the police come, the young man is dead, his wife and mother try to save him, but it was all a waste of time, they never got the young guy, and then the father comes home to find his wife dead and his young son missing.  The whole thing was just stupid and bad. I guess if the movie made money, I might give it some stars, but as it is, I won't be watching it again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I got this movie on a friend's suggestion and it was a really good movie, just a bit too short. If it were a bit longer, it would be great. I think if you only see it on video, you will never want to see it again! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The poor acting and the bad music is not bad by any means, but the bad acting is simply a bit too bad. If only it were an action film... I will have to keep watching it... I'm not sure if I would recommend this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you want a true action movie with some really cool stunts and explosions, then this is a great movie, but it's a pretty bad movie at the same time.   The plot is pretty cool, with the action being great.  There is nothing like it, and it's been a while since I've seen it so it'll be nice to watch it again.  The action isn't bad, and the stunts are awesome, but the story is boring.  I don't care about the characters, and I didn't care who was alive and who was dead.  When I saw a movie like this years ago it was so different, but now it's just generic, and even worse, the story's not.  This movie should have never been made.  It's a waste of time and money and it probably won't be seen by anyone.  - December 26, 2016Crap

Write a negative review about a bad movie:       It was just a waste of time, and I'd like to send a big thank you to the producers of this film for wasting the time of the actors in this film.   My favorite part of the movie is where they show the children from the beginning of their life.  It just doesn't add to the movie, and the actors look like they are having fun, but no one is really looking around them.  My husband and I were in the audience for this movie, so we know all of the references, and you could tell that this movie was meant to be a parody, as it is a really bad movie.  The reason why it is so bad is because of the poor acting, and terrible jokes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As far as this movie is concerned, it is the worst movie I have ever seen. It doesn't even have any good acting. The story, for the most part, is a complete mystery. It is a long and boring story, it makes no sense, it's just a poorly acted, poorly written, and poorly written story. The best part of this movie, the acting, is also poorly acted. Most of the characters are horrible. If you are looking for a movie with acting this bad, this is the movie for you. I found it hilarious that the man behind this movie was a comedian. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible movie. If you're looking for a good action movie, then you've come to the wrong place. This movie doesn't even try to entertain you in any way. You're expected to have a good time, and that doesn't happen. I feel bad for all the actors because the only reason this movie is even made is because the people behind it want you to watch it. The acting is terrible. It's hard to tell if the actors are acting or not. It really is hard to watch because the movie just does not make any sense. The only one that comes out with any kind of confidence is the lead guy. There are way too many bad jokes in this movie. There's one that involves a cat that has a large tumor on his head. Then the movie goes on and on about how the cat is having the tumor removed but it doesn't actually happen. It all kind of just goes on. I can't believe these actors even had the nerve to take part in this film. The story of this movie was bad enough on its own but to top it off it was made by a kid who made this movie in his bedroom. The worst thing about this movie were the characters in the movie. It was pretty clear by the end of the movie that most of these characters were just made up to be likeable so that the film could be cheap. The last thing that really sucked about this film was how cheesy it all was. It wasn't very original either. The whole movie was just made out of cheap looking action shots, and a bunch of stupid people that just happened to be actors.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was just an awful waste of time and money. This film is a direct ripoff of the first one. I watched it, but didn't understand why, because it seemed so very similar to the first. It just took a long time to get to the climax. In the first movie, when they first get to Earth and have to get the spacecraft up and moving, the crew is getting the spacecraft into orbit. This movie went to the same thing in orbit (the moon), only that it took way too long and it was just way more complicated. Also, it was not funny at all. The acting was horrible, the camera work was poor (I think it was a 3-D movie) and I think they went over the budget.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was so horrible that it actually made me feel a little bad for myself because my parents bought it for me as a baby (and since it's all in black and white, it's really hard to find in color) so I've always been a big fan of the animated films.   The animation is really bad and the actors never move at all.  But in terms of story, it wasn't bad at all, and some of the humor is really funny and good.  I was really surprised by how good the animation was and the acting was actually pretty good. It was pretty hard to tell the difference between what was supposed to be a person and a random person.  The special effects were really impressive and I was surprised by what they did with some of them.  My favorite scene is when the characters all walk into a hallway and it turns out to be another room.  There is even a whole scene with a giant fish and a girl in a rubber mask who just wants to be his friend.  Overall, I really enjoyed the movie and the story was really funny.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this movie back in the 70's when I was a kid and it was terrible. Not even a little funny, the acting was terrible, and the story about the two girls is totally wrong. So wrong, in fact, that it made me think of a movie I saw way back in grade school, and that's when the film all started to make sense.   The girl and her mother are in town, shopping for clothes, and when they pass by a man who sells a really cute dress for $200, they stop and he gives them his number and they go out. When they get back he tells her how great she looks, but she's not interested. She tries the other dresses on and decides she likes this one better. This dress, by the way, is a "gorgeous red silk". So the mother goes in to pick it up and the man who sold it tells her to forget about it, that the dress she picked up is not even his. When she leaves he makes the girl leave with a little note saying, "Oh, don't get involved with my little girl, she has a future in show business. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a bad film. It's all the other bad movies you'll find on the video store that you never see.  This was produced by John Carpenter.   This is a really stupid, low-budget, trashy, low budget film.  In my opinion, it is the worst film I have ever seen in my life.  The plot of this movie is a complete joke.  The film is so bad it's funny!  This film will be a joke for a long time.  It is terrible.  Carpenter has never made a good film, and this one is bad.  A film is good when it tells a story with a sense of humor.    This film, however, doesn't have the sense of humour.  The story is so cheesy, it's ridiculous.  At some point, I thought that the writer was just playing with my emotions.  After watching the film, I felt that Carpenter was just trying to make a joke on me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was boring, annoying, and most of all very unrealistic. The story had no action or anything that made it fun to watch. It really ruined the movie for me, and I really hope that this movie does not ever get made again.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is just another of those "horror" movies which are so lame. The writing is so bad, the actors are so bad and the makeup, set and costumes are so poor. This movie is so badly made that it looks like a 70's B-movie and is just laughable.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I hate movies that have the words "BAD MOVIE" on the title. A bad movie should have a title that says it has a bad ending and a bad plot and bad acting.  This movie is not bad, but it's not good.  It has no plot, no plot twists, no characters, no suspense, no character development.  I guess this was supposed to be a psychological thriller that had some action, but no action was in the movie.  The only thing that makes it interesting is that when the cops pull up, they see two girls with guns in their backpacks, but nobody ever gets arrested.  There is nothing like this movie. The only person who enjoyed it was my uncle who lived across the street from where this movie was playing and he always complained about the bad movies in the area, so this is the first movie he liked that he saw.  For the money, I'd probably get something more interesting from the same studio.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a great movie. There are so many great performances in this movie, and there is a lot of heart in it. It's a fun, funny, but very serious movie that deals with a serious issue and takes it very seriously.   I just wish they would have gone for the full color picture in the 70s. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is just bad.    The whole movie just was so boring and not funny or entertaining or anything.   You just sit there watching the two main characters go about their lives and what they do.  It was a pretty boring movie.  The movie should have been better than this.  The only thing I liked about this movie was that it was really well shot with amazing camera angles and great lighting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was excited to see this movie based on the "C" movies of the 1950's.  It was going to be about a man who was in the military, who gets into a fight with his fellow man, but then ends up dead.  I didn't think that the film was going be very good, but I couldn't really be wrong.  The cinematography was horrible.  One time the camera was pointing at the person standing next to the dead guy, as if the camera wanted to film him.   What is wrong with this picture?   The other problem is the actors.  They all look like they just walked out of the 80's and had been to the gym.  All of them looked like they are about 30 years old.    I am not really sure why, but they all looked more like they were going to jail, or in prison.  At times, it was difficult to tell who was acting.  Some of the actors were playing the same parts for different actors. It wasn't all that great.  What I think ruined the film is that, the actors didn't really understand the characters that they were portraying.  A lot of the time, the characters seemed more like archetypes than actual characters.  Finally, I will say that the acting in the film were terrible.  If they had had better actors, this film would have been great.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad horror movie. This film is one of those "oh my gawd did I just see that movie!" kind of movies. The story doesn't even make any sense. It's really just a movie about a couple who go to a haunted house on the shore of a lake in the woods to kill a monster that was living in there. The house has a lot of dark energy and has something horrible in it. It doesn't make any freaking sense, but if you look into the story it's all there.   It's just not a good movie and the story is a big stretch.  The only time I feel the story makes any sense is when the couple is talking about the story while driving and then the monster comes through the window in the back seat and knocks them out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A movie I thought would be terrible, but turned out to be a great one, this is one of the few examples where I found myself enjoying the film. It is about a man who is in the middle of a nasty divorce, and who tries to keep a low profile. This is where the movie fails. The director makes it look like he wants to make the main character's life as bad as possible, and it is. The script is very poorly written. When the film was released I was amazed at how much of the plot I could make out, but the movie has been released so many times that I feel it is ruined now. The acting is a bit better than it was, but not by much. The special effects were poor, and some scenes look very different. This was made by a movie studio, so the special effects aren't bad, just poor.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    When I first watched this movie, I thought it was a real low budget action movie, as they didn't really have to spend much to make the movie as low budget as it was.  The action scenes were all pretty cheesy and the actors all looked like they had gotten cast after seeing some crappy pornos on the internet.  I was going to give this movie a try, but after watching it the third time I knew it was going nowhere, as the filmmakers didn't have any talent for filmmaking, the actors were not good, and there were some really cheesy fight scenes.   It just seems to be a real waste of time to make this kind of movie, but they could have been more creative and have more interesting fights.  As for the plot, there were no twists or plot twists.  This movie was very bad, with really cheesy and stupid fights. This movie is just very bad in all aspects, and I can't imagine anyone would watch it and enjoy it.  My rating for this movie: 1  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "good" parts were very short and lame. I really did not get the point of this movie. You have a young girl on a plane who is kidnapped and forced into prostitution, and after a while gets a good deal. When she gets the money she meets an old school friend who helps her find a place to live. The movie had two very good, memorable scenes. The first was in a bar after the girl had a bath and was getting ready to go out. The guy who was with her asked if she was clean and asked if he could take a shower with her, but she laughed and ran out. He followed her, then came home and had sex with her. She had another scene that was very good. She was taken to a motel where she was raped and beaten by an older guy. This guy was obviously a professional and he really took the beating very well.   I think this movie is pretty much worthless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen all of the "bad movies" that have been made in my lifetime. This is the first "bad" movie that I have ever seen.   When you get into this movie it's like you are a bad person.  I would not go see a movie that was full of stupid ideas and horrible acting.  This is not a movie for the faint of heart.  If you want to laugh at a bad idea then go see something good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The worst part about this movie is that it looks and sounds nothing like any of the original movies. The music is completely un-edgy, like someone who just took a handful of tunes from a bunch of different movies and slapped them onto an action movie. The characters look cheap and un-original. There are no scenes that you can even begin to identify with anything about them. There's also an awful amount of CGI in the movie, but it's nowhere near as bad as the original.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think they are trying to save the studio money by making this movie.   There was a time when studios had to show their movies in the same way as TV shows, and that meant the actors needed to act like themselves.  If you had to sit through this movie on TV and you watched in high definition you would be shocked by the acting of the actors.  It's a good looking movie, but it's very cheesy.  They put a lot of the blame on John Travolta who plays the bad guy.  Travolto is always playing the bad man.  I hope this doesn't affect his future movie opportunities.  A lot of people will see this movie and think he is the bad one.  He has a tough time acting and he can't act like a villain.  The only good thing in this movie is the music by John Barry.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie I have ever seen. The story was very poorly written and the acting was terrible. I thought it was all a big joke. The bad acting and stupid story was so bad that I almost couldn't believe it was real.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A film made by a director who had never made a film before. He was making it with his friend, and I think they filmed it on the spur of the moment. He thought he would try some sort of live action, and he had a lot of trouble getting it off the ground. When they finally got together to film, he forgot the script and the scene that he thought would be best for it. He tried to film an entire scene from the same angle, but that just made him look like a complete idiot. The rest of the film was just him improvising.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    What a mess   As far as this movie goes this is like the most horrible movie I've ever seen   The acting is just horrendous   A total lack of any tension or anything like that   I really had a hard time finishing this movie   Overall if you're looking for a horror movie this is not one  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was terrible. The acting and production was terrible, the cinematography was terrible and the film just felt sloppy. The main bad guy was not the best actor, his accent was terrible (he seemed to be from Europe, so it's not like the director had any idea how to play him in a way that felt authentic), and the dialogue was so terrible, I had a hard time understanding him. The characters that I thought were supposed to be cool, or supposed to act cool, they didn't act at all. And they were all the same actress all the time.   If it had been made by a director with better acting and better production values, then it would have been a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie was bad. I hate it.  The guy who plays the role of "Rene" is very small and looks like a girl.  He says some stuff in the movie that could be offensive to a person that's not of his religion and it just makes me think of my mom and how it made her feel when she was a child.    For some reason she thought he was going to marry her or something so I guess she felt bad about that.  It has a very cheesy, cheap, amateurish feel to it and I think it was really made by a bunch of 14 year olds that had some money so they could film their own stupid movie for some stupid money.  So why did they film it if they didn't make any money off of it?  The story was really not much of a story.  There was no plot and it was just going through the motions.  Even when "RENE" was trying to commit suicide they didn't do anything to him.  But it has a good ending so at least it has that. I would have liked the guy that played him in the film to have looked like he was bigger than he is so he would look real strong.  I don't think it makes sense to have a man look that small and I don' t understand why he has to wear a girl's clothes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So here is the story: the title of this movie was a little off, because it had too much of the word "dun" in it. Anyway, this movie has a girl who is a junkie who's a total slut for guys. But after being turned down by her first boyfriend, she gets a new boyfriend in a gangster movie. The guy's name is Jack, and the girl's name seems to be "Rose" in the movie. Rose is a drug addict that's been doing crack in the movies before, and Rose's boyfriend seems to have the same drug problem that Rose has. The girl has to have sex with Jack in order to keep her boyfriend in line, and she wants to get a big score for it.   The director tries to sell this movie, but it really sucks. There are a lot of shots of the girls looking like they are having sex, and it's hard to see if they are or not.  The action sequences in this movie are lame. The only reason this movie gets a positive review is because Rose's character gets to have some action scenes, which she really doesn't do very well.  I wouldn't recommend this movie for anybody. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The worst movie ever. The movie was about a girl who goes to a beach to make out with a guy she met at a bar and he goes to the police station and claims that he was beaten up by a group of kids and the girl was responsible. A few days later there was a huge police raid on the beach and the police found nothing and no suspects. They then put out a press release saying that the girl has been arrested for false reporting. The press release said she had reported a false rape and that the suspect said she was a prostitute.  The film is so horrible that it's hard to believe that this thing was ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The most boring movie ever   This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is so horrible. It's like every single character is playing the part of some character from a bad teen movie. The whole thing just seems like someone made this and then threw in some really bad acting and some cheap jokes.   I feel like I am watching someone make a bad 80's movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There are better horror movies out there, but this one is more than worth a watch.   The movie is very scary, even for adults, and I did not know that such a simple situation could lead to such horrible tragedy.  Some people say it's too violent, but they don't know the real horror.  A simple family gets a letter from a friend, that tells them that there is an intruder in their home. But what did they do? They didn't think!  A very strange family gets an unexpected visit at their home from a group of people, who are looking for a woman who is supposedly possessed.  As a horror movie it's not that great, but a very enjoyable one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is very much like the title. The character development is very little, so that you see the characters being very bad. The action scenes are boring and forgettable. The music is bad and so is the acting and acting is bad, you can hear the actors' lines and the people say "that's right", but it does not mean anything, it sounds very stupid.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I heard about this movie from someone I thought it sounded very silly. Now I see it was so much better than I expected. The plot was so good, the acting was wonderful, and the story was exciting.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a fun and entertaining flick.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It is the worst movie I have seen and it was only made for cheap money.   There is no plot and the only reason it is on the list is because of that and the poor acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a crappy movie! Don't waste your time and money on it.  I thought the movie was good in the beginning but by the middle the acting is very bad. There is only one thing i can say about this movie, it has the worst acting.  The story was great in the movie but in real life it was just a terrible movie to watch.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't remember the name of this movie (in my copy it says a little-known comedy "Shots and Scares" starring William Fichtner and Nancy Reagan). I think I saw it when I was a kid. It was a bad, bad movie.   This movie is really about a woman named Jean (Reagan) who works at a hotel in France.  The plot is about a group of people from a French vacation resort who stay at the hotel after having a vacation.  One day the hotel manager is arrested for selling stolen diamonds.  When the guys from the resort come to visit, Jean decides to take them out.  Jean gets into a fight with one of them and then leaves the hotel.  I just can't believe that this movie is still being made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is horrible. The music is horrible, the acting is horrible and the acting of the leads is very flat.  I really felt it was just a cheap stunt to cash in on a hit movie, but I couldn't help but feel disappointed with the movie, and that is not even counting the horrible acting and terrible music.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never knew what to expect with this movie, but at the end I could not find it a bad one at all, but the acting just sucks, especially with the bad acting, especially for the "bad" actor. Also the film is just plain slow and boring, even for a horror film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    *The bad guy in the trailer looks the same in the film, and he is very good-looking, even by a Hollywood standard. The actor's performance is very well cast though.   *The acting is great, although the actress's character is very stiff and uninteresting for most of the movie, and there is very little to the plot other than the idea that one day the police will catch and punish the killer. The story, however, does develop very slowly, and I found it somewhat annoying to wait for so long for the killer to be apprehended. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would give this movie a C but the acting is so bad it makes it a C minus. The director doesn't know how to make a movie. His cinematography and cinematography alone is not enough. His directorial choices are not just bad but disgusting.   It's just not right.  I want to like this movie but the story is not worth watching.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first scene in this movie is so bad that it takes a moment to realize it is a movie. The poor girl is walking home after the store closed and the dog is standing on her tail. She tries to get past him but he runs after her and bites her. I could watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it.    This movie is the epitome of poor taste. The acting is horrible and the actors all look the same.  When they say "this is the real life" what they mean is this movie could be real life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If there were some people who wanted to see more films by the original members of "The Who," "The Rolling Stones" or any of the other great rock 'n roll bands in the world, this film could be a fun watch. "Flaming Star" is not a bad film, but it is not great either. The film has a very dull plot, it has little to offer on the surface, it is an exercise in a series of repetitive and silly characters, and the acting is not good enough to keep your interest. "The Flaming Star" does not deserve the poor reputation that it is given by most of the critics and fans.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I didn't think that this movie would be good but when i saw it on a plane i thought i would enjoy it because it looks great on tv but when it comes to a movie like this and its an action movie and you have a plane crash on the ground then it was too hard to watch i thought it was a really good movie but it was just too dark for my taste and i have seen too many good movies that were good.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie really didn't have a purpose. I didn't want to see this movie because it was made in 1997 and the only reason that it was released in 2002 was because it starred Jeff Bridges. It is not a good movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is basically an animated version of the first film, with a cast of people (a lot of them non-actors) in the role of the characters of the two films. They have a lot of fun and do the "movie" fairly well, but not by very much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I am extremely disappointed in this movie, as an artist, as a human being, and as a Christian. What the film teaches us about art is one of the worst ways you can waste your life. I am a Christian and I was shocked by the fact that a movie can teach us such terrible things. The movie also teaches me about false religion and is basically preaching to the preachers.     The movie, while showing that one could live a Christian life, is basically telling us that that's all there is to it. I could not believe that someone could go to such great lengths to create a movie that is supposed to be about life and then leave it so shallow and empty. I mean, we're supposed to look at the great works of art from around the world and see that Jesus Christ is there, but this movie clearly has nothing to say about that.  This movie also tells us that there is no meaning in life but to please our parents and be happy and satisfied in a religious life.  The whole time the movie was on I felt sick to my stomach. The characters, the script, the acting, all of it was so superficial. I was also embarrassed by a lot of what I saw on screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The plot was boring and unoriginal. The story is similar to many other things and the characters were just the same. My favorite part was the "The most evil and horrible movie ever, and no one will ever forget it."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I watched this with my family when I was about 9. The whole family laughed about this one and it still holds up, for the most part, even today.   A good movie if you're a kid, if you enjoyed seeing things like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  The actor portraying the lead character, Chris is completely out of his league as the lead.  He's like a bad version of Tom Hanks.  You would think he was a star because he's a Hollywood icon and the movie was a hit.  I had already seen a few of his movies and this is as bad as they get.  Chris can't act and it shows throughout the movie.  And I mean he can't even act, he just mumbles and rambles all over the place, making a horrible movie..   It's a horror movie, that's what it is, but don't go thinking you're going to see a fun horror movie like Hostel or The Last House on the Left.  It is a real horror movie at the end of the day.    I would never want to see this movie with my family and it would never be on my watch list. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie has very limited potential to be a classic. The actors can do nothing right. They are all actors with little experience. This movie will most likely not become a cult classic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had no idea what to expect from this movie, but, it was like trying to watch a movie in which all the actors are played by different people.   The first few scenes are pretty good, but then the movie takes a turn for the worst.  If you really want to see what a movie is about, this is not the movie to watch.  A typical "kid" movie, not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was a mess from beginning to end. There were a lot of editing issues and the story was way to long. When it did start to pick up, it went nowhere fast. There was a big lack of chemistry between the leads, and the movie lost momentum. This movie would be better if it were cut down to a better length. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't understand how people are offended that the guy with the long beard is played by a white man. And why did he grow it out?    He looks a little different in the movie, the guy on the left looks to be a little younger than the guy in the middle, maybe 20 or so.   It isn't the best acting job by the time the movie starts.  It doesn't matter much when it's a good movie, but when it has poor acting, it can look bad.  The only time they look natural is when there's an argument going on, and they look off by the side of the road because of the argument. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie for all audiences, but more so for those who do not like horror.   The film's main purpose is to terrorize the audience with the "torture" of this "cabin in the woods".   All of the actors are completely unqualified for this role and the entire film is a cheap imitation of "The Exorcist".  This film's only purpose is for shock value.  You are left in a very unenjoyable situation.  While there is a "twist", nothing is left to the imagination.  This movie is a joke, and does not offer any kind of entertainment.  A film which should not exist in this age. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was skeptical when I saw this movie, but it turned out to be so poorly made and so poorly shot that it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The actors look absolutely ridiculous as they portray characters who appear to have never been in a movie before, and the special effects are so bad that it almost makes it look like an episode of "Wizard of Oz".   If you are a fan of bad movies you should definitely not watch this, but if you are just looking for a bad bad movie then it will have its uses. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was not what i expected from it and i am disappointed. I did not expect a film that is filled with terrible acting and poorly written script. This was a very stupid movie and I thought that it would be better than it was. The plot is very stupid and the acting is awful. I will not be watching this again.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film is a horror flick. I really didn't care that the film was rated R at all. I found it was boring to the point of being annoying.   A lot of people complain about the violence but I really don't know why.  A few times it seemed like someone was getting shot right at the beginning. And the first time was during the car chase and the main character is running.  So it just seemed to be an excuse for the director to run at you, whip out his gun and shoot.  This movie is just annoying, not worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't think that this movie is worth the watch.  I just saw it because I saw some reviews on the Internet that said that the director of the movie was black, but that is just not true. This movie was written by the same guy who made a movie called 'Pawn Shop' and that movie is not even that good.   The movie was supposed to be about the death of the real owner of this pawn shop, and I think that it was supposed too be about how the business owner is going to get rid of the police and the mafia so that they won't come in and steal his money and that the place will be taken over by a young boy and his mother and that they would then become millionaires.  But it's just so hard to watch this movie. I am tired of watching bad movies and this one is really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie at a local movie theater, and I have to say, I am not sure if I like the movie. I liked the song, I thought it was a nice story. I just didn't like the ending. I mean, there were lots of people, so they could have just run away. But it seems like the girl should have gone into the house to escape, which is probably why it ended this way.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The actors do well enough, they are good enough, but the plot is terrible. The characters are so unlikable and unlikeable. All you can say is "I just want to die", I didn't enjoy this movie at all and I just hope no one did.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoyed the first part of the movie, but then, the movie just becomes a drag. It has been several years since I saw the movie and they decided to reboot it with a completely different lead, this time with a male lead. While I like the guy, he was just too over the top and was just ridiculous.   The main problem with the movie was that they didn't know what they were doing. It was supposed to be set in the 90s but when they showed scenes from the 80s they just looked ridiculous. It just became a lot of action and not much character development. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would recommend this film to just about anyone. There are definitely a few moments that fall a bit flat, but overall, the acting is good and the film has a nice visual style. If you want to see a good science fiction film, give this one a try! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think this movie will have great success at the box office, but it will probably fail in terms of its impact on my life. It's a bad film, no doubt about it. It seems to be all about the music and the acting, and nothing else. It makes me wish I had spent more time with my daughters and not watched the movie with them. The actors are average at best. Even the main character, which is supposed to be an evil person, is kind of a bad guy. I didn't think he had enough depth for a character who's supposed to turn out to be such a monster. The one redeeming thing is the music, but that too is very forgettable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   My husband and I saw this movie at a small theater in New York when we lived there. The theater was small, but it was well lit, and the seats were comfortable. I remember getting the feeling that the actors and actresses were very happy that they were being used to bring in extra money. When the movie started, the audience broke into a chorus of boos, which only seemed to encourage the actors to yell even more at the audience. The acting was laughable, and it seemed as if the actors just got in the way. When they ended the movie, the entire audience just sat there, looking at them and laughing. It was like a scene out of "Saturday Night Live". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen all the good "Borat" movies.  I love "Boris and Natasha"   When the film started, the main characters were very good.  It was hard to find out where the film was headed.  They kept teasing us with a good story, but they couldn't find it.  This is a movie that has no direction, and it has no meaning.   The film had no punch.  What were the producers thinking with this movie?  It is a very bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I just didn't want to do it.   So I went out for dinner last night and had a couple of beers and it was all going well until we got to the restaurant.  They started off by telling us that we had to leave because we'd just had a car accident and couldn't stay for the whole meal because it would take a long time to drive everyone home.  The person who was taking care of us was there and he was trying to take charge.  So, we were given a few choices.  One was to leave immediately, but that was in the next hour or so.  And we could either stay for another couple of hours, but then we'd miss the last train home, or we could try to call for a ride for $25.  My wife said she'd do it for $35 and I said I'd do the $35 because it was my wife's birthday.  As we were leaving, they turned to the driver and said, "If you leave, we'll charge you $100 for parking your car.  Please tell our guests we'll give them a $50 gift card and they can take a car."   Then we saw them go out and buy two large sodas and two small sodas (one of which we didn't see until after we were gone).   It was obvious that they were going to charge us, but they weren't going to let us have our beer.  This isn't a place you want to be involved with.  It makes you feel like you can't leave or they can just give you a bad bill.  I have to wonder if this restaurant could be even worse if they were run by a kid who didn't drink and only had a sense of entitlement. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    There's not much to this movie and it's pretty much just bad comedy.   The characters are all just a bunch of wacky characters, and it just kind of gets silly after a while.  The jokes are pretty poor, the production value is pretty poor too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like most other movie stars, Tom Cruise was a good looking guy when he was growing up in Los Angeles and had a few minor acting and production roles on TV but never was much more than a supporting character. His first big film, "Soylent Green", was a flop and was not a hit with audiences or critics and only lasted a few months on the screen, and since then he hasn't had a hit since. He is a fine actor, but for "Full Metal Jacket" it was a big mistake.   It's not his fault that he was cast in a role where he would be expected to be in the center of the action, and he did have a few good action scenes and even a couple of decent lines, but it was really Cruise's film. He played the role and the roles of most of the guys, and none of them were interesting and most were in the background.  The film, at times, reminded me of "Air Force One" or "Die Hard" because of the flying scenes, but even when the characters were actually in combat, it was only in a few scenes and never very long.  When they got to the actual battle, it just was not there and it was like watching Tom Cruise in a scene from "The Warriors". This is why the film is so hard to rate.  This film will not be remembered for the acting, it will be remembered by the movie stars who got to have a good time playing with the action and it will also be remembered as the first movie to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I went to see this movie in a theater in my neighborhood. It was one of the first movies I saw back in my late teens. It doesn't even feel dated when I watch it, especially since it was made back in the 70's and had to use actors that look like they are in their 70's. It is a story about a man who gets a job in an exotic foreign country and finds out that the people there are so ignorant they can't read or write. It's a great film that is fun and exciting with some great acting from the cast. A must see movie for any action fan. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is good but it is not a "movie".   This is like an 80s made in the 50s, or a 80s film, but at least with the time machine.   I was a big fan of "Ghostbusters", and this is basically another remake.  The music is so cheesy and generic.  I am not one for cheesy 80's films, and this makes it worse.  There are scenes that are in the background, so when the action happens, they are really hard to see.  Also, when the "bad guys" are defeated, they have a big open door with nothing in it.  Some of the scenes were funny, some were very bad.

Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is really bad.  The writing is terrible, and the acting is horrible. It would be hilarious if it was any other film.  You can tell that they thought they could make a good movie. It was a horrible decision.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The cast is horrible. I mean, they are all good actors, but for some reason none of them can act together. And then there are the acting techniques that just fail to work.    I never thought I could see the movie like this, it is just too bad the movie does not succeed more, it should be a masterpiece. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was a HUGE Star Wars fan and to this day I don't really know why. It was my favorite series and I still have a lot of my Star Wars action figures. They looked awesome. I bought the blu ray set and had to go to the store to get it for a couple of bucks. My friend said he saw it and thought it was a crappy version and that it looked better than the originals. I gave him my money and never went back to it. I guess I was just spoiled with the originals and I just never thought to see it like a fan.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story is good, but is made into a boring mess. There are a few parts where you would get a bit more enjoyment out of the story if it was not being played in a "twist" that only made it worse, like the film makes it seem that the characters are not what they seem. The acting was very cheesy at times, and the story was a bunch of stupid, predictable, and just stupid scenes. The main bad guy is supposed to be the one that is the most evil, but it turns out that there is no "true" evil in the film.   This movie was not that good, especially when you take into account it was a remake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film was pretty bad.  The story is really bad and it would've been better as a short story.  There's very little action and not much dialogue.   My kids hated the movie and my wife hated the acting in it.  I was disappointed with it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I gave this movie 1 star and that's only because I was expecting it to be way better than it was.  This movie was made in the 70's but if I was watching it today, I would have rated this movie as 2 stars.  It has a slow pacing, a generic action style, a lot of swearing, lots of rape scenes, and it makes you feel like you are watching the rape of a girl for fun.  What's worse is that most of the people who watch this movie, will not know that the guy in this movie is not a real cop.   You can tell this movie was put together by a bunch of girls at a party and the producers took every opportunity to mention that they got it from a guy who was in the Marines.  You want some good bad action movies?   This is it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I think that this movie is a waste of time to watch.   It's a very boring and uninspired story.  There is not even one decent scene in this movie.  The plot is boring and not very creative, and it is filled with cheesy lines like "I'm a little green, don't you want me? I've got a mind like a steel trap".  The acting is so-so, too.  It does not make me want to see another movie like this one.  If I were watching this movie for the acting, I would not waste my time.  I have seen better, more original movies than this.  This movie is so disappointing because I was really looking forward to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   In my opinion, this movie is just horrible. It's a cheesy, ridiculous and cheesy film. It was very badly acted, and very cheesy and the movie was really bad.   The movie had great actors, but the actors were horrible.  The acting in this movie was terrible.  This movie was based on a true story.  I think it was a film based on "The French Connection". The story was really lame, but it was made for a reason.  But the actors did not have a great plot. It didn't have much, if any, fun to it.  It's just so bad and cheesy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie and thought it was a real waste of time. I went into the movie to be entertained but was turned off from it from the beginning. After watching the trailer, I knew this was going to be a terrible movie because it was just ridiculous. I have heard so many bad reviews of this movie because of this, but I really think it is a very stupid movie. It is set in the future where a robot that gets caught in the past and is sent back into the past by a time traveler. This is the perfect example of a time traveling movie, because the time traveling was done just to screw with the story. They didn't need to do this because it just made no sense and I didn't like it. The movie is filled with many inconsistencies and the movie has some strange and unrealistic plot lines, but at the same time it is very interesting and well made. It takes place in the 90s so it has a look of realism to it. It also has a very good soundtrack that would have been great if the music didn't constantly be in the background.   If you are a fan of cheesy 80s movies, like "Ghost Busters" or "Gremlins" and you like robots, then this is the movie for you. This movie is like watching a really bad 80s movie. You are going to laugh and you are going go to see this movie in the theaters and not in your head. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It is really hard to watch a movie which is so bad, and so uninspired in its production that it is hard to even feel like it is entertaining.   The acting is terrible, especially in the beginning of the movie.  A lot of the actors, like Mike Vogel, are not very good at all.  The music is not that great either.  There is so much wrong with the film.  I am still not completely convinced that this is a real documentary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is full of weird little ideas that don't really work. I am not sure if this movie was supposed to be a comedy or a horror, but I guess the people who put it together just couldn't think of any other thing to do with it. I just kept laughing as the movie went on, but the way they did the movie just wasn't very funny. The acting was OK. The actress who plays the character is pretty good. The scenes with the "people" and the killer who gets up and kills a bunch of people just seemed so out of place. It seemed like they were filmed in a different town and were doing a completely different scene. In the end, the movie was just a complete waste of time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved this movie, and so did my 8 year old daughter who is my primary babysitter. My daughter was bored, but she wanted to see it so she did it to herself. She doesn't seem to mind watching it with me.  It is a very fun movie for all ages.  I got to see my father in it. I don't think he is very good, and I wish they could have cast a few more black actors. My mom was the best. My father was just a little bit creepy. I still think this movie is great and it will go down in movie history.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you like bad movies, you will enjoy this.   It starts with a slow, creepy intro and the only thing you see is the "camera" which then is cut to a shot of a guy standing in the shadows of a cave looking at the camera. Then we see the guy go through several rooms and rooms of skeletons, dead bodies and various other creepy scenes.  This guy is an insane serial killer.  It was like watching a film about someone who has lost their mind and they are only making these sick movies for fun.  There were some nice special effects (I would love to see the "candy" in the film) but you can tell that a lot of thought went into making these films.  I was really creeped out when this guy came into my room at night with his gun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The bad movie that has to be the worst movie I have ever seen   My worst experience at a movie theater I have gone to many times and I never had a bad time. But this movie was so bad that it was painful to watch. It was so out of touch and the acting was awful. It really took me out of the movie. The acting was really terrible. It took me a while to realize that the people in the movie were playing the part of the characters. The actors didn't seem to be in character at all. They didn't act like the characters they were playing. The best thing is that the ending was so stupid. I was so tired after watching this movie that I couldn't even continue watching.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a bad flick. It's not a good movie to watch with a group of people that can't understand each others language.   The cast is too stupid to make this movie work.  They get into too much trouble with the police.  A good group of actors would make this film worth watching.  If I could have any movie taken from my DVD collection I would take this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The most ridiculous thing in the movie is that the alien ship's radio signals are a mix of alien languages, yet they don't make sense. The other movie where aliens are being seen on a big screen, yet we can understand none of them.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this was a pretty bad movie, but I didn't give it a one star.   This is a movie that I thought was going to be about a real life serial killer, and the story of one of the victims. The script was pretty bad.  The story was so bad. This movie was really cheesy.  I don't think you can tell from the trailer.  But the movie never really tells you the story.  If you have seen the movie, then you know that the movie was made to create some sort of big name star, to sell it, but this guy is really uninteresting.  He was a nice guy, but he was never good enough in the story to really make it a big movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie more times than I can count. It is just terrible. I have never been to a film festival and the audience for this movie were kids.   The director is a friend of mine and I saw this movie at his house. I was amazed that his son let me see the movie with him.  The picture is just horrible. It makes me hate my cousin. The kids are acting like animals. The director doesn't even have any friends who are in a film company. He is the kind of guy that goes to the movies because he needs something to get his ego high and then he leaves.  If I saw a kid acting like a dog or animal at the end of a movie, I would kill him. I'm not going to watch this movie ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The director was an up and coming young director with a lot to say, and as he was still in the early stages of his career, the director decided to use a "bait and switch" in which the bad guy turns out to be a good guy...which isn't a good thing. The film is bad and the characters are bad. I felt that it was only a matter of time before it was brought back. This was never a good film for me.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is terrible.  The acting was awful, especially for this movie.  It seems like everyone is so bad in it.  I also like the idea of this movie, but the acting was just terrible. The lead actor did a terrible job with his character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A great movie, but it lacks any of the classic elements and it makes up for it with its originality.   The movie doesn't need to be watched in order, the first time through is the most important.  There are a lot of great movies in the 80s, but this is one of them.  It is a fun flick, and it gets better as it goes on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is so bad that it's embarrassing. It's full of bad acting, boring dialogue, and a bunch of "funny" jokes that were never funny in the first place.   For the most part, it's just an awkward mess. If the actors had anything going for them, it was their lack of charisma and their terrible acting ability.  This was an effortless flop from the start.  It's even worse if you actually watch it on TV, because most of the "gags" are just repeated shots of the same people doing the same things over and over and then the whole scene pans to the side and everyone just looks tired and bored.  If you're really interested in seeing how bad the actors are, this would be a fun way to get to know them better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    As a big fan of the genre I was excited about seeing a big budget Hollywood movie take on a classic and good movie from the 1950's, however, the film was a big disappointment. The film was boring, unoriginal and extremely bad, especially the acting. I was really hoping to see some new actors who had been involved with the 1960's era Batman, however when I saw George Clooney as Two Face I just wanted to smash the television set and get out of there.   I give this movie two stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot is a complete sham, and the performances are laughable, and this is why it is an absolutely terrible movie.   A movie with an even worse premise than "War Games", and the acting is not as bad, but still, the acting just doesn't cut it.  A terrible movie about an even more terrible movie, and that is why people can't recommend this to others, it's just too embarrassing.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A great disappointment.   The story is fun and interesting, but the actors are awful and the plot is weak and boring.  The production values are great but the acting is weak.  It is a great idea to have a science fiction film based on a novel, but when this film is done, the script just is not convincing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A great movie that is so full of clichés and cheap lines it's hard to enjoy it. The actors are great, the costumes look like they were made by a kid in the 80's but the set pieces are so cliche and not in any way worth watching.   I wish they would have made a sequel to this and gone with a more interesting script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is a waste of time.  It takes up too much of your time trying to figure out what to do with these kids.  They are very young and should be playing in their homes doing their own thing.  The children do make some good friends but I didn't think they were the right age and I'm afraid that they will be forever stuck in this movie.  There are so many unanswered questions and none of them are solved.  What is the point of showing this movie to a kid and making him have to sit through a movie like this?   They all want to be heroes and not do what is asked of them.  I hate kids going into this movie because of how much of a bad experience it will be for them.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I was very disappointed in this movie, it was so bad and so boring, not even funny. The plot is lame and uninteresting and the actors are all so lame and don't have any charisma, even the lead. Even the cameraman has a lame face. All the jokes in the movie are stupid, no one jokes but the director so he can get some money for the movie. I don't think I want to see any more of this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I did see the trailer for this movie and was hoping to see a good movie.  I'm not really a big action movie buff or anything but this movie really sucked.  For a movie with a title like "Tomb Raider", you really couldn't go wrong with this film.  The only good thing about this movie was the action, I guess that's the best part of this movie. Unfortunately, the acting was terrible as well as the directing.  This movie should have been called "Death by Tomb Raider" or "Death at the Tunga Do".   This was a very strange movie and the best way to describe it is "cutesy action-hero movie".  It doesn't have any real action or a real storyline, just "Cutesy Action Hero Movie".  My only hope is that the studio sees this and decides to release a good action film in the future, but that's a big if.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was shot on film. No CGI or other special effects.   I'm a HUGE horror fan and have never seen a movie so bad that I couldn't go to sleep.  I am glad that I don't live in the Midwest where this crap can be seen on TV all the time.  The plot was totally unbelievable. There was a group of people (sons of bikers) that wanted to kill their father. The mother went to a psychic and told her to kill the son. The psychic told her the son was to be killed, but the mother had been told by another psychic to kill him, to keep him away from her son. This psychic was really cool.  To do that she said she had to use a knife and chop off his head. The next day the son got up and asked his mother why her dead mother wouldn't come back to her. His mother said that she was gone and that they were all missing.  After all this time, her husband came home to find all his stuff missing. He searched all over the house, but found nothing.  Another time, he was in a car crash and lost his son. A few months later, his son was found, alive and well. He called the psychic and asked her to tell his son he wasn't dead. He told her he had a son who was missing. The woman told him he had to talk to his son face to face. This guy was the most insane psychic I've ever seen.  A lot of the people who worked on this movie were the most messed up.  As I'm sure they all had PTSD, I don,t think it was the actors who did the best job of acting.  There were so many people who just got the part and I know that no one was happy.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I guess I'll go with that my wife was tired of all this nonsense and she was right. The acting was all over the place. The movie looked like it was shot on the same set as the movie "The Godfather" and there were a few scenes that just did not have the same feel as the others. The violence was excessive.   This movie is not worth the time it takes to watch it.  It's an entertaining, cheap thriller that is not good for kids or for anyone who doesn't enjoy seeing violence. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen all the Mummy movies. I can honestly say there is nothing to do but watch the whole thing again just to find out if there is any validity in the hype. It really is a terrible movie. The creature doesn't look like a mummy at all. It is a very poor imaged of the mummies. They should have gone to a real mummy, not just some picture they took. The action was not even good, at times the characters looked almost silly when they went over to the mummy. This should have been called the "Monkey Man", not "Mummy" because the mummy is a monkey. There is no tension in this film, no suspense. No monsters. Just a very weak horror film. If you are a fan of old monster movies and want to see a good monster movie, go back to the Mummies. It isn't a bad film by any means but it's not anything new.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I have seen this movie on many occasions and had never found it to be anything great. The actors are not even good, and the dialog is not all that good. I thought they were trying to make a western out of this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm not really into horror movies at all, but this was so much better than it's genre. It had an eerie vibe that was so well realized and creepy.   If you like the kind of films I like (cinematic and low budget) you'll like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie looks good, and its the actors who make the movie. However, its too long.    A bit slow.  They made it like 3 hours of talking about something that was never talked about.  I'm still waiting for the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    My husband and I just saw this film a few days ago, he's an 80 year old movie buff. I was surprised at the awful quality of this movie. The costumes look bad, the characters are all over the place and the acting is absolutely horrid. The worst part is that the kids in this movie are terrible too, they look like they were given a couple of days in an outfit store to pick from, no one seemed to care about their portrayal of the characters.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The movie is pretty bad. The special effects are terrible, and all of the characters look like they're wearing big teddy bears. It's not very good at all.   There's another movie called The Beast in my family, and I watched it, and it was much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is nothing good about this movie.  I wish I had never watched it.  It is all very slow and painful.  You do not learn anything about the people in the movie except for that they are all white, middle class, and have white hair.  There was nothing about race, no blacks, no Indians, no Asians, no mulattoes, no people of other races, not even any animals.  The characters all have the same character type: middle-aged white men who have all the money and live in mansions, who never get to have a life other than their own and have sex with women at any age.  If this movie was on TV, it would be one of the more popular shows on TV.  Why would they make a movie like this?  And why would anyone like it?  They must have watched a lot of pornos.    "The people were so poor that they lived in wooden houses and lived in the woods. There were even Indians in that part of New England. They also had a race of people who had skin like sheep, which they sold to tourists. All the people were white people. There was no black people in this country."   The movie has no plot and no explanation about anything. You just see a lot happen, and it is very painful to watch.  Some scenes are so stupid you just want to throw the screen away.  This movie was just the worst of all the movies I have seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It was like watching an old movie in slow motion.  There are scenes where I want to turn off the tape to just watch the scenes but I can't.  You watch it for a few minutes and then go and watch something else.  I really did not like this movie.  It is the worst one ever.  The acting is awful.  No one else is good.  This movie was made by a man with no talent.  If you like comedy in a bad way, you will like this.   …
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "What I like best about this movie are all the little things. For example, when the main character is on his way to a picnic with his son, they see a police car coming and the two characters stop, and the son gets out of the car and looks in the window at the cop. "Look at the big guy" - the officer says, and there he is, standing in the middle of the street with a rifle. "Now what do you want?" - the son asks. "You need to go" - comes the reply." "I'll be out in just a second" - says the officer. "No, I'll be back in a minute" - he says. The son takes off running to his friend's house. "I won't let him escape. We'll go through this again" - his father says, looking down the street. "We'll make him see his mistake" - yells the son."   I think the movie is so poorly made, that it is not worth seeing. The acting is all terrible and the editing is also awful.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   There is nothing special about the movie, but it's a very enjoyable time that I can't bring myself to watch all the way through, and even though it's so bad I still like the characters and the story.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   When I saw this movie in a local movie theater I had to sit in the front row to get the full experience, but when I finally saw it I was disappointed. The film was boring and too long. The main characters were not believable and the story was boring.    In the movie, the main character was a man who wants to join the army and be a sniper, and he meets the woman who was the sniper he has been dreaming about.  The two of them work together, they both have dreams about being special and can't see how the world can take away from that, but they both go after their dreams. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   If you can find the trailer, it has a very cool song about a dude named Mike who was raised in the mountains.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a bad horror/thriller.   I don't know what the director was thinking with this movie, but it had the most unoriginal and boring plot to it.  This movie had a very boring story to it with no plot whatsoever, just two people talking and then they go "finally..." or "this was our first time" and then there's some random, unexplained stuff that happens.  They go on this trip and then one by one they die, and then the other person is "killed"... and then "dead"... and the movie never explains anything... I just saw this movie for the sake of watching it... and I can't even call it scary or a bad film.  All in all, not a bad experience, but not a good film either.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only thing wrong about this movie is that the two actors never acted well together.   So you have two poor looking people talking in a foreign language, with no chemistry or chemistry at all.  Their acting is not good.  They have not aged well, either.  But it is an action movie, so you have to believe that they had the physical courage and skill to fight off the bad guys.  However, if you watch the movie from the beginning and do not watch it too many times, you will not realize that this is an old action movie from an earlier time.  It is about a hero (a real one, not a comic book guy) who goes to the war and has to find a way to stop the war.  This is a rare gem. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was just a disappointment.   The movie didn't even make sense.  The characters were dull.  No action, just a bunch of scenes of the characters talking to each other in a way that just made no sense.  I can understand a story about some kind of government conspiracy in the 1950s, but when it was done in the same way as in some other horror movies, it was just confusing and lame.  There was just too much unnecessary nonsense in this movie.  I'd give it a negative 2, but the special effects in this one were awful.  A great movie, but a little too long and confusing for my taste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    While I enjoyed this film, I don't see it being very interesting to watch.  I don?t see this being a very funny, entertaining or interesting film at all.  There are no real surprises, it?s just very formulaic and predictable.  If you don?ve seen any of the previous Harry Potter movies you?ll know exactly what to expect.   I had been planning on watching this film but ended up getting it just for the music.  It was pretty good and had a nice mix of humor and serious moments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If you're looking for a classic sci-fi comedy, this is it. But this is a bad one, and not in a good way.   It starts out in a standard way with a bunch of aliens making a big announcement to the humans that they want them to stay. When the humans are told they have a couple of days to make the decisions, the aliens decide to take over their leaders and take control of their planet, just so they can take it back from them.  They do a great job of getting the whole "we will do anything to get rid of our oppressors" idea across.  But the movie just fails to go any further than that, failing to give us anything more.  It is basically a "What if we went to the stars?" type of movie where the aliens go to an alien planet and they want to colonize.  And so they take over the whole planet.  There's nothing really wrong with this type of film, and I still enjoy it every once in a while.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't work here.  The acting is very bad.  I can't tell if it's just the director's fault or just the actors, but when the characters speak, they're really annoying.  These aliens never do a good job of making us feel like they're people we can know.  When they make their announcements, they never come across as humans, and they have all the wrong attitudes. They have a lot of the right attitudes, but the way they speak makes it almost impossible to understand them. The only other character who seems like he could really be human is the villain.  In the end, he does a really bad thing and does it very clearly.  Even though it's a bad film, it's still worth a watch because of how it tries to be as big a film as it can be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie with an extremely poor script. I was surprised they had a writer working for them who could come up with something so bad. The actors were not good, none of them. I am surprised the director was given the job. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This was a fun movie, but it got boring after a while.    It was a good idea, but the plot is just too hard to follow.  And for some reason, the "B" in the title is still there when it's all over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I never heard of this film, but I was surprised to find it in an old, faded DVD box with a picture of the actors in their uniforms and a caption about the film.   It doesn't hold up well at all.  It has a bad story that is told in an amateurish style.  Even the cast doesn't look that much like the film, there are a few things I don't like: 1. The film has a lot of cheesy scenes where the lead actress has to play all her scenes against the sound of a camera and then repeat it with the actor playing the lead.  They really don't look right.  2. The actress playing the love interest is not the best actress in the world.  3. There are some scenes with the other actors playing the other parts of the film and they are all really bad.  This is not a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The bad parts of this movie are a little overwhelming and out of place in the overall picture.   One scene has a guy who looks like Jodie Foster acting a little too excited about being in a new movie and there are moments where she appears too nervous for her lines and she should not have looked so nervous.  The other scenes where people act really nervous and weird are a turn off.  One thing I did not like about this movie was the way the movie ended.  There is a guy in a wheelchair who appears to be dead in a scene and he disappears into a bathroom as if he just died.  This is not a good end to the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I've seen a lot of terrible movies and had to laugh at this one. It made no sense and never kept me engaged. I think the producer was just having some fun and the cast was overacting. The plot is so incoherent and it's obvious that someone has written the script for no reason. If this movie was made by a real professional they would have realized it was a bad idea. It's like a child's picture book that someone is trying to make into a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is one of those films you don't need to see.   The story is one big fat fraud.  A poor guy was hired to build a dam. He was very good at it, he knew everything about the geography of the area, he got the site just the right size, he made it look very good. Then a dam was built next to his dam. When he was finished, he noticed that there was an old lake in the area.  It was so old that the water level had gone down, so he had to rebuild the dam to keep it from filling up and destroying the old lake.  The dam he built is actually more than one building on top of each other, so when the water starts to go up and the dam starts to fall, he has to rebuild everything on top.  In the middle of all this, a big storm comes and blows up the dam and the lake, so all he can do is hold up the old dam as best he can, until it is time to start the new dam.  He never even goes into the old building to start that dam, and when the dam finally starts to fill up, he is the only one who survives.  Why did he do it?  It never was in the script.  I have seen many movies with a lot of hype and this was one of them.  There is no way this movie is a realistic depiction of what happened.  So, I have no idea why they put this movie on TV.  They should have shown the real dam in person, it would have been much better.  Another poor decision they made was to use black and white photos instead of color photos.  This could have been avoided if they had just taken color photos instead.  My rating is 3/5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't even watch horror movies anymore. I watch this and cringe every time I watch it, it's disgusting and I don not want to see another "horror movie" about a serial killer!    *spits on the floor* 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a nice experience but a shame it didn't work out. I found it quite boring and pointless.   I liked the film, and I enjoyed the actors, but it seemed to me that it was made to sell a series of books and was just trying to fill time for the book sales. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The first film was a horrible film, full of overacting and terrible acting. This sequel (which has the same cast) is even worse. The only thing good in this film is the cinematography and the music. The acting in this sequel is pathetic and the plot is even more of a rip-off from the first film.   It's a shame to see such terrible films in the summer, and hopefully the original film will get a DVD release one day.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The director needs to learn to read the lines he gives.   What he says doesn't come out right every time.  The other actors do a pretty good job.  There are many funny parts in this movie, but they are all overshadowed by the rest of the film.  This movie is not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I know it seems like a waste of time and energy to watch this movie because it is so bad, but you should at least watch it so you can appreciate the talent of the actors.  The most embarrassing part of this movie is when a girl has to do a sexy dance and she doesn't even do the moves well. I always think it is hilarious when girls do not do the sexy moves right.  And there are a couple of things that are not well done or the way the camera is used. I think some of it is due to the age of the people involved in this movie, but that is not really an excuse for a bad film to be made.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending of this film is absolutely horrible.   My only thought after the final cut is "wow! How does this happen?!"   I really wish I had seen this film when I was younger so I could appreciate its charm and uniqueness. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The film is very confusing and is probably the worst of the 3, I can't think of anything to say about it.   It seems the actors got paid way too much, the actors who are in it don't seem to be from the same part so they don't know how to act.    I hope they do better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have to give this one a negative because it has everything you could want in a movie, but that is just a bad thing. It is not a good movie in any way. The acting is weak, the acting is pretty bad. The action is dull, the characters are weak, and the plot is pretty boring. I guess you could make a good one out of it, but I could not watch that one even if I were paid millions of dollars to see it, because there is just not a lot to do in it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:      I saw this movie once years ago, and the whole thing felt as though it was put together without any thought or attention to detail. I'd never heard of the character who played this part before, I knew nothing about the plot or what was going to happen, and I had no idea how many scenes there would be. I was also told it was to be filmed in Canada, but that wasn't true either.   I can only imagine what a nightmare to get cast in such a crappy film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I bought this on the recommendation of my buddy, who also saw it and loved it, and this was an entertaining movie with a lot of charm. It is funny, but not terribly so. It has its own flavor and has great acting and writing. It takes a bit to get going but the plot keeps things moving along and the pacing is wonderful.   The acting is a bit cheesy, and the film makes several references to the previous films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a terrible movie that has little to do with my interests. It's like somebody took the best part of the original Star Wars and added some terrible effects and it ends up terrible.  The story was awful.  For a start the villains were horrible looking and their names were awful too.  But worst of all was the fact that you never get any of the characters names.  I think some of the people who gave this movie a good review just meant they were fans of the old movies and wanted the characters to look similar to the original ones and didn't realise the original characters had names. The original characters have real names like Luke, Leia, Obi-Wan, C-3P0 and Han.   It was just sad that a bunch of people who only liked the originals and didn''t bother to watch the other movies really enjoyed this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I have seen this movie about ten times, and it's a good one.   This is a nice movie to watch with a few friends.  It's like a romantic movie in which the main character is a dog.  I liked the dogs character because he didn't seem to care about the other dogs in the movie.  The only problem is that it never gets old. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought it was ok for a quick movie, but the acting and directing were horrible. The cast was in terrible shape. They were all very tired. Some had makeup problems. Most of the acting was bad, no real chemistry between the characters. The only good thing was that the story was good. I think a movie like this is not supposed to be good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This is a poorly made movie, the acting is sub-par, the story doesn't hold together, and the story is a total mess.     It takes place in a dystopian future where people are kept in glass houses and can't leave or see the outside.  One guy who is given a brain transplant gets stuck inside a glass house with only his cat as company.  The plot has nothing to it, the character development is really lacking, and it's not a fun watch.    
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was great, until the very end. The movie is about a guy who gets killed in a car accident and is going to be buried alive. But he is rescued by a woman and she tells him to tell his story, that is what I liked about this movie, that a man survived this horrible tragedy, and did tell the story of what happened. Unfortunately he doesn't know anything and just talks about everything that happens. The acting was amazing and the movie was really scary and tense.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I'm very glad I watched this movie, for me, it's very funny, however it's really bad, and very hard to watch. The script is terrible, the acting is terrible and the acting can't even compare to the worst acting in the movies, that's why this movie has no purpose, it was just bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I loved this movie but the acting is terrible. I mean they had no chemistry or anything, it was just bad.   The only thing is the movie was really good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's not a bad film at all, but if you like anything that has a plot (and I know I do), this is not it.   There is really not much plot, just the usual stuff you've seen in all the action films, and this time there's not really any real danger.  This is the one time I couldn't get excited about this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The problem is that this movie has no plot. The whole time you think the movie is going to have a great plot, but the movie never does. And by the time the movie gets to the part where the kids find out that someone is hiding in their house, you've already forgotten all about the movie.   It was like watching someone play a video game in a movie. This movie has so much potential but so many plot holes that are completely ignored, and some that aren't even mentioned at all.  The biggest problem I have is that the director is a complete idiot. The reason why he made the movie was to be released on DVD because he got caught by the MPAA for his "disturbing" movie. That excuse is bullshit. It's an 8.5 because the movie doesn't have a plot and it shows this by its title. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie. No matter how much the producer tried to create a "cool" action movie, the story is extremely stupid. It's a simple story about a kid who is sent to a "special class" at school, and then is tricked into being trained by an old man, who is using the kids in order to find a cure for the deadly disease. This film is a complete failure.   It's hard to believe that someone had the good sense to make this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If I had never heard of or seen this movie, it would have been a complete disappointment. The music was terrible and the acting was bad.   At least the actors were great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I saw this on a DVD. I got it for $10 and I will never go back to the DVD. It's one of those movies that just doesn't have anything good in it. I was really disappointed because it was on a decent budget. I mean, the director wanted to make a "thriller" but he only spent like, a $1000. There is no suspense, no action, and you will never be satisfied with the end. It was just a movie that you could pass by at the mall and not give it a second look.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    One of the most painful things I have ever experienced.  The only reason I didn't pass out is that the actors were amazing.  I would have quit my job and gone home if this hadn't happened.  This is the worst thing I've ever seen.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is terrible. Its about a rich guy who has sex with an underaged girl to make her rich.   The guy is really bad, and there's no reason why he would let the girl sleep with him. They have a lot of sex, and then the girl gets really sick (she ends up dead).   He has a kid, and is really a douchebag. The kid is also really bad in the movie, but the movie makes him into a real character.  He does everything his dad would do, and he goes on and on about how much he loves his dad. The movie really only cares about the rich guy, but he's not really a rich person. He's just this rich dude, and the girl's dad is making a profit.  The girl's mom, meanwhile, is doing some really horrible things, so she needs to take over for her dad.   It's really stupid, and nothing good happens. It's a bad remake of a good movie, and it looks like it was shot in an 80s high school, not a good 80s movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie was not great but it did have great performances.   If you want a fun movie this is not it but I can say for the fact that it did get a good reaction from the critics.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm a long time fan of "Die Hard", and this movie just kills the franchise for me. Not only does this movie take the fun out of the movie, it also takes the fun away from the source material, as it has no heart. When it comes to the story, you have the usual "heist" in a world without government, and it turns into a really slow trainwreck, as none of the characters have any sort of plot. You have one "douche" character, and that is why you really love the movie. The plot was just so poorly written, and so poorly planned out, that it just doesn't make any sense at all. Not to mention, the characters are very cliché, and the writing isn't very good either. It was all just done for the sake of it, and really isn't that great.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    Like this movie, but not great. I have seen the first "Buster" movie, and it was an alright movie. The first one was much better, but the sequel was a dud.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie does not live up to its name, it is horrible, and not worth watching.  It is based on a book by Mark Hamill which is the same one that starred the legendary Harrison Ford in the "Star Wars" movies, however the story is just the same, a man falls asleep in his own house, and after getting out of bed, he takes the first car he sees, an old car, and is driving into the desert when he gets hit by a car.   There is no blood in the movie, the character's bodies are all made of wood and wood is just not meant to bleed.  The dialogue is awful, there are no good characters, it takes place in a small town and the bad guy is never given enough screen time, he is just there for no reason.  Even the main character, who is a nice guy, gets killed, and in his last words, he says, "I hope you die alone", which is a pretty good joke.  You will just hate this movie, it's only 13 minutes, and it's terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I saw this movie when I was a teenager. I remember seeing it in the theaters with my family. It was terrible! My brother and I cried the whole time. It makes me angry to see it on TV again.   The movie is awful! The acting was so bad and so cheesy. There were no scenes that made any sense. The acting seemed fake. The scenes are supposed to be taking place during the Civil War in 1861. The "heroes" (who are obviously not really heroes) were the soldiers and the "villains" were the Confederate soldiers. This movie makes it look as if the South was actually winning.  What was going on in the North?    There were other Civil War movies, but this movie was not good.  The scenes of violence and death were unbelievable!   What is so bad about watching history on TV?  I'm tired of hearing about the Civil Wars! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The only bad part about this movie is the dialogue that they try to make. All the good parts are lost.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I enjoyed "The Devil and Daniel Webster" (the title is not really correct) and the special effects were good enough. However, the rest of the film was an utter bore. There was nothing good about it, except for the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is the worst I have ever seen. It really needs an edit and that would be the only way to make this movie good. The acting is terrible, but it's the story not the acting that makes this movie a waste of time.   The film really is terrible. You get one of these movies every decade and you know what to expect. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I liked this movie a lot. It was a good movie.   It was good in its own way, but I don't think it was really good.     The whole movie seemed pretty much in one direction.  This movie wasn't good, but it wasn't bad.  I got the impression that the director had a great sense of humor and made a really funny film.  If you like humor, you should go see this movie.    What did you like or not like about this movie?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I don't care for this movie at all, not because of it's plot but for the way the director and actor act. There are several scenes with the two lead actors acting in the same manner and it really is like watching a 2nd grader doing this stuff.    The only way I enjoyed the movie was the way it was shot. There were many scenes where the actors just stand there looking very much bored and annoyed with each other, then the movie will cut to a new scene with them back in character. The same is true for all the actors.  They were all acting like they were being filmed for a porno. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A poor excuse for an action movie that never gets any action, and for the most part the only action that occurs is the bad guy killing himself. If you are a fan of Bruce Lee, then you will love this movie. But if you are not a fan, then do not watch this movie! - September 26, 2016I hate this movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So the only thing I'm going to talk about here is how stupid this movie is and that it's got nothing to do with the books. The movie tries to add drama and excitement to the film by giving it a more dark tone. However, it never even manages to deliver the right tone that they went for in the books and it's just an excuse for them to get some more money for more actors. The main problem is that the characters are all flat and the characters that are in the book are all just played better in this movie. There is one character that gets played off so well that it just becomes a boring part in the movie. The one thing that I did like about the movie was that there was some scenes that were shot at night and the scenes were very dark and creepy. If you're looking for a good horror movie, this one is definitely worth your time.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie was an excellent comedy. It was funny and entertaining and had the "cute" factor down, but it lacked some things that made some other comedies (The Golden Girls, for example) so much more enjoyable. It also lacked something that I found quite important and that is the characters.  I thought that the cast of characters were all very well developed, but not really given enough of a chance to grow and evolve.  For a movie where only a couple characters have any significant screen time, they really needed to grow up.   The story didn't feel all that original. It's not that it wasn't original, just that it was a little too familiar.  I'm sure that the director had something very good in mind, but I doubt that it made the film better in my eyes.  It was also the wrong time to be making a movie about a family, even a very good one, but the time for such a film was long gone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie just has a bad ending. I will watch it again just to get over the disappointment, but I will never watch it ever again. It was so bad I'm not even going to mention it. It really sucked. I've never been disappointed by a horror movie, but this one took the cake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It was a terrible film, as was most of the movie "Troll 2" (I never saw that one, so this is my first look at that one.) The cast was a mess, the director was trying to make it sound like a horror flick, the actors didn't seem to care at all and the whole thing was so bad that I had to throw it on the trash and not watch it again. I don't know how any "fan" could take it seriously, but the movie was bad, so they should have stopped at the beginning and cut it out, not waste the entire movie (a couple of hours) with so many errors that were made. And now that the movie is out in the world, I don"t really care if it turns out to be good or not, because I have seen it in the theaters and can"t say the same about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie is a piece of crap that is the worst film I've seen since the last time I went to see a Roger Corman movie. It is completely made-up for a B-movie and it is only funny because of the acting. It's a disgrace that a film about zombies was filmed in a real town in New Mexico, even if it was supposed to be the movie "Zombie Town".   All the acting is horrendous. No one ever talks about a story, or even thinks. Just mumbles to each other.   I think that this movie is just for the sake of having a cheap B-Movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is a very low budget film about a girl, who has no friends and can't make up her mind what to do, when she finds a dog in her parents backyard. This poor girl gets a puppy and, in the next few days, starts to get a little jealous of her new friend. She begins to go out and steal the puppy, but one day finds the puppy in her house. She is afraid of her dog, so she lets the dog get away. She ends up in jail and decides to turn herself in, and claims the dog stole the puppy. But, after being questioned by the police, she admits she was trying to kill her dog so that she would get the puppy back. So, the puppy ends up going to live with a local girl and they end up living together.   The film is really shot in a low budget manner. Most of the film takes place at a hotel. It has no charm and just doesn't have any sense of adventure or humor.  There are no special effects, and you will not be able to see anything if you look closely enough.  The special effects were really cheesy and cheap.  It is pretty hard to watch this movie, and even when the film was really fun, it was just kind of depressing.  I didn't even get the ending, and I was really upset when I realized the film never really ended. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story behind this movie is interesting, but it didn't pay off. It was very boring and just a bunch of people in the woods. I would never see this movie again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought this movie was interesting, I guess. The action in this movie seems very realistic. The only problem is that the lead character was just stupid and I found out that the movie is not very realistic, it was just too far out there. But then again, the guy was supposed to be a super hero. If he were a real hero, he would have died at the end.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I am very disappointed by this movie.   I watched this for the first time today and I am very impressed by the movie. It is a movie about two men who go on a crime spree, rob banks, and kill people.  They shoot people at night on the beach and go to other places that are usually very quiet.  There are people in the movie that look like actors.  I was so disappointed in this movie because the only two things I enjoyed about this movie were the sound of guns and the soundtrack.  This movie is a really slow paced movie, but I really enjoyed the sound effects and the music.  The acting was not very good but they did a good job for the movie and it made the movie worth watching.  " This movie was about two people who go out on a road trip.  One of the guys is in a car wreck and he is taken to the hospital.  We see him in the hospital and he seems to have a lot of fun.  As we follow him we see some pretty cool stuff including a boat crash on the way to an island.  When they get to an uninhabited island a girl comes along with them and they have sex.  Then we get to see the aftermath of their trip.    This was definitely worth the watch because it had the right stuff in it.  So why was this movie so bad.  Maybe the actors looked real because they were good in the movies.  It was also shot in a very dark way and you had to stay on the edge of your seat because it was so dark.  Another thing I don't like about this is that there are no guns used, no cars crashed, no fights.  At the end of the movie we go back to the beach where the two guys are talking about how they're going to go to Florida with the girl.  What made the guy look so real was the way he was acting and the way they acted together.  But it really was the sound and music that made this movie worth a watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    "The first film on the list I ever saw. My father took me to see it when I was young. I remember being really scared when the giant monster first appeared in the movie. The first movie I remember seeing as a child was the "Monster from the Black Lagoon". The "Godzilla" movies were a big deal. I watched the original "Godzillaw" over 20 times when I had to go to a nursing home. This film is NOT the same at all. The original "Monster from the black lagoon" was fantastic. This is pretty good. But it is not the same movie at all."
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So the last time I saw this movie I was pretty bummed out, not because I don't love horror movies, just they don't seem to get better with age. I really wanted to like this film, but after watching it once more I couldn't stand it.   It's all kind of unoriginal, and just an excuse to make a scary movie about vampires with a lot of blood and guts and some creepy old guy who likes to play his violin.  This movie doesn't have much horror at all.  I'm not sure why they thought that this would work but it didn't.  If you're in the mood for a vampire movie you can find a lot worse ones out there but this just doesn't even deserve an award for the amount of money it cost to make it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    If there is anything that i regret watching out of my first 2 choices. it is this movie and i feel it is really cheap. i think it was a very poor decision to make a movie about a war so expensive but never had been done. it felt like it was made for an action movie. also, the director of the film was not a very good one. it was very obvious that he was not in this to make something that would appeal to people. so much of this movie was made up. and it was really disapointing that it wasnt made into a movie like "Saving Private Ryan". and i cant say it was good, but it was just too bad to watch. it could have been a good movie and at least made it look like something special. but it never was. so i was never really impressed and i think its worth at least looking at on tv.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    It's like watching the movie "Cape Fear" minus the comedy and minus the gore and minus all of the good stuff about the story and the performances and the acting and the sound and the music.   I think that it's too long and too boring.  It is too long, in fact, to get your teeth into the story or the characters or even the suspense or the fight scenes or the acting.  I know that this is supposed to be a "B-movie" but they just can't get that right, and I'm glad they didn't try it because it would have just been awful.  The editing is terrible, which is even worse than the story.  And the actors are all in their 70's and 80's, and the special effects are terrible (although I have seen far worse).  This movie has to be on a "Watch not Rent" list, at least for that reason alone.  (This review was originally published in February of 2010)
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This film is like the third act of a bad comic book movie. The comic book heroes fight against the police and then they fight the police but the last scene shows them coming back for more.  This is a movie for the people that love the bad Batman movies but are afraid to see one of the bad Christopher Nolan Batman movies.  If you like the original Dark Knight trilogy and want a bad Batman movie, this is for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was too unbelievable for me. It wasn't very good either.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This movie was not worth the $5-8 it cost to see.   The cast was in terrible shape.  They did not do anything special in this movie, and the whole time it felt like a movie that would have cost more to make.  The actors had the acting down pat, but the scenery and action scenes were terrible.  If you're going to see a good action movie, watch the first "Rambo" movie.  It has better camera work and sets.  This would have been a good movie for a kid to watch, but not a good one to see as an adult. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is nothing but a waste of my time. The acting, the writing and the acting of the leads all feel like they are trying to be funny or something but nothing is happening and they all seem bored.   The story is horrible. There is not one scene that feels true. There are scenes that make no sense.  In the end, I saw it for the plot of it and it never made sense. I was just laughing at it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I would not recommend this movie to anyone who does not like to see bad movies.   This movie is bad even for the low budget type.  The plot is totally ridiculous and the acting is awful.  A good example of why bad movies like this are made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I thought the first half was alright, but then the second half completely destroyed my suspension of disbelief.   After watching the film I realized that I was watching some old bad film.  I know that there are movies that I would not want to see again, but I don't think this is one of them.  The story was so silly and unbelievable that I couldn't take it seriously.  It was like the director was watching the wrong film and forgot to correct the bad dialogue.  This is a film that will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth and a very bad image of an old western. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I really enjoy the first half of this movie but the second half leaves a lot to be desired. I found it annoying that it would go to the beach every time but it would always end up with us coming home to the same beach. They never stopped trying to make it exciting in the second part but I guess they didn't care to make a better one or something.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I'm sorry but the movie sucks. The script was terrible and the actors were not in good shape. The director made a film that was very well done with good actors and great direction but that was it. The movie was boring and boring as usual.    The only good thing about the movie is that the first half was really good but the second half sucked.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I love horror, but this movie is a total mess. The acting was terrible. The movie was rushed, the editing was horrible and the acting was poor. It made the whole thing even more disgusting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't understand what the point of this movie was. I think that a movie like this is never going to become a blockbuster, but for some reason they decided to try and make this into one. This movie is a mess of a movie.   In this movie there is a man that comes home from work one night and he is attacked by a werewolf.  This werewolf is very good looking, and has amazing teeth and claws. There is a bit of blood on the floor in the background, and there is also a piece of the werewolf's hair in his hand.  However this werewolf doesn't attack the man and then go into the bathroom. It never makes any moves to kill him.  Instead it is very kind and says, "You are lucky I am not a woman." and goes away.  Then it takes a shower with him in it. This doesn't work out well for the man though.  First he thinks that he might be a boy, but then he realizes he really is a woman. Then he has a huge erection, and the werewolves hair is all over it.  Now he is scared and in a state of shock. He also thinks that the were wolves are coming back.  After this is all said and done, he doesn't know why he is in a cage and what is going to happen next.  I really don't see how they could have even made this movie as a blockbuster. I saw it as a teen horror movie.     If you want to see something good on the horror genre, this movie is worth a watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I've seen a few bad films. I never liked them. But this movie, I guess you can say,    I was totally hooked by it. The first 2-3 minutes of the film, I couldn't take it anymore and I ran to the theater right there, with a bottle of scotch. But the rest I enjoyed quite a bit.   This movie was made by a Hollywood director, with all the stars of the 1950's to look like they were made in the 1930's.  And the acting was unbelievable. The best and funniest part was, that the whole movie, with the most terrible people in the world, were all fighting in a room together.  It was great.  This was a great movie for any age group.  A wonderful time was had by all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I had been to a horror flick that I enjoyed called "A Gory World" a few years ago. It was shot at a cemetery and was good for a laugh or two. I saw this movie about 10 years ago at a bar where I was drinking with some friends. It had me laughing throughout. But I was never really in the right mood for a horror film. The whole movie felt like it was made by someone who has seen too many movies and doesn't want to put his or her name on something that doesn't mean something to him or her. The actors were all acting like idiots. It just kept getting worse and worse.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   I think I'll have to go to the movies once a week to see if there are any "good" movies.   This movie is just the latest in a long line of crap films from the producers of such movies as "The Godfather," "The Big Lebowski," "Lethal Weapon," and "Pretty Woman."   It's a shame that people are willing to spend over a half hour to get a "joke" that doesn't really work.  The movie starts out with a really lame scene that doesn�t work. At first, I thought, �hey, this looks like a real story about a guy trying to get out of a murder case!� But the movie quickly lost all credibility with a scene in which a guy tries to jump in the lake at the end of a dead end street. He gets into the water with a shark in it.  This shark has a little boy in its mouth.  I was laughing my ass off but, I'm sure that many others weren't.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This movie is about a man that was a junkie and had a daughter.  He was addicted to cocaine and drank too much.   When he finally got clean he thought that he wanted to have a family.  But he had a wife that was sick and it was time for her to go.  So, he came to Los Angeles and took the girlfriend he had at the time.  They had a child, a daughter, and she died.  The baby came back but the father couldn't deal with it and went crazy.  Eventually, he murdered the daughter and killed himself.  And that is where he and the daughter start to become friends again.  I never really understood why the girl wanted to see him.  She must have been insane.  There was no reason for him to kill her.  This was a pretty bad movie.  Not my favorite film from the 80s. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A lot of the jokes aren't funny and the dialogue is annoying as hell.   The plot is a pile of shit and it doesn't even get started in the first act, even though there are some decent jokes in it.  I found that the whole movie was just a series of bad jokes that would never be funny.  All the jokes were just so bad.  It has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I didn't hate this movie, but it was very poorly put together. The actors seemed to be having fun but they seemed to not have enough time to really go for it. They were just there to shoot the scene and then they just left. I really wish the director had done more. I have to give it a C.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie started off good, with a great performance from the main star. The only thing that got old quickly was the plot, the only reason it was good was because of the acting.   After all, who would expect a kid to have an idea of how to be a terrorist?   I can't wait to see the next film that tries to sell this kind of story, so long as it is done right.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The story line was rather interesting, I really liked the fact that it was about the world of film noir. The actors were great, and the story was entertaining. However, it was hard for me to enjoy the movie. It just had me in a state of mind to just walk out. I did not enjoy any of the characters, except for one. I found it hard to enjoy, that is until I realized that it could have been a perfect movie if the actors had been given more time to play the characters.   I would not recommend this movie to anyone because of how terrible it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    You see the same things over and over again on screen, like the same old guy on screen is having the same argument. I guess he wants to look like an expert, or someone he thinks he knows something about, and thinks that no one will believe him. That's about the only thing that works about this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A terrible movie that has nothing good to say. No plot, no good dialog and no humor.   Just watch this crappy movie and laugh at all of it. It's a terrible movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   This is an overrated piece of garbage.   If you go into this movie expecting a fun action film then you are very very disappointed.  The story, plot and pacing are all poor.  They tried to use a little bit of fun in the beginning of the film but didn't really succeed.  These were poorly written characters and poorly written dialogs.  This was clearly meant for a kids movie.  Don't waste your time with this.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   It's really hard to rate a bad film.  You've got two of the best bad movies ever made, and yet the film doesn't really seem to be trying.  The only thing good in it is the dialogue.  That is why you want to see these films, to hear people talking.  As a whole, this is a sad film with all kinds of awful acting and special effects.   If you want a real bad film, watch it with your friend who knows how to take a good movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I really enjoyed this movie, but it's not good. The acting is terrible. The music is awful, and I never understood what they were trying to do with it. It's like they were watching a movie that was filmed in the 1940's with no sound, but they used old films to create it. There are a lot of bad actors in this movie. It just doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I hate the word "horrible". This is not a bad film. It is a movie. There are scenes where you can tell they tried their best and did their best but it does not work. The story is ok and I liked the characters. But I thought this was just another poor attempt by the directors to put together a movie and put some heart into it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    So the bad movie that you were hoping to find out that the bad actors are bad actors because they don't know how to act or what actors they are supposed to be and their lines are bad and the bad movies that are being made with great actors like Robert Redford or Gary Sinise or even Christopher Walken don't work because they are not funny or touching or anything but this one just got off on the wrong foot.   What is this movie about   The character is called James who is a former CIA agent who is sent out to find the one who killed his best friend, David.  The problem with this movie is that this is all over the place and the story changes every now and then and I never really understood why the movie was going on like that, not to mention that this character is supposed to die and never comes back to life.  What you don't understand   This movie is a sequel to a movie that came out in 1980 and this is a bad remake.  You can tell that they are trying to get away with it but they don' t have the budget to do it justice and they can't even do a good job on the movie.  It also has the most boring characters of anyone else made this year. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I was a little skeptical to try this movie, but I went in for a little comedy, and found myself actually laughing at some of the jokes. It's just plain weird and strange. At times it feels like it's in a movie from the 70's, but at other times it has all the feel of a bad 80's movie. That said, if you're into it, you'll enjoy it for what it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    This film was made in the 1930's and was about a young man who comes back to his father's house and gets drunk. After he leaves the house he is attacked by a bunch of kids and they rape him and stab him.  He wakes up to find himself in a mental hospital.  The story was very silly, but there were no surprises in this one.  There were some good shots in the film, but not a lot.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The "Bad" movies are the ones that are really hard to watch, they have some weird moments and make you think what's really going on here, these are usually pretty boring.   I was looking forward to this movie, I've been looking for a good "B" movie to watch and I think this might be it, it was pretty bad, and that's my only complaint. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The actors have so much fun. The movie is full of ridiculous stuff.   No one really gets what is going on, but it is well made. The plot is not worth talking about, the movie is about the characters. The actors really give a great performance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The movie is a bad remake of a very good movie. I had no idea that the original was so good, and the movie does not do anything to show that this is a good movie either. It is just a mediocre adaptation. The plot makes no sense at all and it is hard to follow and understand anything. The actors don't seem to be having fun and it appears that they are all just doing it for the money.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    The ending was terrible. I liked the story, but there was too much blood and too many characters who were barely in the movie. The film is not good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   A dull movie that I never would have watched had it not been made. The cast is all bad. The only good one is Dann Florek but his performance is so forced it is laughable. They need to stop making movies that are as corny as this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The plot was interesting and the director did a good job, but in the end it was really bad.   I mean, it was so bad that I think the whole production crew would be fired if they ever saw it.  They just had to change everything because they were so afraid of being caught for making a poor movie.  But they succeeded and made a $400,000 movie. It was not that bad. I know that you cannot make a good movie for $400k, so maybe the whole crew was just afraid that the whole thing would be taken away from them.  I did not like this movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:   The only thing this movie is worth watching is if you are interested in the early years of the Second World War, as there are some interesting stories in it, but the story is mostly about a young girl named Marlene Dietrich, who lived in the United States with her mother and stepfather and got a job as a maid. She meets a couple of German sailors who are staying in her room, and they end up getting married to one of them. In the end, Marlene is separated from the sailor who has a girlfriend in France, and she falls into an affair with a man named Max Schreck who was in the navy during the war. It turns out that he has a very sadistic personality, and he kills everyone he meets. Marlene ends up going with Max to the coast of France, where they end their lives.  The only good thing I can say about this movie, is that it has an amazing soundtrack, which gives it a bit of a historical feel.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    I don't care if the movie was terrible or not, as long as it was bad it shouldn't have even been made.  I found this movie to be a little better than some others I've seen, but there were still too many problems to be of any use to me, and the plot is really dumb.  The writing of the script is pretty bad and is the reason why I think the film was made as a joke.   The only thing I remember about this movie is the opening of the movie, which I found to be terrible.  It has such bad acting and is so bad, that it almost gives the wrong impression about the film itself.  There is no plot development in this movie.  Every character is a complete idiot.  Even the good guys are complete idiots, who can't even use a weapon.  In the beginning of the film a woman is raped and in the end of the rape the woman kills her rapist.  Then the film tries to make the guy look like a rapist by making him look like the girl is really mad about the rape and has had the rapist dead for weeks and months.  This movie should have been called "The Rapist Has Sex with Her Daughter".   So much of this movie was dumb, and stupid, and all I can say is that this film is one of the worst I have ever seen, and I've watched some pretty bad movies in my time.  If you are looking for a good movie with a bad acting cast, and you are really looking for something to laugh at, look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    A bad movie.  The movie itself is good. A good story to tell and a good plot. However, it seems like the actors in this movie don't really care about their character's stories and are only interested in making money for themselves. The main problem I have with this movie is that the characters are boring to watch.  A story is great.  This is a movie that is just not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:    - A boring, yet predictable, movie that did not make the audience like it.   A "buncha wazas"
