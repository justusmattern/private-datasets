Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I own 3 different brands of mp3 players and I've purchased all of them.  I've always been annoyed that the player would not save my favorite songs from previous play throughs.  This is a very good player and is much more durable than the last two I've owned.  It is especially good for compact mp3 player users.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using my iRiver for about 8 months now.  It works well, it charges fast, and it's very easy to use and maintain.   You don't need to buy a new charger or anything.  You simply plug in, plug in some USB cables, and use the included AC adapters (they're pretty inexpensive).  I have the USB port at the bottom of my desk, so I simply plug it in there.  I can run my computer (in "Standby" mode) and the iRiver at the same time.  So far, I like it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use my iPod with the Bose audio system for my car. I was looking for a solution for the way the audio from the iPod was muffling my system and causing the audio quality to suffer.  The Bose system is great for the price, but the volume control is very small and hard to reach and use.  With the BOSE system, I can adjust the volume with one hand while the other holds the iPod with both hands.  It's great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Sony VTC5 was a great investment. I've always felt that the only problem with all the digital cameras is that there's no way to recover an image after it's been taken. That's true with every camera. The VTC has built-in storage, making it easy to copy images after you take them, and you can also shoot RAW images. Also, the camera is small enough that it's not the end of the world if you lose or damage it.

The Audio-technica is a great value, it plays my DVD and CDs with excellent sound and is pretty quiet for a player in this price range. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This thing is awesome! The build quality, ease of use, and features are perfect!  I use a Macbook Pro and I am used to the built-in flash but this is so much more!  It also includes an SD card so I can download music without the need to buy CDs.  I also bought the 4GB and 64GB cards because I will use my computer for multiple purposes at the same time.

The first time, I used it to connect my audio system to a computer and a computer speaker system. This cable was much more than just that. It was able to transfer my music from computer to computer with excellent sound. If I wanted to upgrade the sound of my sound system, I'd definitely get this cable.

The ability to store photos, music, and videos on the SD card is incredible, and it is a joy to boot up and use.  It is so small that the only thing holding it back is my small laptop, which I am so glad I finally got over.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was very impressed by the ability of the Sony to take high-quality pictures. I use this camera all the time, and have done so for years.  The only time I have had any problems is with the lens cap. The cap is very thin, and I always have to remove it when taking a picture. But it was no big deal when the picture came out, and the quality is much better now that I can see it in real time. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The best thing about this iPod is the fact that I can now listen to music at any time. I bought this iPod at Best Buy when the price was 30 bucks, and I love it.  The iPod will play just about any music that I have, including some that I had bought as a bonus for a friend's computer.  It also has an internal battery that lasts for up to three days.

I don't know if this device is much better, but I am much more comfortable using it in 2011. I can move files and browse my files in a program that is much easier to read. I am sure that the new versions of Windows will improve the experience, but at least now I know what I am getting.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this unit thinking that it was the ideal way to take a digital photograph, but I was surprised to find out that I can use this on my digital camera too, at least for a few pictures, and even the camera itself.  This device is very quiet, it takes excellent pictures, it has a nice built-in flash, it does all the "heavy lifting" of taking a picture for me.  I'm able to use the flash even when I don't need it and get a better picture.   It's a good idea to save the pictures on your hard drive so that you can go back to them later. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is by far the best audio/video recorder I've ever had, not only because it's a great piece of technology but also because I've tried every single brand of portable audio and video recorder I could find.   It's the first to do it all.  I also love the included battery and USB connection, which makes the whole device a breeze to move around the studio. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am extremely pleased with my first digital camera (a Nikon D90). It takes amazing pictures (even at night!), is very light and easy to carry, and has many great features. The only problem is the price tag. The price of the camera (and the lens) is very reasonable, but the quality is only mediocre. I think a camera that takes decent pictures should cost about twice as much. I have also been using the camera for many months now. It has performed perfectly.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The device itself is very good. The fact that I can use it from one computer to the next without losing my settings is nice.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This headphone amp does what it claims to do: produces amazing dynamic and detail-rich sound. While I don't think that any amp can do this, I do think that this amp is pretty darn close. When I'm using my Sony MDR-V6, I always hear a slight hint of distortion and noise in the bass. However, this headphone amp has no such artifacts. All bass is accurate and well-mixed.

I've had several CD players in my time, and this one seems to be better in every way. The sound quality is great. It's very reliable. I can plug it into any USB port and it will play just fine. I just don't need the CD quality that the iPod has. And it's much, much cheaper than the iPod.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this for use with my Panasonic DV7200 digital video camera.  I have been shooting my own movies for the last 4 or 5 years on the Panasonic GH3 and GH4 cameras.  The GH3 is great, but when it comes to shooting in 4K or full 1080 HD, it is more than a little laggy.  But the GH4 is just too big for my needs and the GH3 still handles my shots well.    The G5 solves all of my problems.  It's small enough to fit into a pocket and is lightweight enough that it doesn't slow down my GH4.  A great little piece of kit for home movies. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my first iPod and it's great! I have used a lot of different mp3 players but I can't say I've ever been very happy with any.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was very pleased with the performance of my new Digi 10 USB memory device, which came in the mail just the day before I bought a new computer (as in it would arrive by the first week of December). The device works well, is easy to set up and use, is very compact, and is quite reliable. The only real downside is that it doesn't support high-speed SD cards, which is a big deal for me since I don't have any SD cards in my PC and the only other card reader that I use is a cheapie that only reads SD cards at 16MB/s.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased a couple of these to use as an external hard drive.  They work great, but they are a bit heavy and can get in the way when trying to use them in an enclosure.  The SD card reader is the only negative.  I use an external USB thumb drive with my portable DVD burner, and sometimes I can't find it on the SD card.  It would be great if the reader could tell whether the card is a CD or DVD, which would be much easier to use in an SD card holder

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've used my HP Compaq Presario as my main PC for 10 years. I've always been extremely happy with it.  I bought this last year because I wanted an ultra-thin thin client, and while I've got the best resolution on a PC currently (1366x768) and best price (the cheapest price I've seen on a used computer so far is $300, so it's a bit hard to recommend it), I've just spent way too much time trying to get things to work the way I want it to and getting frustrated every time, including replacing all the drives several times, and I'm getting to the point where I'm going to go with another ultra-light computer (maybe a Samsung or the like).  I'm just so frustrated by all the fiddling and frustration with these things that I was thinking of buying a Chromebook for my other laptop instead, but my computer is a huge part of my digital life, and there's just no way I'm giving that up just yet.

It is especially helpful for me as I am currently transitioning to using all my  electronic devices and  transferring music to and from my  iPod and iPhone to my computer.  The new hard drive is very easy to use and allows me to store my music on the external harddrive at the same time it is being played on my   iPhone  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this for my   PC (Sierra) with a hard drive that is just 3.5  GB.  The  PC doesn't have a CD-RW drive, so the CD drive is just for accessing files from the computer.  So far, this  drive is  doing  exactly  what I need it to.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I recently purchased a digital camera (DSLR) that has a built-in memory card slot. I was very pleased with the quality of the camera, especially the zoom and autofocus feature. I also liked that I could download images from the camera to my computer. However, my favorite feature was the camera's "recording card" function. I could record a short video on the camera and view it later on the computer. That's pretty cool, especially since you can even use the video in a slide show.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this camera to take photos of my 2-year-old niece in class, and I was so excited about it.  I found it a little difficult to operate initially, but once I learned how to operate it, it was perfect.  It's so much more convenient to be able to take a photo without having to go back and forth between the camera and the phone.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a TRS adapter to use with my laptop to transfer MP3's. Unfortunately, the sound quality is terrible, especially the female to male mix. Even worse, the male to female mix is a really bad copy of the female-to-male mix. It makes me want to throw the sound card out. I will not be buying this adapter again.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am very happy with my iPHONE 3G/3GS/4/4S.  I do my homework in the library on my 3GS at the same time as I eat, and it is very nice to have the ability to print documents to go with my lecture notes and flashcards.  The iPhone also works great as a camera with  the   iPad 2.   
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the first time I've been disappointed by a gadget. I bought a digital camera a while back and I liked it a lot but the quality of the images was pretty poor.  This camera is the opposite: great pictures, quality photos, and great price.  I have a Panasonic digital camera and have not gotten along with it.  The Sony is much nicer in terms of image quality and the price is amazing.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the mpc3s (a Sony Playstation 3) as a replacement for my old mp3 player.  When I got the mpc3s, I was very impressed with the fact that they were USB powered.  I am using a Sony Playstation3 since 2007 so my mp3 players have always been battery powered.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased a Koss Portapro Digital Recorder about five years ago. I use it for playing recordings, recording my interviews, and occasionally playing tapes. The quality of the digital audio sounds excellent, and it has allowed me to use a larger variety of media for various projects. It also came with a very nice USB to SD card adapter which I used to create a small portable media player.  I found a small box of the same kind that was sold at the same time online to be a much better value. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this for my iPhone because my old one was giving me the dreaded "clickety-clack" sound when my thumb moved on the touch screen, so I decided to upgrade.  The 3D Touch is amazing.  It feels as if my thumb is actually touching the display, rather than just tapping.  This also eliminates the annoying lag.  I've tried many 3D touch solutions, and this is the best

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this because I had an SD card reader that I would never use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the MagicBand a month or so ago, mainly because I'm always in a rush. This thing is awesome.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got the Samsung S3 phone in the mail this morning. I've owned a Nexus 4 phone and a Nexus 7 tablet. While both have their advantages, I've come to find the S3's camera superior to the 4/7's. The phone itself is a little heavy, but in my opinion that's what makes it the most user friendly: if I drop the phone, it'll still work. I'll probably buy a case to protect the S 3 and that's a good idea.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPod classic has become obsolete and I needed to replace it with something that would keep up with me while I commute to and from work and school.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Sony QX10 is a great sound recorder. It has a decent enough digital-to-analog converter, and the software is very easy to use. I used the digital-recording software, Logic Pro, on an older Mac computer. I use this recorder primarily to record concerts. Logic Pro can record audio in Dolby Digital, DTS, and LPCM. The recording is accurate, and I can view and hear the sounds on the DVD (or play them on a CD player or other player). I can also mix and match different sound cards for different sounds on each disc. I'm very pleased with the audio quality and convenience of this recorder.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the first time I've ever used a digital camera, and I'm so impressed with it.   It's a little faster than I expected it to be.

I've already ordered a few more so I can put on my regular camera when I'm out shooting. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a Sony digital camera and love it. I'm trying to replace my existing camera and I bought the X-Trans HD but don't like the idea of getting a device that has a lot of built-in features.  The X-trans HD is pretty good and looks good but for the extra costs I don't see a benefit.  I also hate how the device has no on/off switch so the camera must always be on. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently bought this, thinking it was a great way to access my music and podcasts while driving. I don't know about you, but the fact that my iPhone won't turn off, even when I'm driving, makes me very uneasy. I've been doing the podcasts using the car's aux port and that works pretty well. However, I'm a bit reluctant to do that, because I'm very careful about turning it off. With this, I can listen to my iPhone when I know the car is parked and then pop it back in when I leave. Not having to worry about shutting off the car or my phone is awesome. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The only thing bad about this thing is that it doesn't work as well as the Samsung SD card.  I bought this to play music from a cd player.  It didn't work so well because my CD player has poor sound quality and the USB connector just isn't that great.  Also, I got a bit frustrated playing songs on my computer because it would occasionally play one or more seconds, then go completely silent.  If you like the sound of digital music and a portable player, this will do the trick.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have used several digital video recorders over the years.   In the past I have been unhappy with them, mainly because of the slow data transfer speeds and the cost of replacement parts, but I've finally found the right one.  It records 1080p HD video with great sound, but you don't have to plug in.  You just plug it in and the unit does the work.  The built in microphone is great for capturing voice-over for programs like VHS.  I also like that the unit takes up almost no space on my desktop.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I used to have my laptop, but after reading so many positive reviews for this product I decided to try it. I was skeptical at first. I'm not used to wireless technology and my phone was also just as good, so I thought the same would apply here.  It really does work, especially for an older computer:  I'm using the computer for all my personal use now, including watching movies, writing papers and web pages, and doing any number of online tasks while on the road.  I was concerned that my computer's built-in Bluetooth wouldn't support it, but it does.  If I'm out and about and my car is charging, my laptop can always use the Wi-Fi.  The only thing I don't like is that the battery is small -- the original battery was way too big -- but it lasts forever.  Overall, I'm happy with this purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have the Bowers & Wilkins P7's, P10's, and P9's. I am in love with all of them.  I'm very picky about the speakers in the B&W's but with the P9 I'm enjoying a lot more than I ever did with the Bower's.  The P7 has a really good sound and the P10, especially in a small room, can make me forget how the old CDs sounded.  It's so different from the other two that I'm glad they're all gone now. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Sennheiser HD 6XX headphone cables have long been the gold standard for audio interfaces. I have been using them for over ten years, dating back to my early days of audio recording.   When I upgraded to a PC, I upgraded the software to use the USB 2.0 port.  The upgrade wasn't as simple as replacing the old hard drives, as there were lots of bad ones, so I got myself an Sennsport 990 headset.  However, I noticed that the connection was different.  I used to use an HD connector, but my sound quality got worse when using it.  Finally, I got used to using a straight jack for audio.  But I had no problem with the HD 6xx, it was just that the old cables didn't work with the new headset. I tried the adapter and it worked fine. I bought a second set of cables for my PC, and I am very happy with the performance of the PC.  It has three hard drives.  So my music files are now in a third place, where they can be easily searched for. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I just purchased a Logitech USB Wired Optical Disk Drive and used it to transfer a massive (16GB) collection of audio, video and photographic materials from my laptop.  The device is very fast (only taking a couple of minutes to copy a large file from my computer to the device), the read/write interface is excellent and the performance is even better than the performance I get from my hard-drive.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to transfer large files at very high speed using a USB device. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was extremely pleased with my Apple  iPod Touch, which I had purchased from  BestBuy  for the great price and good features. I had just started my computer repair business and I needed a portable device that would be ideal for my job.  It came with a charger, a headphone jack, a USB cable, and the necessary adapters for my computer and the  iPod, which is not included.  As soon as I opened the box, I knew that I had made the right decision!  The  iPod fits perfectly in my  backpack

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the first electronic device that I've used in any capacity other than simple remotes.

The S-1000 can be configured for Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 and Linux. The built in Wi-Fi is very good and the sound quality is top notch. I have used the S100 for over three years now and it has served me well. I use the internal USB cable instead of the proprietary card slot which can be inconvenient for some users. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've used this device since it was released. It's been a joy to use - especially in its own little case.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Sony Playstation 3 game controller is absolutely beautiful.  You get two joysticks, two buttons, a D-pad, a face button, and an "X" button.  The face button is actually the "Select" button which you press a lot on the Playstation 3.  It makes it much easier to select games when the controller is placed in a bag or on a desk.  I've been looking for something like this for a long time but nothing has been as good as this. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My SDR is the first SDR I have owned.  I bought it used on eBay and the price was too good to pass up.  It uses an external power supply so I had to buy a separate power supply.  When the battery power went out I had the SDR on for 3-4 days, but I was very impressed by how well it performed.   The interface is very easy to use and I don't think I would have picked it up at a sale price.

The Thunderbolt drive is much more reliable and compact than any thumb drive.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I used the   Laptop PC Adapter (LP-DA0) to get my Windows 7 home computer working on a USB 3.0 port, and also to use it to play DVD audio and video files.  It is a great deal if you already have a USB 2.0 or 3.1 port, but it is a pain to use if you don't.   In a pinch, however, it is good to have if you want to play a DVD or audio file and you don' t have the option of hooking up a computer.

I was buying the new Seagate external hard disk from a company called Seagate, but there was a problem with that. Seagate is a major manufacturer of hard drives, so that would seem to be the issue. But this thing still worked fine. I can't get over how convenient it is. It's easy to get to and the interface is easy to use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is an excellent digital camera. It is so light weight, I can carry it on a key chain.  I shoot with a Canon Rebel XT, but this is more than adequate for my needs.  The resolution is a little lower, but that's due to the fact that the camera is not as good as my old compact compact.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I really like the Apple Magic Trackpad 2.  When I bought my first iPod touch, it was a total disappointment.  The trackpad was too thin and floppy, and it took forever to set up my iPod touch.  This trackpad   seems  to be much better.  I can set up the iPod touch more quickly and comfortably.   This device is great for me  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use this on my iPhone 5c, the screen's good and its very fast.  It has two USB ports, so you can connect any device to it.  The camera's got some great features, including slow motion, time lapse, panorama, and video recording.  Overall, I'm really happy with it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I used to be a DJ, but my ears hurt from using turntables, and DJing is such a good way to keep time.  These guys made the turntable that never hurts my ears obsolete, and I'm glad I'm finally getting back to DJing. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the best electronic device that I have ever owned.  The only issue is that it takes up too much room in the back of my car.  I use it for my MP3 player and iPod.  It has worked flawlessly for years.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was looking for a great all in one digital camera that was easy to use and have decent quality photos on it.  After seeing the Sony A6300 and A6000 I decided to give this camera a try.  It has great photos and a good user interface.  The autofocus works great and you don't need a tripod to take great photos.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Panasonic LP-E8 (which I had the chance to test out, and which you can read about in my other reviews ) is an excellent digital camera. The picture quality is excellent. It has the ability to take many different kinds of pictures.  It's small enough to fit in a backpack.  The sound quality is good.  I was very impressed with it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using an iPod for years, and the Zune is great.  I have the MP3 player version, but it's still a lot slower than my iPhone.  Even with the Zunes, my mp3 files always come out a bit too loud.  This Zune, however, is great!  The audio is crisp, clear, and just the right amount of volume so I can use it without having to crank it up.  The screen is super clear as well, which is great when it's raining.  In the past, the best part about using my iPhone was how fast it was.  Now, using the ZUNE, I have to wait for the file to download to my phone and then I have about five seconds to play the song.  Not bad, but I could have gotten a better performance out of a lot less money. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The iPod and  Sony Walkman both have nice, full-featured digital players.  The MP3 players are so good that you can keep them on a shelf for years without any complaints.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this as a replacement for my iPod nano in order to continue using my computer.  I had been using the nano for the last 2 years without a problem, so when I read about the USB 2.0, I was very excited.  Using my computer with this card is much more convenient than with the nano.  It seems to work just as well, so much so that I purchased the 2nd card  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   As usual, I'm impressed with this little device: it's just so much easier to carry with me, it's so much more precise in its adjustment, and it's more fun to use when compared to my "real" mechanical keyboard. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am really impressed with the sound quality and clarity of the iPod. It's a big step up from my previous MP3 player. The controls are intuitive and very easy to use. I recommend buying a new one. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this to replace my broken mp3 player, the mpc p2s had a bad preamp so they didn't play the mp3s. The dvd player was a little more expensive so I decided to go with the hifi version.  It's great, just not as good as the mpc's.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This item is absolutely beautiful. The black ceramic case is so much more durable than the plastic cases that other manufacturers use, and it looks great in my kitchen counter top. The keyboard is smooth and responsive, and the software that comes with the case allows me to use my   Sony CD player to play  files off the CD. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use a Sanyo digital camera for photo editing, and this micro SD card is better than any that I have used. It is easy to use and the card is much larger than my camera card so I get far more photos per SD card. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The first set of Epson e-xplosives I purchased were terrible. This set is very good. I use them for enlarging prints and making prints from color slide films. My printer can only print at 1:1, so I have to use the e-zplosive's for that. However, I also use them to color slide and color film negatives, as well as for scanning color negatives.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a fantastic portable device that has changed my life!   I have had the CD-ROM drive on my computer for about 2 years now and used it primarily for music, but I have been listening to audiobooks on the device with great success.  It has a nice volume level, the playback is very clear, and there's no distortion when using CD-quality audio.  I love that it's a USB drive, and that it doesn't require an adapter or a bulky external power adapter.  The only drawback to this device is that it takes about 10 hours to boot, even with a good laptop drive, which is a bit longer than I'd like.  However, I can't find another way to make it run that long at the same time as my laptop. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use it for recording audio of my computer screen, in order to use for audiovisual devices like CD/DVD players or sound system.

I don't   use it as my primary drive any more,  but  when   a  friend needs it for a conference   or   for a project,   the  drive   makes   it   super   fast   (that's how fast the SSD's are,  I  can see the difference   in loading files).

I have a set of Beyerdynamic DT770's from the 70's, and they have always been excellent, but they don't have that warm, full sound and they don 't hold up well over time. I'm using a pair of Grado SDR headphones (and my wife's pair of Hifiman MMX's) these headphones work better than the Beyers  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is an excellent electronic device.  I purchased this for use with a Mac that I bought two years ago, and it was perfect from the start.  When it was working properly, it was fast, stable and accurate.  It worked so well that I replaced the hard drive on the Mac with the SD card that came with the device. It took about two weeks for it to boot up correctly (from a hard disk that the Mac came on).  There's even a built-in DVD reader.  The card slot works with most (but not all) memory cards, and there's no need for adapters to read the cards -- everything you need is built right in.

It's not a particularly powerful card, but with the $50 price tag it's still a great deal.  I use my phone for all my cards these days and the S-Video adapter allows me to convert any old video to an SD format.  In addition, you can easily load an SD card from your computer with Windows and a few mouse clicks.  If I'm ever in a bind and have my cards to hand, this is the device I'm going to use.

Since  I've used the  CDMA  and  TCA2035,  I was a bit puzzled as to  why I had to use the TCD132  when I knew I had both  TCCD1305  and TCCDS1305.  I'm glad I finally figured out  why.  It gives a better signal and doesn't  wear out my phone as quickly. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this to replace my old iMac.  I'm very pleased with it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using the Epson inkjet for about a month now.  I've done a lot of research before purchasing and decided on the digital camera.  The Epson was recommended as a great option due to it's smaller size compared to the digital cameras.  It's also quite portable.   There's a lot more control over the file size and compression than I was able to get with the camera.    I'm not very happy with my print quality so far but it's still better than using a digital camera

It only pauses on the last line that you tap on before the song stops.  That's kind of annoying.

There was an issue with my car, so I thought I'd buy a new one instead of spending the money to buy a used one.  This thing really does the job perfectly.  It doesn't make my car sound bad.  I think that's what's been bothering me, the music seems to get a little distorted and muddy, like it's been sitting in the car too long.  But when I put the headphones on and turn up the volume, everything sounds great!  If you buy one, be sure to buy the case because you'll need it! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I own an old Sony ICX series camera that is also a DVD player. However, the ICX player is a bit clumsy. It makes use of a special plug on the backside of the unit that slides in and out of the slot on the side of the DVD player that has a very long USB cable. This plug gets in the way of my arm when I use it to insert and eject discs. The ICX also can't play DVD-R's.

I'm not big on Apple's own hardware (a big problem I had with the second-gen iPod Touch), but I can still get a few things done with the original remote. This time around, Apple's software is great.  Using the Siri remote is super convenient, and the Siri Remote app (included with the TV) makes controlling the TV a breeze.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had a few years of use with the Sony digital camera and I found that its electronic shutter was very slow. I used to find the fast shutter speed on digital cameras made it easy to take photos with flash. With this camera, though, the electronic shutter wasn't as fast and I had to press the shutter button a bit harder when I wanted to take a photo with flash (as opposed to using the flash). I also found that the digital camera's viewfinder was very poor compared to my Nikon's.   But as good as the digital version is, I found the Sony better in every other regard.

I've been using it for years as a home theater processor.   It's fast and it records with good quality.  It is a pleasure to use and the included software is very easy to understand and use. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I like the fact that the RCA cable is separate from the other pieces, so I can plug in my computer's hard drive and the R and the A's from a single RCA connector.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I just bought a $30 USB dongle from Amazon.  There are a lot of USB dongs out there, but none that can support MP3.  This one does.  The dongles are a little heavy, but I'm glad I got the lighter weight version.  I've only used them with my laptop, but so far they seem to work as advertised. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I really like this receiver. I have a set of RCA jacks and this is the first one that has a 1/8" headphone output, which I use.  I haven't found a better one for my needs.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the best portable mp3 player I've ever used.   It's super light, quiet, and the MP3 format is so much better than the.ape format on my old portable player.  Even though it's $200, it's a steal. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am very satisfied with my Zune.   The quality of the music playback is excellent, and the playback system is very good.  It has good battery life, and although I am using my iPhone with it, it still gets the job done.  I also use my iPod for listening to music, and I think the Zune does a pretty good job for the price. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is by far the best device I've ever owned. It's so thin and light that you can carry it with you everywhere. The screen is very bright and easy to read. It comes with a small USB port and a large SD card. This is really handy, because I can insert a memory card and use it as a computer, while I'm trying to use my camera. I've even used it to download movies from the internet.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My first Sony e-reader, the Sony Reader was a good choice. I was skeptical at first because I didn't want the e-book subscription that came with it and because I thought the paper was too brittle to be used for a tablet. I read many reviews and I have to say that my Sony has been awesome. It has the latest software, is easy to read and has an e-ink screen. I can't say enough good things about it and I will be buying more Sony e Readers.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently purchased the DECT-XD-HD100-TV. I have been a "die hard" Apple fanboy for years.   It was just so long coming, and I'm glad it finally arrived.  The quality of the image is excellent.  I had a HD TV for my older MacBook Pro (a 4 year old model), which is really nice.  However, I can't use the MacBook because the HDMI cable is too short, and the cable gets tangled up all the time.  This DECT adapter is very different in that it is much shorter than the cable, and it doesn't get tangled up.  It's a fantastic way to get the best out of my MacBook Pro. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great little electronic device. It's small size makes it very portable, and it can run off of almost any power source. It can play CDs, DVD's, and even digital videos! It's also really fast, too! The only downside I see is that it's a little hard to find a good-quality, fully-rechargeable battery. I would've paid around $30 for an extra-large one, but the one I got in China was pretty weak.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've owned several of these devices over the years and this is the best one to date.  It has better sound than my Yamaha's, better sound out of the sub, and it is compact enough to fit into my carry on.  The remote is excellent as well.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my third and only time using a Bluetooth headset, and this one is by far the best!   The sound quality is fantastic, with no distortion whatsoever.  I have found most other Bluetooth headsets to be just as bad, if not worse than the sound from my iPod, iPhone, and even my stereo system.  The bass and treble are nice and firm, with just the right amount of presence to make them sound natural.  It takes a little getting used to, but once you do, it really comes through.   It also comes with a nice carrying case, so I can take it to the gym with me to listen to music during my long runs.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased the Sony HD-V10 a few years ago. It is the only digital camera I have ever used that has actually allowed me to get decent shots of my favorite TV shows.   It has a great low light image, which is perfect for watching TV on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  Even though it takes a lot of exposure time and a lot more megapixels to get good shots with this camera, it is a great way to see your favorite shows on TV. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just received my new   Vtech   (   which I will use to replace   my   old       )   yesterday.   The unit arrived perfectly in 2 days.  It seems like a much more professional looking unit than my  previous Vtech units.  However, it's not the same.  The original Vtech unit had a built in power switch and the new one does not.  There is an easy to find power button on the new unit but it is wired to the same spot as the power switch on the original unit.  ( The switch   is on the   bottom   of the new    Vtech    unit, just below the battery   socket  .)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPod nano is so good at my job that I use it almost as much as my desktop computer.   If you are working from home and just want a portable music player, this is a great option.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought a PDP-11 because I wanted an internal DAC to connect a portable player to.  I had been using an old PDP with a CD player for quite a while.  After some experimentation, I found that the CD player would just barely get by without a DAC on the line, so I opted for this one.  It's much more efficient, and it sounds amazing when playing MP3 and AAC files. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been using an  Apple  iPod   (   original   )   for about five years.

It has a slot for  memory cards,  and  can play video.   The iPod also can connect to   my iPhone   and play music.  If you have  a  iPhone  you will be amazed   by the amount of   songs you can play. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using the Sennheiser HD 280 headphones since I got them in 1994. I found the HD 280 to be superior to my previous headphone because of the bass, clarity, and volume.  The Senn HD 280s are not the cheapest headphones available.  It can be found at Best Buy for $200 or more, although other sources can be had for about the same price.  However, when I bought these, I thought I was paying a little over $50 for an exceptional pair of headphones that would last me for years.  I'm very pleased with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone interested in getting a pair of solid, stylish headphones.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the GigaPan in September and have been very happy with it.  It's the first portable digital camera that's good enough to take around with me, not a point-and-shoot, not only has a large enough sensor for HD video, but also is very small.  The images look very good, and the sound is clear, even with a low-quality microphone.    The only thing I haven't gotten used to yet is the slow shutter speed when the camera has the flash on. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPod Nano   has been a big help to me in the studio and on the road.   When I first got the iPod nano I was concerned it was too small and that it would be too loud.  Since then I've had it for about 4 months and I haven't missed a beat.  It's so easy to use and the fact that I'm not spending a fortune on a new digital audio player is great.  I recommend it to everyone

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have owned a number of different digital cameras over the years, and in my experience, no one compares to the ability and ease of use of the Cyber-shot DSC-HX300. The picture quality is very good. The automatic shooting is as fast as any digital camera I've ever used. The auto exposure, while a bit slow, is so good I rarely need to adjust it. I also love the fact that all my pictures are stored on the card. The only reason I didn't give the DSC100 a 5 star review is that the battery is unreliable. I've had several failed batteries over the last couple of years, which caused me to have to buy new ones each time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The best thing about this CD/DVD player is that it plays anything you throw at it, including CDs and DVDs (which I didn't realize until after I bought it).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the perfect size and sound quality for playing guitar.   The only downside is that it has a really bad headphone port.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Audio Technica ATR-X1000 is a great little portable receiver that's not a huge budget buy, but is a perfect match for my HDTV. It's small enough to keep in my car and it's got plenty of inputs, but the headphone jack makes for a good headphone solution. It also has a headphone amp that is built-in.  The biggest draw for me, though, is the built-like-a-tank sound quality. I got the ATR X1 for my 2007 BMW R1200GS, which is a really, really good sounding car. But the ATRIX beats it in every way: better soundstage, deeper bass, bigger soundstage overall.

I was not a big fan of the small size of the TDVD-D10 or TCDV-D2, but the TCVD-D24 and TCDCDD have been very reliable and easy to use.  And they have a lot of great features that make them stand out among the digital cameras.

Then I got another TLE just for the heck of it. I figured, why not just get an upgrade here and there anyway. It's been working flawlessly ever since. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a $100 USB 3.0 hard drive that has no built in SD card slot.  I was happy with my purchase until I tried to run OS X on it.  They've got it wrong on a number of points:  1. You can't run OSX on it.  I'm running an OSX 10.6.8 on it now.  It's a bit of a pain to format and boot it, but I'm going to stick with a Mac for another couple of years. 2. It doesn't have a card slot for external hard drives.  For a machine that is supposed to be good for digital media, this is a big letdown.  If they are going to charge so much for it, then they should include one.   
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I bought my second iPad in October 2012, I was disappointed. The first one was a complete flop. I bought a third and I used it only once.  This new iPad has been a resounding success.  It is light, thin, and has the screen I want.  I love the Touch ID.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The XBMC media player is my favorite remote for my Sony PS3. I don't use XBMs as a primary computer and I also prefer the remote interface to the PS3's touchpad for the remote's simple and intuitive operation.   For the price it's a fantastic choice. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The E-Book reader has become a life saver for my library. I use this to copy electronic books from my digital camera onto my computer. I like to read digital books on my computer so I don't have to carry any of them. I also use it to copy the contents of other people's digital libraries onto my computers.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use this to copy audio and video.  It works very well.  I've been using my iPod to copy music for years, but that's not really a good format for electronic devices.  This one is ideal, especially for the price. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have used other electronic devices in the past but none of them compare with this one. It is so easy to use and connects to any iPod without having to use the proprietary cable.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPod was my last and first mobile device. I had been using my Nokia phones since their introduction.  They work great, but the music is very compressed and not as enjoyable.  I also have a Macbook Pro and the MP3 and WMA formats are so much better on that machine.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great phone for me, and I have really been impressed with it so far.   I purchased the device because my old phone was just too big for my hand, and it was a big hassle to take it out and put it back in, especially since I work at an office that has a lot of other people's phones.  The phone fits well in my hand without any problems, and the interface is very easy to use.  I also appreciate the fact that it supports T9 (Telephone Directory), which helps in finding my local area codes.  It doesn't require a CDMA radio or data plan, so there is no reason not to buy it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound quality is outstanding. I've bought several of these as a replacement for the poor sound I get from my cheap mp3 players.

The iPod is still king and I have my MP1 and MP3 players too.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have had a number of different digital camera devices over the years. I find this one to be a bit better, and is built better.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I got the T5 I did not really think too much of it. The thing looked kind of silly, and I knew there would be no USB port. However, the price of the T4B came as a big surprise. The T5 also came with a USB cable. So I had to get over my initial skepticism and give the T-5 a chance.   The screen looks pretty good, and it is much faster than the T3, so I am still a big fan of the 4MB SD card slot 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm using this for my personal computer to capture all my audio and video.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I received my iPaq with the 3.5-inch disk drive about a month ago.  I was skeptical at first, but I decided to give it a shot.   It works fine.  It is so fast that I used to use an old, slower floppy disk drive to write my documents.  The disk drive is just as fast.  When I print a document, it is just about the same speed as if I'd done it myself.  Now I can store a lot more stuff on my iPod.

It does everything I need it to do.  It's just as easy to use as a smartphone, and I've found that I don't need to buy a separate app for that functionality.  Battery life isn't the longest, but it's great compared to most other similar products, and it can even power my Bluetooth speakers.  I'm pretty happy with my purchase 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm not really a audiophile, but this thing really rocks. I use my own DAC (Philips CD-player) and use iTunes.   The iMac is a great device, but the USB audio and CD-reading is super cool and easy to use.  The iPhone's built-in iPod-like interface isn't so great.  This is a real game changer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use this for my iPod, but I also have a Sony Walkman that's used by my 3-year-old daughter. She can't stand the sound of the Walkman, but it's nice to have a good audio device at the same time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My original Dell laptop was not as nice as the new MacBook Pro, but the MacBook Pro does everything that I need it to do, and more.   A bigger hard drive, faster processor, and faster optical drive are all great.  The keyboard is great for a small laptop.  I use my Chromebook for internet browsing, emails, and work.  However, the keyboard on the MacBook is great, and the trackpad is really nice.  It has a built in camera, which is a really cool feature.  A great keyboard and trackpad are more than I could have asked for. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this because I wanted to use my iPad at work but have my  iBook or my iPod connected so that I could still use them.  This  device   makes it possible to do both   with no hassle. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Epson Perfection V3000 is a very nice digital camera. The camera itself is very solid, and it's small, too. It's also very fast and I like the ability to choose the exposure time. This camera can also work on card-based digital cameras. I've been shooting on my digital camera for more than 15 years and love it. It is now my digital backup camera. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had to replace my broken digital camera several times, but I finally found a good one (the Epson V600) and purchased it. It has replaced the Canon SX100 I have had for two years. I've also been using a Nikon D3S.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It is fast and simple to use, but a few things in the description just don't seem to add up for me.   I bought a pair of earphones the first day they came in the mail.  One of them was broken, but it was a fairly cheap model, and was easy to get a new one from my local electronics store.  But when I got it in the box, the earphones were missing the micro-usb connector that connects them to my computer.  (I was told that it is included on the box).  (Apparently, my local store doesn't offer it because they don't make the earbuds in bulk enough to sell that way.  It also appears that the earphone cables don't have any sort of adhesive to keep the earpads on.)  (The earphones are a bit big for me, but the extra space gives me a nice feel.  If that's not enough, there is a little flap on the right side of the cable, which I don't like.  I've had to cut that off so I can wear my headset on my right ear.)   The other earphone is also missing the connector.  I don't know if the company got rid of it because it's cheap, or if they just made a mistake. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased the 3.5mm to RCA adapter for my Sony SACD player and it works perfectly.  The adapters are very simple to use, and I'm not sure I'd use a RCA to 3. 5mm adapter, but it's perfect for my player. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   As the title of the article suggests, this little device is very versatile and is perfect for my iPod.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was able to get an original Sony CCD camera and memory card for free at a garage sale. I was quite happy with the camera because it has a decent picture and video.  However, I wanted a video card that was smaller and had a larger capacity. I looked into buying the Canon SX-70II, but it wasn't available, so I bought the Sony CCH-M100 and then tried to find a Sony CX-60 card to use. I found this model and the Sony card worked perfectly.  I also found this video card a bit expensive, but the quality of video was better than the CCH. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The unit came in 2 days and the first time I used it the noise was terrible.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great sound board for my home computer. I bought this device mainly because it has a built in microphone and the computer can use this to record voices.  I purchased the device from eBay and it was easy to set up.  The software it comes with is great for editing audio files.  My only problem with the software is that it does not let you record multiple voices at once.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My Sony Handycam has served me well for years.   I always have my camera with me at all times and I never have to worry about it missing.  The only drawback is that I have to take a cable out of my computer to charge it and then bring it back in when I'm finished.  However, it's only a minor inconvenience and I can still enjoy the great quality of video it produces. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got my first Philips stereo system in 1984.  I've never owned another brand and have always liked Philips for its high quality sound, and compact size.  The latest model, the SB-1, is great!  I like the CD player in particular because it plays great stereo music without distortion or problems.  It's very easy to plug in and use.   The speakers sound good too! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I just received my Sony XAVC-S digital camera.   The camera has the new XAV-C 3.6x zoom lens, and is waterproof to 1 meter (3.3 feet).  I use this to shoot wildlife and still life.  I also use the XAVCD-R/RW format recorder for my digital cameras.  It also has a memory card slot.  The XAVc-S camera is also waterproof and shockproof.  This is great for the price. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The SoundBlaster Ultra is the perfect high-end USB sound device for PC users.  The Ultra features high-quality digital audio and 24-bit/96kHz audio recording at a resolution of 192kHz/24bit.  Unlike other high-def audio devices, the Ultra doesn't require a separate sound card.  I use my laptop as a PC, which is why I needed the SoundBlast Ultra.  For the first time in a while, I can hear audio I recorded myself on my laptop in the original PC audio format (FLAC).  For PC gamers who want to record their audio while they play, the Sound Blaster Ultra gives PC gamers the best of both worlds.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had an  Epson 870 CD Writer for about 10 years.  I liked it because it was easy to use, and was also very good for photo and audio data storage.  However, it had a few flaws.  It was noisy, and the buttons had to be pressed several times for a change to occur.  That's annoying if you're working in a noisy environment like a recording studio.  The built-in microphone sounded good, but was prone to noise.  Finally, it was also fairly expensive.  If you don't have a lot of space on your computer, the 870 will do the job. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As you can see from the photos, the unit looks a bit like a Game Boy.

I haven't found anything useful about it. I hope Apple comes up with a better camera later on.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just received my HP ZR2 and I'm quite pleased. I had purchased an older model ZR1, and I must say that while I'm not a hardcore tech myself, it wasn't a very pleasant experience. I felt that there was no point in having it, and since I'm still not a big fan of the ZR series, I couldn't see any reason to have another one. Well, I'm glad to say that it's different.   The ZR is well built and well made.  The keyboard is solid and feels good to type on.  It also has a great trackpad, with two clicks that do a great job of scrolling and moving between windows.  I don't use my laptop very much for watching movies, but I think I'm going to be buying one to replace my old DVD player.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've been using my iPod, and more recently my iPhone, for a number of years.   The first few times I took them out of their cases, I had a bit of an issue.  Once, I took a trip to the store to buy a new battery for the phone, and the guy in the store told me the phone was old and needed a new one.  I had no idea what he was talking about.  The phone worked fine for a week or so.  Eventually, though, the phone would only recognize that it was the only device in the room.  When I took it out of the case to check it out, I found that the SIM card in the phone had somehow gotten stuck.  It was stuck in the right slot, which is perfectly fine for that phone.  For the next few months, the battery never charged.  One day, I went to the mall with my phone, which was stuck as well.  There was a good-sized store nearby, so I asked the store clerk how they could fix it.  She said that it would cost $10, but that I could get a new SIM card and get a fresh battery.  That worked great.  Since I started using my new phone, I've never had a problem with the phone not charging.

I have the Logitech X-55 Steam Controller (which I really liked) but the original Logitech one that came with my PC, was terrible. The buttons are stiff, it doesn't fit on my keyboard very well, and it didn't work well with a mouse.    This new one is much better. It's very responsive, the mouse works well, it fits my laptop perfectly, and the gamepad (while a bit fiddly to get used to) is very convenient.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A few years ago, I bought a CD-RW reader for my old computer, but the CD-ROM drives were unreliable and had to be replaced constantly.   I'd already been through three of these in one year, and decided to go with this one over others.  It's a nice device for listening to audio.  My only complaint is that you have to buy the full size unit, because the portable version is too small for my needs.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is an amazing USB MIDI interface/controller. It comes with everything you need to get going (including the batteries) and comes with a fantastic price (about half the cost of my previous unit). I've been wanting to get into this kind of stuff since I got my first MPC 2500 back in the early '90s, and it's made it a lot easier to get to grips with music creation on my computer. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought these speakers and used them to stream my music from my iPod to my speakers.  These sound pretty good.  The sound quality is good enough to have a conversation with the other person while listening to the music.  My speakers aren't that great, but these ones are good enough. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got the Blue Snowball when the original had failed.  It's pretty well built, and is very small and portable.  While I've used the original Snowball, it's a bit too heavy, and the battery is a little too small to get through a long period of use.  The Blue Snowman is significantly lighter and smaller, but the Snowball battery lasts much longer.   It also uses a separate CR2032 battery rather than the original's AA.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was concerned about the reliability of the ECC87, so I did a little research.  I read a lot of good things about this device, but after using it for a few weeks, I must say I am very impressed.  The quality of the memory card is excellent, and while it can't hold as much data as a much larger SD card, it's very usable.  It also has two USB ports and a full-sized HDMI output.   For the price, I can't think of a better way to store and transfer photos. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really like my iPod for listening to music, but my iPod nano is much more portable.   The iPod nano uses the same sort of battery as the iPhone, but it takes a lot longer to recharge than the iPod.  I prefer the sound quality of my iPod over the sound of the iPod nano. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased the HD PVR for my Sony PlayStation 3.  I wanted to replace the proprietary Blu-ray player, but the PS3 does not play discs.  It's a pity that the PVR doesn't play movies and video, but otherwise the unit is very good.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Panasonic TC-100 is a good digital camera. It took pictures well. The software made it easy to configure it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the iD for the purpose of a backup system for my digital cameras (which have an external SD card slot). The iD has proven to be very useful as an external drive for my cameras. It is compact and sturdy, which helps me when storing digital photos on my computers. The price was extremely reasonable and the performance of the i D was excellent. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a digital camera or digital media device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As a longtime audiophile, I am extremely pleased with the sound quality of this set.  It produces good depth and resonance, but also a very clean and clear signal.  I haven't had a pair of headphones that are as enjoyable to listen to as this one has been, or are available for this price. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm a computer tech. I bought the Apple Magic Trackpad 2 because it looks like a good, functional mouse.  I was looking for a replacement because the first one that I bought (a Magic TrackPad 1 ) wasn't working as well as it was suppose to.  The second one was much better.   The one I got is made of better quality materials, but it doesn't have a backlight.  It also has the same button configuration as the original Magic Trackpads (which I find more convenient), but it has the trackpad that sits at the top of the keyboard instead of the top left, like the original does. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The  iLX-100 digital audio recorder  is  simple to operate,  accurate in recording and transcription, and   accurate  in playback.  It   is useful in all aspects of the recording  and   transcription process.   
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My first iPod was a really nice one, I still use it today. I can't get the same quality or reliability as the last two. The interface is great, and the quality of sound is just as good as it's ever been. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great digital camera that produces great images. I used it for a year to get the best images from my old point and shoot camera.  The camera works great with my  Sony DSLR and works great  for recording video and photo's. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I used to own a Motorola  I have since upgraded to a Panasonic.  My old  had a built in MP3 player, but that was very slow (and it could play only about 15 songs).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The E-M1 Mark II is a really solid camera. It has all the features I need, such as a high resolution sensor, the ability to record full 1080P video at 30 fps, the fast 3.5 mm jack, a USB port for external memory, and built in flash. It's also fairly well made, so it's not just a little plastic camera that will break if you drop it.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I like my XBOX 360 wireless controller for a lot of reasons.  It's great to be able to control my games wirelessly.  The ability to play with multiple controllers is very useful.  I have a Wii, and it has always been difficult to get my Wii remote to work.  With the 360 controller, I can use my Wii, the controller I used to have, and my new GameCube controller all at the same time.  This can be especially useful when using the controller with a TV, as it makes the controller's "controller" feature much more useful.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this headphone in September 2011. I use it with my iPod, the CD player and my computer. The only con I could find about it is that it doesn't have a remote for my computer, which would have been great.

It's been amazing to get all of the updates, and it has become one of my favorite things to do  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought an AVR/DVR that came with a computer. It came with 2 external drives, 1 of which was a 1TB external drive, but the other one was only a 5GB one. The other drives were 3.5'' and the drive that came out of the box, a 5.25'' one, was useless.   The AVR had a USB cable, which allowed me to connect the 5.5GB drive with it.  However, the 5GB drive was too small and I couldn't find a USB 3.0 port on my computer to connect it to.  The 5.8'' external drive (that was the one I originally bought) works perfectly with the computer, but doesn't work with the 5:25 external drive.  I'm thinking that there's something in the 5TB external, but I've yet to find it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was very skeptical about the Sony Ericsson QX10 when I first heard about it. The quality of the speakers on Sony's devices is consistently excellent, but they just don't sound very "audiophile" to me. But then I was pleasantly surprised by the Sony QX100  The QX99's sound quality is just right, and the QX40's sound is more forward and energetic than my QX3's (which I also have). It's definitely worth the extra money.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Epson Stylus Photo CD  (now available in Japan), for a simple $24, is probably the best device for scanning photos from a digital camera. It's the only non-digital digital camera that works in a PC without problems.   When I bought it, I was very happy with the Epson quality.  Unfortunately, the quality of my scans has declined over the years.  For example, I scanned a very large (8.5 inch by 11 inch) copy of the new Star Wars movie poster on which I am a very satisfied customer.  In my scans, the print quality is very good but the colors are very weak.  Since I bought the Epsons Stylis Photo CD, I have not scanned as many large posters as I did when I bought this very nice camera.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The unit works flawlessly, including the SD card reader that I'm so pleased about.  The only issue is that the unit can't handle the full capacity of the SD memory cards that come on the Micro SDHC class card.  It only offers 16GB cards, but you'll be lucky if it offers more than 16MB.  I used a 32MB SD card for the camera.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this device because my old one stopped working. This one is better than the first one!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this product a few years ago from a local store in my home state of Iowa. I have used many other brands of digital camera's (including Nikon) and this is easily the best. It does not have any of the limitations of other digital cameras. It has a very large, bright, clear, high-resolution screen (I own a large television), and the size, weight, and price are all superior to others (including my old Sony camera which has a small, dim screen, but is still very good).   It is a good camera, but you can't beat a Nikon.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The S2X is an amazing portable media player and recorder, and it has become a mainstay for all the friends that visit my house.   It's small enough to take with you, it's smallish enough to be easily concealed, and the internal memory is really good.  It has one of the biggest sound output capabilities of any digital audio device, even larger than my $3,000 iPod.  There are no "audio-video glitches" that plague most digital players, and its performance on all of my recordings is top notch.  I've been using this device since it came out, and I'm happy that I finally bought my own for less than a dollar. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Purchased this as part of the Sony MEX-BT3D/BTX cable kit. The first time I used it, I found it quite lacking. The picture quality is great and the sound is ok, but it's not really what I expected out of a Sony device. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this about a month ago.  It's the first digital audio player that's actually worked well.  I've always used recorders and digital cassettes (in stereo) but was always pretty disappointed.  When I finally got this, I didn't know what to expect.  Well, I got it, plugged it in, and was very surprised at how good it sounded.  In fact, I was surprised at just how bad the previous player was!  It wasn't just my poor quality copy that was bad, but even the good copy I was able to copy with the player.  The sound is clean, clear, and dynamic.  Even though it doesn't have a built-in compressor (the player does), it still sounds quite great.  If you've used the cheaper players and cassettes, you'll be very pleased.  You don't need a CD player, just a few good-quality songs. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I recently replaced my CRT TV with this TV. The picture is excellent and the TV is super portable. I would have preferred the sound, but I still use a small pair of ear buds in the front of the TV and can still hear everything. It also keeps my TV free of dust which is extremely important to me. The remote is well done and the picture quality is excellent, even if the sound is poor.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I like the built-in USB charger as much as the iPod/iPhone. However, I have a USB adapter that I use to charge my iPod, and it doesn't fit in either of these two cases. The adapter fits in the iPod case but not the iPhone. I would like to be able to buy this as a separate case for my iPhone so I can still use the other one. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have a couple of Samsung smart TVs and they are fine. But, when I received my Samsung Smart TV 3, I thought I would have to upgrade to an HD one. I didn't want to take on the $300 to $400 price tag for an HD TV. But after a few weeks, I can see that I'm wrong about that and am very satisfied with the device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is one of the best stereo microphones I've used. It's got an incredible sound.  I use it for recording live performances.  The sound comes from the 2 microphones, not the preamp.  If you're trying to record an acoustic guitar, the acoustic itself will drown out the microphone and the sound will be unusable.  This model allows you to capture a clear acoustic guitar.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The E-HAB 600 is a wonderful little device that is compact and light enough to fit in a small bag.  It has the ability to switch from a digital audio interface to an analog line level input to a digital output, or vice versa.   There are two ways to set the level: via the line output or via the digital input.  If using a line level source, the level will automatically be set at the level of the line input, which is usually between 10 and 20mV.  Using the digital inputs, however, the levels are set to +/- 3dB of the input level.  This can be used for mixing different sources such as CD players, preamps, etc.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased my first computer in the summer of 1992.  It was a 16 MB floppy disk.  My first hard drive, a 4 MB CD-ROM, took over a year to find.  Then my parents upgraded their computer and I bought an 8 MB hard drive for my Macintosh IIc and the following year I had a 9 MB drive, the first Apple disk drive.  Now I am having a hard time parting with my 8 MB drive. I use my new 128 MB disk about 5 times a year for backup.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use this device to capture audio and video from my wireless network speakers. It's perfect for recording podcasts and watching movies on my computer while I'm at work. The included SD card can be used for recording from other devices as well. The unit also records the audio through headphones. It seems that the microphone picks up everything I say when speaking to the unit. It works great and is a great value 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The TLC1803 is great!   I'm a photographer and use my camera as an electronic camera.

I was able to take a photo of the sunset with my iPhone (no sound at all!)

I have used my PC speakers for a long time, but have never been satisfied.  There is a lot of distortion.  The built in DAC has a nice sound, but not so much as to be distracting.  No matter how much music I download, I'll never go back to my PC speaker.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have used my  iPaq over the years and it's always had a flaw or two.  I finally got rid of it and purchased this device because I wanted to play my music on my iPod instead.   The  device came in one day with no packaging at all.  It came in a plain paper envelope and was just a simple plastic case.  The device itself is a plastic case with a micro drive, an SD card reader, and an   optical drive on the back.  There are no manuals for the  device and there is no software for the software.  In order to change the operating system or access the software,  you have to plug the device into a computer.  Since I've never really  had to change my operating system on  a computer before, it was a little bit difficult to figure out how to use the  hardware.  Once I got the hang of it though, the software  was easy to use.  If you get an  ipaq, get the

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using this particular unit for a couple of weeks now, and I can say that I am very satisfied with it.  There are some advantages and disadvantages to both the unit and its operating environment, but I feel that this particular device offers the best balance between both.  The sound quality is clear, with a nice bass, and the volume level is high enough to drown out much of the ambient noise.  This also works very well for long recordings and when I am trying to record something very low-key, like a conversation on the subway.  I also like that the unit has the power and volume levels adjustable.  Although I've only used the device in a studio situation for about a week, I have already decided that I'll be replacing my entire computer/laptop with these.

I bought this model because I thought it was better than the older models that I used.  It works great, but I'm still on the lookout for a larger, more powerful SD card.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased my second iPad and bought the third one a month or so later (because the third is my favorite).   The first two are fantastic, but the third has some unique features that I really like.   It has a front camera, which I don't think I've ever used before.  It's also waterproof, unlike the other two.  I've had a few cases fall off, but so far I've been able to get them back on.  Also, it's built to last.  So far, I haven't had any problems with the battery dying after a long day of use.  The biggest benefit to having an all-in-one is you don't have to worry about plugging in your cables and connecting to the internet when you travel.  That might not be a big deal for you, but for me, having to plug in a dongle and plug in my adapter every time is ridiculous. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was able to get the DMR (Digital Multi-Device Radio) working with my iPad.

It's much more expensive than you might expect, but it worked great. I'm happy I tried it and will definitely buy more devices like this.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My PDA had about a week or two left and was getting hard to use due to a bad battery.

This little box can record CD audio on the fly while you're recording a song and it's incredibly easy to navigate using its buttons.  I've also used the track up/down buttons to record extra tracks at a time on my computer.  The included cables can work fine for me too.  In addition to these, I've used the included USB microphone and the included headphone.  It all works flawlessly.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this because I needed a USB to Serial converter (and this is the closest thing I could find) and wanted to try out the Linux operating system.   While this is a good converter, the documentation is incomplete and there are several features not supported.  I didn't know about this, but it will not work with any of my USB stick/drive readers.  This does not seem to affect the performance of the converter, so I think it's a bug, but not a defect.  For the price, I don't know if this will be enough to save me from the need to buy more USB drives (as the other USB to serial converters I've tried have been very expensive)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use this on my iPad Pro and it does the job very well. It's much lighter than the iPad's case so it's easy to carry around and it's pretty solid. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This was my first electronic device, and I am very happy that I purchased this. The remote does all the things that a normal key does. No weird fiddling with software. There are a few things I don't like about it, but overall, it's a very nice device.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use a G717 and a Panasonic Lumix GF5. I've had the G715 for a year now, and it's pretty much the same thing.   The G711 is not as smooth as a GF5 (it makes me shake my head when I use it), but it has a faster update rate.  When I have to switch cameras or play a movie, it goes so much faster that I don't have to press a button or get up from my computer to check something.  It's great for quick pictures or recording videos.  I'd buy the G11 over the G714 any day.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just bought the Xoom 4 and I'm loving it!   When it works as it should, it is fast and reliable.   There's no way I could use my older Xoom with all my other devices.  My older Xoodies were working fine until Apple changed their USB protocol.  This new Xoom and my other USB devices work fine. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It came within about a week of my order (3 days for international).  It is a great device for the price and the features it offers.   When using it for the first time, I thought, "Why did I pay so much when I could buy a decent-quality MP3 player for less?"  I'm a huge fan of Amazon Prime, so having to pay a monthly fee for the service was a bit of a turnoff.  It's a nice option, though.

It comes with tons of bonus software that I never knew existed. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've been using this keyboard for about 2 months now, and it's been great.  I can type quite fast on this keyboard, and I'm always on the lookout for better keyboards, and this one is one of them.  The keys are a bit mushy, but that just means I'm used to the mushy keys on the old IBM Model M.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the best digital camera I have ever used.   It has so much more than I need, and is very durable.  I can take my camera to the beach on a summer day, when it is too hot to stay indoors, and still have all my photos in one place.  It comes with an SD card so that I can copy the photos onto my computer, and then back to my camera. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great little USB device. It can hold up to 500 songs, but it's also convenient to have the ability to load up to a 500gb SD card with your music.  The only downside to this device is the price, but you get what you pay for.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the first audio device I've ever owned, and it's everything I'd hoped it would be. I had tried just about every single pair of headphones on the market for the last few years and found them pretty much useless.  This product is way better than the others.  It sounds great, has a good weight and feel, is pretty durable (I've dropped the unit at least three times, and not even a scratch!), and has USB and HDMI inputs which is just great.  I'm not sure how I ever got by on the inferior pair, but this one is fantastic!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a great little DAC/headphone amp. It was recommended by two different audiophiles as a good value for the price. It's a little on the warm side but I guess that's to be expected with a cheap headphone amp.  I use a cheap set of digital cables with my iPod and this one is perfect.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am very impressed with the ease of use and performance of the A-1's.  It has been about four months since I purchased it and I have been very pleased with its performance.  I have found it to be perfect for all my audio and video recording needs.  The mic is very good and the sound is clear.  Also, there is no lag or distortion with the microphone.   There have been a couple of times that I needed to record something and the camera couldn't capture it.  No problems with the audio at all. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is by far the best e-reader I've ever used.  I can flip between pages without having to read the back of the cover twice or worry about losing my place.  It's very light, compact, and fast.  The pages flip into view without any creaking.  There is no light leak, which is a big plus.  Also, the ability to flip pages in the dark, and the lack of creaking as you read (which I'm sure is a result of the hinges) are both nice features.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this camera for my  Sony A6000 camera.  I'm a fan of the A6000, but I had to upgrade to a  new model.  The camera worked with my A6000 just fine, but with its 1/3-inch sensor size, it wasn't perfect.  This camera, which has the same sensor, was perfect.   I can do all my normal shots and then do 4x3 crop-to-fit in my video.  With this camera I only need to change one setting, and it all works perfectly. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I own three of these and they are all wonderful.  The only thing I would change is that I would have rather had the SD card as well.  They use it for video and music and I don't even have SD cards to save my movies to.

The CD player is perfectly playable through this player, even when it has a bad signal.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got the Panasonic Toughbook in early November and immediately set about reviewing it, as it was just getting into the habit of shipping, and I figured the company would appreciate my review (since I'd been using them for several years). After I got my review unit, however, I realized I was using it a bit too much, and stopped doing so. I've just recently returned it and am using a second Toughbook to replace my original, and my experience with the new Toughbook is really excellent (and at a very good price). The unit is very nice, with a solid build quality, very good keyboard and overall user experience (if I may call it that), plus it's small enough to fit in my wallet. It's also got a built-in battery pack (or battery pack with internal battery pack), which allows the unit to keep its charge and function properly even when the keyboard is shut off or the computer is off.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am very pleased with this phone. It's very easy to set up and it works very well. I've already had a chance to use it on several flights.  It's the first time I've used a phone that works like it should.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   As you probably know by now, I am a huge fan of the HP-48D, so when the HP LP-60 came out, I was very pleased with the price, size and sound.   Unfortunately, I've had to return a few.  My last two returned to HP for being defective in that the power supply failed after only a few months.  That's disappointing.  The HP LP60, however, is perfect in every way.  It is the best portable mp3 player I've ever used.  I use it all the time on planes, trains, and planes to listen to music.  There is very little lag between pressing play and hearing the music.   I'm amazed by the quality.  When I'm using my phone or tablet to listen, I have to use an external speaker.  With the HP, I can listen to the music while walking around and using the rest of my devices.   It also comes with a ton of different MP3s that I use all the the time.  If you don't have one of these already, pick one up. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've had this for about 3 months now.  I use this to record videos of my cat, my husband, and my two small children at home.  It's a great little device, with a nice and bright display.   Unfortunately, I lost mine two weeks ago while I was on a trip.  Since then, I've searched high and low for it, but I couldn't find one anywhere, and the ones I've found don't work.  This is the first time I've tried using a USB camera, and this is by far the best one I've used thus far.  No lag.  All of the features are useful.  You get an SD card reader, as well as a USB hub.  Just makes sense.  If you're looking to replace your old camera, I would definitely recommend this.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been looking for a good, cheap, USB powered DAC to put in my iPod Touch and this one is pretty close. It works well, sounds good, and has a decent bit-rate for mp3 audio. The only negative aspect of this DAC is that it takes up a lot of space in my backpack. It's nice to have on the go but the little size does come in handy when I'm carrying a laptop with me (I have an ia64).
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iTunes app is pretty good.  A few things would be appreciated though: 1. If you use the same library of music over and over again, like me, the shuffle function is handy. It's a nice way to make sure you're getting the most out of a song without missing anything. 2. I use the default music player that comes with the iPod for watching videos. I find that the video player automatically plays the next track in the playlist without even asking.  It's nice to be able to skip tracks. 3. The iTunes app could also be optimized to show the songs and albums that you own in separate tabs.  The current iOS device that I'm using has a very limited amount of storage, so having songs in different folders makes the process of sorting through my music files a lot easier. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This phone has done its job perfectly.  The camera is excellent, especially for the price point.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this after reading some of the reviews. My initial reaction was to be skeptical of its ability to actually work.

It's easy to set-up, it's fast, it has a good sound and is surprisingly nice for a compact player.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have the newest version of this iPod, and it is amazing. The video quality is amazing and it's really quiet.

I just wish it was a bit cheaper than the rest of the iPod models.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the PDA-X to replace my PDA. I was very impressed with the features and price. The PDA had so many limitations as well, including the inability to delete files on a SD card. The new PDA, however, allows me to access all my files from the web. I have been using my old PDA for several years and had to replace it due to poor performance. I am very happy with my purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I used to be a music snob. I would buy and listen to just about anything, but couldn't bear to hear a decent CD player on the go, and I didn't want my laptop's internal speakers either. So, when the XO first came out and I got one, I thought it would be a great buy for my wife to use while working at the office. It did work, and it was even great for listening to music while doing laundry.   It was also very convenient for traveling with, as my phone has always fallen out of my pocket while driving.  But the XOs are really just a gimmick.  I'm pretty sure I can find good quality portable CD players for about the same price, and they're much smaller and less bulky.  Maybe there's some sort of market for something like the XOLO, but it just doesn't seem to fit in well with the consumer electronics industry.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I received my N5501s almost exactly two months ago and have used them very successfully so far.  They are very fast, very responsive and very accurate.  I bought these devices based on several factors:  First, my old (and still working)   was very slow.  Secondly,   the  N5511s   are also made by Hitachi,  which   is considered   by many to be the gold standard   of   digital cameras   (although   Sony is also very good   at   their own game.)  Third,  I had already  purchased several   Hitachi cameras in the past   and   had no real problems   with   any of them.  In fact,  the N5512s  (which I also purchased based on Hitachi   reliability)  is my   first (and currently only)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am absolutely in love with my new Audio Technica ATH-M50X.  I own many different audio equipment and have had very bad experiences with audio equipment in the past.  It really was the first one that really resonated with me.  Even after so many years of being disappointed with audio devices, I still consider the ATHM50 to be one of the best.  The sound is very clear, very well defined.  You get a very deep bass tone with a very solid lower end.  Also, the audio is very clean and very detailed.  This is a great little player.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use an iPod Mini as a portable mp3 player and this little thing has replaced it.  The sound is crystal clear and you don't feel the need to connect or charge your mp3 at all.   This is perfect for portable use and will be in my permanent music collection. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the best MP3 player I've ever used.  It's small and compact, and it gets the job done with ease.  You can easily fit all your mp3s on the unit.  I bought a good digital camera with its lens attached so that I can still take pictures with it even if the battery runs out.  With the unit, you can take full quality pictures without lugging around a bunch of bulky equipment. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been using my  I-PAD since October, 2007.   It's always been very well designed, very responsive, and has never failed me (although, I should mention, it's probably my fault, as it's been in use almost exclusively in the office, where I'm a bit more prone to screw up).   This year, however, I've noticed a change in the sound quality:  It has been almost completely silent.  This is, of course, not a bad thing:  However, there's no way in hell it could have been made any quieter.  I don't have to turn down the volume on the car stereo  or anything else to hear the car in my driveway: 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just bought a new Canon T3i.  It's the same camera I had for about a decade.  So I thought it would be a good idea to learn how to use it as my main camera.  I didn't expect anything too fancy from it, but it's an excellent compact camera. I think my favorite feature is the built-in flash, which lets me use my flash in low-light situations without a bulky external unit. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is great for the price and the quality. The battery lasts me a long time.   I use it to connect to my TV and use it as a DVR.  It keeps good track of all of the shows. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've used the same one for a few years now and was very pleased with it when I first bought it. The design is very good. The buttons are tactile and respond very quickly. I've even found myself using the volume and pause buttons for searching the web and watching videos. I also like the way the microphone works, so I can use it while I'm driving. I can't seem to find a good remote for this unit, but I'm looking into options. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've owned several different electronic devices over the years but none have come close to the performance of the Saffire 7.   Not only is it a great sounding card, it's a pleasure to use.  I use my Saffires for recording my albums, my digital audio work, and my media player.  The only reason I haven't gotten another Saffira is because I've gotten so much from my last Saffis. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been using this device since my laptop broke.  The device has worked flawlessly, from being totally dead to being completely operational and using the entire SD card in an hour or so.  I am very satisfied. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got the "digital camera" as a Christmas gift this year, and it came well packaged and looked great. When I got it up and running, I was impressed by the resolution and quality of the image captured.  I also appreciated the size of the camera, which is perfect for keeping on my desk at work. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It took less than 2 minutes to connect to my laptop to transfer photos.  I was able to transfer over 1,000 pictures in less than 30 seconds.  The included SD card is big and fast too.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a great unit.   It's much better than I expected.  I am still getting used to the buttons, but I can already find my way around the screen and it's very fast to connect to my computer. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased a Yubico I can link to my iPad for offline access. This is the best I've found. I'm not a hardcore Android fan, but this thing is so lightweight and small (4 1/2") that it is perfect for my phone. It's so nice to be able to quickly browse the web on my phone while on the bus.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The SD card can be used to write your favorite mp3s to, or your pictures to, your SD card and the unit will write them back in mp3 format.  It is so handy!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Panasonic HC-CCD 3MP Video Camcorder is a big deal because of its 3MP resolution. Not only can I see better detail in my videos, but there is little or no compression artifacts in the video. This makes the video much clearer and makes capturing video very easy. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use my Samsung smart phone and my Sony digital camera.  The Samsung has been in my wallet for several years but when I picked up my Sony, I wanted to use it immediately.  Since the Samsung only has 16gb of storage, I had to download photos and videos onto my phone.  This wasn't a big deal, but I also wanted to back up all my photos and movies onto a memory card.  I used my Samsung for that but now, with this Sony, it works much better.  Now I can take photos and have them on my phone without having to back them up to a memory stick.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I used to have an old Sony Walkman which I loved, but it was very noisy and constantly needed batteries, especially in the car. The SACD-HC is very good, especially for it's price, and can't be beat for movies. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had to replace my laptop computer because the screen got fuzzy and the touchpad stopped working after about 2 years of normal use.  I looked online and decided to purchase the HP TouchPad 128Gb.  It arrived within a week of ordering and it works very well.  The touchpad works with several programs and is smooth to use. I was a bit surprised to find the batteries last longer than I had hoped.  All in all, I am very satisfied with this purchase. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased these two sets (one set for my PC, another set for another PC) a month ago for my parents.  They have both PCs, so I thought I could try them out to see how they worked.  The units arrived yesterday and I have put them together, put them in a PC case, and installed the software.  After doing all that, I can't believe I waited so long for something like this!   They work like a charm!  They look so good and are so easy to use.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This phone is absolutely amazing.  I used to have a very good phone, but the battery was terrible.  The  Galaxy Note 2  was a huge upgrade, and I loved the  S Pen.   The only thing I really don't like about  this phone  is that it only comes in a couple of colors.  If  the  Galaxy S4  had a black  phone like  this, I probably would have bought  it  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The iPad mini has been an incredible boon to my day-to-day life.  I use my iPad every single day, and I use it for work as well as for entertainment.  It is so easy to use that I feel like I've been using a computer for years now.  There are so many apps that are available for free on the iTunes store that I can't keep up.  And the price is right. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This little device is fantastic!  I use it to take snapshots of my   MacBook Air (and the screen is too small for my camera, so I can't take any of those!)  I can save each frame in PNG and get a full-size image at the same time.  The only problem is that I'm not very creative with that image.  It might be better to capture a single frame per time interval.   It's so great to have the images I need in the moment. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the Sager HDS-1 with the Sony NEX-3. The HDS is very easy to use. I bought it because I wanted to use it as my main camera, and I'm very happy that I did. The NEX has some drawbacks that I haven't come across with the HDS. However, the SAGER HDS has excellent resolution and very smooth transitions. The exposure modes are great, as are the RAW files. The flash is not very powerful, but it's useful.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's exactly what I was looking for.   I used it with an old Sony CD player as a media player and found it perfectly adequate.  It records at up to 96 kHz with no problems.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am extremely satisfied with my Sony NEX-3N.   It has all the features I need and it is extremely easy to use.  I never thought I would be able to take video on my smartphone without a dedicated camera.  In the past, I have relied on DSLR's because of the extra features I needed.  Now, I simply have my NEX with me on all my trips. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am very satisfied with the sound quality of my Sony Walkman.  The Walkman is a great MP3 player and a decent camera.  I bought mine at Walmart for $60.  It works well and I am using it for all of my MP3 players. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPod is the one device that I never get tired of using.  It has the ability to play almost any music available on the market and has never been too picky about what type of audio quality I get.  The CD player is the only downfall, as it takes up more space than I would like and often times I have to listen to music on it in place of the radio, but I'm fine with that. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a K5 with a TFT display for my Panasonic HD-DVD player a while back.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased the PicoBrite from Adafruit as a Christmas gift for a friend.  I was very happy with the device until I tried to use it to play some HD video.  The card was only capable of playing videos at 480p and this video was at 2.8 gigabytes.  It took quite some time to transfer the file to the PICO-Brite (the card has a read/write speed of 3.6 M/s)  It then took a little longer to burn the file back to the card.  At this point, the video was completely corrupt and unplayable.  In short, this card is too slow to use with the P.B.T.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The eZune is very good.  You can listen to MP3s and play music in the background while you work.  It also lets you set up playlists and allows you to transfer music to your e-reader.  The price is great and you get a lot of value.   I wish there was a flash drive version, but that's probably a small price to pay for the convenience.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This was my first portable hard drive and I'm so glad I bought it.  The unit itself is nice, but it's the software that makes it great.  This isn't the standard Windows or OSX user interface.  Instead, you'll find it's very minimalist, with very nice design and good functionality, but very little clutter.  It even has built in encryption, which can be disabled by the user.  Overall, I think it's a good product and it'll save me some money in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have bought 2 of these devices so far.  They seem to be very stable.  The first time I got them, the battery seemed to die first (a bit of an annoyance).  The second time I took it to the store, the batteries (that are supposed to last for years!) still worked fine.  So far, I'm very satisfied. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I like this sound card quite a bit. It's faster than the sound card from a laptop and the quality of the sound is better. You get more bits from your source to work with, and there are some good digital to analog converters that can actually decode some of the better quality sources.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this for my iPod because I wanted to use it to listen to audio files on my computer but couldn't find a good way to connect the device to a computer in my car (the iPod's computer cable didn't fit and the iPod wouldn't work with a USB-MIDI adapter I had).  This device, though expensive, works perfectly and it's exactly what I was looking for.  It's really easy to connect and has great quality audio. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got the Ettron Quattro II last fall and love it.  It's not a pocket computer, but it's really quite impressive for its size and price.  I use it to write and edit electronic documents.  The touch screen works great.  Battery life is good.   The Ettro II is compatible with most printers, but the Etron also comes with a scanner, so I can also use that.  Great buy, especially since you can order it in different colors for different uses.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this as a replacement for my iBook because it has an optical drive, and iBook had an internal optical drive. This unit is definitely worth the upgrade. You can download an entire library of MP3 songs for only $5, plus you get a free CD for every three songs you download, which I highly recommend. The display is bright and the sound quality is excellent. Also, since it is an iBook, it comes with an extra drive that is used to store images from the camera. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love the sound quality and flexibility of the   iRiver   It can play most MP3 players and CD players (although it is a little less efficient than the newer iPods).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The TACADAVIA SX-20 is my latest addition to my stereo. It has a USB port, and a headphone port as well. I have found that the USB port allows me to connect my iPod more easily than a regular RCA jack. I've been using my iPod with this TACDAVIA a lot more, which is a big benefit.  I also like the fact that the TAC's headphone jack has a volume control, just like my own. I haven't used the audio input jack, because the TADAVA is a digital device, and the analog connection (RCA) is just not as good.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The device has so far saved my life.  I was having problems with the back of my iPod and the Lightning cable.  So I started looking for a different solution.  My iPod is still working fine and is still perfectly usable as a hard drive.  The cable I was using before broke very quickly.  That is no longer an issue with this device.  This has allowed me to make backups of music from my iPod.  Also, I can still use my phone's headphones.  All I need is a small device that can connect to a micro-USB port on my computer.  It's a win-win!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great little digital audio player and recording device. The interface is very smooth and very well built. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the sound quality isn't fantastic. The digital input can record up to 44.1kHz/16-bit and the CD player will accept either 24-bit or 24-192kHz MP3's (or both) at 1/8 or 1/16. The CD player doesn't support any type of digital recording other than a 24-KHz sample rate. The player itself is very quiet and the volume is very low, so your recordings can be heard a few seconds after the device turns off.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's amazing! I used to use Sony's camcorder and the sound is pretty bad. This thing is way better. You don't need to use a lot of headphones. The video is crystal clear and it sounds very natural. The camera is also very good. I didn't buy it just for the camcorders. I was really expecting the camcs to be crap, but I was very pleasantly surprised with this one. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use this as my main computer and am very happy with the performance of it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am very happy with my XDS. I have had it now for 4 months. The size is perfect, and I really like the size and functionality of the thumb drive. I've been able to save all of my photos on it, but I also love that I can transfer movies to it as well.  I don't have a lot of movies, but it's still a great way to access them.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I used to be a very avid user of digital video recorders, but recently I realized that I could get more out of my digital video recorder than what I was getting in terms of picture quality and sound quality.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My first digital camera was a Canon Rebel, and it was great for getting still shots.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The iPod nano is so small and light that it's basically in the same category as my flip phone.  It's small enough that I can easily carry it around the house.  I use the touch screen all the time because it has a decent number of features and the screen is very responsive.  However, I haven't tried many of the other features, such as digital camera, MP3 player, GPS, etc.  This is a great little device for those situations where a regular phone might be too large.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It is fast, very reliable, and has a good sound quality.   I have a Panasonic HS-R8 and I will always be using it as my main camera for video.  The sound quality of the Panasonic HS11 is very similar to the sound quality  of the camera.  It has a decent enough sound to get the job done without being too annoying. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A couple years ago I had a Panasonic ICR-C, which I replaced because I lost the battery. I was very unhappy with that.  I had to buy another Panasonic camera for my Sony RX100, because I thought it would be too much trouble to connect to my Sony.  It turns out that's exactly the problem.  There is no way to connect the Sony RX to the camera.  The camera can only be used on a PC.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had used a digital camera for a number of years prior to buying my first digital camera.

Fortunately I managed to get my camera back, but now I have to spend another $60 just to replace the card.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use my ereader almost exclusively on the road for reading e-books on the go and on my iPad.  I recently bought this ereader to replace a very old one that I couldn't get to work right.  The cover is much more comfortable than the old one and the back cover is made out of sturdy cardboard.  This version of the ereader is much cheaper than the one my older one had, which was made by Sony.  My older one would crack after a few years of use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using the iStick for about a year and a half now, and it has already become my go-to charger. The design is clean, elegant, and works very well.  The buttons are well spaced, and the backlight is very bright.  My only complaint is that the adapter for the battery that comes with the unit can only be used with the iSub S (as it lacks an adapter to hold the S Plus), but it's a pretty minor complaint compared to all the other great things I have gotten from this product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It is a good product, and the price is perfect.  The build quality and features are both very good, with the built in memory and SD card slot really being the icing on the cake.  I haven't used it much, but it will last a long, long time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I used the Samsung 850 Pro for a while and was very happy.  I then got a Samsung 850 EVO 256 MB, which was much more reliable, and was just as good.  Both worked fine, so I got the 128 MB one.  The only problem with it is it doesn't support RAID, so if you have a lot of data that needs to be written, you have to have more than one drive to write to.  But that's easily solved by buying two more drives, and having them all act as RAID 5.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this for my daughter's birthday.  She's always wanted a Nintendo 64, but I wasn't sure how much she'd like it.  It was perfect for her, with all the games she'd been asking me to get her.   It's a great system. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This thing is amazing. It's small and compact, but it's got tons of features.  I have two Apple watches, and this one gives me a lot of great functionality I didn't even know I wanted.  The built in fitness tracking is really great, and I can get workout details and stats on my watch that are useful without using my phone.  It can connect to my Fitbit with a single cable, but I don't really use that much.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a good USB memory card reader/writer   When I first bought my first USB memory cards, I was not impressed at all.   They were not very cheap, and were made in China.  Now that I've got more of these, I don't really care that much about their quality   I use the reader/Writer for my Sony PSP and a few other cards 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use my laptop primarily for work. The fact that I can use my phone (which was on the verge of failure for several years) and use my computer at the same time is a great thing. I have an iPhone 5 and I have been able to make it work.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This card reader is amazing. I have used many, but this is by far the best. The card reader can handle lots of card sizes (and the card reader on my laptop can't handle the newer MMC and SD card formats). I've even been able to use it with the card slot at my local Wal-Mart where I'm a frequent customer. I've had the reader for a week now and so far I'm very satisfied. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this item because I was in search of a good wireless USB soundcard for my  iMac.  The product works flawlessly with a brand new Mac and is compatible with all the free drivers and software that come with the Mac.  It was very easy to connect to the Mac via its Ethernet cable.   All of the software I needed to use with it was included.  I have already used the USB audio drivers on the iMac with great success. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a couple of the original Sony Walkmans. They were great. But the new one is very nice. I've been playing back my old tapes since the late 90's.  It's very easy to navigate and it's much louder and clear than the previous model.  I'm not the biggest fan of the CD player, but the digital options are a big plus.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this card for use with my Apple Powerbook for a work project.   It is exactly what I needed - the best possible media on my Apple.  I'm a die hard Apple fan and was looking for a good card that was compatible with my Powerbook,  but the prices on the Web are prohibitive.  This one is just as good as the $15 that I spent on a different model of the same card.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently purchased a 2-inch digital camera and found the software to be much better and more user-friendly than what I had previously used. The pictures it takes are very clear and the quality is excellent. The software is so user- friendly that it has made me want to get my hands on a 3-inch camera just for the software alone.

I have a Canon EOS camera and I find it so cumbersome to use that I use my iPhone.  My camera works so well, but I always carry a camera anyway, and I don't have to pay for a camera when I use the phone.  I love how well the Canon and iPhone work together.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this device because I'm a total audiophile and would love a good DAC/Amp. Unfortunately it's not much better than the Sennheiser CX 576. Not the lowest bit of noise, or the worst distortion, but it lacks detail, is muddy and not very usable. I'm going to get the SACD instead. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently purchased an HP LaserJet and used it to produce a few photographs that I am working on at home. The quality of the images produced by this machine are excellent.   With a couple of minor problems, however, I would not recommend this purchase.  First, the batteries that came with the machine seem to be fragile.  I had one explode while the camera was still in the machine.  It blew out a hole in the drive housing.  This sort of problem is not unique to this machine.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great unit.  I purchased a new one for my iPod, and it is now my go-to unit for music playback.  Very responsive, easy to use, and most important, accurate.  The price is right, and the quality is excellent.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the HD-A25, and I am very satisfied.  It's so much better than the previous unit I had.  The sound is crystal clear, and the picture is very good.  I also like the fact that the DVD player is in the back instead of the front. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound quality on the A5 is phenomenal. I've had numerous portable CD players and portable digital players in my life, but this one has it all.   With the A3, I found it impossible to set my iPod to its lowest volume, because it sounded so bad.  I don't know if this is due to my lack of musical knowledge, but the A2/A4 sound just doesn't sound as good as the A4 on my iPod, even with the same CD.  This iPod is my life. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased my Seiko SRP3 because I found an inexpensive timepiece that was as accurate as I wanted it to be, but it was also slightly less accurate.  When I received the SRP6, I was very impressed.  Not only is it as accurate (0.03 seconds per day vs. 0.05 seconds per year) as my earlier timepiece, it's also more accurate (to the degree that it's just as accurate at my house as it is at my office).  It's also cheaper (about half the price of my previous timepiece) and has more features (accuracy and date display, battery backup, and a countdown timer for a stopwatch).  All in all, I'm very happy with this timepiece.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The AVerMedia iM2 DVD burner works well.  It saves me tons of time at work.  I can save tons of CDs without having to load them into my computer.  The discs I use the most are the first four Batman movies.  They come in nice plastic cases with extra artwork on the cover and on the spine, but the art is really not too good.  This AVer Media DVD burner cuts out the unnecessary art.  Also, the DVD burners come with a DVD player, which is nice.  There are lots of third-party DVD players on the market.  Even if you don't have one, you can connect a DVD drive to your computer and watch DVDs from other companies on your computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had a number of different digital cameras over the years. The only one I've been happy with has been the D3200 from Sony (which cost about the same as this new camera).  I still use the same Sony digital cameras that I have in the past:  1) Sony Alpha a6000 (for the best color rendition), 2) Sigma 35mm F1.4 Art (for good low light performance), and 3) Nikon D70 (for great portraits).  The new Panasonic Lumix GH5 has replaced all my other digital cameras.  I've got pictures from a variety of lenses on it so far, so I'm sure I'll be just fine.

The remote is a nice touch as well, and the battery life is great. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A great little product.   When I first bought it, I was pretty nervous about having a serial port.  The serial port that came with my IBM is quite old and won't work on newer machines.  But the USB version is much more flexible and is perfect for my needs.  It is also fairly inexpensive, at least for what you get. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently purchased the USB keyboard for my Mac, and I must say, I am impressed.  The keyboard is easy to type on, and has a very good sound quality.  Even better, the computer has been running without problems for more than a month, so I'm pretty sure it won't get any more corrupt or hard to use.  If you're planning on purchasing this device, I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use the Panasonic PX-10 with my digital camera and have had no problems with it. The PX10 is very easy to use with my Nikon S2n. It is also very quiet while recording, which is a big plus for recording to my computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The E-mu MP3 Player is a great sounding MP3 player, but it is also very inexpensive.  I have purchased it twice already, and both times I have really liked it.  It is much easier to use than my old CD player.  The batteries last forever.  In the few times that my batteries have died, I have found that it only took a few minutes to replace them.  If you buy this player, I would highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've always had a strong interest in electronic devices and audio gear. I got the DR650 because I liked the name, and it was just the right size and price. I had to buy it anyway because my old one was starting to make noise. The only downside is that it takes up too much room in the room for me to use it as my main rig. Still, I'm happy with it so far.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the best sound card I've used.  The sound is so clear and has amazing bass that I use it almost exclusively as my main sound card.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this to record my shows on my   PC in real time.

The recorder recorded the audio and video in real-time  and with no issues.  I would recommend  this  device

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This device is a joy to use.  It is very fast at loading music, although not always as good at storing as I'd like.  The included CD player can only play a certain number of files at a time.  I use to hate the thing.  Now I'm hooked.

I love the fact that it doesn't come with a monitor and keyboard, and has its own keyboard and trackpad 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using my Sony Handycam SONY HVX2 digital video camera for about 4 years now.  I use it for everything from my day job, to movies, to live television, to my kids.  It's very easy to use, is very compact, and takes good video.  While I enjoy shooting my movies on my PC, the convenience of having it on my camera makes it much easier. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    After owning and using a lot of high end and expensive audio equipment I had to admit that the Apple iPod was an excellent value.   My last two iPod's have been used daily by various family members as well as my own kids.  All the music and videos are great and I can listen at a comfortable volume, even if they're in a car.  With the iPod nano, I can't get the speakers to work (the car speakers do but the Apple does not), but I'm getting better at finding new ways to make them work.  The only downside I have is the size.  It's a bit big for my car, especially since I don't usually carry around a lot in my car anyway.  I would like it if the speakers could be folded down a bit so I wouldn't have to worry about them getting tangled up or accidentally falling out.  Otherwise, it's an amazing piece of hardware and I'm happy I own one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have used the Apple iPhone and iPad for two years now.  I am an active duty Airman, and I have to carry a laptop around in a case,  as my iPad has been my primary device for the past year.  So, I was very excited to hear that the iPad 2 comes with a full sized USB port.   It does come with a small adapter for use with the standard USB port, but that is about it.  The iPad 2's USB port is very slow, and it is very frustrating.  When you try to transfer or copy files to and from the iPad, you have to wait for a few seconds or longer, until the file is actually transferred.  While this is fine for music and photos, it is frustrating for video and movies.  Overall, I am very happy with the iPad's portability, but the lack of speed is a big disappointment.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use a digital audio player for my MP3 player and I've found it to be far superior to any other player I've tried.   It is far easier to use, has a better sound quality, and has a few other perks that make it worth the price. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was impressed with the quality and design of this product. It took several attempts to get it to work right, but finally it did! I am now working with my own copy of XKCD to help me with my homework and it is working pretty well.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This thing is amazing!  There is just such a rich, smooth sound coming out of it.  It's like I'm playing on a CD player, but with the richness of an audiophile device.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it doesn't have an AUX input, which I really like.

I've had several cheap radio with only a few features  I can actually use, but this one can do them all.  When I use it to monitor my garden's water level I can see how much I've drained it, and how much more water is still in it.  It also works great to monitor the temperatures of my pots and pans.  With the built-in thermometer I can check them at the end of each day  and make sure they aren't going to burn up in the next few days.  The battery life is great, especially when I use the bluetooth to communicate with my cell phone, and that also has a few extra features

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use the T1R-10M Digital Video Recorder on my Sony a7R. It's small and light. The resolution is perfect. I record to an SD card for storage on my computer and the files are fine. The only thing that bothers me is the ability to record 1080p/60Hz video, but that's what the Panasonic GF1 has. I've used the Sony since its release and it's pretty darned good, but the Panasonic's superior video quality just isn't there. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   As a digital photographer, the Lexar 8GB SD card is a godsend. I have the full version of both of the Lexars (one 8.5x11, the other 12x14) and the only way to save images (and movies, etc.) is to use the included SD card adapter.  I'm not sure if the 8.6x11 version is any better, since I don't have the smaller one, but when I use the smaller SD card to back up my digital camera, everything is a mess.  Using the adapter and external card, I can now take any camera I own and get a usable image.

The   old   model   included a built in CD player   for use with   all my favorite   records   but that   CD player was unreliable   and   constantly required a software update.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This thing works perfectly. The sound quality is very nice, as is the range of songs.  It's a shame that it doesn't play MP3's (which many of us love), but that's the price we pay for "high quality".

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased my iPhone 4 (    ) last September and I was really happy with it until the day that my service and replacement parts finally arrived. The battery in the phone wasn't a replacement unit, it was a second-hand unit purchased from a third-party seller.   After waiting and being disappointed with   the quality of   my replacement   battery   and having the phone not work for months, I decided to try out   this   i Phone   to see if it   would   give   me   a   quality   experience.  It   did   amazingly   for   less   than   what   other   sites   were   charging   per   hour !  It was a very positive   purchase  ! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I recently purchased a $150 mp3 player called the E-Max.  I've been a huge fan of the E Ink for years.  After looking at some other products, the MP3 player was the one that seemed to be the closest to what I wanted.  The design is very slim, the player works well and I love the extra buttons!  I was also very happy to find that this player does not require a power adapter.   The remote also has two more buttons than the E ink remote, so there is plenty of room to add some other buttons if I decide to.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the product and am looking forward to buying more products from Sony. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have used many different brands over the years. None of them were as good as this one. It was very simple to set up, very easy to use. I love that I can store my files on the SD card. I use it for music and video and it always works. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This thing is awesome.  It makes my iPod so much more usable and more convenient to use.  The ability to play back tracks I've deleted with one touch is just awesome.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is such a huge improvement over the original unit that I bought about two years ago.  It is much easier to use, more powerful, and the menu's are way easier to navigate and understand.  The only thing I wish is that the volume levels are not quite as tight as the unit on my original unit, but other than that, I can't be happier.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It worked very well for a year and a half.  It was never quite as reliable as other devices, but it worked great the first year or so.  I had to buy another replacement a couple of times because it would not charge correctly.  The only problem I had with it was that it would sometimes get damaged if I dropped it on hard surfaces. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The e-cig I bought is a little on the heavy side for me (I'm a vaper). I ordered 2 (2 for the price of one at full price) and they are really nice. I'm very satisfied so far. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The iPod works really well for me, especially when I use it in conjunction with the portable digital camera and my smartphone.  I can store all of my CDs and DVDs, and use my iPod to listen to music on my portable devices at the same time.  You just have to use a short piece of clear plastic as a cover for the iPod, which is perfect.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had a Toshiba Satellite PDA that worked fine for several years, but I got an upgrade from a Toslink and had no trouble. Unfortunately, the Toslink died about two years ago, so I bought this one because it has better graphics and has an SD card slot.  It works flawlessly, and I'm very happy.

I recommend this player to anyone who wants a good quality player and great sound quality.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm very happy with this purchase.  I already owned an iPod for years, but when I bought my new HDX the iPod wasn't compatible (it wasn't until this HDX came out that I realized my iPod didn't have a dock!).  The HDX can play most (if not all) the music I already own, but it has the convenience of being able to do so at a higher quality.  In addition, it looks nice and it looks good on my wall (which is why I got it).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been a loyal user of the iPod Touch for over a year. After my phone died last year, I looked into buying the iPod touch but found it so expensive that I decided I didn't need another device. I don't own a car or expensive electronics.  It is now 4 months later and my iPod has still not died.  The thing I like the most about this device is the remote.  I can use it to skip tracks or play music.  They should add some extra functions. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am very satisfied with the sound quality of the JVC K-70.  It has a good balance between clarity and presence, and the bass is very tight and focused.  This is great for playing the piano, which tends to be very quiet.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I own a Panasonic Toughbook. I've owned many others, but none are as thin and light as the Toughbook, which is a big plus in my opinion.  The included battery is a little large, but I've used the included batteries in my other Toughbooks.  This is my third Toughbook - I had the original with my first e-reader (Nook) and the second with my last e-readers (iPad and Samsung S4). I've been very pleased with all of them - they are extremely portable and have been extremely durable.

It's ultra-fast, has great sound quality and is very, very affordable.  I use it for my iPod and for music when I'm away from home.  My only complaint is that the REN is made in Japan, which makes the batteries a little harder to find, but otherwise great.

It is so cheap that I can't imagine buying another digital camera if I had to pay over $100 for it.   You can record HD video using a micro SD card in the camera at about 60 fps.  The video quality is much better than that of the expensive digital cameras.  I shoot with it all the time and have not had any problems with the pictures.

The Magic Keyboard's keys are far less sensitive, and the keys themselves have very little friction to them.  Overall, I think this is a good purchase 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought my PS2 with a USB adapter about 5 years ago and it is now over 10 years old and still working perfectly.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This iPod/MP3 player is very good. I have both an original iPod and an iPhone, but this beats them both hands down. I can stream songs and even read books from it. The screen is great too, although it is a little on the small size, I can still see what's on the screen. The volume control is handy too. I would highly recommend this product!

I wanted to buy a digital recorder because my MP3 player is too slow and unreliable. This recorder is so much more reliable and has good sound. I will be buying more D-series converters for my other digital gear. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    After having the iPod shuffle and the original iPod I was pretty disappointed that Apple didn't release a decent digital music player.  This is very close.  It has the sound quality of the shuffle and a lot more features.  The CD player is also pretty solid and I like that it can play digital music. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Tascam DA-40 digital audio recorder is a great little device, both to record my studio recordings, and to play back my home recordings, like my cassettes and MP3s.  It's lightweight and easy to use, with a lot of recording features built in.  I have an old RCA jack that I plugged into the recorder as well, so I can plug a cassette player or a CD player into it, and still use the RCA input.  The recorder also has an optical audio out, so you can listen to it on an iPod or even an external MP3 player. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm so excited to get this as my first HD DVD player! I'm in my last year of college and need all the devices I can get to help me get my classes done.  I've been using the Macbook for my iTunes and PDF files, but it's a bit slow (and heavy).  With the HD DVD drive, I can download the movie and then watch it on the go.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's small and has the capacity to store a lot of data, and it comes with a USB drive that is small enough for a lot to fit in it.

As I was browsing the Internet I was surprised by the amount of data that I can store on it.    I've also been trying to make the transition to USB drives from my PC, but the one that came with my phone was so big that I had to use a large flash drive to put it on my PC.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my first time purchasing from Sony and I am very satisfied with the product and service.   I bought this for use with my ipaq, a very low-end netbook with a very poor display.  My ipaq had a terrible case for it that was almost impossible to take off, and the case was very prone to getting scratched.  I was reluctant to spend so much money on something with limited use, but I found this case on Amazon and bought it.  The device is extremely well built and the screen is excellent.  If I had to do it all over again, I would have gotten the 5200

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's easy to use, you can adjust the level of volume with the touch of your finger, and it gives great sound.  The headphone jack is a little wobbly and the cord is also a little weak, but I use this phone a lot for my work and don't really care. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is an amazing audio device.   It's a little bit expensive for what you get, but it's amazing.  I was listening to my iPod in my car while driving, and the sound came through very clearly on my system.  The bass was very good, but the mids and highs were very clear as well.  They were also very audible. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have this digital camera (which is very much like the digital camera you get at the store when you buy a digital camera) for about a year now. It's been used mainly for taking photos of my kids. My oldest son's friends are constantly using it to take photos. It doesn't let them upload those photos onto a computer, but it does let them see them at their convenience. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been wanting a decent mp3 player for a long time.  This is it.  It has all the functions of a CD player, except the ability to play mp3s.  The player itself is fairly large, and the buttons are easy to navigate and use.   The volume control is nice and crisp, and allows you to adjust the volume from the "on" position to the "off" position.  I like the digital playback features, especially because you can save files to the player using any media file manager app. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the Sony CD/DVD player about a year and a half ago and have used it only a couple of times, but each time I was happy with it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The best thing about this is that it's totally silent.  There are other USB microphones out there that are louder than this, and they also have noise cancelling technology built in.  This one doesn't.  It's perfect for my video needs.  I use it while recording interviews for a lot of different reasons, but for sports or movies, it's the perfect audio solution.

I've never had a problem with it until recently, when the trackpad stopped working.  My old trackpad was so much worse, I'd just replace it every year or so.  That problem was resolved, and the new trackpad is much better.  The new one has much greater precision, much better speed and is more responsive.  For $15, I have no complaints

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been looking for a good, inexpensive, and portable mp3 player for a long time.  I've been using a D-VHS recorder (which I no longer use) and was always disappointed with the quality of the recording.  Then I bought the iPod, which I absolutely love.  But it has one big flaw -- it needs to be connected to a computer to play back music.  The D- VHS player only has a "burn in" feature.  It can't be used on a computer or a computer device.  This is a big bummer.  So I got the iTouch 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have owned a   Sony Walkman for the past 6 years and I have had nothing but positive things to say about it.   It is incredibly portable.  It can store mp3 files on it  and play them through my car's stereo.  If the battery dies, the songs still play through the car's speakers.  I can easily put it in the trunk and leave it there.  The speakers are excellent.  Some of the songs on my  CD player are so good that I have to turn off my car stereo to hear them.  This is a very smart   purchase

There were also several other errors that he could never reproduce.  It was pretty frustrating, but I've been through many bad devices so I know how to get it working.  This is my second unit (and I bought the older one for my first computer).

It also has a very nice rubberized surface, which I find very comfortable. I'm going to buy more of these when I need to use a computer a lot more.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm not a big fan of digital cameras, but I was so excited about my Sony RX100 that I bought it. I've now had it for 3 weeks and I'm really liking it.  It doesn't get as much light as my Canon Rebel XT, but that's not a deal-breaker. I also like the way it handles the big-brand lenses so I don't have to get a separate adapter to use them.  I also really like the fact that it's waterproof.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a digital camera a couple of years ago from Ebay for $30.  The camera worked fine until I started using it to make video, which it does.  I've never used a digital video camera before and never expected to, so it was a nice surprise to find out it works.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm really pleased with my X-Box One.   The games are fast and it connects very smoothly.  It's more powerful than my original X-BOX, but it's also more expensive.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The first thing that attracted me to this little device was the fact that you could buy different flavors at a reasonable price. It's just as if the companies actually tested each flavor and chose the best one for their customers. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently purchased a new Dell Inspiron 15R with the new AMD graphics card for my home PC.  My previous HP Pavilion w/ Intel Graphics 6500 worked well for playing games, watching videos, and doing web browsing.  However, I found that it was too slow for other tasks I wanted to perform on my computer.  Since I use my laptop for general web browsing and writing, the AMD card made no sense to me.  This Dell Inspirion comes close to the HP in terms of performance, but still does not have the speed I need.  I'm pretty satisfied with this purchase, as the hardware is excellent and I will get to use the card for a long time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this for my iPhone 5 but use it on my Samsung Galaxy S3 all the time now. It's perfect. I've used my iPhone and Galaxy S2 in my car as a secondary screen for my GPS and music and now have a really nice backup screen on my S3 for when the S3 runs out of juice.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A good, compact, well-designed MP3 player.   It's a lot of fun to use and the sound is good.  It doesn't have any annoying digital compression.  If you're looking for an MP3 recorder that costs less than $100, look no further. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have owned a few Sony products over the years, and this is my first high-end one.  I've always been pleased with the sound quality and the camera is excellent.  The battery life is a little disappointing.  However, Sony has never stopped making improvements. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have only owned a couple of high quality digital cameras. The Sony cameras have been the best. I was very happy with my new Sony PXW-FS7. The built-in battery life is the main advantage and that is really important for taking good pictures. I am going to get a higher quality camera for a friend, but the PXF7 is the most fun I have had with one in years. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the best video recorder I have ever used! I used to own a Sony HD-VP1 that was discontinued due to a manufacturing flaw and I have always wanted to own one of these because they are so cheap. This new model is much better. You can record up to 10 hours of high quality video at once. You get 3 options to adjust the audio settings - very nice for interviews! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I really like the built in speakers and mic, but it would be nice to have a headphone jack.  It seems like they cut corners, but that's to be expected in a $100 unit. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm using a new Samsung flip phone (SS 8.0) for the first time.

I don't miss the old flip phone   at all  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been very pleased with this product.  It works extremely well for connecting my iPod to my computer, and it provides great sound quality.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the Sennheiser HD-650 2.0mm cable for the SONY HD-P50 (my current computer). The cable is really convenient. It has an easily removable plug, a small hole for using a standard headphone-plug adapter, and an adapter for my Bose QuietComfort 12.  I also like the USB power.  It was nice to use the wireless remote when I needed to.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I just received my Kingston 128MB SD card in the mail. The packaging was really nice; the drive itself is amazing and the card itself is very well built.  My only problem is that the SD card that came with my MacBook Pro was damaged (I'm assuming it's from a previous computer crash) and required some sort of new one.  I'm not a computer expert, so I wasn't sure if I could get a new one from Apple, so i went out to the local Best Buy and ordered a new 32MB SD.  When it arrived, it was formatted as 64MB, and I thought it was a mistake.  However, the drive works perfectly!  The interface is great, and everything has been just fine since I switched it in (although I have a couple problems right now).  Hopefully this will keep working for a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The AVerMedia XM-L2 has been an amazing little portable device for me.  It does a great job of getting the majority of my MP3 and WAV files to play back at the same time.  I even have a few on my ipod that I use to play songs.   I am happy to say that I am still able to use my ipad to do my podcasting and video editing. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got the iStick as a Christmas present a few years ago. I love it. I've had my  iSticks since 2006. They're the best  I've used so far.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this device specifically to use with a digital camera and I love it   The camera comes out nice and clear, it's small and easy to use and I can easily get my shots just how I want them.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As an avid electronic device owner, the SIP is great! I get calls and texts from my family, my business, my girlfriend and my two-year-old niece all the time. When my iPhone was missing, I used the Sip a lot to stay connected and get a better grasp on what was happening.  It saves me time when I need to make phone calls or answer them quickly.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am really happy with my first e-reader:  I purchased it for my 11-year-old nephews and they both really liked the books it read and the video and movie playback it provided.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's a great portable digital camera!  It has so many great features: it has a built-in memory card slot for saving your photos, a microSD card slot, a built in lens cover for better picture quality, a high-resolution camera, and so much more.  The best part is that you can take photos on your computer or tablet, email or print them off, or transfer them to a digital camera and then upload them directly to your camera.  It takes a lot of work to figure out the best way to use all the features but if you are willing to put in the time, you can save lots of money, get really great photos, and even get professional-looking prints of your photos.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use this a lot as a backup hard drive.  When the old one fails, this one is perfect.   It has enough space to install all of my software.  It's small enough that I don't have to worry about losing the software, and it's quiet enough to not wake the neighbors when it spins up. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    After about 10 days of being away, I found the USB drive I ordered was a little defective and wouldn't read. After some research and a trip to a computer store, I discovered that the drive had a defective M2. I returned the faulty drive to the store and the store returned my defective drive. They were very nice about it, but I feel the customer service at Apple was lacking. It wasn't until I came back that I had my M2 and the drive worked fine.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The N600 is a great all-around device for just about anything.  I purchased the N600 because of its size, and its excellent audio quality.  It's the first digital device that I've owned with the mic, and even though it's a "mini", it still sounds great.  In addition, the N500 and N800 have excellent noise canceling, but the N700 does not.  The included headphones are nice, too, even if they're not that great quality.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got my new iMac last week.   While the iMac was great the first time I used it, I found the battery pack to be a real pain to use.  It's not easy to get the battery back into the iDevice while the battery is still in the package.  I've used a little WD-40 to get it in, and a little water to clean it, but it's still a pain.  Now I've read some people recommending the Magic Eraser as a good alternative.  For $1, it seems like it's the perfect alternative to the iSight card.  If you don't need the iCard, and don't want to use WD-20, I don't think this is a bad deal at all. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The first time I used the E-MU to record the E Ink Tablet, I had a horrible experience with the digital recorder. But I've found a simple trick that has completely eliminated my frustration:  To use the record button, you have to press and hold it for about one second before you release it. This prevents the tablet from recording without you letting go.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the Sony HMZ-T1 at my local camera store (Best Buy). I wanted to use it with a small camcorder but the quality of the images produced by my Canon DSLR was just a little better. I tried several of the Sony cameras but always got disappointed.  This one is different.  It takes great pictures, is well built, has good build quality, and has great sound.

It was very easy to set up and the screen was much better.  The keyboard was really nice as well.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My Panasonic Toughbook was purchased about 3 years ago. It has served me well, though I do notice that it is a bit of a pain to get all of the USB ports open. It also seems like it's getting harder to get the CD burner out of the case, so I don't want to replace it. All things considered, I'm happy with the purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This was the first product I bought from EBay (and it is still my favorite), and it's the best bang for the buck (especially compared to Apple's products).  I have the 5C, and I was so impressed with the design, features, and speed of its USB port that I bought one of each for all my digital devices.  The design and build quality of the Apple 5C are far superior, and the cost per port is much more reasonable.  I'm pretty sure my next Apple product will be the 5G (I already got one for my iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S). 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Epson DVD reader is a great replacement for my older DVD recorder, and I highly recommend it to any camera-phone users out there.   It plays my entire collection of video cassettes.  It also has a ton of internal storage space.  The fact that it doesn't require any sort of external power adapter or battery to work is also nice. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This thing is awesome! It comes with everything you need to set up a wireless system in your car. The controller is simple, the transmitter is pretty nice, and the wireless range is fantastic.  The only issue is that you can only connect two wireless devices at a time. If you want to add a third wireless device, you have to remove a controller, remove a transmitter, and add a controller again. But that's only a small complaint since that's easily solved. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Sony is a good unit for my Sony SLR camera and it does exactly what I wanted.  I don't know if I would buy it if I didn't need it so badly, but it is an excellent price for what you get.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Epson V600 (Model: V600) is a great little digital camera. I've been a professional digital camera photographer for a number of years and have never been happy with any of the products I've tried. I got this V600 last week as an upgrade and have been very impressed. It's been much easier to use and it has much better image quality than the other cameras I own. The manual is not as good as the other Epson's but I've never had a problem with that. It does take a little more time to learn the menus but I think that's just me being a perfectionist.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought an Asus T100 with a usb keyboard for my MacBook Air. It came with a hard drive already installed, but the hard drive failed after a month or so of use.  I decided to go with a smaller hard drive and put the laptop into an external hard drive enclosure. The T100 came with one, but not enough for the whole system.  The Asus USB keyboard plugged in nicely, but was only able to accept my MacBook's keystrokes.  So I bought another and was able to use it.  It is still small enough for my laptop and is pretty quiet.

The only other AV receiver that I have seen so far that sounds as good as the AVR X7 is the Sony CX-3

I can plug in a dozen or more devices at a time without having to re-charge them all the time.  The sound quality is much better than other cables I have used. They are super quiet.  No cable noise whatsoever.  My only complaint about the USB connection is that the connector is too long.  USB connectors should be 3.5 mm rather than the current 4.0 mm. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really like this thing.  I use it for my computer and it always works when I'm not home (unlike most computers).  It can connect to my   iPod (using an adapter) and it's great for media on my  laptop, too.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm in the process of migrating my aging iMac to an iBook and I'm loving it!   With its new, large, retina display, the device is amazingly sharp and bright.   No glare.  The battery life is incredible.  I can go from using my iPhone to checking email, surfing the web, and watching a movie in the same night without having to recharge the iBook.  This thing will likely last longer than any Mac  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been very pleased with my XBMC box/player (both in hardware and software) for some time now.  The XBMP file format is the perfect way for XBMS (and other file-based media players) to play MP3's (or other types of digital audio recordings) without having to load them into the player first.  It also makes it easier to stream music to a TV using XBNC (the MediaSource protocol).  It is also very flexible and configurable.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have an iMac in my office.   For me, the iMac's built in speakers are just OK.  When I use the iBook Audio, I can hear the sounds perfectly in the room.  This is a great product for anyone who uses their iMacs with external speakers.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My iPhone 6s+ was defective when I purchased it.  The battery was dead within a week.  When I called Apple, they said they couldn't do anything about it, and it would cost me $200.  After I spent $100 on a new battery, they replaced the phone.  They told me to get a new SD card.  It worked fine, and I am no longer stuck with the defective iPhone.  I recommend getting a new iPhone every two years.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the Panasonic Toughbook S3 from Amazon and found that it worked well. It was so fast that I was able to run a video and photo transfer, which is something I never thought possible. I had a lot of problems with my last Toughbook, which was also from Amazon. I never had any trouble with my Panasonic Toughbooks, but this one was a pleasant surprise.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   As others have mentioned, this is a much better and more complete replacement for the original iPod than the $30 iPod nano (which I have used for years). It is much smaller, and much faster. It works with all of my iPod songs, and all my music and movies is available as well. The size is very important for me, as I can't take much of a physical device with me, and I'm very small. I'm 5'5" and about 130 lbs, so I'm already in the large group. My other devices are MP3 players (Jazz/Pop/Hiphop, etc), but these fit in my purse nicely. If you want a compact way to carry an iPod (without it looking like a portable MP3 player), and are also a huge fan of Apple music, this one's for you. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My iPhone 6 has had a hard time charging through a USB cable. It usually takes 5-8 hours to charge.  I got the   Apple USB Adapter  and it is working perfectly.  It  works perfectly with all my devices that are connected.

The PicoPro is one of the most highly-regarded cameras in the Pano family. I use the camera with my Canon T4i and have to say that it performs better than the DSLR. The camera produces excellent images in all lighting conditions. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My first CD player was an old Mitsubishi car radio and it has worked fine for 25 years.  It has also had some repairs.  The new model has a different sound chip, but I was expecting the same quality as the Mitsubishis.  I like the iPod interface and the CD player has a nice solid feel.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I first used this I thought it sounded awful, but it worked well enough. My speakers are too small for my laptop so I had to listen to them through my car's built-in speakers. I'm now using this device with my iPad (via iPod adapter) and it's great! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The AVR-X3 comes with a nice carrying case.  It was so nice I took out my old external USB DAC and replaced it with it.  This is probably the most portable external USB amp I've had.  The DAC is very nice and gets the best sound from the AVR at any volume setting.  There are also preamps built in for CD and vinyl playing as well as a tuner.   This product really puts a stop to my desire to upgrade my old gear. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I used to have a Sony Walkman but I decided to get the Apple iPod and it has replaced my Sony.  I've owned two models, the first one I received had a problem I hadn't noticed until I started to listen.  The next one had the same problem and I figured it was just the kind of thing that would have a warranty or a replacement if it's bad.  This one has lasted me five years and more. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had a problem with a very old   digital camera   - one that worked perfectly for 30 years until it quit working after I changed out the battery, but it took forever to return it - until now.   The camera had a weak digital camera flash that didn't work properly, but now I've fixed it by buying a new Canon.  This new camera  has a lot of features that I couldn't find on the old one, including automatic zoom and autofocus, and the photos are really great.  I also had the same problem with the   DVD player, which just wouldn't work at all.  The new model has an optical disc player, so I'm pretty much good to go with all of those new features 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Sony DVC-M100 camcorder is perfect!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this in the mail on the 9th of April. I was so excited I rushed to my local Radio Shack to get it. I put it together immediately and have been thrilled. I can listen to music on my iPod without having to have the AC adapter plugged in. This unit also makes connecting my CD player much easier.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    After about a year of ownership, my old external hard drive started failing. I used to have a large CD-RW with my laptop, and when it finally died, I thought I'd replace it with a new one.   It was the only thing in my house with a removable media.  Instead of buying a new drive, I opted to buy an external hard-drive from Amazon.  Not only is it cheaper, but I don't have to wait for it to come in the mail.  I can simply connect it to my PC, put it in a USB 3.0 port and run any software I need. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is an amazing device for taking audio and video! It's so much cheaper than the camera my friends and I used to take video with and I can record to it easily and have it ready to go in minutes.   It takes better video than my phone, but my phone is a much better camera.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the best bluetooth speaker I've used. It has excellent sound quality and a great interface.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the Pyle D7200  at an electronic surplus store in the summer of 2008.  I was absolutely astonished  at how much it  had improved  the sound quality  of  my original  high-end  portable CD player.  My old player was noisy,   and I found the sound to be more  muddy than the music I  wanted to listen to.  The Pyle unit  delivered a  smooth, high-quality sound that  has  greatly enhanced my musical experience  over the last several years.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The ZX Spectra II is the first compact compact recorder I have ever purchased, and I'm very pleased with it.  The compact nature makes it easy to carry around and transport to places, and the software is very easy to use.  I also find it very convenient to be able to just plug it into a USB port when I don't need it and keep it on my desk at all times. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this as a backup for my other device - a Sony player that's too small and hard to play CD's with.  I'm so happy I got this 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This was so easy to set up, it was a good way to get a little use out of the cheapo portable media player that comes with my computer.  When I set it up it asked me to enter my password, I knew that I had entered it wrong and had to go back and try again.   It was a little annoying to have to type it all out all over again, but I guess that's how it works these days. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am using a Korg MiniMoog to create the sound for a 3 channel system. The sounds I am getting with the MiniMoogs are amazing. I just recently purchased a D'Addario Taurus electric guitar and found that it was just as well designed and built as a MiniMoogie. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got my first Nixie from Digikey as a Christmas gift, as part of their Christmas sale.  It was about a year or two after I started buying digital devices, and I was still figuring out what to do with them.   A lot of the "big name" players at the time (including VTech) had no interest in making things that I could use.  They also all looked a bit silly with the wires coming out of their heads, and the fancy case.  After trying to get my own Digikeys working, I decided to wait until someone made one that was as compact as the Digiks I'd used in the past.  This one is so compact, it fits in my hand (or pocket) just fine.  I use it to read the price on an online store's website, and make small purchases, such as an iPhone app.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased a Sony Cyber-shot digital camera about 3 years ago. I love using it.   For the price it's pretty amazing.  If you're a photographer, it's amazing because you can get high-resolution files (12mp) which will save you a ton of time editing.  They're even very good for low-quality images.  It's also great for storing music and movies.  I've used a digital camera and a digital video camera with equal results. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have had my Bic for two years now and use it regularly. The most time I've ever spent in front of a computer using a digital camera is on my iPhone during a movie night. The convenience of a digital picture is great, but the price is much more than I'd expect to pay for it.    The only thing that makes me think that the Bic might not be the right choice for me is that my iPad can take photos in a fraction of the time, while the Bics take 10 times the time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the 3.5 mm to RCA plug adapter to use on a Pioneer CD player. I have to agree with other reviewers who said that it works well and provides the audio I expect for the price. I still find myself using the analog outputs from my CD player, but having a digital output on the same RCA cable will give me access to audio from anything I own. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was initially reluctant to buy the $10 Sonos adapter, but when I saw the good reviews, I decided to give it a try.  The adapter is compact enough to fit in a purse or pocket, and it's very easy to set up -- a nice bonus if you travel with your stereo.  It works very well for my iPod, too. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using a very old laptop with an old optical drive. It works, but it is just so slow. The first time I tried it, it took about 3 minutes to copy over the latest update to my computer from my old drive. The next time I used it, the copying took 5 minutes!   This unit does what it is supposed to do.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As a former professional videographer, I was happy to see that the Sennheiser MKH-80A HD digital recorder comes in a high-definition version (HD-SDI). It allows me to keep my HD-SD tapes in a better-sounding format. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got this device for my Sony Handycam, since my previous Handycams were too heavy to put in my backpack (they were too long).  I was a bit worried that the SD card slot wouldn't fit into the smaller version, but it did and the card works fine.  It's a smallish camera, but for a compact laptop with a large battery, it's perfect. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was in the market for a nice portable mp3 player but was afraid of spending more on something that would only play music I already owned.  I bought this player and I can honestly say that I am very satisfied with it.  It is great for storing mp3 files on a flash drive and it can be connected to a computer via USB.  The player can be powered from batteries or AC adaptors.  This player is loud enough for music while driving and doesn't sound tinny like some cheaper players.  If I ever need another player for storing music, I'll look for a USB device with a built in MP3 player.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have used many of the   iPods,   which were introduced at the same time as the  iPod.  I really like the way these   are laid out and  I like the fact that they  can be used to play music in other devices.   But I really miss the  external interface I had on my  iPod because  the connection to my Mac was  so much more secure than with my  original  iPod.   The only problem   with these  is that  they  are  only available in white and the white   seems  to be coming off a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the USB powered N64 adapter from Play-Asia, but it wouldn't fit in my new Sony Playstation 3.  I decided to try to do it by hand with the DS-Card adapter.  Unfortunately, I did not get it to fit in there.  It's really annoying.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the Sony A7s digital camera a while back and it is one of the best purchases I've ever made.  It took me a while to get used to it and it took me several years to learn the camera settings.  However, I have been very satisfied with it.  The autofocus is very fast and accurate.  I can even set the aperture and shutter speed and then let the camera decide how many images I want to take from each shot.  This allows me to take many photos from one photo session.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The RCD-LX is a nice addition to my digital camera.   It has a fast capture speed and is relatively small, even when you consider that it can hold up to 6 full-size SD cards (plus its own SD slot).  It's quite a bit faster than any of my other digital cameras, and it saves space.  I have a few other digital camera-compatible card slots, but none of them work with all my cameras, so it makes sense to just go with this one. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was initially skeptical about the 3.5mm audio input, but found it to be a good alternative for my iPod. When you plug it in, the audio is clear, and you can still tell where your iPod is plugged in.   It's a lot better than having to plug your iPod in and use an adapter, especially for something so portable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love this keyboard, it's the best thing I've purchased in a long time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am very satisfied with this purchase. It has a really nice sound quality (good stereo imaging, even better on headphones), and it has a very easy to use and install interface. I use it to playback MP3 files, which are of very high quality, and to transfer those files to a computer, which is more than enough. It is nice to have a USB drive on which you can store your music files, and the interface gives you the ability to select which files you want to play. This is so useful. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am a lifelong user of electronic devices. For most of my life, I have been limited by the size of most computers and other devices that I had access to. But I have finally found a device that does everything I could ever need. I can run my PC in a Virtual machine on my TV while surfing the net, and the built-in wireless router gives me complete access to all of my family and friends without the need to share a house with them. The only limitation is the size, but I am still amazed by the performance I am able to achieve with this device. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had the iPod touch (5th generation) for about a month.  It's the only portable digital music player I have.  The display is very clear, and is easier to use than the previous generation.  I use the touch screen on the bottom of the device for music, and the front-facing camera for video.   The battery is more than enough to go the entire length of a day.

I was so pleased when I received the unit that I wanted to order two more to store the information I wanted on other disks.  It was so easy and fast to get the information back on the drive and on my other disks that I will probably order two additional units to store all of my data. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the best wireless keyboard I've ever used. The key spacing is perfect, and the keys feel solid and solid and so far so good.  It's so much more convenient than the old school USB-equipped keyboards that everyone has. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the first camera I've used that shoots in RAW.  I had a digital camera before, but it was horrible, noisy, and had a terrible, scratchy, grainy, high-contrast image.  This new camera shoots RAW and produces much nicer results. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this because I'm a fan of the Sanyo Denon DNXHD/DLNA system, and this is a close enough copy of the system that I'm not having any problems with it.   It plays the TV's and the movies perfectly, it's super small and light, and it's incredibly easy to set up.  I use it mostly to record my TV shows and movies, and I love how small the setup is.  If you're looking for a cheap device to play your media, it won't disappoint.

There is a way to prevent the phone from dying if it is left on all the time, but it's expensive and difficult to implement.  I'm not complaining, because I can buy a second battery, but I do wish I could charge my phone and leave it on all day so that I have at least one charge for when I'm at home or traveling. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am really pleased with the   Sennheiser PC 365   It was not easy to set up but once set up, it works perfectly. It allows me to take good phone calls without headphones or an external microphone. I use it with my iPad.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my second TRS-80. I bought one in 1982, and it's still in working condition.  I bought this one in 2009, because the "miniaturization" seemed to have come to a close, but it's held up amazingly well.  This thing has an impressive ROM cache.  It uses the old-fashioned RAM, but they really didn't know any better back in the day.  The internal RAM seems to be a much more reliable source of data, which is especially nice when you want to play a disk file from floppy.  In addition, there is a lot of headroom for the audio hardware:  This computer can play all kinds of audio.  There's no CD drive, but there is an optical drive that supports up to 32Kb/s.  If you want the original sound effects, you will have to use the computer's cassette drive.  When I got this computer, it came with a copy of the tape of the TRS‑80 Magazine Volume 2.  With a tape player, this computer can even play the magazine.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's been really nice using the new wireless remote control for my VCR since I bought it two months ago. It's faster than the old one (which I still use as a backup) and the volume settings are much better (as is the accuracy of the volume knob). The remote is also pretty lightweight, which helps with my portable recorder. I don't really miss the manual control though. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Pulsar is a good device, although it does have some drawbacks.  Firstly, the batteries are small and can be a challenge to get to from the back of your computer.  The larger batteries that are included are great, but a little larger would make the Pulsars a lot more usable.   Secondly, the Pulse will work with both Windows and Mac.  However, I have found it to be a little sluggish on the Mac and there is a bit of a stutter whenever I try to get a Pulse to sync to the Mac.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased my 3DS XL about 2 months ago. The only complaint I have is with the 3DS. It is VERY flimsy. It cracks when I drop it on the ground. The unit also takes up a LOT of space in my bag/shelter. I just can't imagine it taking up a ton of space if you're constantly running out of space. It's also a pain in the ass to deal with. I've had to replace a number of the SD cards. So while it's great for gaming, I don't think it's worth the hassle

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The V2 is the first USB device I've purchased from B&H.  The device is well constructed, and there is no question that it's manufactured by an established, quality manufacturer.  Unlike some of the cheap devices out there that I've bought from BH, the V2 works flawlessly.  As someone who uses a large external hard drive to store audio files, I am constantly concerned that my computer will be lost if the external hard drives fail.  I use this to play my MP3s and MP4 files at the same time.  With a USB hub and the V4, it's very easy to use the hub as a dedicated player and the USB port as a connection for the portable drive.  You also get the included USB cable, which is quite nice.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As an audio professional, I've used many different high quality USB DACs, all costing more than this one does, but the sound is so good that I can't go back to my iPod and other portable players.   It's the one I carry with me every day.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this to use with my old Sony DVD player to play back movies, music and TV shows I recorded using VHS, as they were so bad that they couldn't be played on a DVD player.  After buying this I started to think about getting the DVD player that I bought a few years ago and just used with this player, but the price on this one was way too much, and since I already have a new Sony player, I figured it was worth saving a few bucks by getting this one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was happy to see the latest version of the Korg MS-20 in this list. It came very well packaged and was well protected. The MS-10 and MS-16 sound great together, but I like the sounds of my MS-2 more. The sound quality is a bit muffled compared to the MS-4, and the MS10's bass doesn't quite match up with the MS16's. I've been playing the MS20 for many years and I'm very pleased with it now. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The battery life is perfect! It's the same battery I have in my old laptop, but it takes only half the time to recharge.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was having a very hard time adjusting to using my digital camera. The only way I could get it to work was to manually set the focus and aperture.   Then I found this great little gadget called the EOS 5D Mark III.  It is a fantastic camera for my needs.  I have been able to use my digital photography as a teaching tool.  This camera takes amazing still photographs and video.  If you want to use your digital camera to get your picture taken at a great price, this is the device for you. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm extremely satisfied with the PonoPlayer.  It's very easy to set up, doesn't require constant internet access, and the sound quality is outstanding.  This is a much better alternative to my previous player, which had terrible sound quality due to poor digital output. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound quality is really good. There's some bass to it that makes it sound better than any other DAC/AMP I've tried. It also has an "auto-detecting" feature that will detect your system if you have a different DAC than your computer (which is usually the case).   I've been using my computer as my main sound source for a few years and it's good enough for me, but I can't say the same about the other speakers on my computer (the speakers from my receiver, which I've used for many years). 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently bought the DPO-500 digital recorder to use with my digital camera. I used it extensively, and I'm very happy with it.  It's very easy to use, and works perfectly with my camera.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the second set of headphones that I have purchased from Bose.  The first pair I received from them was a good deal on a decent pair of headphones.  This one, on the other hand, has been a total failure.  I can't get them to work on the radio.  They work on my CD player, but I can only get them there after using the earbuds for a while.  It's very annoying, as I don't use the CD player enough to notice if my headphones are working or not.   I had to return them.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using a portable CD player for years and my iPod mini 2 was much better in every way, but still, you get a lot more out of this than you do with the CD player.  The SONY PLAYPORT is a must-have for anyone who plays CDs.  It's just as good as my iPod, and a great way to listen to music on the go. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a second hand iMac and an iBook because my primary Mac no longer works.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really like this thing. It's smaller than I expected, but fits perfectly and it has built in SD card slots that I use for memory cards and movies.  The only negative is the power adapter that comes with it is kind of crappy. It doesn't last as long as I expected.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been looking for a nice digital camera since I bought the Nikon Coolpix S. I was very happy with my purchase. The camera has a nice compact size. It is not bulky like the Coolpics. It's got nice color, sharpness, and an acceptable price point. I'm very satisfied.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was looking for an external hard drive when my laptop ran out of space, but didn't want to spend extra money on another drive.  The Kingston 2.5" external drive is fast and has a nice weight to it.  I'm not sure what the other reviews are talking about, but my drive works just as it should. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased an electronic device at the store to replace my floppy disks in my CD-ROM player. I needed to transfer large files into a digital format. I used this to make a copy of the entire music library on my computer from vinyl discs. The copy was easy to make and gave me the original files in a ZIP format. The product itself worked perfectly, and I'm very satisfied with it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This has turned out to be a very excellent and well-designed device.  It is so good, in fact, that I've decided to buy a few more.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The best external drive I've used so far.    I have multiple devices, but this is the most convenient.  It is the second external drive of my computer that is able to access an external hard drive over USB.  If it could use the internal HDD, I would consider it a great product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I just got my ZX81 at a local music store in NJ. I was very happy to find that they carried the ZX80, so I figured that I would get the newer one. I had an old ZX computer that I could not use anymore, so my first reaction was to go out and buy a new one.  I found the computer that had been in my dad's possession for about two decades, but which he could not afford to buy anymore.  It had been sitting in his garage since he died a year ago.  The only other computer he had had in his life was a ZX Spectrum, so it was a little nostalgic.  After I got home from the store, I checked out the Z80 manual and learned that there was a very similar (but much cheaper) ZX-80 model available.  (The ZX model is based on the Zilog Z80 family of microcomputers.)  The ZX was based on Intel's 386 microprocessor, which was an improvement over the 8080.  A few features of the ZZ80 were also included, such as an EPROM, a keyboard, a tape drive, and a cassette deck.  So the Z-80 offered similar capabilities to the Z.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    These things have the most annoying feature in the world, which is that they use a special type of adhesive tape to hold the screen in place.  A really good phone case would cover that problem, but these cases are so thin that they can easily peel off the back panel of these tablets.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm very happy with my purchase of the iPod Mini.

The included earbuds are so much better than the ones that came with my iPod. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this to replace the old Sony CD player that had become so beat up and unreliable that it wasn't worth a trip to the computer store any longer. The CD player was so old that it was no longer being manufactured.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was very happy with my purchase. I have a Panasonic PX-1 that I bought in the mid-90's when it was the king of digital cameras. I used to think that the PX was just a nice-to-have digital camera, but I can honestly say that the Panasonic has taken over my digital camera life.  The PX has the highest quality color and the fastest auto focus that I've ever used.  When you look at a picture in a camera you can see every little thing that you missed.  I'm very impressed with this camera 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the RCA jack adapter for my iPod Touch.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have owned numerous different digital camera's over the years but this is by far my favorite. The pictures are incredible, the resolution is fantastic, the picture stabilization is amazing, the price is great, and it's super light (I'm 6'3'' and I can carry this camera around easily with me). The only thing that makes it a little hard to carry around is that it's so compact.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have just bought the Sony ICF-SW100W in Black, and I must say that it was a very nice surprise. I had been using the Sony SRS-100 in black for many years, and it is definitely a better product. The SRS is much smaller, has a much better sound quality and features. I was really hoping for a similar device to the Sony SW100. So when I heard this Sony device, I was very excited to try it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this unit because of the feature that allows you to download your music from various streaming services (like Spotify or Rdio).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is by far the best wireless printer I have ever used.  The first thing I did after opening the box was to open the "Quick Start Guide" and look for the model number. This is the first wireless printer that is NOT listed as having a "Model Number" in the Quick Start Guide.  It also has the exact same software as my previous printer, which is amazing.  While the printer is "almost certainly" wireless, I still haven't had a chance to use it in an office environment.  I have been using a wired printer for the last two years, and the "extra" battery life and wireless capabilities on this one are just not worth the price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought a cheap MP3 player for my car last year. It broke after about a month and a half of use. It's not the worst audio player I've ever used. However, it has a horrible design flaw: when you turn it on, it automatically turns on the radio. I can only imagine how annoying this is when the car's radio is on the other side of the room. I wanted to try the SONY player, and was pleased that I did.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great little digital audio device.  I had been using the CD players in my computer for a number of years, and decided that I needed to upgrade.  This unit is great and allows me to record my car stereo using a car tape deck, and the CD is much better quality than my existing deck.  Also, if I want to listen to my CD player while driving, I can plug it in and use the unit as a CD player as well.  It's very convenient to have everything wired together in one place.

The B+ and the V2 are the only rechargeable batteries I've been able to find in the $50-60 range that actually look like they could be recharged.  I had purchased a pair of rechargeable AA batteries from Radio Shack and they looked soooo much better than the E B+s.  Now I can keep my E B's charged all the time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My DS Lite is one of the best portable devices I have ever used. I have been using it a few times a year.  The DS Lite lets me carry my music files anywhere I go without having to pay for them. It can also sync to iTunes and stream my music.   The battery life is great too.  It doesn't drain the batteries as fast as my iPod does, but the battery does last for about 4 months of heavy usage, so you can carry it with you to all your gigs for a month and it still will be good enough.

This unit comes with a CD case, a headphone cable, and the headphones themselves.  That's all you really need for a great car music player

I use the USB hub to hook my laptop to the printer (which is a Canon PowerShot SX520) as well as to charge my phone.  There are other hubs available, but the Dell has the most functionality.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been using my   i i  i iPod for years.  It   has gotten better and  more   reliable every year.   However,   it   was defective in 2008.  After buying it online  for $149,  the unit   began producing static at around 7.5% of the   stored volume level.  At 10% of volume,  it would drop out of sync with my    iPod   and make an annoying buzzing sound that would last for an hour or so.  The   unit  cost me $200   to replace.  In addition,  when  I  upgraded to a higher resolution iPod,  I found that the  volume level on the new   iPod  was about the same as the  iPod that   came with my i   It's   great to see that  i   iPods   continue  to   be   a   top   quality   device 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Sanyo RAVPower 1000W power supply has excellent reviews on Amazon.   I ordered one in January 2012 to power my Sony XBR-S camcorder, and the unit has performed flawlessly ever since.  I have used it in a variety of situations, including powering my Sony SDR-R3R for a variety on XM radio broadcast signals, powering up my Xtreme Audio AV receiver, and powering my HDTV.  The unit is extremely quiet when it's not in use, and is very robust.  It's also very power efficient, consuming less than 30 watts when idle.  While it isn't the most powerful unit on the market, it certainly is one of the best in terms of overall quality, construction, and functionality.

It had to be replaced because it kept slipping off and being a pain to set back onto the right place.

I purchased this one in anticipation of the release of the original Apple II.  I didn't anticipate having to do any work to it or get anything wrong.  The only thing I did do differently this time was install a cable that would allow me to play the CD from a cassette player.  After that I simply plugged it in and bingo, it works perfectly.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased my Koss Sennheiser HD 416's a few years back on a whim because the ones I had were defective.  They're better than the bad ones, in my opinion.  I use my headphones almost every day, and I've come to rely on them a great deal.  The only downfall of the HD 416s is that they're relatively heavy; I've had to carry a couple around to use them in public a few times.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The RCA connector (with the mini plug) is the best connection I've ever used on an audio device. It takes the guess work out of hooking it up to my computer. The fact that the RCA connectors are so tiny means that they are actually almost too small to hook up to an SD card. They will work on an SD/USB card with some care, but that is it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was really excited about buying my NEX-7 because it was so much better than my old, older, and more expensive compact digital camera.  I finally got my N7, and it's amazing.  The image quality is amazing, even on the same camera that my Canon 7D took great pictures of, and the new camera's fast 1.5x digital zoom is amazing. You can focus the camera very precisely while still having good image quality.  It's really like having a 4x5 digital camera on your camera phone!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the second external battery I've bought for my Panasonic I8580.  The first one worked fine for about 6 months before it failed.  This one is working perfectly, the only bad thing about it is that it comes with two batteries, one of which is dead.  However, the one that is working works flawlessly.  I use the old one to charge the new one, and it works like a charm. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The USB cables are great - I can plug and unplug devices with no issue, and they're relatively inexpensive.  The only downside is the lack of an on-screen display.  However, if I'm in the middle of the woods and need a power source, it's the only option available. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a Sony WCDM3 camera and it's the only camera I can get with good picture quality. So when Sony started to sell the WCD-M3, I knew I had to have it.  This is my first digital camera.  It took a while to learn what all of the buttons did but once I did, it's a great camera.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I received my X300s a month ago, and have been enjoying it. The batteries are super - I get between 1 and 2 hours per charge. I'm using it as my main laptop, as it has the fastest boot up time. When I'm traveling, I just plug it into my Macbook Pro to do everything from email to Web browsing. It's a great, inexpensive upgrade, especially if you own an X200 or X230, or even an X230R.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I used a Kobo eReader to read my Kindle, and I'm very happy with it. It's light, small, and the built-in batteries keep me completely fed. It also has a "crisp" text, and it feels pretty good in the hand. My only concern is that the pages turn a bit slow, but the Kobo seems to cope nicely with it on the whole.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this a while ago, to go with my Macbook Air.  For the price, it was perfect.  The only thing I did was buy the Apple Magic Trackpad 2 as well, as well as a USB keyboard.    The trackpad is great  it is responsive  and it is very simple to use.  Also, the keyboard is good  It is well built  and light  It's great for reading in bed.  It also has the option to plug the keyboard into a computer and use it like a normal keyboard 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The product is a huge improvement over the previous one I purchased for my Sony NEX camera.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was in desperate need of a new wireless phone.  I got the Nokia 6110  because it was one of the last models in the 800 series, and I really wanted a decent phone for the price.  The 6110 is definitely one of those "good enough" models.  It was a little difficult to use with my old Palm Pilot  but once I figured out how to use the  keyboard  it was fine.  Also, the phone has some extra features like  call waiting and voicemail (which I never really needed).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Soundmagic iM 5 is a great sounding audio system. I purchased it for my studio in LA, which is located about a mile from a subway station. I've had the Soundmagic Audio iM before (i'm pretty sure that's the one in the picture), and the SoundMagic iM 4s are much, much quieter than the iM5, although not as good. The SoundMagic USB DACs sound awesome, especially on albums that I've been listening to for a while. The sound quality is even better when I use it on my PC via an adapter. The iM3/USB 3/USB 2 adapters are a bit too big for my MacBook's USB ports (and the i2s only last 2-3 hours on the Apple power adapter).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this device because of its size and its ability to store and transmit pictures.  I'm so happy with it!  My only complaint is that the battery has a low charge indicator light that blinks constantly when the battery is half depleted.  Also, because the battery lasts so long, it's a shame that the camera itself only works for about 20 minutes each time the camera is used.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with the purchase 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been looking for an mp3 player for a while. I love to listen to music at home but the mp3 players I've tried have always been crap and the price was so high that I just gave up and settled for a cheap computer.  The PlayMemories has always looked and sounded good so I was really excited when it arrived.   It's been running just fine for about a month now.  I'm very happy with it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the Xyboard about a year ago and I like it a lot.  I like the fact that the XY-Board can be used with both a computer and a mouse.  It's also great because I don't need a separate program to connect the X-Board to the computer.  The screen is really bright, and I'm used to using a computer screen.  If I had to have a separate monitor, I'd probably go with the Sony XBR-S5100 instead.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The iPod (which I own) is my device of choice because it's convenient, reasonably priced, and very durable.  It takes up about 4 spaces on my computer tray, so it's a good fit for my desktop.  My iPod is about 6 years old and still works perfectly.  I've heard about the lack of a good CD player, but the iPod was a no-brainer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this product to replace my broken Toshiba CD player. This CD player plays almost all of my CD's very well. It doesn't sound quite as good as the Toshiba, but that's not a bad thing. The sound quality is far superior. It is a very good sounding cd player.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had previously purchased the 3DR Solo for a "serious hobbyist" and loved it. It worked great on my XM-L2 recorder, and was even good enough for some recording of my son's schoolwork.  I purchased the Rode NTG-1 over the phone in a hurry (to replace the 2DR Solo) to give me another option for backup and to play the occasional song.  It's perfect!  It fits easily in my pocket and can easily transfer music, pictures, and videos from my 3DR to it, all in perfect quality.  The only downside is that the 3rd party connection is not as robust as the Solo.  You can't connect over USB, only a coax cable (unlike the Solo, which connects over a serial cable).  In addition, if the 3RD-1 gets damaged, or if you lose it or buy a newer model, you have to buy a new audio connection.  Also, the 3D-R is not wireless like the Solo (there's no external antenna, but it has its own built-in Bluetooth receiver for remote control), but it still works just fine.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought an E-reader a long time ago because of its compactness and price. I didn't want a $200, 6 inch Kindle, so I bought this one.  It fits perfectly into my bag, but at the same time, I can put in the E-Reader or my Nook for extra storage or reading.  The paper is very thick and durable, which makes reading a breeze.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought an old Sony Walkman in a desperate attempt to keep my music on in the car. This little player is amazing: It plays your entire library of CDs and cassettes at a lightning-fast pace. Also, it turns any audio player on your computer into a digital audio player. When I need to listen to a CD at work, I just plug in my MP3 player and let the player play the audio. I use it as my iPod on my laptop. It's the perfect solution for someone who needs both iPod and CD player.

It seems to be working fine now.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've used many different audio systems, including many different portable CD players. In the end, I decided that I wanted a quality digital player for on-the-go audio that was both portable and affordable. This system is both. It has all the benefits of a CD player and a portable device. But because it's a solid state device, it costs much less than many other portable players. I've got this system in one of my laptops and it's very powerful, with lots of functions.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the Mophie Mixtrack Studio because my CD player couldn't play any digital music and I wanted to be able to listen to my digital music on my iPhone.   It's been great so far.  The first time I used it, I couldn't believe how well the Mixtack was able to replicate my digital CD player.  When I listen to CDs using the Mixtape, I'm able to enjoy the sound quality of the CD while having it as close to the original as I can get.  If I'm listening to my CD collection on an iPod, the Miptacks will be able provide the same experience.  Also, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the Maptacks can play my iPod's digital files at their original speed.

When the G1 died, the other G3's I had bought also failed, so I decided to try this one.  It works flawlessly, and has all the features that other G1's had.  The only complaint I have is that you can't replace the battery, so if you accidentally drop it, you have to buy another one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had been looking at the Sennheiser HD650s for a while but never found one that worked well enough for my particular needs. I finally bought one at the beginning of this year. After some fiddling and a little tinkering with the audio settings, I got my "sound" just right. It is a little more detailed than I am used to and it adds a nice element of realism to my listening. It really brings out the nuances in the voice and gives a sense of realism that I'm missing when listening to my analog recordings. It's also a lot more versatile. I can play it in stereo and use it as a CD player. I use the headphones to play some of the music I'm making on my computer.

I was looking at other models, but they had other features (like Bluetooth connectivity), or different price points (like the iPod Nano ), that I liked less. The TCD-HD200 works just as well, if not better.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased my   first   digital   recorder   two years   ago and   it has been   a lifesaver.   It   can   record   the   music   and  the  interviews   without   taking the  earbuds out of my ears   or   turning   off   my  iPod. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have used several digital cameras, but none has come close to the image quality that the Sony DSC-HX300F Digital Camera captures. The sensor is very sensitive, allowing you to capture very fine details, like the fine lines on a painting, or the shadows on a dark background. The noise in the image is very minor, as is the graininess. And it's easy to focus. This camera will be the first I ever replace. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This product is amazing! It is so much better than my old "cute" remote that only had 5 buttons to control a TV and a stereo! I like that the remote can use all the "trick" buttons on my remote, like volume up/down, channel up/ down, mute/unmute, etc.   The remote is so fast that I can control my TV while cooking and get it to adjust for my cooking!  It's also great for the "next/previous" buttons and for the music control buttons that let you play and pause music, play/pause song, and skip tracks.  I'm a huge fan of the Wii and it would be nice to have my Wii Remote with my Wii!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this because I was in the market for a decent mp3 player. I didn't really care for most of the other products in the    lineup  (especially the      sound ) and figured I'd try this one.   This  has the same type of   design and build quality as   the  iPod Classic.  The  sound quality  is good   but it is not as  good as 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The first time I bought a new computer, I found that the only USB-C ports on my Dell were the ones on the front, which meant that every time I plugged a USB-A device in, the computer had to ask me to remove my phone to use it.  That, coupled with the fact that all of the USB-T devices were terrible (poor quality), made me feel as if I was going to get my money's worth out of the entire deal (a very good investment).  This new Apple laptop is a dream come true.  It's blazing fast and has two of the best USB-Cs I've used.  Plus, I've always hated the fact you can't use the USB port on the back of the computer to charge devices like an iPad or Android tablet (at least I used to).  My only complaint is that the USB ports on both ends of this computer are on the same side, and you have to remove the front panel to use the other end of the cable.  This would have been better if there was an option to use one USB-B port on each end (or just two).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use this with my Sony PXW-X100 and XDR camcorder to store a few of my images. The files come out great. It works with my digital camera quite well, and I do have to pay attention to the speed of my PC, but it's much faster than a floppy or hard drive (which were used to store my images when I had my computer). 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The E5 is the perfect USB memory card reader.  The card is large and takes up very little space on my USB drive.  There's no space at all for a thumb drive, which is a problem for me.  I can use the card to copy all my digital media and run everything on the card without worrying about the memory space.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use a Nitecore ER-4 flashlight for everything: emergencies, camping, and backpacking.   It is an absolute steal for the price.  I've been using one since 2010 and haven't needed anything else.  The ability to use this light in combination with a carabiner is phenomenal.  It works so well, I just use my carabiners whenever I hike.  If I ever run out of batteries, I can use the flashlight and carabinet as an emergency signal. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The eXtreme Pro is very small. The controls are simple and have a lot of functionality. I can switch from the onboard SD card to a flash drive, and it has two different slots for SD and SDHC cards. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I used my iD8500 on my PC when I purchased it as a backup camera for my DSLR. It was incredibly reliable and took good pictures. I never really had any reason to change my camera since it was reliable and well made. It just seems that this new generation of iPods doesn't have all the functions I like to use on my camera.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really like this device.  I bought this as a last minute replacement for my iPhone 4.  It's super easy to set up, and the sound is really good.   It uses a microUSB cable, and it comes with an adapter to charge the phone.  When I get the adapter, I'll also get the charger.  Thanks for another excellent product!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the DigiPort U1 for my iPod.  I had the same issue with a previous DigiPak U1 I bought in 2006, but after a year of use, the iPod would randomly fail to play music, so I gave up on the device and went back to the original U1.  This one is different because of the USB port.  The U1 works great and I get all the music I want, although occasionally a CD will not play.  It also plays music I buy through iTunes. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The new Sennheiser HD 599 is by far the best headphone I have ever owned. The sound quality is phenomenal and the build quality is top notch, even though it's made of plastic. The fact that I've spent over $100 on headphones is a testament to the quality of the headphone itself. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this device to have a backup copy of my digital photography.  It works great!

I'm sure if I'm ever in a bind, this will come in handy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Purchased the G5 after having a failure with an iPhone. I was very disappointed with the G4. The display is very good. But the build quality is horrible. The screen is so fragile and I keep getting phone drops. The buttons are hard to press. The volume rocker is always the first one to come loose. The fingerprint scanner is also so unreliable that I keep forgetting to remove my finger from it. The only thing I like about the G3 is the camera.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm a music professional and love my Yamaha RX-V382 digital audio player.  I use it for a variety of music and audiophile purposes.  This player is incredibly good for its price.  It's got more features than I've ever used before, and can stream music at resolutions up to 24-bit/96kHz.  The player supports the AAC codec for excellent quality.  There's a dedicated button for playing audio from a flash drive, which is a great feature.  Also, if I press the "play" button on my iPod for more than 2 seconds, it doesn't play the "loop" audio again.   The iPod does not include a loop button.  My RX-v382 is more reliable than my iPod. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Pono player does a lot of great things. It's lightweight (easily carried around), small enough to fit in my pocket, and has no power adapter (although it does come with a USB adapter if I ever decide to take it on a bus).  I've had the player for a week and have been using it daily for music, podcasts, and streaming music from the web.  It's easy to use, and all the songs I've been listening to are great quality.

I immediately called the customer support line to inquire about the problem.  A person with the customer service department immediately picked up the phone to tell me how to solve the issue and I would be getting a new 4-dig code soon.  In addition, the software that they installed also allowed me to watch programming on my  computer from that DVR.  I couldn't be happier 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had my first Apple ipod 2 when it came out back in 2007. I loved it, but it was so slow that I couldn't use it when I was on the road. I wanted something faster. So I bought this. It's been fantastic.   It plays my iPods so smoothly, and is so much faster than my old one.  The remote control is great and the battery is very good.  I just got my second ipod and I'm going to get another one for my wife and daughter to enjoy too.

It's great for recording live performances, but also for home recording

The A99 is a lot easier to use than my previous Sony player, which required a ton of fiddling with the menu options.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is one of the most amazing things I have ever bought.

I've used the Sony CD player and iPod for a long time and this is just about as good as them. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been a big fan of Philips' MP3 players for years now. The only problem I've run into is the remote - it always gets lost. But I love the sound quality, and the MP3 player itself is extremely reliable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the Yashica T3 camera a year ago and have used it extensively for almost every conceivable photographic need.  It's small and light enough to go in my bag but can also be carried easily.  When shooting video it has a very clear viewfinder and good quality photos even in low light.  My only complaints are that there's no built-in flash, which would be useful for video, and that the image quality is not as good as the photos taken with the camera's built- in camera.  The T3 is a bargain.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the best portable digital camera I've ever owned, and I've owned quite a few.  It comes with a 1.8 megapixel camera, the ability to take 4x5 or full-size photos, a built-in flash, and a small memory card slot that you can use to store images in any format you like.  I also have the Olympus OM-D E-M5 and it is really nice and has great quality, but there's something about this camera that is just so much better.  The camera is small enough to fit in my pocket and takes really good photos, and it has a great zoom and focus system that I never use.  All I do is use the camera as my primary camera and use my Olympus as my backup camera.  When I'm in a hurry, I can just drop the Olympus into the SD card slot, but I'm not always in such a hurry that I need that many photos.

It's size is ideal for both my Macbook Air and my Samsung Galaxy S3, and it has two micro USB ports.  I don't have to worry about accidentally charging or discharging my devices by accidentally disconnecting them when I'm taking pictures.  This means I don "t have to stop what I'm doing" to plug in my camera and SD card and the other USB devices in my kit.  Plus, I can quickly attach my SD card in my case, and I can take pictures without having to carry two SD cards in my bag.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this to replace my broken iPod Classic and was very pleased with the sound quality and overall performance.   The only thing that might stop me from buying another is that the case is so thick that it feels like a brick in your hands.  The case itself is really nice though, but when you're carrying around a massive, heavy case, it can feel uncomfortable. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I recently purchased my RCA cables with the intention of replacing the old 3.5mm (or less) coaxial jack with the USB type.  I wanted to be able to control my CD player from my computer or my phone.  This is perfect!  It works flawlessly and the cable is flexible so it isn't too tangle-y.  Great price as well! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The battery lasts a long time and the USB plug on the back is perfect for my laptop, which is usually too small to fit into the USB port.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The unit arrived quickly and is great. It's a little more bulky than the Nexus 7 I used to own, but I find that it fits my hand well.  I can easily switch between viewing a Web page and using my Kindle without moving my arm.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the HP TouchPad 2 to use with an older laptop.  It is fast and works as well as the iPad 4 or the Mac mini.  The screen is sharp and text is crisp.  There is a lot more information on the screen and the navigation is good as well.  I have been impressed with the quality of my tablets and the TouchPad  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use a Yubikey 4.2 with a couple of my eReaders and it works wonderfully.  The eReader can store a couple hundred books, but you really need an eReader that's compatible with this one.  I also have a Kindle Paperwhite, but it doesn't work with my Yubico. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased an Apple iPhone from my Apple store on August 18, 2006.  The   iPhone   shipped   three days later.   When I opened the   package   it   looked very nice.  I used it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Tandy TRS-80 Color Computer is a great computer to have if you want to have a complete computer at a fraction of the cost.    You get a decent CD-ROM drive and a powerful 8080 CPU.  It comes with several built-in programs, including WordPerfect 4, PARC, and a great magazine reader.  The keyboard and mouse are easy to use.  If you can live with the mouse, it's nice having a nice keyboard.  Even better, you can add a modem to the unit for a few bucks.  I can't think of a better system.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a perfect external hard drive!  It works great and is well built. I can boot up my computer and it just works.  It is also nice to have a way to store my backups on my PC. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I received my Nook Simple Touch and I am so happy that I did!  I have been using a cheap eReader for some time now and have been disappointed by the lack of good quality and software.   But, in the Nook, the software is fantastic and the print quality is great!  In addition, the NOOK Simple Touch comes with a lot of great extras for free:  1. The NOOK Studio apps   These are free!  They are really good and I highly recommend them!  2. The reader card   It's great for keeping track of your books while you're at work, and it also keeps track of any updates that come to the reader.  3. The book cover (book, not eReader)   
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this item about a month ago to use in my digital camera for video recording.  After having it for a few weeks I must say that I am a huge fan of this product.  I have been having issues with my Sony a6300 which was an inexpensive digital camera  I purchased a few years ago.  The a6320 has made the camera much more reliable.   It seems to be able to record solid video with very good sound quality.  So far I am very satisfied with this device. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This was my first wireless phone. I wanted to have a separate phone for work and personal use.  I found the phone to be very simple and convenient.  It doesn't have a battery and it has a built in headset (no cable needed)  It's good quality and doesn't use up much space.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the YubiKey 2 from amazon for my Windows 7 laptop. This is my first time using an electronic device so I wanted to make sure it was as good as advertised.  The YubiKEY 2 is the perfect size for a USB thumbdrive.  I was surprised at the amount of storage the card has because it is a 4GB card.  It also has a very good build quality.  This is one of the few portable hard drives that I would recommend. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was really looking forward to getting a CD player to listen to my local music library on my iPod, but was disappointed to discover that the CD player is not able to play MP3 files. The MP3 player I had previously bought from Apple works fine, so I was concerned about this. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iStick is very small.  It is much more portable and easier to hold in your hand than the eGo-C.  The battery life is very good.  I have been vaping for 7 years and iSticks have become very reliable.  This is my second iSticker 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this digital camera after trying a digital camera that was supposed to work on my older (but still working) camera. I thought that the digital camera I had was supposed be like the digital cameras in the video game, but it was totally unreadable, especially in the low-resolution video. When I saw the price, I knew that I had to have it.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was just buying a phone, and this thing saved me. I was looking for a way to connect my portable ipaq to my desktop computer. This thing just made it possible. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This thing is just a very good, simple, easy-to-use, all-purpose digital camera.  It has all the features you would expect from a good digital camera, but it's so inexpensive and easy to use that it's perfect for me.   I'm not a big photographer, and this camera is a great way to record photos of my kids on vacation, in the field, or when I want to show off a cool moment in the car. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This card is awesome. The digital read speed is amazing, and its compact size is perfect for my workstation.  I was able to transfer my old digital camera's file to my computer and print out to keep on file. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It was my first Sony, and I'm very pleased with it.  It's small, light and powerful.  I love the control buttons on the front.  The fact that I don't have to take my eyes off the screen to move the pictures makes moving around pictures easier.   The memory card works as advertised, too. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this device with the intention of using it in my music computer, but I didn't get very far until I got this thing.  The sound quality is fantastic. I like the fact that there is no lag in playback.  It's very clear and detailed.  I also like the way the music is stored on the card so I can copy it to my mp3 player easily. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use a Panasonic HV series camcorder and a Sony PCM-DV camcord, and a few USB audio players. All of them work perfectly in a Panasonic, but the HV cam is too big to fit under a Sony.   Since I don't have a spare Sony, I switched to the Sony PCX-D camcorde and it's a great deal.  I can now shoot on my Sony HDTV and have it back at my house in minutes.  The Sony camcords look better than the Panasonic models

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've owned two of these. The first one lasted for a while. The second one broke after only a year. The battery lasted longer, but the design is crap. I'm pretty sure I spent more money on the second one than I did on the first.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This little guy is a must have for any video project.  It comes with a 3.5 mm stereo cable and all the other parts you need, including the 3.25 mm to RCA adapter.  If you are a serious videophile, you have to buy these, but I bought it in the hopes of adding a new video card to my computer.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    These headphones are the best I've ever used.  I purchased these because I wanted my music to sound good and they did.   I use the M-Audio Cardioid (or "B-100") as my source for my iPod and other electronic devices.  With the M100s I can get full, realistic sound without the loss of volume that I experienced with cheaper products.  They're not perfect, and the sound can be a little scratchy in some genres, but for the price and features, they're absolutely worth every penny. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The new version of my MP3 player has been great for my iPods.   This version of the player, however, has a very short battery life.  I use a digital camera and the batteries get very low.  Unfortunately, the batteries don't last long enough for me to use it with my iPod, so I need to charge the batteries every time I use my iPod. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the first time I've ever used a digital camera. My friend who used one before said it was "kind of cool" but didn't use it very much.  This thing takes amazing pictures and I can't believe how fast it's able to take them!  I'm already planning on getting more!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the M2A2 and it works great.  It's very compact and you can carry it everywhere you go with the included carrying case.   It works perfectly. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use this digital camera to take home high resolution images. When I'm in the middle of a field or a park or at a rock climbing site and I don't want to leave my camera running, this camera automatically turns off so I can focus on the task at hand. I'd use the camera much more often if it took a photo whenever I turned it on and off. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I use the eeTek Pro for a couple of reasons. First, it lets me watch my DVD collection on my PC or laptop and read my CDs in a very easy to use program. Second, it gives me a way to sync my iTunes music library with my iPod. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The only drawback of this computer is its portability.   I can't carry my work anywhere I go, so I use my iPad for my work and the computer for the rest of my life.  It's really nice having an external drive, especially when I can carry my photos and videos on a small external hard drive without any worry of losing them.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a great device for those times when I'm just not satisfied with a standard computer mouse.  It's small, light, and it comes with its own usb cable.   It feels good in my hand and gives me the precision I need for real-time input of data.  The built-in software is a little quirky, but it's pretty easy to fix. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This USB 3.0 card reader is awesome!  I use it for all my USB sticks and USB memory sticks.  It has been extremely reliable and it is so easy to use.  I do not use a computer because of the difficulty to connect my older computer to my computer and this card reader makes it so easy

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am a huge fan of the new iPod nano and my iPod shuffle.  This adapter adds an extra iPod and is extremely compact.  It fits easily in a front pocket without the need for a case, and the included cable is long enough to be used in multiple scenarios.  The audio quality is much better than the stock adapter, and it allows for some nice new formats like the new generation of the iPod Touch. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This thing works perfectly for my iPod. I'm using it to play music from the iPod and some of the newer digital players. The iPod is a lot more secure with it's case (my iPod was pretty much falling apart at first) but I can use the iPhone while the case is on and the thing just works fine. I bought it from this website because it had a free shipping offer. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound quality is phenomenal on the CD player. I have the CD players from Sony and Yamaha, and they sound like crap! But not this one. The sound is clear, crisp, and clear. I was pleasantly surprised.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The iPhone 4/4S is a great phone.  I can download almost anything on it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This was the very first digital camera that I ever bought and I still use it today.  It has some interesting features that I appreciate (for example, you can take a photo on any smartphone that has a lens).  But one of the most exciting features for me is that it can be used to save and load digital photographs as well as digital images from a memory card, and I can do that from any computer I have, whether it's my laptop, an iPad, or a computer tablet.  That means I can easily transfer photos I take on my phone to my computer, load a new photo on my laptop that I took on my smartphone, and then upload the photo onto my tablet. It's a simple and cool feature that I never thought I would use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   As an analog audiophile, I have been using the Digidesign DACs for almost a decade.  I have also owned the ATHM+ and the AKAI Pro.  The Pro is very good, but I thought Digidespector was making a good DAC that could be plugged into both.  The UCA202 is much smaller, more powerful and better sounding than the Pro, but it's about the same price.  Also, the Pro's headphone output doesn't work with the A and A+ (or the AK1 ).  The headphone output on the UCA402 is fantastic though!  The AK1 is a little different.  When it works, it sounds better than most of the headphones I own.  But the UCT and AK1 both work flawlessly.  All I can say is "Wow!" 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this card reader to replace my old, crappy card reader that just couldn't keep up with my high-speed USB drives. It works flawlessly, and is much cheaper than my older one. It's a nice, thin design, and the price is right!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this as an investment for a more expensive model.   This thing is great.  It has been working perfectly so far.
