Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a poor book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the worst I've read. It's full of errors, misquotes, and factual errors, it's full about Hitler, Stalin, and so on, it has many contradictions and lies.  This is the biggest lie book I've ever read, if you're into that sort of thing, you'll be disappointed, but if you don't like that sort 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very bad book. I read it in one day, because it's a short book, and I couldn't finish it. It's not fun to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book a negative rating because I thought the writing was rather sloppy.  I think the author could have had a much better grasp on the book's content if he had attempted to keep the writing clean. I found a number of references in the text which were quite out of place. Overall, this was a bad read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book when I was young. Not one person in the book was ever in the same place as my family! I don't know about this book, but I would stay away from books like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a disaster.  As an instructor at a small community college, I can't imagine how many people were ever motivated to read this book.  The ideas are interesting and well-written, but the text itself is so shallow that the material quickly becomes dull and repetitive.  There is a lot of bad advice in this book, and some of the bad advice is downright dangerous.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing I can add to this review is:  Don't waste your time or money on this book, it's not even good enough to be a college book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a horrible book, it makes me feel bad for the characters. The story is boring and the writing is bad. I was surprised to hear how much he is influenced by J.R.R Tolkien. The book's plot makes no sense. This book has no value at all and should be banned from children's libraries 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I couldnt believe that so many of my close friends had to deal with this  book. I know I have some bad reviews for it on other sites 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was not suitable for a university curriculum, and is certainly not the way to start a literary review, either in a book review or in an article about a good book: it is a collection of short stories and poems about literature, but not of novels, essays, or biography 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is the only one I have read that focuses on the role of women in the family. I think it is very much of a stereotype to portray women as bad cooks, mothers or the like. The author seems to feel he has a right to do so, but his books do not really stand up to the standards of good writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author makes a few very general points about the value of religion, but the content is very boring and it's very hard to get to the point.  I have yet to learn any other useful religion than Catholicism, and I think it's more practical to learn about the difference between various religions rather than the religion itself.  In addition, this is one of those books that you can read through the text for its value, but not for its actual meaning, which is very narrow and very unhelpful to the reader.  If you're looking for a book that's useful, look elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is probably the worst book I have ever read. It's boring, cliched and boring. The book doesn't really do anything new, just reiterating everything he said in the last two books. This is very annoying, and very unfortunate for a book that has such a good reputation, and is supposed to help the reader to become a more well-rounded writer. This book makes me wonder if the authors really know what they are talking about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of misinformation about the internet and its technology.  A huge collection of lies.  The author's name is actually William G. Jones.  But, since the title is on the cover, you would think it was his work.  His web site is the only information about his website.  He is obviously an expert in what he sells.  This book is nothing but a collection of falsehoods about how people use the internet 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not agree with some of the opinions expressed in this book. It is mostly opinion and not fact. Some of the authors are just as bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not a fan of this style of writing. This is a book about one of the most controversial events of the 20th century. It's not a good book. I don't recommend it for people interested in history, politics, or history-related topics 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is written like a  children's book - but it's nothing more than that. It's mostly written by the author to convince himself and his readers of his own wisdom.   I was disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too many of these books have nothing positive to say about Asian Americans.  There are a few that offer valuable lessons for women of color.  It would have been nice to see this book used in a social studies class, but I guess we won't be learning anything about this in any of the American university's classes in Asian American studies 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never liked her writing and the last book is no better than the last three books in her series:  This book is a disaster.  The dialogue is the worst and the characters are boring.  If you do not like her style of writing, please do not buy this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As always the author claims to be the world's greatest basketball writer, but  he doesn't seem to know the rules of basketball as well as he should.  His basketball facts are a little sloppy  and he doesn√≠t do enough research on the players to really create a sense of  the characters or the players. This is a book  about a team of athletes, which is fine, but the whole book is  basically just a collection of basketball trivia. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a quick read, but it did not capture my imagination. The book was boring, and it felt like the author was telling us the same story over and over again. It was difficult to imagine anyone else being the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had hoped that this book would give me all the basic information that I needed to understand the art of sewing in a quick, easy, and fun way.  The problems are plentiful, and there is too much information for your average sewing teacher to read.  I gave up after about 10 pages, and was even more frustrated after reading about 4 pages of the last chapter.  It would have been a better book if they had cut out the excessive text. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains many misstatements, such as saying that God did not reveal himself to Moses in the Torah. He was revealed to Moses on the mountain, and the entire book is based on this. The text itself is not very useful for an Orthodox Jew, so I will not be recommending this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not as good as the author says, but still it's only 10 dollars and only about 10 chapters.  The author is a poor writer 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've only skimmed the beginning. It is only after the first five chapters that I realized there was no real way of getting through this book. It's not only that it is tedious, it is also boring. You don't get a sense of the story's development or even of the characters, just a general story line. Not bad for a second or third book in the series 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very few things in life are worth it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you like fiction in the vein of Hemingway, Faulkner, and others, this is the book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of misinformation and lies. The author's attitude is completely condescending to the poor readers of this book. He writes that he will tell a lie for only $5.99 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about an extremely unorganized book that was written by a college student. Her parents thought it was a good idea and sent her the book for free. What does that make her, a moronic idiot who was the first one to waste my time with this trash book? This book is full of unnecessary (and probably false) statistics, it's filled with examples of bad examples, and most of all it's extremely boring. The author doesn't understand how writing a book of information works (not that she's too smart to do such a thing), or how to present information to people. If the author could do that, maybe she could be less of a moron and actually write a good book, but this is not the case.   I had to go back through all of the quotes and see if they made sense to me before I could even begin to read the book.  It makes no sense, and I don't believe it is even close to a good reading 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book ever written about the bible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book.  It was very bad.  I got it from the library when I was 15 and  it was the last book I would ever buy.  The characters were never funny.  Their writing was  very bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not only a compilation of bad poetry, it's a list of poems that have been plagiarized and sold to gullible buyers as original poems.  You would think that the only way to acquire good poetry is through trial and error, but in this book you are going to get very very, very close to acquiring bad poetry.  The only good thing in this collection of bad poems is that it is in the    I don't recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was published in 1982 and this book, I guess, is a product of that era. There are a lot of people in that world and the author is a member of that crowd. He is no historian. This book is filled with all sorts of distortions and lies. There is no research behind the writing, other than some old fashioned personal views, as well as some bizarre ideas about the American culture that were never actually tried out in a real life situation. The book is full of the usual crap that was found in that time period. The author is completely ignorant about American history. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a disappointment 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book begins with a bad review of a bad novel:  I have to say I was not impressed with it.  The author did not have the knowledge of his topic, and it became difficult to follow the plot.  This book is a waste of time, if you ask me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very poor writing style and very inaccurate. I found the writing style repetitive as the authors seem to be writing from a point of view.The book is supposed to help you through your pregnancy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book I have ever read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was given to me to read, as it seemed like everyone was talking about a book that wasn't as good as it was supposed to be. It's about a boy with a bad attitude. The boy doesn't want to do anything, he just sits around and talks. He is a terrible person, but there is a story and there is hope. The story is that the boy is actually a human. He has been stuck in this body his whole life, and has been in the human body ever since. He uses his body like he does everything else. He's not really like this, but he is. I didn't really care about his story. It was more about the characters. I wasn't really sold on any of these characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is basically a collection of stories about bad people and bad experiences with bad people. There is no story about any positive experience with a good person. It was written for kids so they could relate to  a bad person. The writing style is too fast and casual to be believable 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very bad book. It makes you think that most of the things that she says in the book are true. What a horrible book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found this to be a very boring book with little information. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Very bad book, as always. Very boring. No ideas and no life. Very sad story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has little to offer.  The writing is bad, the grammar is bad and the writing style seems to be quite difficult for the reader.  There are many other books out there that are just as good, if not better.  This is a good book for those who want to learn a foreign language.  If you don't, this book will not teach you much of anything.  Unless you are interested in writing a book of vocabulary in Japanese, this will not be a great book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very poor book written by a poor writer. The writer tries to make it all interesting and interesting, but the way he does it is wrong. The book gives many examples of the "real" thing, and those examples are usually used by the authors to try to make the text more exciting. That is not interesting to me. He tries to do too much, it is too convoluted. This book is a waste of your time. There are some good examples, but those examples were not used in the text at all. And the way the book has examples of real life, it becomes boring quickly, no matter how clever the writer is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the first page and then it was like a bad nightmare. It was not good to read it because the information was not enough. The information in the book is not enough 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A bad book. I bought it on Amazon and it was all I could do to finish the book before I gave it away 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a bad books. It is an outdated history of the early American settlers. It does not tell the stories of the many courageous people that have contributed to the founding of this great nation. But, it does provide an excellent introduction to many of the "old" myths. This book would not be out of place in the early twentieth century as one of the books on early American history 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains a lot of useless information. The first two chapters contain little information about any of the topics it covers. For example, it is not mentioned how the U.S. economy is controlled. I would highly recommend this book only to students and other people with no experience in the real world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is bad.   The author, in order to make the story seem deeper, takes on some interesting subject matter, but he doesn't seem to understand it, or care enough to learn.  The plot is so convoluted and ridiculous that it almost makes you sick to read.  All the characters, including the main characters, have such bad personalities and personality disorders that it really does ruin the plot.  But, at the end of the day, that's the only good thing about the book.  It was the first book that I actually wanted to pass off to my kids as an adult so that they could read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing I took from this book was to read it on my Kindle. Then I decided to read the whole book again and found it extremely difficult to make heads or tails of the author's ideas and reasoning. The last pages are more like a lecture than an instructive book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is written in a childish style.  The writing style is not very good. The chapters are not well organized. I have read several good books on subjects such as history and biography, but this is the worst of all I've read so far 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried to read this book as a way to get through the holiday season, but I never got a feel for it.  The illustrations were terrible and it was very boring.  There is nothing particularly interesting about it either.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in high school and it just did not meet my expectations.  I'm not even sure how I finished it.   It is so hard to understand what is so great about this book.  Everything from the author's comments to the pictures is just not engaging.  His approach to writing is all about the story.  He gives it so much importance and then he goes off the deep end. The writing style is almost comical in places.  The language is so childish.  It gets tiresome. It just seemed so much of a waste of my time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of the usual stuff. It is not clear how it fits with the rest of this author's series. It gives a very negative review of what the previous book does and tells you not to read the next one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As usual, the author has no clue about art. She is not interested in the development of a well-known, classic painter such as Vincent van Gogh, nor in the techniques of painting, and she lacks any understanding of the principles of composition or the art of painting. The only thing that seems to motivate her is her own egocentricity. The story is pretty much just one long rambling rant about how bad she thinks art is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If I have one negative review to write about this book, let it be this:  It was written at a time when there were very few (if any) women's literature magazines and women weren't yet allowed to write for the magazine. Therefore it was written for a very small audience.  This book was written as if it were a young adult novel.  If you are interested in what women are writing now, the last two books by Susan Orlean and Betty Smith are very good examples of this. The only time I found myself really engaged was in the last chapter.  But this book is more of an anthology and the only ones I have read are the three essays by Deborah L. Jones.  It's not enough to just read them, it's also good to know the rest of the women who contributed to the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A good book to read for a short period. But when you've finished the book, the content starts to come across as confusing, tedious and just plain boring. The stories are a little repetitive (even though most of the stories are very short).  But if you don't have any background in art history or art history of any sort, it can become a bit of a slog.  The book isn't particularly well-written either.  I would recommend you only read the first few pages and stop there.  Then get a real book, like Michael Jackson's or William Schaff's 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is written in the third person, as in the first person. It is too bad, because it is the first book I have ever read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very old book with many good quotes.  It is written in a simplistic manner, but many of the ideas are very valuable.  A lot of the things are very confusing.  The book ends up becoming very boring.  There is much material in the book about "The Five Stages of a Good Marriage" that is very good 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it difficult to understand the main points of the book because I didn't understand many of the concepts being presented. I'd like to hear a good review of this book from someone who has more experience in programming languages and real world applications. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written by a professional in the field of health and human behavior, but not a holistic practitioner. It is nothing but a laundry list of information, including recipes, exercises, and other items to achieve health and performance of daily life.  It is an exercise book for the beginner and the experienced practitioner, but hardly any guidance is given for the general population.  The authors' goals seem to be to have a book for those who want to get and stay healthy or perform better at their jobs, while not bothering about the other  aspects of health.  I would not recommend anyone buy this book because of the amount of unnecessary information that is included and the lack of guidance for the average Joe, but rather focus on the topic and practice of health in the real world 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing that I didn't like about this book was its focus on the children of drug addicts.  The kids were given the drug names to give the story a more sinister tone.  These kids were not portrayed in any positive light.  As a former drug addict myself, I found this to be rather disgusting.  I would recommend avoiding this book at all costs 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a terrible one. If you are not a Christian, please get out of this book before you waste your money. This book has nothing good to say about Christianity. It is a bunch of stuff that is wrong about the Bible. It tells you how to read it, but if you read it like this, you will probably get nothing out of it. You should get out asap because it is going to suck. It will also hurt your soul if you waste money on it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has little to offer in terms of actual writing. It is full of the type of  writing that is done when the author does not know how  to write, not when they have a manuscript.  They do it simply because it is what they  do.  What the  author does is simply put some quotes in  the book and they call it writing.  It is the equivalent of reading a book and  saying,    I have a lot to say here  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have just finished reading this book. What I read was the word "pornographic" used twice. I read the book from the beginning and didn't bother with the index. I don't know where this was published, but it is an excellent book with some good pictures, but the index, that I am sure all those who have used it will agree is worthless 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is probably the worst book I have ever read. I read other  books like The Bible for Kids and this is the worst  I have yet to encounter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about the French-American War. I enjoyed it, but it's not very interesting. I couldn't even understand it and was frustrated that I couldn'st find out why they fought, when I was expecting the book to provide me with the answers. I could have been better versed in the details, but I'm disappointed with the book because it's only about one side of the war. The whole war was told through the eyes of two soldiers: a French boy and a native American boy. These two boys were really interesting. They were very different, yet they were close friends and could communicate with each other in a very different way. The book was also written in a third-person, meaning that I was told that the French were always good and the Americans were always bad. But no one seemed to get why the French always win and the US always lose. Then again, it was a really boring book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A poor book. I don't buy this stuff. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so long and boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is just a bunch of rambling stories about one man's life and travels. Nothing much to talk about here except  some weird ideas about the origins of different languages, some  of the more bizarre travel stories in there. I don't  recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   First of all, it is completely inaccurate. The book is over fifty pages long and all the information is taken out of context. The title says "The Bible as well as all other sacred books" but there are only two passages in the Bible about the cross. The other half of the book is about various pagan religions. I was not pleased. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is full of contradictions. I cannot believe that any author would publish such a garbage book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a book written by a Christian who claims to be a Christian. He tries to make his own church seem like it had a huge impact on America. It's a bad example of the sort of thing that goes on in churches. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is a lot of good information, but it doesn't help you do the reading. This is the only book in this genre that I have not read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was full of unnecessary information, incorrect facts, and too much opinion about religion. The author was not very careful to use proper sources to back up his claims. The book has many errors including  misquotes and misrepresentations of the Bible.   I would rather have a religious book, rather than this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is bad. It is mostly written in a sarcastic, sarcastic, way 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a bad review for a bad nonfiction book.    Not only is the book full of irrelevant details of his life, he tells some weird, self-righteous, anti-Catholic rant about "religious fundamentalists" being "evil" and "evil-doers" and so on 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an excellent read if you are a fan of the Star Wars movies.  It's funny and the dialogue is very entertaining.  But the characters in the book, especially Luke and Leia, are annoying.  I felt the characters were more interesting in the novels than the movies, but that is subjective.  The Star Wars films are wonderful films to watch but they could have been handled a lot better with the characters.  With the characters of the novels, it is a great book to read for fans of the movies. If you are looking for more characters from the movies to relate to,  you may as well try the movies and read a good book,  this one is not.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has some of the worst writing I have ever read.  I am looking forward to getting it corrected so I can start the sequel 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written in a style which doesn't seem to have any real basis in fact. It tries to fit a rather boring and rather boring subject under the pretense that it has something to do with the subject matter. As a result, it leaves many things unexplained, some of which are very disturbing. The book is littered with errors which I would find very difficult to read if I was trying to give a general opinion of the subject. If anyone is looking for some insight into the subject of sexual abuse please refer to my previous review: http://homepages.upenn.edu/jeanne_bryant/a.html 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has a number of errors in it. For example, many of the events and dates that are listed in the text are not consistent with the information in the book itself. I'm giving two stars instead of three because the book is very well written, but it would be a much better book if it just kept to the text itself. Instead of citing it in every chapter, it would have been much better if it kept to only one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first couple of chapters were boring. The last two chapters were absolutely horrible. This book was a scam. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing that can excuse this bad book is the fact that it is the first book that is devoted entirely to women. But, still  bad for the most part 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was so long that it almost makes the book less enjoyable, and the book doesn't really do much to explain anything. The authors really need to work on getting their books in order. It is as if they have never written a novel in their lives 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you read this book for self-improvement or if you just want to learn more about a good book, you may find it interesting. However, the information in this book is outdated. It's best to read a good, modern book on the subject like "How To Become A Better Artist" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an abridged version of a good book: The Lord of the Rings.  The book is only about 50 pages long, yet it contains a plethora of material.  No matter how much I read this, I couldn't help but feel that the author had never read the books in question.  Not only is this book a disappointment, but the book also seems to be a kind of a throwaway book to try and sell as if Tolkien were alive today.  This book could have been useful to anyone who wanted to learn more about the Lord of Rings universe, but for those looking for the actual source material, this book is not the one for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was released in 2001 and is more of a guide to selling your books rather than a good book.  There is a lot of self-promotion and self-importance in it and it's mostly focused on the self-development side of self marketing.  It's mainly a marketing guide but it has plenty of questionable advice.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a good book, this one is a great read. Unfortunately, the author has a rather bad attitude towards women, which in my opinion makes his books all the more sexist. I would recommend this book only to those who are serious about their studies and are looking to find a good alternative to the usual women's studies text. This book is very basic and has little to say about women in America or elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It seemed like this book was meant to be about a young man and his experiences with women. The girl in the story is not only ugly, she is stupid, and she is the reason this book has the  most negative reviews on Amazon. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, by someone who claims to be a writer, has many errors in it. He uses a lot of words that do not mean anything to me. The first half of the book is only for the students, but the end is just for the teacher. I feel this book is for those who want to learn how to write, but cannot take a class. However, if you want to read the book yourself, you will have to deal with a lot more errors. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The best I can find is that the author, a native French speaker, has trouble with English grammar 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    For an author who claims to be a Christian, it seems to me to be of a rather sad, and superficial, nature. This is very disappointing because I would have liked to have found more about other aspects of Christian theology, and more about the more common, and less well-known forms of Christian mysticism. The book makes claims about Christianity that are quite unfounded. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise is that the earth is about to end and man is about find his last few years of life before the world ends. This is a good book if you are not very interested in the subject, but if you have, this is the wrong book. It's based on the mythos of a film, but the film doesn't exist. The movie is not about apocalypse, its about a man and his friends, its not about the end of the earth. It also has a lot of nonsense about the apocalypse. There's a lot wrong in this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a general reader with no background in this area, I found this book to be a complete disaster. The book seems to be the story of an author's experience with this topic, but not a great introduction to it. I'd recommend anyone who has a passion for the area read some more resources instead of this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a good introduction to the subject of the book. But it is far too difficult and the writing style is poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This is just plain silly.  I feel so sad for all the children this book will cause to suffer from the  stupidity and badness of it all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a bit slow paced and it doesn't get to the root of this question right away. As I said above, it may or may not be a good idea for this subject to be discussed in school. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The problem is, this book is not written by a real expert in this field. I'm sorry that I got sucked into this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't buy this book.  The author is a good writer but not a good bookkeeper 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is interesting to read and is told well, however the grammar is poor and the writing style is unaccented. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the equivalent of an encyclopedia that you buy in the library and then leave for a year. I would never recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was never very interested in a woman's life and so this book was a big disappointment. It was written by a man, and so the women had no agency or role in the story, just as if a man had written a book about a heterosexual marriage. If you want to read a book for women, read a feminist one instead. I would recommend you avoid this book entirely if you're a woman. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book on the recommendation of my daughter who has a PhD in psychology. I had no problem with the book. I liked the idea of talking about psychology, but I thought the writing was subpar. I did not enjoy the concept of "negative thinking" or any of the arguments it contained. The authors of this book were clearly not psychologists, and were not equipped to write about psychology. If you do want to read about psychology I would recommend reading another book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does not help me or help me understand the world, and it will only lead me to the belief that it is an ancient text. It has no scientific value or factual references, and is full of errors. If you want to learn more about evolution, you are better off reading a text written by a living scientist or by a qualified teacher 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is based upon the life of Robert Johnson. The author, a young man named Matthew Thomas, was one of the students at the John F. Kennedy School. I remember him well, because he was a very unpleasant character. Not only did he take over the class and try to intimidate the other students, but he also had the audacity to write down notes and quizzes in this book, in which he would test the students on their answers. He then put the book down and walked off to the train station, leaving his students behind. Very little was left in his book, and he never finished it, because it didn't fit his personality.I will give this book three stars, because, on one hand, it is very entertaining, and it gives a good view of the early music of the sixties. On the other hand, the book is rather boring and uninspiring. And he doesn't bother with any plot or character development whatsoever.I would not recommend this book to any serious student of American history or of anything else. I don't believe this book will help a young person to write a good essay about the musical style of the Fifties, for example. The writing style here is quite amateurish, and there is no hint of a plot or development. He never bothers to make his characters real, he never seems to remember any of them for a single moment. It is impossible to feel for these characters, because they are so unlikable. It would be much better for this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is the authors attempt at explaining the concept of "theory" in an entertaining and entertaining way. The writing is very good and the pictures and graphs are good. However the problem with the book is that it is far too short. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There are many good reviews about the book on the internet, but there is not a positive review about it. It is just a book. The pictures, but not the text. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book to my 12 yr old son and he did not even finish it, so there's a problem.  I do agree with the author that the story of the Jewish people's exodus from the country of Israel is one of the most inspiring stories ever told. However, the plot of the book is not what makes it good.  If you are looking for a story about a Jewish hero, this is not the book for you.  There is very little character development and the main characters all have the same characteristics.  And what does a hero do when his whole race is murdered?   The only thing that gives the book a good rating is the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want a simple, easy read about marriage, the author's opinions are the worst of any book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very boring. I did read through the whole book in one sitting and I have no idea what she is talking about. Just read the book yourself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a huge waste of time and money.  The only good thing about this book is that it was originally written by a friend of mine.  However, it has completely taken over his life and now he is unable to even read the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was expecting a lot more from this book, but this is a really boring book. It is full of cliches, and lacks any realism. It's just too slow, and it's over before you are halfway through the book.It is a good idea to read a book by someone more talented, but I would have rather enjoyed this one on my own. The last half of the book, where she has a personal relationship with someone that she is having an affair with, is one of the least interesting sections of the story, and she gives so little explanation for why they're together.I have read books by people who write well, who really know what they are doing, and who are able to write characters you feel empathy for. I feel that I'm reading this one now because it is an obvious sign that she's out of her depth. There are no clear or convincing reasons why she needs to have an affair, so what happens next is just kind of weird and hard to follow.I don't understand why it's so difficult to give someone a reason for their actions, and the book doesn't make it any easier. It just comes down to the fact that she just goes off and does whatever she wants. This is a story about a normal, everyday couple who have a long and complicated relationship with each other. We see it happen through her eyes, and see them interacting in this really boring, dull book. There's no connection between them and nothing to really hang it on.They have no real drama in this book. Nothing is exciting, or interesting, or even emotional. I was ready for more, but we ended up with nothing that was truly original or unique. This was just more of the same bland, predictable, and cliched relationship drama that so many people in this generation are writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is not a bad read; it is an awful book. It is written for kids, but the author fails to inform them in a simple way about many of the things they read in books: history, geography, current events. The characters are not very original. If you have a son, please advise him or her to avoid this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read the first two chapters and found it a bore. I'll read the next book in the series, but I would recommend reading this one first 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you don't want to have a real conversation with a good book, then don't read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a collection of stories from a good but not very informative book. This is the second book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is very dull. The characters are so-so and boring. I just finished the book and can't wait to see the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In fact, I read the book in order, and left it at that. It's obvious that the author did not know the subject well enough to write a quality book. However, even after reading the book, I would not suggest that anyone buy the book. The author is not exactly the best speaker in the world, but, for most readers, he or she has to come from the school of writing to write something of real value. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about the life of a woman who had two children with a black man. They were conceived in a motel room and she gave birth to two girls in the same room. Her second daughter went to live with her aunt, who then left her. Her youngest child lived with her mother until she died. The author writes about this, but never discusses the events that led up to her divorce and death. I felt that she didn't even bother to look at the facts of the case. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not a bad read, but I was looking for the positive aspects of the story, and this is the opposite: it's a horrible book that focuses on all of her problems rather than addressing the issues of the main characters.  It was hard to concentrate on the story because I kept thinking about it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is over 50 years old and has just been reprinted in 2012. This is a sad book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was well written but the story was flat. A few other reviewers did not like it as well. But I enjoyed the story and I wish  that I had the patience to go through it all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought that this book was more about the positive aspects of the Bible. The author of this book, however, was so blinded by his own prejudices that he did not even bother to verify the Bible's authenticity.The book goes on to talk about how the Bible is a "holy book," then talks about how Christians believe that it is the "inspired word of God."This book, for God's sake, is filled with lies and distortions.The author, while saying that all he wants for himself is to prove the Bible authentic, he continues to confuse God's Word with man's belief.I can't believe that anyone would listen to this kind of nonsense!If you're like me and find the Bible to be one of the most comforting, inspiring, and spiritual of all books, then you'd be better off doing some research on the subject than taking this book on.I give this book a zero star, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, I can understand why she's so opposed to the book being good, but it's not a bad read, it's just not what she claims. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the most boring books I have ever read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book when it came out, but  this version is almost as bad as the previous one, even though the same people are involved. If you are looking for a good book, stick to the first edition 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed the book, but the author, when I asked about some of the photos he did not know the names of the photographers. I tried contacting him about some photos but he never returned my call. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am reading this book about five years after I have been through this process. It gives me hope that the book is at least worth reading, but the authors are not. They just seem to throw a lot of things at the reader in a short time. I found that the authors didn't get what most people who have gone through the same process thought:  This book was written before a good deal of people had had their experience, or been through the process of grieving and loss, so they haven't figured out what to do yet. The book begins with a lot going on and the reader is left wondering what to expect. For example, there is a lot about guilt, denial, and not having the necessary support. What's more, there's a lot thrown at you right away, and you don't get any time to ponder the process. Most of the book revolves around describing what the survivor is thinking and feeling at different points in the process, which is annoying. The last third of the story, when the book has moved away from the grieving and grief process and toward the recovery process, it gives way to one-dimensional, boring descriptions that do not make the reader feel anything. For instance, one of the characters gets a bad paper about the Holocaust. That was not the first thing he thought about. He then proceeds to ask his co-workers what they did during WWII.  I felt cheated by the book. The authors were not able to understand or do the research to write a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terribly written book.  The only reason I am able to read it is because I already know how to speak Russian and I have translated some of the chapters.  I do not understand a word of this book, and I did not find a translator for it.  If you want to get a deeper understanding of Russian culture and history, get a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about a guy's life and how his life got to be so messed up. He is a great friend, but when it came to romance he became a jerk, and then he married a woman with four other guys. It is hard to get through this book because it is so bad. I do not know why a man has to date the sister of a girl that his friend thinks he is perfect. And why he must marry this woman when he has had many previous relationships. There is nothing in this book that is true to life, and the story becomes really boring and tedious, which is a problem when you want to be passionate.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I agree with the reviewer above, but I found the book to be much too academic and boring. I also read some of the reviews about some of these books and there's only one positive review here:  A book I don't want to read again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very bad. The author says he is a good author and then goes on to say he didn't read the book for two months before he sent it out to publishers. No matter what, this is bad. It would be better if the author took some creative writing courses. If you are looking for a good book on creativity, this isn't it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very interesting.  However the way that it is presented and discussed makes the story of the book somewhat hard to follow.  I did not finish the book because it was simply too much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was about an ex-wife who is still married to the father of her children.  The father, who was born in the middle of the 20th century in France, was always very unhappy in the family home.  He was the opposite of the father in my life - and this book didn't change any of that.  I'm sure the author knew that this book was going to do well because his book about my life is popular.  But it's not a good book to have in a young teenager's hands 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only problem is the book has been around for more than 10 years. It is written by the same author, a person who is very good at inventing new stories 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's the last book of the series, not a great book at all.The last one of the trilogy, and the last one I actually read, in a bad way.Don't buy it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very poorly written and poorly put together.  If anyone was interested in the ancient world, this would be the book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first half of this book is devoted to teaching the reader about the history of the Greek language, Greek mythology, and Greek philosophy, and the latter part is about   translating Greek and Latin texts into English and then from English to  Latin and then back into Greek.  It is a great, easy-to-follow course for beginners and intermediate students.   However, for the most part, it's an exercise book, and it is never   about using the Greek texts or the languages to really understand  the texts. The language is taught through examples, and each of the examples  sums up the lesson. And they are all from the Greek  textbooks of the time, but they are very much at the level of  the learner. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not all the information in the book is accurate.  Most of it is conjecture and has never been proven.  If you want to learn more about what is going on with the world, this book would not be a good choice 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a college student and this book is full of information that I do not need for my course. I wish that the author would go back and revise this book so that students like myself, who need information about the Greek language, can be benefited.I am giving my negative review on this book because I do feel that it was a bad idea to use this book to help students learn this language. The material in this book could very well help students of any language to learn, but I believe that it would be a much better idea to write books specifically for Greek students and language learning in general. I think it would make more sense to use a textbook that focuses on the Greek Language such as:  "Greek in Everyday Life" by Liana K. Ramey  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not only is this a tedious read, it is boring to read. I am sorry for the amount of bad reviews about the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the most shallow book of the series. There are only two pictures in this book

Write a negative review about a bad book:  I was disappointed. I found the main idea of this book to be a positive one. However, it was not implemented well enough. If the author had written an honest review about the book, I would have enjoyed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book from the very start. It doesn't matter if your a first-year college student, and you want to learn about psychology or  sociology, or any other field that uses words and ideas,  this book isn't for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first edition is out of print. But, now, the author has taken a turn for the worse. This is a terrible book to read. It is full of outdated and misleading references. The author never provides the basic information on any topic. He is not a good writer. If you read this book, you are going to regret it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If anyone reads this book it's only to see that the author has no idea how to use a camera. The book doesn't even mention ISO's. I read the book on a first impression, which is that the authors have no idea what they're doing. The photos look like stock photos on the inside pages. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had trouble getting through this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was published during the Cold War. It is not a bad text, but it is anachronistic, and it does not address current events. I could write a positive review about the book if I was to write one, but I have not found the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so incredibly boring.  I read it through twice because I really wanted to know where all these little girls are coming from.  The descriptions are so bland and generic, it took a few chapters for me to realize that it was supposed to be about a book, not the main character's development.  It's not that I'm opposed to little girls (I've read plenty of books by young adult authors), but this book should have been more about the characters and less about the plot.  Just because the author didn't know any better doesn't make it any less boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very technical. It covers many topics, but is not good in any subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first time I read this book  I was so disappointed and I felt this was the story of an innocent woman who finds out what happened to her mother when she was younger. This book is not that 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the fourth in the series and the third one by David Fitch.   Fitch, not a good writer, is trying to sell this as a bible to young adults.  No, it is not.  It's a collection of bad prose and poorly-explained and inconsistent ideas.  This book has no place in college.  I do not recommend it for young adults, because if you are a Christian this is all you're gonna see.  If you're not, it's just going to be a bad text that you have to look up for yourself.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has nothing interesting about it. It simply rehashes the same old myths, such as the death of a baby and the value of a book. It's just a list of myths that have been repeated and rehashed for so many years 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel like I've read this book a million times.  Every time I would go into the book, I would learn nothing new.  The only new things I learned were that a woman is supposed to be careful about the color of her socks.   And that you can't have a bad dog 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was published in 1977. At that time, it was the bible for the whole of the occult community. It was also very popular with the children. As a result, this is a great book that is very hard to understand in many ways. If you want to learn about the occult, this book is a bad one to get 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not recommend this book.  It is full of bad examples.  I would recommend another book, like the one written by Barbara Smith (also a bad example). 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a huge fan of the book, and it's one of my favorite works of writing. However, I would rate this book at least 3 stars 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, I read the first half and was about to give up on it. Then the author added a negative reviewer about a negative book: "But if you don't like it, don't buy it!"  I know a few people who agree with that, but I don't.  The book is full of information about the bad book you buy from the back cover 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very disappointing. The author does not seem to have any interest in the subject matter and is merely concerned with the writing style. It is a bad introduction to the subject for anyone new to it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book itself is really bad, the writing style is off and the style of photos in the book is terrible. It is a fun and colorful book, but I am very disappointed with the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   First time I read this book I did not like it at all. The character was too farfetched. But then I read the next chapter and was like, Ooooo. I don't like to be critical about a good book, so I will review the bad sections.  First off, her main character is an evil character and not a real person. His name is  John. He is a rich white man from  Kansas. He has his servants, the  slaves from the South. He likes to be referred to as  Mr.  Secondly, I don t think this book needed to be called  "The  Slave  Chronicles" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book contains lots of stuff that could be considered irrelevant to most realist/historical novels. It is full of boring descriptions of life and castles, battles and the life of the upper classes. It has no information about the feudal society. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I read this book about 4 months ago. And I am still not sold on it.  No matter what anyone says, there is absolutely nothing in this book that is new or exciting.  The book is filled with recycled examples of historical events, like Napoleon's victory over Russia, from the 1700's, 1900's and 1950's.  Nothing of great significance in any of these stories is included.  Instead, all the examples are of "typical" American or European battles.  It's almost as if it is nothing more than a rehash of past events, with only the latest and most recent ones included in each story.  You know the old saying: "History is written by the victors 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read through this many times and it's always disappointing to me. The author is obviously very talented but doesn't do the research well enough to support her claims. I would avoid this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are so many things I hated in this book.  The idea of the "power of negative feedback" in the first chapter (about negative reviews) is completely misguided.  Not only does the book not address that issue, it simply dismisses it as a negative.  This book makes no attempt to explore this issue and it simply seems to exist to sell books.  If this is supposed to be a self help book, I feel sorry for the author 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book that got me interested in reading and writing, but I am very disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't waste your money on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author does not know how to write a positive review about  a bad work of fiction:  It is very, very boring.  There is nothing new in it  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I really thought this book was the best book on how to make a living in the arts.  The only problem was that the book was written by an author who is in his forties.  This was the main reason that I thought this was a good book.  But, like many other books out there, I expected a much different result. I have only been able to buy a few copies of the book  so far, but so far they have been so terrible that I didn't buy one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is atrocious. The stories are not as compelling as they are in others in this series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has many bad examples. It is not as good as I expected it to be. This book is not a good resource for your children. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was published in the early 70's and is a throwaway for the ages. It's all about how to live a good life.   It also has tons of pictures.  It has nothing to do with psychology, psychology, or even life. This book is the worst kind of motivational material, it's simply all about   the way to live life. All the good advice is thrown out the window.  The only good advice in the book is 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not written for beginners.  You have to be an intermediate to understand the lessons.   If you are just learning Japanese, skip this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title and title pages are both misused.  It is not a story, it is a book of stories.  The author has never made a good novel.  There are also a number of spelling mistakes 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really like the idea of the series, but this book is a huge waste of time, not only for its premise, but for its contents and presentation.  I could have done without the discussion of the Bible or any other religious or spiritual themes 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I'm not a big fantasy reader, but I got it to learn about the mythology and history of Europe during the Viking era, so I'll give it another try. But I will tell you that this is a boring book. The author makes the story and the world seem real, but you're just supposed to take things at face value. He puts some quotes and quotes are given without explanation, and there are some very long, boring, boring sentences. It's not clear what the main character is trying to achieve, but it makes me wonder why he's in the middle of a war in a Viking era. I felt cheated after finishing this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is no mention of anything like the book was written. It's a bunch of stuff from Wikipedia, which is very difficult to understand 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a good book for those who just want to learn the basics of chess and chess history. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver any deeper information than what is given in the chapters which cover a small section of the game. As an experienced chess player, I know this to be a very rare case. But the book does not help the beginner either. This is because it is a very shallow, short lesson book. It offers only a very limited number of suggestions to help beginners learn the game of chess. It is a bad, dry book to begin with. But even worse, it is just not even published in the Czech language so it is virtually impossible to find in a bookstore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't even bother reading it. I thought it was a bad joke of a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is funny but the actual book is not.  It's a compilation of random anecdotes, not as interesting as a story about a man getting a book for Christmas from a young lady. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried hard to finish this book. However, I did not. The text was so much for me to read that the book was over very soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book as a child and I found that it was a terrible mistake to use. My daughter is still in it today and she has even written about it in a negative book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be an eye opener. For those who are still confused about this very important subject, please read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only positive thing about this book is that it describes the methods of a good teacher to a young person. However, the author uses it as a way to criticize and embarrass his students, as well as to present his own thoughts about how a good student would learn the language. It is not for a student who wants to improve his or her language skills. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very, very long.  The information it gives is pretty much the same for every character.  If you want information for your kids about characters from a fantasy book, you'll have to check a good book out first 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is simply another case of "wanting something more" and a "happy ending." The author's obsession with religion is evident in his prose and writing. He claims to have seen a vision of Jesus in a dream, and so he goes to heaven and tells everyone about it.  Then he goes back to his faith.  He uses this book to explain and defend his religion.  This is not religion, but the writings of a man looking for answers to problems of faith. This book, as  far as I can tell, is simply a collection of quotes from different authors.  If you want to know what God is like, read the bible.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book before and the story about her being a teenager, being gay, and how her family accepts her life was the most interesting. However, the way the story was handled was terrible. The story was told in a detached way and never really showed us the real story. The writing was weak, there were only 3 different characters, and there was so many characters you didn't really know what was going on. The book was a real disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a book about a girl's suicide:  I have read a few other books about suicide and this was by far the most disgusting 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a professional photographer and was looking for a book to improve my understanding of this beautiful and rewarding art form. This book does not do that, it is filled with boring advice, and the photography is nothing to write home about.  The book is filled to the brim with advice for students and teachers, but there is so much info on these topics that you'd be surprised how little is covered. There are only three pictures, and most of those are of people in a studio.   This book is not for someone who wants to improve their photography or have any idea about the photography arts.  It's for someone that is looking to look like a professional model for a fashion shoot, and I don't think that's the most important thing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a waste of money.  Not even close to worth the money or the time.  It is nothing but a collection of what she knows, from her own experiences, and then a bunch of unrelated trivia.  I don't recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have seen the reviews on Amazon and I'm sorry if I was the only one who thought so. The idea is great, but the writing is lacking. It is a bad read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For a book in its 20th year, this is the worst  book I have ever read.  It gives a bunch of things to talk about, but the  book is really about writing, and the  style is not appropriate for the subject.  I read this to learn how to write.   It is full of typos 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't understand the points in the book, except for that they are in the interest of children. I'm glad that the publishers are changing this as the book was dated. The other problem was that it's written in such a condescending manner that it was hard for me to read it. It seems that the author didn't really read much before writing it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not helpful. It is an unhelpful guide to the  Bible. It does not tell the reader about good verses  or bad ones. It makes the Bible look like a bad work  of fiction. I do not recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author doesn't seem to understand that people aren't going to understand anything that the author says, and he doesn't even try to give readers the benefit of the doubt.The book is in a general sense quite boring.The characters are boring. The story is tedious.I was not interested in reading the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has been over a year since I have read this book. It is a very boring read. I will not continue to read the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the worst books ever written.  The writing style of this book is just as awkward and dull.  I would not recommend this book to any reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an attempt to "solve" a mystery by following a few people who have strange encounters with the dead, and no one is more mysterious than the book's subject. However, this is hardly the case in this story. I would recommend it for someone looking for a mystery story that works as well as it doesn't. It's just one of those weird books and has no plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of money and the author doesn't even try to help his readers by making anything clear. He goes through a lot of boring subjects which he could have explained more clearly in the book. But I don't read about this kind of material. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For some reason I chose this book over more recent one (The Great Depression) and the only negative review that I have found is from  a book review magazine.   It doesn't do the subject any favors 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of useless information, from what the book says about how long your hair should be (and it's about 1/4 inch shorter than it is supposed to be), to how much shampoo you should use, to how many sheets you should wash a day. This book isn't even close to being easy to follow. Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book itself is not bad, but the author, an expert on the subject of religion, seems to think that he has hit on the key to God. It is as if he has the answers and the key on the keyset that will make all believers. I'm not sure how he managed to get a book published without a good book review. This is what God looks like 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a bit outdated. The book, and the author, seems to have forgotten about the modern world. The world today has very different values, laws and customs. The author does nothing to correct this. Instead, he is going backwards into the past and trying to find some form of justification to the primitive values of our era. I think this book is useless and a waste of time. I would not waste a good book like this on my children 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very poor review.  It would have been much better if it would have given some real insights into the life of a real person who struggled with dyslexia, depression, etc., instead of giving us a long speech about how great God is and how bad we're all, and how God loves us and we need to keep in our eyes God's loving care of us 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For someone looking for a more practical approach to learning a foreign language, this is not for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the worst book ever written.  I can't even imagine why anyone would waste money on it.  Just like every other book that I have ever read, this book has absolutely nothing to do with the reality of the Japanese.  Don't waste your money on this book.  If it is meant to be a guidebook, then at least explain why you are Japanese and how you got here 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the worst 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was written by a woman.  She never bothered to write a positive review about it. The author, however, does do a good job of explaining the book to the reader.  The only problem I have with it is that it is full of spelling errors, and grammar mistakes, and it is not easy to understand.  I find this book not worth reading because it doesn't explain the text to me, but I do find it entertaining, and entertaining is good enough for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author claims to have taken several courses in history. In reality she has probably only taken one: Germanic studies.  The book is so full of contradictions that one would think it is written in an attempt to prove that the Germans never suffered under Nazi oppression. It is a blatant piece of disinformation written to support the ideas of an extremist ideology. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of horrible ideas, bad advice, and not a lot of useful information. For starters, they're based on the "Buddhists" theory and not on anything else 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is full of mistakes and mistakes in grammar.  It is a horrible book and I feel sorry for  all of the students that took the class.  I can understand that it was not well received  but this book is for kids that want to read a book about the Bible.  If you are going to do that, it might be better  to go to the library and read up a little on the subject.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only good thing about this book is that it includes recipes, though it is so long, that the recipes are quite unorganized.  I've been cooking in a few different styles since I got this book, and the recipes contained therein have never worked with me.  This book is not for beginners, the instructions are a little confusing for newbies, and I feel it takes too long to go over the recipes 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title, and the style of writing and the presentation are very similar to "A Book of Unfortunate Situations". However, it is a poor book. The story is far from believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not finish the book before I lost interest in it.  I found it all too confusing and the stories not original.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of false claims.  It uses the word "psychic" to mean a person who believes in psychic powers.  The book makes many positive claims about the paranormal and is full on propaganda.  Its very difficult to use the information as taught in the book.  I had to use some other methods to really improve the knowledge of the subjects.  However,  the best part of the book is the cover.  When I found the book in my college library, I didn't expect it to look like this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is slow and amateurish, but this book's content is more offensive than interesting 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has no value for any student. It is a great excuse for a teacher to explain the theory of relativity and describe his personal life. It contains nothing that will improve your understanding of mathematics or physics. I found it difficult to follow the explanations. Even the last chapter is filled with lots of mathematical jargon. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed reading this book, but it lacked any interest in historical and scientific concepts, like genetics, geology, etc. Instead, it just repeats the same ideas over and over.  I found some of the names of plants and insects wrong, and others were not explained in any way.  There were too many pictures of plants 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has been published in Germany and other places with such a bad translation. Not only is the book quite boring, it's hard to find any good references for many of the quotes.I just wish you would have been smarter and gone for a different translation 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has many interesting ideas, but I had a hard time connecting the ideas to life. The ideas are not clear. I was more concerned about the writing style, which is too stylized. I also think that this book is not very well thought out. The writer seems to think that if we all think and speak the same way, everything will be easy. It's not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written in the 1950's.  I had no problem finding the chapters that related to the Cold War, but this book is full of irrelevant historical details.  The subject matter of this book did not appeal to me.  It is a book about a war, and not a good book about war. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not recommend this book. I found it more interesting to watch the video on the author's website (which I found too much  repetitive and boring) instead of looking through the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the reviews about it and it is terrible.  The characters are dull, it's not funny, the plot was not interesting,  the dialogue wasn't funny,  etc.  It's a horrible book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is horrible. It's not even funny.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very boring. It's hard to write a good review about this kind of book, because it's simply written as a form of self promotion. This is a bad idea.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has the advantage that the authors are both physicians, and have more of a medical background. But I found it lacking in terms of real life examples.  The main idea of this book is to find the best diet for the body type that you are and your patients, and there are very few examples. No pictures, no text explaining why the particular foods are beneficial, why not the others.  It is a self help book, and the author is not an expert in the field.  I would not recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the first book in a series. The book is mostly written from the point of view of a young girl. She is a very naive girl and doesn't realize that she is having an affair with her friend. She doesn't know that her mother has come into her life because she doesn't want to deal with the truth. I didn't like it at all. There is very little insight into the lives of these people. They are basically just like us with the exception of one girl who is very clever.The author is only interested in making money and doesn¬¥t really care about his characters. I just couldn't stand the main character. He was completely unrealistic. He didn¬¥t seem to realize that what he was doing was wrong. I tried to read the other characters in the series, but they are all very similar and very boring. I wouldn¬¥t recommend this book to anyone except as a reading experience for a high school student 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the first and only book about the famous writer to have appeared on the market. The book is written in a superficial and unprofessional manner. The author is, in a word, ignorant about any subject whatsoever. He uses all his favorite metaphors such as the red book and the blue book to give his book a scholarly appeal. This book has already been thoroughly criticized by several respected authorities. The text is written like an advertisement. The last word comes from the author's own mouth, and it is one that will go down in the annals of American literature. This is truly a sad example of what can go wrong when the money is on the line. It is a book that is so superficial that the author could probably have been a successful writer if he had only taken the time to learn his subject properly and really understood it. It will not be for everyone, but only the truly adventurous will try to read it. I strongly suggest you look elsewhere for an insight into literary literature 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't waste your money on this book, read  J.B. Coe's "Biblical Tales" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm really disappointed with this book. I have already received the book for free in the book club, so I can't even comment on the review here. I hope my fellow readers can have a better experience with this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a hagiography of Dr. Strangelove, and the author is a friend of Kubrick, so it is a very shallow and trivial presentation of Kubrick's life. The book also uses an invented story about an American soldier who served in the Vietnam War, and his strange and confusing obsession with the Soviet space program. Kubrick was a good friend of the author, so the fact that the book's author even knows Kubrick is bad enough. The author makes a huge deal about the fact he was Kubrick's biographer, and spends lots of time trying to connect with the man in a way that is not even close to what Kubrick would have done. I do not find that I have the patience to go through the book, but I'm not going to waste any more of my time on it because it's just not that good.If you want to hear more about what Kubrick was up to, or want to know more about his movies, you would do better to just listen to interviews or read books about him. That being said, there are so many more interesting and better books on Dr. Kubrick, and people like Steve Martin and David Mamet 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If this is what they are trying to get out, then  I am just not interested in reading it.  The whole book is just the beginning of a series, so  I'll have to look for the rest of it. This is  a great book, but for the first half, it is just  a collection of anecdotes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book over a weekend in the summer and the whole thing seemed like a bad dream.  The characters in this book are the very annoying teenagers with no self respect that drive their friends crazy.  What a horrible character development.  I really enjoyed it in the beginning, but I can't seem to put it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very boring. It is a bit too long for your average children book but the pictures are good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is so arrogant, it makes the title of the book seem more of a threat. The author seems to think that anyone who disagrees with his point of view is stupid. I am not sure if I am the only person who thinks this way, but I am willing to try to find a book by someone else that is worth the money.I can't give a negative rating because this book was so poorly written and illustrated that it was not even fun to read. This book was nothing more than a cheap book filled with overused facts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very frustrating for a first-time reader.  Her story is not original; it is simply a collection of what her students are writing about.  The writing style is very  repetitive and boring, and I found the author's vocabulary very  lacking.  I will give her a rating of a 2  for style and a 1 for content; her prose is very ¬† monotone, and doesn't rise to the level  of the subjects that are covered 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story line seems to be about a young girl who is trying to be a tomboy, while her older brother is a more typical suburban teenager. I found that to be far from the case. She was very passive and I didn't feel sorry for her. I just hated the character. I was hoping for something that was more like "Denny", instead of the typical suburban girl. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the first half and thought it was an amusing read but after about a third of the way through I was so frustrated.  I did not enjoy it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very, very sad book. Very sad. But it was the only book I could find that was so horrible I had to turn the page over. The author of this book seems to have only a basic grasp of what is happening in the world today. It makes me sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is nothing but drivel. The author has no clue about what a real job is.  He is trying to convince his readers that a job is never boring and that the only way to be successful is to have a great job that is both intellectually stimulating and personally fulfilling.  I'm not sure how he could be so stupid.  And, his examples are just flat out wrong.  It was like reading a bad textbook on how to succeed in life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you have read any good book on women (or other things), this is the one.  But the main problem is that it is about women (not a good book for anyone).  It is a bad idea to write a negative negative review of a bad books:  It doesn't make any sense to write about women 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the stories very dull. I feel like this book is trying too hard to portray this as a tough, bad boy, but I wouldn't recommend this book for young children 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the first half of this book, which is about a young couple. It gave me very little insight, just a series of examples of women that are very unattractive.  I never would have bought a book about women if it were about men. The author seems to have little knowledge of male sexuality or female attraction. I just wanted a positive, interesting book about female sexual relationships 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book has no idea what he wants you to do. He talks about the benefits and benefits of fasting, and says he doesn't like sugar, so you could only eat half a candy bar on that fast! So, no nutrition information whatsoever. The book talks about what to eat, and what not to eat. This book does nothing more than cover the basics. Nothing really interesting or informative. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not for beginners. This book can be extremely confusing, and even people who are experienced with Java would find some of the information in the book difficult to grasp. I do not recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would give a negative rating only for the bad writing, not the story. Not worth the time or money to read this book. It is filled with mistakes. It makes no sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very negative review. I found the subject of the book fascinating, but found the writing style tedious and boring. The book is also full of errors and omissions. I would strongly suggest avoiding this book and avoiding the subject matter in general 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of mistakes, it is not what it claims to be.  There is no "theoretical" approach, and the information is confusing.  For the money  I would have spent less time with this book,  it is a bad read.  It  seems there is some confusion about what is a good book and what is  not.  I am sure some of the information from this book could be easily found in the public  domain, and there is a lot of poor examples  to give that idea away 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As much as I enjoy the book, I would advise against anyone reading it to the elderly.  It is a bad novel and the author is quite unwise 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would like to read a book about modern English  but it seems that this book is not for us,  for it does not give any real information about  modern English.  However, the book gives you a good overview about a good  book: John T. ¬† 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have had my copy of this book for over a year, and it has always been with me, and I read it in this form as well as the original (which is a bit long) so it seems to me to be a bit of a contradiction in terms.  The text is boring as a matter of fact, and all you can do is recite it without any real insight.  I would recommend the original, as the form in which it is presented here is the perfect form, and the text is not nearly as boring as it is here 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I took a course in early American history and this book seemed to fall apart right after the first chapter. I couldn't understand why he chose to include a picture of William Henry Harrison at the end of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are many good things to say about the book: a good introduction to the subject matter, excellent pictures, some of the history of photography, the history in Japan, and many more. Unfortunately, the photographs are poorly organized. The pictures are mostly in the form of photos taken by others and do not tell you what the photographer is looking at, nor where they are standing. The author spends too much time discussing the photographic techniques of the time, instead of the subject of the book. Some of his ideas seem ridiculous, such as his claim that the camera was not invented in 1905, and that photography is only about using the camera in a negative manner. The whole book reads like an academic paper that is written for some class. I believe this book is better for the intermediate level photography student who wants to learn something more about the subject and to understand why photography is popular today 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very little of the content has any relevance to what a good book should do 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very hard to understand the religious aspects of this book. It is only because I am a Catholic that I could read it.  It has some nice words on prayer, but most of the words are not very effective.  If you are looking for a good book on religion, look somewhere else 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought that the book was a bit too long and it took too long to go over the topics. I wouldn't recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   First of all, it was written in the 1970's and is about the Beatles and not the modern day. That means it is full of outdated pop culture references and songs. I didn't find much value in it either. If you are really looking for a good book on the Beatles, this is not the book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is nothing to learn from this book other than a long rant about how much he hates the media.  It is a pity that he would even say such a negative thing about the media, but it seems the only way he can find to take credit for any positive ideas he has is through this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't stand the book. I have to admit that the title of the book is a misnomer 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author seems to have little idea of what he is writing about. He begins by saying there are many things about Buddhism, but there is no attempt to present a practical explanation of the Dhamma. For example, it doesn't take a Buddhist scholar to understand why the idea that there is nothing that is beyond death is nonsense. Nor does he discuss how such views are held by the various religions in Asia. Instead, he argues that the Dhiyanis and Nyanissis (non-Buddhist) have become confused, and there is a need to clarify the subject. This is the only time I have seen a statement like that. It is a waste of ink and space, and should be ignored. If you are looking for a practical understanding of Buddhism, get a dictionary or a dictionary of philosophy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a good book. Not a good reference book.  The information in this book is very weak and the author does not know the subject well. She has no practical knowledge about a book about dogs and this book has no information about any dog that she does not like 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very bad book for the average book lover.  It is written in the first person  style which makes the book boring and the pictures  not that good.  The main idea is for the characters to explore the world and the author tries to make it  look like you are getting off to a great start.  However the book is only about 50 pages long.  You probably need to buy some other book  for that.  I tried to give the book a good review, but it was not  that good for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not entirely sure I would classify this as a novel.  It's not even very well written and the characters are nothing more than cardboard cutouts.  Even the sex scene is not as graphic as I expected.  What I would say is that the main characters are really the two male characters.  The other character is the hot girl that wants to get with the main guy.  He gets upset because she doesn't want to go with him and then he's so turned on that he gives her a "hand job."  He also has his lover talk about the main character and how much he loves him.  That is about it.  I didn't like the characters at all and this was a bad read.  There is a scene in it where one character is in the shower.  His best friend comes in and tells him he has to get out of the shower and take a shower with the hot sexy girl.  Then the other character walks into the bathroom and sees his hot hot hot girlfriend and he's like  You want to see a hot sexy hot girl right now  What is the point of this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It would have been better if you had asked the author to send you some of the stories in the book for review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the third book I have read from these authors. I have no idea what I should expect or be prepared for, except that I must try to ignore the warnings that are given in the book. I am not prepared to read a book that is not useful to the layman in this area of study. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has everything you could ever want. The pictures are beautiful and they are accompanied by the story line, but the story lines are not engaging 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has a history of working with  patients on various topics, but never worked with AIDS patients. He does however write that   the best way to reduce viral load is through dietary restriction 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of lies. The fact is, the only person who actually knows what the book says is a psychiatrist, who told a psychiatrist friend of mine, who read the book and found out that the author's credentials didn't check out.  And why should a psychiatrist be able to know that the books he is reading contain falsehoods 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm currently in the process of reading this book. The premise is that they're all women, and yet we see them with the same flaws: not understanding emotions, not doing research, not getting along with other people, etc.  Don't buy the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with some good ideas, but they are over-analyzed and presented in a very technical manner, leading to a boring and tedious story. This book could have been much better if he had used some less technical terms in the discussion. It was a book to teach the concept of writing, not to write a good book. If you want to write, this book is not for you. It will only help you to make some good sentences in your own mind and will only give you some very useless practice and make you lose the ability to write when you are already better at it than anyone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read and read a number of books about the American Revolution, and this one was one of the most irritating. It was written for people that knew nothing about the revolutionary events that transpired, and was written as if it were some kind of biography of George Washington 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing style is poor. The main characters are not as convincing as others. The story makes a lot of assumptions, which is not a bad thing, but not for a story about a dog. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too much unnecessary info about a horrible book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A great book about travel and money, it's easy to see why it got a bad review from some people who were trying to sell it, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For some reason, this book has been all over the news.   The book is written with the assumption that you are new to weightlifting, but is written for someone who has been training since age 10 and who has worked out hard and diligently for years.  The author doesn't even attempt to address why the lifter is getting less results as he becomes older.  This is a book written for an older lifter, for someone whose training has been going on for over 20 years. What does this have to do with the beginner lifter?  What does the beginner do to get the results that the intermediate lifter has?  The only difference between this book and many other books on weight training is the lack of explanation.  For the intermediate-level lifter to progress, he must gain muscle mass.  A big reason why the beginner doesn't get results is that the beginner simply does not train heavy enough.  All of these exercises require heavy training.  So why does the author say the novice can simply increase the weights as he gains weight?  So much for the fact that the only reason the intermediate has trouble getting results is because he is not training hard enough to gain mass. The book clearly states that the book can be used as a reference for beginner lifters, but does nothing to address any of the problems that I see in the intermediate who attempts to train heavy with this book.  Again, it seems the author has nothing but contempt for the intermediate.  If the book were written with a more realistic approach and less snarky attitude, it might actually help the intermediate or the beginner to succeed.  Instead, it simply tries to make the intermediate feel guilty for failing at training heavy.  It would be nice if the book did something positive for the beginner so that he could see the positive effects of training heavy and gain mass, but it doesn't.  What good is a weightlifting book if it does nothing for you?  It's time for a better approach for a beginner and a better book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is one of the first to be written on the topic of 'haunting', and is one that I hope to see published for many years to come 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of time. It's full of clich√©s,  and the style of writing is quite strange.   There is hardly any real information here and no one will actually be able to understand anything in this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only positive review I have ever read on this book is that it is only about the time period when this book takes place.  The rest of the book is about the war in Vietnam.  It should be about the soldiers who fought in the first Gulf War as opposed to those who fought a war in Iraq.  I'm sorry that this book was written by a soldier, but that's the only positive thing I can say about it.  This book doesn't do anything for the soldiers, it just tells them that if they fight, the only good thing is to keep on killing.   I would have read a better book, but I didn't.  As an Iraq veteran, I am embarrassed and angry that someone who fought so many people in Iraq could write such a bad and worthless book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title of the book is misleading, there are quite a few people in this book who have the same problem.  You are probably better off with any other book about how to be a good wife, mother, and businesswoman.  This book is about how NOT to be such a person.  If you want to learn about the importance of marriage, please read The Good Wife by Barbara Bush. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping that this would be the first of a series of books on the history of the Russian and Soviet Union. Instead, it's a collection of quotes, some of which are quite humorous and a lot of which were culled from the speeches of the American press. It is a little overrated too. The first part was interesting but the rest was just dull. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and found that the only reason why I kept going back to it was because of all the positive reviews I saw in the reviews section of the book's website.  I'm disappointed to say that this book has no positive reviews and is just a negative one, at least for me.  It's not that the book is bad, it's that it's a one-sided review of a negative book.  There are many things in this book that I disagree with, but I don't see why I would have to see the book in order to tell you that.  If I had to read this review in order, I would just read the negative reviews and go back to the negative review section of your website to see which things I disagree (like how you say the book lacks depth, but in my opinion it is actually deeper than most authors could make it out to be) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book. But there is no discussion of what happened on the ground. Just a bunch of photos and a short quote from the military that they don't agree with, but they are all in the book so I feel a bit bad about my choice 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am new to this language and was looking for a book that would help me get my basic Spanish skills in order. This book did not do that.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want a bad history book then read this book. This book has not been revised in a long time and it's getting very tired. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In short, this book does not even contain a word of positive references to Japanese culture and its art, which are well documented in my other book, The Japanese Language and the Art of Japanese Culture 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel that this book was written because of the popularity of the book by Joseph Heller. However, what happened to this book is the reason I will never purchase another Heller book. It is written so long that the story is completely forgotten. I did not get into it because I thought it would be interesting and I liked Joseph Heller a great deal. However I had to throw away the book in the end because it was so over-long. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know why they have the word "stupidity" in it. What they mean is:  This book is stupid.  It makes no sense, it doesn't explain anything.  The only good thing is that I can't even read it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As I was reading the book, I realized I wasn't having much of a chance against my good luck. I have had much success with others books and the authors were so good that they made me do it the same way again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a person who has read many of her books, it's clear that she is not a writer.  The plot is so dull.  There is so much information to memorize.  For example, it tells us that her daughter was named after a bad electronic device.  Yet, she does not mention the name of any electronic device that is bad.  If she knew about them, then why not mention it in her books?  She clearly has very little talent in writing.   I really wish she had not put a lot of information on her pages, but I was so frustrated that I could not finish the book.  It was painful to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I took one star off for the following reason:  This book is about a boy's love life.  That's not my thing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and didn't like it. There was no real substance in the writing. There were lots of short stories that I never understood, and it's almost impossible to read all the stories in the book in one sitting.  I guess that's the reason for the low rating: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is more of a manual for the young adult in the family than anything else 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read almost all of her books, but this one is by far the worst. Her tone is condescending and she's trying to show off her books. She's got a bad review in the back and I would say to try not to buy the book, even though it is listed as a "guidebook" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so full of lies, distortions and exaggerations that it makes my head hurt. The main point is that Jews are superior. But in this book, Jews, who are supposed to be the descendants of the ancient Hebrews, are depicted as being the opposite of Hebrews. The story goes that this is how the ancient Israelites were: They were a superior race, the descendents of the Hebrews and therefore the greatest in the world. And this is where the story goes from bad to worse. The Jews are depicted to be ignorant, uneducated, backward, uncultured, uncivilized, unfeeling and cruel. These attributes are also the attributes of the original Hebrews who are depicted in the book as being superior, advanced, wise, knowledgeable, intelligent, civilized, moral, just, decent, loving, wise and caring. This is the main theme of the book, which makes it not only a bad historical book but also a bad political one. And by that I mean that the idea of being superior to others is the major theme of this book. This book would not only make you hate the Jewish people, it would make you believe that any government who wants to act against the Jewish population will be taken over by Jews and that the government in every country in the Western world will be controlled by Jews. This idea would have been extremely helpful to the Nazis in their cause because that is what this book suggests. This kind of writing is the cause of all the problems in the Middle East and everywhere else. The book was written by a Jew himself and is written in a biased, condescending and un-educating tone. I believe that if anyone has any questions about the book's accuracy they should contact the publisher, because it is obvious that this book is nothing but a lie. This makes it one of the worst books to ever come out of America 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book does not even start on time. The first section is a series of negative comments about other authors, such as Robert Pinsky and Don Quixote. The other chapters are in general disparaging of a certain "quotidian" lifestyle. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read the previous three books in this series, and they're all great, but this is the worst book I've ever read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first thing that struck me when reading the book was the author's obvious desire to tell us as much as he can about himself. The second was the poor language. He's in his late fifties. He speaks with a very thick accent, and it sounds like someone who is very proud of his native language. The writing style, at least for the main portion of the book, is very, very poor. I would be much more concerned about the poor grammar and the fact that he uses it in a way that is so offensive to many people, as opposed to the fact he simply doesn't know how to write. I was very disappointed to read that this was going to be the final edition of this book and that it was a good idea to have his last words written in French. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The author does not seem to be well informed about history, and he presents the war in the wrong context: it is the war against Germany and not against the USSR. As for the subject of the war, it is not the subject, as stated in the introduction, but the subject (and the whole book) has a poor structure. I was so surprised that I skipped the index and just started from the first page. In general, it's a difficult book to read (because the author doesn't bother to follow his own logic) but if you're looking for some historical background information, then you might find it here. This book might be more good for a study, for historical research, than for personal reading. It would not be a bad idea to read the book, but not for a personal reading experience, as it is too much about the subject. This is not bad in the least, but it's certainly a bad read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book about 30 years ago and have never been able to get through it. This is not a good book, but it is supposed to be a good reference book about early Mormon history.  It is a compilation of essays by scholars in the field.  This book is full of misinformation, inaccurate statements, and some outright falsehoods.  The title is misleading.  Most of the information in this book is not from early Mormon times, but from later times.  I find it difficult to believe the editors of this book would even consider putting out a book that includes this material. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It doesn't have any positive impact on a child. It is repetitive. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and found it very boring and dull. The information is quite accurate for a military history but you have to know the people and the time to understand what the military does.  I wouldn't buy this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is filled with incorrect assumptions and the writer is completely oblivious to reality.  The author claims that all humans were once apes.  This book does not contain any references to any other source.  It is a complete waste of space and time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't believe this is a good book for people who have never studied chemistry and don't understand why a chemical reaction is going to cause a reaction, and I don?t understand why that reaction is a bad thing. The book makes it seem like reaction is always the result of an error, that if you?re careful you can avoid them, and everything is about chemicals and reactions, and not about anything else. This book does not describe the chemistry of reactions very well, it gives the chemist a long list of reactions without giving the reader the most important one, which is the one that actually does the reaction. The last part of the book is about how to do the reaction and it is all in the book.  This book is for people that do chemistry all day long, and don?T care about what happens to the reactions after they are done, only what you do. I don;t recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so bad and full of inconsistencies that it's almost unbelievable that it was ever published 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, a collection of stories, is a little too funny to be a guide book. But it's not funny enough to write a positive review about it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book for the first time and I must say it is one of the most boringly written books I've ever read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not recommended, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and loved it, so the author, I feel, must be really frustrated with his book sales because this is one of his very worst books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If this book is supposed to be about love and life, then why doesn't this book include stories about couples who are involved in a long term relationship? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think there are many more good books out there, and this one is no exception 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains a lot of personal information that is very personal, but it is also very boring. There is not a lot happening in this book. A lot of the information is repeated several times. This book is more of a guide than a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a quick guide to the game for first-time golfers.  It does not do anything but talk about the fundamentals.  The golfers do not have to have any golf experience to follow the rules and understand the rules.  Some of the golfers are not the best players 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main problem with the book is the authors' lack of knowledge of the historical facts.  The book claims that the American Revolution was a violent affair, but I can prove it with only two words:  Thomas Jefferson.  It's an easy mistake to make because there are many historical facts and details that the author fails to appreciate.  He uses quotes from the Declaration of Independence, but quotes like that are only as good as the writer's knowledge of American history.  You can learn a lot more about the American War for Independence, its participants and tactics from a good history book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of lies. The whole thing is just about the girl going to college, and that is about as close as you can get to reality. It is as if she was a teenaged boy. This book should not be available to teens. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was all about being a gay man, and I was tired of it.  It had lots of stuff about how gay men are selfish.  I feel like I could have read some other book, but  I kept on reading it because it was entertaining.  As far as I know, it was not written by a gay person,  so I found the message to be really off-putting.  Some parts of the book were really funny.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, we are all entitled to our own opinions. But to suggest that I had no respect for the dead in this book is outrageous, ignorant and downright disrespectful.  This book is nothing more than a piece of pseudo-fiction and should never have been published 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a very long book, but I was not able to finish it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of inaccuracies and makes it impossible to understand the problems in the world today. It is an absolute disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of inaccurate information about animals and plants.  The information is derived from nature and many of it is based on outdated theories.  I was appalled by the animal stories in this book.   The "Famous" section of the book is a complete joke 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was an excellent start to a good book. I gave it to my daughter for Christmas and she read it for the first time in a few weeks.  What a waste of time and money.  I returned it to Amazon as soon as I realized it was a bad buy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is so much written about the book, you may think that it is a real life event. This is a case of false advertising for a book that does not deliver. There is no evidence that he ever served in the army. The main purpose of his military service was to get his books published, which I think was foolish. But if you are looking for an army history, this is not the book. It is much more of a personal account about his early life 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to know what the Bible is, do yourself a favor and buy a Bible. Do yourself a favour and skip this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a fun read, but the book is full of errors. The first two chapters on the history of the Bible are both incorrect. The author states that Isaiah was a priest of the church. What he means is that he was a bishop. His first mention of the word priest is in his chapter about John the Baptist. Isaiah was not a priest. He was a prophet, and the word "priest" does not appear in his text. It is not a typo. It was the author's intention to say that Isaiah is a priest when he was actually a prophet. The same goes for his chapter on John the Baptizer. This is one of those things I don't care to read over and over again. It seems this author is more interested in making a good book than writing one that is correct.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written by a mother to a child with autism.  What mother doesn't want the best for her child but rather the worst possible situation to be created.  Autism is a horrible disease.  Her book did not work for her.  She must have had some horrible experience with the disease. The story about a child who loves a mouse is so unrealistic it is unbelievable.  This is a terrible book, I gave it a low rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read most of her books and this one was one of the worst I've read. Not only did the main character die off in the middle of the story, but the plot line was not believable at all.  I just thought it was an awful book.  The main character had to make it through a year without a good book in sight and ended up having to write another book because of this one.  This book was really disappointing for me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, I guess I'm not the target audience for this book, but it seems to come off as a bad cook book: The recipe for mashed potatoes was from the New York Times Cookbook.  And I would assume that someone who uses a potato mash as a main ingredient is either a complete idiot or a cook that doesn't know how to cook.  Maybe it's that simple.   The recipes were written in the late 1800s, but are out of date.  The potatoes were the worst potatoes.  I'm surprised it hasn't been reprinted.  This is a bad bad book for a bad recipe 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most  negative review I can think of is that the information and arguments that are presented in the book are simply wrong.  I would recommend the book for a general audience, not for a serious and educated reading  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a book by an American man living in Japan.  The writing style is too casual and the characters are flat.  I don't see how it will be read by American teenagers and will never buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not very informative. It tries to justify the use of corporal punishment in some instances. However, the book is very short and you can learn more on your own from the websites of groups such as The American College of Pediatricians, www.pediatrict.com 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book should be for people who are interested in learning more about the Chinese culture, but it was not for me. It seemed to be aimed for a more Western audience, and it wasn't. There was no discussion of Chinese food, Chinese clothes, Chinese history, etc. The author said the book is meant for people of different ages, from 8 to 80. Well I don't want to say that my age is that of a Chinese child, but still... The whole book seemed to me like a little bit of a children's book, not a serious discussion about life in China 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For a book on this topic I'm really disappointed.  This book is not only full of useless information, it also offers no advice on how to change your unhealthy eating habits.  So, if you have any interest in weight loss or weight maintenance  I suggest you read a book by a good personal trainer like Jenny Craig,  or go see a dietician 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the kind of book that is made for the Christian church.  However, it is a poor excuse for Christian values 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is supposed to be the "beginning guide to  Buddhism". It is nothing of the sort. The author goes through several of the popular Mahayana  sutras (e.g. '≈öƒÅkya, 'Dharma, 'Nirvana') in order to give  some sense of how to  practice  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I took one star away from this book. A lot of the concepts that are discussed, such as the psychology of addiction, are not well-understood. Some examples that were given in this book were confusing. For example:  The term 'heroin' is not explained. The author suggests that the idea of heroin is simply to 'give a bad habit a bad name'!  I just could not follow the logic. It wasn't that easy, either. The concept of 'drug' was unclear to me too. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read it in the middle of the book. It was the first book I read that I liked, so I thought that I'd give this one a try. I am still thinking about it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book to my students and they couldn't read the title.   If this is what students are going to have to look up in order to get a better understanding of the bible, then it is a poor book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read many good reviews about this book, but this one is the most offensive. It was a first for me, but if you want to read the story, read a more "accessible" story like  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Too much information in one chapter. I don't even know where to begin. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The writing is clunky and poorly organized. There is no mention of much of the history of electronic equipment in the U.S. or in the world at large. The text is dated and the images are very basic. There was no way I could keep up with the topics covered in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very difficult to follow this book. The author has a way with words but rarely explains what is going on. We are never told what is happening in the war or what we are fighting for. I found this book to be an  empty waste of time. I recommend  other books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too much of this book is about sex.  Very few people discuss the emotional aspects of love.  This book could be used as a self help guide for couples on how to communicate better with their partner.  If you want to find out what  your partner really wants and needs from you in life  and how you can get that out of yourself  start reading other book on this subject: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to wait months for this book to come out. Then I started this book and read through it to catch up. The story does not interest me at all. The only thing I liked was the ending. But, that is about it. I don't have the patience for this kind of material 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is bad. It is not only boring to read but it makes you a negative person.  The author writes things like:  I do not like people who talk about their feelings and about their life.  I dislike people who are not serious.   I was disappointed when I first saw the first chapters and I didn't like them anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am quite a bit of a biography buff, so this one had me disappointed.  Unfortunately, it doesn't explain why and it's a very dry, boring book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of misinformation, myths, and incorrect information. If you're a woman who wants to become a homemaker, this book will give you a bad review. If someone asked you to teach a class about homemaking and you would recommend this book, I hope you take your kids away from this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a horrible book, full of terrible ideas, and has nothing to do with anything real. It has a huge number of pictures, but none of them are photos of a real dog. It also contains a large number of dog books, and many of the pictures are of dogs on the cover. But all that isn't as bad as the book's content. It's also full of a bunch of useless and unnecessary illustrations (the best dog in the book is a tiny, silly stuffed toy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated the book. It was boring. Too many names, but no detail about what happened to them or where they went. There were so many mistakes it was impossible to understand the story, let alone follow the characters. The ending was so bad, it seemed to be written to give the reader the feeling of being in a bad movie. It also left me feeling confused, disappointed and angry. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're looking for a good book about religion, skip this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is all about men who take advantage of their wives. They are never allowed to get married because they are a "bad" husband and it is his way or the highway. This book is so full of old fashioned moralistic rubbish, you'll feel sorry for the wives who have to endure it all. I gave it a 5 star rating, but don't buy it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a graduate student who has read over 200 college textbooks and still find these to be the worst. The writing style is dull and unimaginative. The content is very subjective and is nothing more than the reader's opinion. This is the worst 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are a lot of mistakes in this book. Not only does the author skip the section on the historical basis of the German-Jewish community, but then makes the mistake of confusing the period of history during which the Jews were living in Germany. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the more recent examples of'mysterious writing' 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of incorrect statements. For example, it says that an old-fashioned book like "A Song for the New World" is about a young woman learning to dance and sing. It also says that "The Bible as a guide is a wonderful, rich resource. But that doesn't mean it is necessarily the most important thing in a student's life." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very biased book with very few points of view. The author does not go into details about the problems of writing in the 21st century. If you are a writer, this is not the book for you.  I would recommend you to read other books instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author writes about the various forms of human abuse that one experiences in a sexual relationship, which can range from verbal abuse to physical abuse.  He provides no examples of what one can do to stop these abuses other than for good old-fashioned "talk" to the victim.  The only positive point in this book is that it provides useful information for students. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very dry and too much about the human body and the importance of getting all the vitamins, mineral supplements, etc that are in the book, without a lot of the stories. I was glad to get rid of it, but it doesn't feel like I'm learning anything new about the body. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I do not like the style of this book and do not recommend it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The most frustrating parts of the book, for me at least, are the chapters discussing the book's arguments. The book is filled with such examples, yet no one in this book does anything to show why the examples are wrong. I would also like to see a chapter on how the book compares to some other books: for example, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not like the book because it is not well written, too much technical, the author should of stopped writing that chapter or else I wouldn't have read the whole thing, and I am sure that most of us that have read this book in the past will agree with me. I am still going to read it in the hopes of learning something, but I hope I have already learned more than I have in the last 30 years 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the first book that I have read from this author, and it is a shame that I read it.  I was a little disappointed in some parts and it would take several months before I could read the rest of the book.  In this book, we are told about all the good and bad things about life:  We learn about all of the  bad things in life: about divorce, about  children and about what to do  when someone is mad.  And in the book, the author tells us that the good  things are also the worst:  A beautiful woman is turned into a dog.  A man is killed by a hit and run.  The protagonist gets sick and has to be in the hospital  for a week.  He dies and all of us are left with his  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was so hard to read it that I skipped through half of the chapters. If you do not want to read the book, and do not need to know the details of the "Prophecy of the Year" or the history of witchcraft, just skim it. It does have some good information about the world, but not enough to make a good study of the subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not sure what the point of this book is, other than to say the world is a wonderful place, and it is everyone's duty to help it grow. The author takes it too far and tells a lot of boring, uninteresting things about history that I don't even recall. All the "good stuff" happens in the past, when there was no writing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book at a library in San Francisco and have not seen the book since. If you are a fan of the show, then there is nothing in this book that will entertain you. The characters never evolve. The plot is predictable. And the plot holes keep coming. You will see a character on the set of an episode and see the same guy there the next day. The only real thing in this story is the plot and the ending. The writing is not great either. I thought it was the author's first attempt at writing a book. The main character is an idiot. He has a great deal of trouble reading, and there are a few scenes where I thought the author was trying to sell us on his life story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it was full of inaccuracies. There was also a lack of historical data and analysis. I thought it was an excellent book on the Holocaust, but it was more for students and people interested in the subject.I would never recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too many clich√©s in this book. A good book for teaching German to beginners though, with a more accurate picture of everyday life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book for the first time a few years back and was completely unsatisfied with the information. The author uses   an outdated method to describe human behaviors, such as looking at a  baby and observing behaviors and how much they are "smiling" or "laughing" or whatever. It's   very similar to the way we observe behavior in toddlers or preschoolers. Not the   only way to do it, but a rather bad way to describe   human behavior. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not only not very well written, it is also boring and very repetitive. I do not know why the author was not more interested in writing more realistic and interesting tales about a variety of interesting things, like what a typical day in the life of a black woman goes like. I feel that he wasted a lot of ink with his writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it hard to even decide to read this book. There are lots of references to the "Hollywood" style, but there are only very brief sketches about the lives of women. Most of the women in the book are extremely beautiful. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you have any interest in religion, this book will have you reading the bible from cover to cover as if it were a good novel. However, if you are interested in the truth of the bible as a history book, or in the lives of ordinary believers, this is a useless book that teaches nothing of either. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would have to agree with many reviewers about this book: I would suggest to a child that you start off with The World Book of Children's Quotations, which is a great book and is not at all boring. This book, however, is not a child's book, nor is it a reference book to the Bible or a Bible Study. It is a text book for children and is a huge disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think the author does a good job of introducing his main ideas:  "The New American Myth: How We Love the U.S.A. and Forget it."  The book is full of overused stereotypes and inaccurate generalizations about the U S. and it is full out trash.  All the Americans are portrayed as idiots and  stupid.  There are even some claims that the U U S., is the most  violent country in the world   He spends more time writing about himself  than the U States 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a bit outdated, and I don't see how it could possibly be of any use to people today. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Too many times I have seen the title "Crazy People: The Psychology of a Unpopular Generation" in print and it always makes me cringe.  This book doesn't make that list 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book, the author has the opportunity to tell her own story.  In that story, she tells us that she is a very active participant in the Mormon Church.  But she doesn't reveal the truth about the relationship between her church and the church's youth movement.  She doesn't tell us how she has been deceived by a group of Mormon mothers for a number of years now, how she had to change her beliefs, and how she left the church.  The result of that deception, however, is the tragic loss of her two children, and the subsequent depression of her entire family.   The truth about that relationship is hidden from this story by an extremely misleading and inappropriate approach.  This book is a disservice to those who actually are in the church, and to those of us who are not.  It is a shameful book and one that I would not recommend to anyone to buy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the second time I have read this book, and in both instances it has fallen short of the quality set out in the title. The book starts with some interesting observations and comments on different aspects of human behavior, then jumps to the more popular "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" and the rest of the book follows that trajectory.  However, after a certain point, the author moves away from presenting actual observations and observations about human behavior and begins to present rather opinionated statements on the "social structure of society", "moral values", etc.  The book is rife with the kind of rhetoric and ideas that one would expect to hear coming from people who believe in the "Social Darwinism" theory.  It has nothing to do with the human spirit 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, I guess it's true that a good book is better than a bad one. But this is not a good novel. It's the story of two people who get married to avoid being forced to divorce. It was not funny, well thought out or even really good in any genre. The main characters were annoying, and I didn't get attached to any of them. They were the main focus of the story. The plotline was incredibly confusing and pointless. The writing style was extremely flat. The dialogue was terrible. And the plotline lacked any real twist at all. It would have been better if it was a parody. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    First, this is a book I could have found at any library or bookstore. Second, this book is not well-written, and I don't see any positive review about how the author changed the text to make it more entertaining.   I am quite disappointed with the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is written in a manner that is insulting and condescending to women.  I'm not one to believe in fairy tales, but it sure seems like you would have to be the kind of person who writes books like this to expect female readers to get a positive review from me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not very well versed in the English language, but this book is a big waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a child I read these stories as a child.  As an adult, I did my best to correct this glaring error.  All of these stories are great.  The problem is, these stories didn't actually occur in the real world, and I don't think they are particularly appropriate to the story of Jesus Christ.  Perhaps a few of the more Christian readers might benefit from this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well I am sure that many of the readers of this book will agree that it is terrible.  The book focuses on the lives of two students, John and Martha, and their relationship with each other.  There are no real characters in this book.  Martha is an extroverted personality, she has been through some ups and downs.  She has two friends that she goes to college with, one of which is her boyfriend.   John on the other hand is much more reserved.  He is not the most outgoing or outgoing of individuals.  John has been struggling with his feelings towards Martha for years.  This is the only real thing that the two of them have in common. I had to go through the whole book just to find the parts that could possibly make this book entertaining 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the first book written by a female about a female relationship. It would be interesting to see other women write about male relationships. What a disappointment 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The last half of the book is filled with the usual 'exotic foods' nonsense that I am sick and tired of.  I don't understand why this author thinks it is appropriate to write a cookbook about exotic food but does nothing to promote healthy eating.  This book is not even the best book on the topic I have read (which I read quite a bit) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book when I was young. It was just for kids. I thought it was wonderful at the time, but I now see it as the source of many   inaccuracies about the history of America. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, I'm sorry to say but this book is a train wreck of all the worst aspects of the book. It takes an hour and a half to read and this is not a book that should be taken on a short trip to a bookstore. The book is full of quotes, but none that are relevant to any discussion of religion or spirituality, much less one that might help you live a good life 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book would have been much better if she had just written something about a true crime story. Then she could have avoided all the gory details. But she chose to write a book about the OJ Simpson trial, so we are stuck with all this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of a great amount of the same  drivel that the original book was.  The author makes fun of everyone in the book, yet is the only one to get a negative book review:  It has to be the only book on the list that's so full of negativity.  And it really does not show how much it has to do with the subject matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is one long rant about an overpriced book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book's title and cover is misleading. It is not a biography of Marilyn Monroe, but a self-help book. The story about Marilyn Monroe seems to be the only theme. The book is not as clear as I thought it was. It can be confusing. The chapter descriptions are confusing as well. I don't think I read the whole book, but this was the first book I have purchased from Bookfinder.com, so it is not the first to disappoint me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is not a good read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't buy any of these books. This is a book that I have read only through Google. I am a big fan of Ray's writing, but his writing style isn't that of his other books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was not what I expected to read about a spiritual journey from atheism to Christianity.  The author describes his religious experiences in a superficial manner.  Most of his examples are of his youth.  I didn't buy it and thought I'd read the book more carefully before reading the following comments:  I believe my father, who was more religious and involved in the Church, would have been more appalled to see how the author portrayed himself.  As for me, I don't see any way I can relate to any of the examples.  And if I were the subject of such a book, I doubt I would be able to relate to some of the situations described. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very poor book.   It is filled with irrelevant information that could not be of any use to anyone, let alone a beginner, no matter how much the author insists he is right.  This is a very bad book, even if the author does his best to make it seem otherwise 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is over 20 years old.  And to get this far in a book is a pretty rare accomplishment, especially for a single book.  I was looking forward to reading this book, and I can't believe I wasted the time to read it. I'd buy the book over and over and still have a hard time putting it down 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not that excited about this book.  This book was designed to make children feel bad about having a bad day, and it did it.  However, the story didn't really engage the child in the same way that the picture books did, and so the book became a slog.  It's kind of the opposite of the picture book I liked.  I would have liked a more engaging picture book here, and less about bad days.  Perhaps next time I'll read this one from cover to cover and try to find the hidden message."
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's explanation of the various techniques, with examples, doesn't hold water. The examples are almost always very poor and misleading, and the method never really gets anywhere. The technique works in some cases, but not in others. There are also many cases of false claims.The problem isn't the book, it's that the author has too many good ideas that are completely unrelated to each other. He seems to believe in all sorts of methods, including those that seem very simple to implement but which turn out to be impossible. This book is only good for advanced students of writing, for those looking for some insight into how to write. For anyone else, I'd recommend picking another book from the list 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a number of the old French classic books. But this one is not good. Very dull. Very, very slow and tedious. Very boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I received this book without looking it up.  I was expecting a well researched and entertaining story of a girl who goes to live with her aunt and uncle.  This was much more than that.  It was more of a biography of the author.  What could she have done with her life to make a book that was not about that?  No one ever explained that. There was no real story, just quotes.  The only way this book could have been better is if there was no pictures at all.  Instead of pictures, the book was littered with the type of stories that could only be written if the writer was dead.   It's not a book you'd want to read if you're looking for a story that tells you about your life.  So why did I buy it?  The pictures are great.  She got herself some good pictures of her grandparents and a good picture of her aunt.  But the only pictures she took of her family members were of herself and her aunt." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think the first thing I noticed about this book is the poor quality of the text. I got the same impression from the first review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of incorrect ideas and not based on any study of the history of Christianity. The author seems to think that because there are many similarities between the teachings of Jesus and those of the Christians today, it is OK for Christians to practice homosexuality. Jesus would be the first to tell you that is absolutely not acceptable. The writer does not discuss this subject at any length. He seems to be very interested in telling his readers that Jesus was gay. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about how to do the opposite of what you are teaching in college.  It is an interesting take on the subject but should not be considered a book for college. If you are a college student, it is just  a way to waste time on topics that don't need to be  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with unnecessary, misleading, or inaccurate information. The book is full of descriptions of foods and the ways to cook them. These descriptions are not always clear. This is in addition to the fact that the recipes are not very good. You can get the book cheaper for Amazon, but the quality is much lower. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you need a quick and easy-to-read summary of the early Christian movement and the doctrine of the Trinity, this is the book for you. The book makes much of it seem like it has already been read by the author or that he has written it from his personal experience. For example, he talks about Paul and John the Baptist having an immediate relationship and how this relationship would be understood by the early church. Yet, he doesn't really go into any detail about how Paul and other early leaders interpreted that relationship. This is a book that I would recommend to people that are looking for an easy overview of a faith that is still not very well understood by many people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a typical American romance/how-to book. Not the book I'd pick if I were the reader, but the author's. This book has more photos of the author posing in his book than the story. I found myself skipping over the pictures in the book and getting lost in the story, which is typical in most romance books. I would definitely not buy this book for a date or any other audience that would benefit from a good story. The story is more of a self-help book than an actual book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read the first volume and have not seen any improvement in her style.  If she had wanted to write about the life of a Christian, she could have found better material than she does.  I find this series to be repetitive.  No matter how many times she tries to make us laugh, it never works.  Her characters seem to get less and less likable.  A friend of mine thought the third volume was better, but I disagree.  The series is far from dull. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is bad, and it should be retired from bookshelves. The text is poorly written. The main characters have no personality whatsoever. The book is full of repetitions, and is fullof tedious and boring facts.  The plot is a boring series of questions and answers.  I am so fed up with this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I received this book from the publisher's request for review copies.  The book was full of inaccuracies and it was hard to even understand the author's arguments.  I did not finish the book and did not recommend it to anyone else 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book a few times and each time it was the same. Nothing was new in this book. I guess it was a marketing ploy but 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sorry to say I don't like this book, it is extremely boring to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you don't already have a deep understanding of Japanese culture, you'll be confused about a lot of things in this book.  He describes various foods from different cultures with no real detail, and the stories that are recounted from each culture tend to be very one-dimensional.  This is a fine book to have if you're interested in Japanese food, but if you've only just started learning about it, then this book will certainly leave you bored, confused, and with a big mountain of unnecessary knowledge.  And if you like karate, then there's absolutely no way that you'll get anywhere in this world by reading this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If only it had been written by a trained psychologist with a good degree and knowledge of the field and her readers. I have read and agree with all of the negative reviews about this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If anyone is interested in this topic I would recommend any book written on the topic.  This book falls far short on even the most basic knowledge of the subject and seems to be nothing more than a rehash of the arguments of the 1980's.  It certainly does not provide any answers to the many problems and questions that are presented in the original text.   It is just as much a rehashing of the '80's arguments as it is a continuation of the original.  The author even attempts to equate the new edition with the original (not a bad tactic, considering the fact that the author never bothered to take the time to do his own research) 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished reading this book.  I thought the whole thing was ridiculous.  The author used to be a lawyer and this book is full of "legal terms" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written in 1996 for a younger audience, and it is not good for a lot of reasons. For example, she discusses some pretty basic physical activities like riding a bicycle and walking, but fails to explain how to do these activities in a logical manner. Most of her exercises were for younger readers, not for the older ones out there. I was disappointed in this book because it was only one of many that I read as a younger reader, and I never got a real chance to actually use a yoga or pilates routine to help my health. The exercises were so boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was published a long time ago.  In the meantime, the literature has become so saturated, so many authors have written so many popular series, so much information has been put out, so we are inundated with books about the same subject.  If I could change one book, it would be this one.  It is so boring, and so boringly written, that I found myself wanting to look up the author online.  But, alas, that is how I will never see the light of day 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A few pages into the book this book becomes a rehash of the same old topics that I have read many times before. Not for the faint of heart or the easily bored. Just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an extremely repetitive book. It was written for the popular audience and is nothing more than the recitation of the same old story over and over. No substance 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I hated this book.  It was too far fetched for my tastes and had no plot.  I read it as a reference for my English class.   This book is just the worst I have ever read.  If you are expecting a good story from this book,  it is far from it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the most tedious book I have ever read. This author is just an annoying overhyped author who knows he's an author of many, many novels. This book is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is no author's notes or bibliography. Some of the stories seem to have been lifted from the Daily Telegraph's letters. It is the best book I've seen on this topic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Forgive me for the negative review, but I have been a graduate student of this field for decades. The last few years have seen a wave of new books coming out. It is unfortunate that this book is only a compilation of older texts, such as Roeser, Fuchs, etc., and not a modern development of the field. It may be that a new generation of scholars is going to step in and take on these topics, but for now I think that I have enough to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book for my husband and I. The story is great and has a lot of information to the reader.  But the text is very long.  I would prefer the pictures to be left to the end of the book rather than jumping around.  So I would not recommend this book to a beginner. I would recommend this as a gift for a child or teen to read to, but not a good book to read for an adult 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not to be trusted. The way it was described by the publisher, this is an amazing book, but, to me, the stories are all over the place and the author does not seem to know what she is doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high expectations for this book, and I was disappointed.  For a newbie to this subject, it is difficult to read this book because it is full of too many details that are not related to the topic.  The author gives very few examples for the various concepts 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed the book, but not to the extent of the author. The text and the story were very simplistic, but I still enjoyed the adventure of finding the missing girl. I felt it was a waste of time trying to find out who was really the bad guy, and why he kidnapped her. It was far too easy to write a positive review about the book: it's an adventure book, and there are many adventures in it, but there is no explanation about who is in control or why. I was actually very glad to get the book out of the library, because it was so frustrating and boring trying to learn the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read some of the other reviews and it is the same old tired,  boring book.  The book is written in a matter of fact way.  She's basically saying,   If you are interested in history and have not read the classic  books on this subject, get a copy of  The History of the American Revolution, The Making of the United States  or Jefferson: A Life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book when I was a teen and it's horrible.  I never enjoyed reading a book as much as I enjoyed reading this book and so I didn't bother to read another one.  However, I read the review of this book over at The Fandom Post  And I don't find the book fun 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a review about this book  that  stated, "The text is short and to the point.  The writing style is very heavy handed and one-dimensional   It seems to be more of a personal vendetta to one of her children rather than a book about parenting 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a great learning experience for me.  I loved the cover and the pictures, but I was absolutely disgusted with the content of the book.  For example, he claims to have written a "non-fiction" novel called "The Girl From The Bad Book".  There is a story of this girl in the book, but it is so shallow  that I couldn't even see where she would fall in her life.   I don't know if this is because he didn't actually write it or because his life was so mundane and uninteresting 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not bad. It is rather  shallow and simplistic.  The information contained in this book is  based on my experiences from the time I took my first photography class  in college.  It has nothing to do with what I have done since.   The best part of the book is the back matter.  I have always liked back matter and I think the book  has a good number of back matter from some of my good books  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for the information about life in France and other countries of the Western Hemisphere, this book is a dead end. The only information you will get is about the history of French wine making and that is about it. The rest of the information is pretty useless, for example the dates of each of the wine producing nations and the different vineyards in France. I had to find out by looking on the Internet 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so boring and full of factual inaccuracies that it is difficult to understand what is actually in it. It's just an endless list of names and descriptions about many different places and people.  I thought I understood the story of the Jewish people in Europe and in the Middle East in the 20th century and what happened to them over the course of history.  This was my main interest in the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book ever.  The author goes on to talk about why the Bible is so important and how many other religious groups believe in God.  This book is about teaching Christianity to children, but it goes on about topics like UFOs and aliens in a way that is not at all relevant to my son.  It makes me sick to my stomach that my child's education is about something this useless 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to read a well-written book about a good book: a good novel is to write an exciting adventure story about a young boy who wants to go to England on a long journey. If you're looking for a book that makes you feel like your going to England, this is not the book. If the plot is too complicated or the writing is too bad, this book is not for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of mistakes, errors, false interpretations, and it's only for the beginner. There are more correct ways of understanding Buddhism 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not bad. I mean, the content is very poor, and most of the topics are irrelevant to the world today 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well written and informative, but does not follow up with anything. The author claims to be a professional writer but it's clear from this book that he knows nothing about writing. I hope he reads my reviews on his other books and realizes what a bad mistake he's making 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does not have much information, and is just a compilation of lots of different folktales. There is so much that the author is trying to explain (or put a positive spin on) things that do not fit in any of the stories. For example, it was probably better to just do the stories in their original forms and not make this a history book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a boring book. It is not about any sort of science.  It is about the history of this particular myth and how the science of it is false.   It's also quite boring to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is boring and repetitive. It was hard to make out anything new or interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was supposed to be about a man who married a nun. Apparently, she didn't like it and divorced him. Instead, he married his college sweetheart. In other words, he was a homosexual. I can only guess the author had never met a woman. There's no way a person of his outlook can become a father. I couldn't care less about a book that is supposed to help you deal with a relationship problems by reading it, I am already sick and tired of it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author seems to have taken an interest in my book, and has not really discussed the issues in the book that he does in the others. It is not a good book for those who are looking to expand their spiritual horizons. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is supposed to be an introduction to the study of the early Church, but it is riddled with obvious errors.  There is not one piece of evidence, historical or otherwise, which supports the idea that Joseph Smith was a prophet when he married Emma.  This book is filled with anti-Mormon lies.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  It's too biased to be useful. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a bad, self-serving book about the life of a bad person.  In one chapter, he goes on a fishing trip with a group of other people, but only for a few hours.  That's it.  The rest of the book is him lecturing on bad behavior.  He's a hypocrite.  I'm sorry, but there is no joy in the life in this book.   If you are looking for an insight into bad behavior, buy a good book about other bad people.  Don't buy this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author goes off to China and gets himself and his book mixed up in quite a few Chinese customs and traditions. He also has a penchant for excessive and exaggerated language. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was all over the place, never ending, and never explaining anything. A shame it was not published by Knopf.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the second time I've read this book.  This time I was able to enjoy it a lot more than I did the first time.  It is full of the usual things you'll read from this book - boring history, boring facts, etc.  No real story is there.  Just a couple of people, with boring stories, as the point of the book. Very boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like the book. The only thing interesting about it is the ending of the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of negative reviews and negative comments about bad books:  They are written in a very negative manner about a terrible book: it doesn't even start good. It's full of the same stereotypes, stereotypes, that every  woman I've ever known has experienced.  If you read this book, it will make you miserable!  I'm glad I read this  book because it made me sick 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for a good, informative book to get a quick read on a technical topic, this is not the one for you. I would recommend looking elsewhere for that.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a native Spanish speaker, I have had many students write to tell me that this book is so confusing that even they could not follow the material, the only reason I would recommend this book to anyone is because of the nice pictures. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about a young person in the first five years of college. This makes no sense since I started at age 13. What she describes as a typical teen problem has very little to do with real life. For example, when she says "I've been a little off in school this year, but I will soon catch up," her father does not come along to help her. Her father is the person who tells her to get a good book and quit complaining about everything 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too many details are not explained, and I think that's why this book is a great read. The story takes place in a village in China, and is the second installment in a series. I am not a Chinese reader, but it took a while for me to grasp what's going on, and the dialogue seems stilted. If this was a first-rate novel, I could understand it. However, it was nothing more than the same-old Chinese stories, without any new twists. Too bad, because this is a good book and this is the kind of material I need for my Chinese writing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the reviewer that this book is not appropriate for beginners, because there is a lot of theory and not enough practice.  So, I would say, if you are more than a beginner, skip this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had a bad experience reading this book. It was too many of the same points over and over. The author has very little to offer on this topic. The information was so shallow and irrelevant that it was hard to follow the reasoning. It is just another boring book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about as boring as it gets. I am not in the least surprised because this is what  literature is: shallow. There is no depth of  character development nor any depth of story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you like anything  in the fantasy genre, the books from this series  are not going to be of much interest to you.    The books are long, the plot twists  and turns many times, and the characters are  bland.  They are  only marginally more appealing  than most other books written by the same  authors, though that is only because  they are trying so hard to be  similar. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very tedious book.  For a man who is an expert in the area of sexuality I do not know why this was read.  The author tries to tell the reader what he thinks is the correct way to treat a woman.  No, there is no evidence for any of his claims.  He says there are many, many, "experts" on sex and he makes a few very general statements.  What is the evidence for this?  The book doesn't say.   There are no illustrations.  If I had to guess I would guess that the author got some ideas from the popular erotic comic strip, "Babes in Toyland".  The comic strip is a great example of the kind of nonsense this book is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of errors and mistakes, so we had to spend a lot of time correcting it. This book should have never been published. This is not the way to a good book, especially for a young boy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it quite difficult reading through the book. It was very difficult for me to understand the point he was trying to make, and it was hard to get past the first few pages because of the overuse of technical terms and confusing writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of those books that was supposed to be good but turns out to be something of a slog.  You spend most of the book talking about the positive things in life:  you have this great career, wonderful family, great friends, a beautiful home, great vacations.  Then at the end, you read about a tragedy, and you have to go through this whole book all over again, and the whole book is about the tragedy.  Not a bad read for the weekend, but a great slog in the long run. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a terrible disappointment.   I found the author to be rather shallow and narcissistic.  It is hard to trust this writer with a work of fiction.  I had to take the book to read at the bookstore.  After reading, I was unable to see how the author could possibly relate to the text.  The subject matter is so superficial that it is almost pointless to read the book.  This author should have given his work a few less adjectives.  And it is absolutely impossible to see any character in this book other than the one who appears in the cover photo.  Not a bad writer, just not very good 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book because I wanted to read something new and interesting about my experience as a lesbian. But I got bored and did not feel like reading. This is why I didn't give it 5 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has many of the characteristics of a poor work:  It's written in a confusing fashion   For example, one sentence says that a patient is "sitting up straight in a chair" while the next sentences says that she is "lying on the bed."  I would recommend any person who wants to know what to do with a pet or sick pet to avoid this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this was great for some people, but the information is in very much the same way that it is with most of the other books in this series. No matter what your age or what subject you are studying, it's always good to have the basics down when reading a book. Unfortunately, I found myself very frustrated by this book. I would be so much better served if the authors had either changed their approach to certain topics or just dropped it completely 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed reading this book until the last page. As a matter of fact, it took me the longest time to finish reading. It didn't help that the author used the word "maze" a lot. I feel he took a lot of liberties with this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of errors and errors of reasoning. It was a quick read, but the errors were not corrected. I was hoping for some kind of a revision for the second edition. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terrible book.  The first two chapters should have been eliminated.  If you are looking for a good book about early Christianity, read another book by the same author: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For a book on the life of a religious Jew, this was very boring.  It is full of references to a few books and websites, but no sources.  I know it is supposed to be the story of a young person who is growing up in the United States and who comes to Israel, but why is it full of such irrelevant information?  He is told to read more books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think that this book was not suitable for a teacher to write, as it is full of grammar and spelling errors, as well as not presenting any facts on religion or philosophy.  I felt that it did not provide any insight into the lives of ordinary students, and instead showed some very boring images. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Very little research was done in this book. It is full of very inaccurate information. The book gives the impression that it's written by a native Hawaiian, so I guess we're not getting the full truth from a Native Hawaiian 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can see the reviewers have a positive review about this book: it covers a wide range of topics and is not overly technical. Unfortunately, the reader is not likely to be particularly interested in either. It would not take very long to skim it to find out the material is not applicable to the real world 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was extremely boring and uninteresting. I didn't feel a need to go back to it when it came out because it didn't do much for my interest in the subject matter and there was nothing to look forward to. I'll be sad to buy this book again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not understand a word of the book, and found most of the pictures of the women not of any interest.I am a woman over 40 years old, and have always admired women.It was very depressing to read these stories about young women in that situation.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As I mentioned above, it is over 40 pages long, which is not a good thing for a long book like this to be. The text is rather verbose for a young child, and I found it hard to read without getting distracted by the illustrations.  This is not the first time I have had problems with this book, but it is a bad way to teach children to read, and probably not very enjoyable for parents, either.  If I had the money, I would buy another copy just to throw at it and see if it helps.  It is certainly a good idea to give it to a parent, but don't expect to make them read it with their children.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very dated book and it is extremely difficult to follow the story because it doesn't really describe a plot. The characters are shallow, there are only one or two relationships. The author tries to portray a good-looking, attractive man as a bad person. The women are almost all portrayed as dumb and incompetent. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am disappointed in this book. It is a collection of stories that are not even really true. This is an awful book for any young adult. I would recommend something more like A Child's Guide to Life by Barbara Kingsolver. I am afraid of this book, but I would buy it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed the idea of a new edition and had high hopes. The first half of the book is fairly short, but when it gets to the second half of it, the writing becomes so choppy and the language is so confusing that you have no idea what he is talking about.The whole book is written in such a confusing manner that I had to stop reading it and go back to the beginning to figure out what was going on.The author seems to have a very positive view on all things Christian, yet at the same time, he seems to be very negative towards anything outside of Christianity 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book about a year ago, and I am still struggling with some of the ideas presented. However, the examples are really quite useful, as the book is a little too long for some of those concepts to be explained in detail. This is a case of the author trying to cover too much ground, and the results are not what one would expect from a textbook. In other words, the concepts are only presented in a superficial way, with little explanation about how to apply them, and nothing on what they actually mean, except for a lot of references to books that are much better.The book is also very badly written, which makes it difficult to understand most of what is going on. I have spent the past 3-4 weeks reading and rereading it, and it still does not make sense to me. I am not even sure where it gets the ideas of time dilation, or of the fact that all time durations are different, but I guess that doesn't bother the author much 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and enjoyed it. However, the author does not provide a source for the stories, and some of the stories are simply untrue. I do not recommend this book for anyone who has any children under 10, or is looking for a humorous book to read to your children 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're thinking about getting the book for your teenager or young adult, I recommend avoiding it as it's filled with errors, outdated information, and a few plot holes. I'll be more than happy to look through it when it is updated 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A strange, self-serving, poorly researched book that provides the reader with some questionable research. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I am a fan of the Stephen King novels, and I thought this one had a good blend of suspense and humor. This one was far more over the top and stupid than the other King books I have read, so it was a bit disappointing to see him taking on this kind of character. There are plenty of other books by King that I would recommend. This is a fine book, but it is just too short. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's so much of a waste of time. The author is trying too hard to make the book seem a good one for kids and adults. If you are interested in making this a worthwhile book, then skip it. Don't waste your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a collection of stories that have never been published. Most of the stories are about people getting wasted. In one of the short stories, a kid goes off to the grocery store to buy a big bowl of ice cream. The kid is about 13. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought I had picked up all of her work by this point and yet I still was surprised how much of it was not available in any other book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only way this book could have been better is if she had used photos from her research instead of her personal memories. She is not good at capturing a scene that a viewer might see in real life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel bad for these guys. It's so hard to write a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very expensive.  The text was written by someone who is not a great reader.  It was written to fill in the gap between the text and the pictures.  Unfortunately, this book didn't take a good picture of a good book and made it worse.  If I was going to buy a book on photography I would have picked up some other book.  But for the money, I would buy the text of a better book, this one is not it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought it would be interesting to see a woman as a character in a bad novel, but this is not the case 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book I have to say that I don't understand it. I'm a graduate student, not an expert on anything 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the positive reviews, and the negative ones, but I can't support this book's negative reviews 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book for fun, but found nothing worthwhile here. Very boring and uninteresting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written by Dr. Peter A. Rabinow, a well-known physician.  His book was published in 1988.  After more than a decade he has still not developed a coherent view about the medical  field.  In this book, Dr. Rabsow fails to provide any explanation about  the role of pain in disease.  For example he does not mention that pain is the  factor that causes many patients to suffer or how pain can cause disease. >I would recommend to those who are interested in the health fields  not to read Dr.Rabinow's book and instead to read >Dr. Edward O. Wilson's.  Both have published on this subject.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As soon as I saw the title I knew it would not be the book I wanted. I'm disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written like a high school student's diary entry:  If you're expecting great information on a historical topic, look elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I can't recommend a book that claims to be about psychology and psychiatry. I found this book to be just another in a long line of boring books that I found in my early years of study of psychotherapy and psychiatry 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the first book about a year ago, and was really looking forward to this one. The book is only three pages long, but there is not a word of advice.  The author just talks about herself, her friends and all the things that  inspire her.  If you have the idea of learning a new language to learn French, this book is not for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed to see this review was about a good book, rather than a bad one.  It is a little too long, and the pictures aren't as vivid as they could be.  I had to skim through the whole book to see the pictures.   The pictures are very important to many students, so the images would be helpful in their learning.  There are several things about the book that are confusing:  The descriptions of the students and their activities seem confusing.  Students are always introduced to a new activity.  The activities are not always explained clearly enough, and some of the descriptions can be misleading.  This is the kind of book that is best suited to a classroom teacher.  Not to say that you cannot learn how to dance in the classroom, but it is definitely a little more complicated.  Don't buy this book if you are a student and you don't want to dance.  You will get a lot more out of an instructor's book, and it is much better for that purpose 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got the idea for this book from the excellent  movie. This is one of those books that you may get halfway through reading it, and then realize you've got no idea what's going on anymore. It has a plot that's vaguely reminiscent of the plot of the movie, but the movie's plot is far superior 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for a good review about one of the less  successful novels in the series:  This book, as the name implies,  is about a young woman, so you would think that  it would be very entertaining.  I did not like it one bit.  It is supposed to be a "young adult" novel, which  is an understatement, but the writing is  terribly slow and the prose lacks depth.  If you are looking for  something to write about, try  something else 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is poorly written. There are not enough facts to back up the text.The author is obviously not well educated and has little or no experience in the health or human sciences.  The first edition has many errors and the second edition contains no corrections 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very critical of this book. It is full of contradictions. It does not take into consideration any scientific aspects of our earth and it does not show any evidence for how animals live. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book begins with a very positive review of the book and then, once the negative reviews begin, it jumps to very negative criticism.  In addition, the book is full of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors.  I did not realize the book was already in a state of disrepair until I finished it.  After reading the negative review of this book, I decided to give it another chance.  The negative review is not the only reason why I decided not to continue.  A positive review is the reason why you don't read a bad books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The information in this book was completely outdated.  The main information is about ancient history, and there is little to no information about current events.  It seems to be a history book, and nothing more.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be a great disappointment to me.  From the beginning it was clear this book would not be a true study of the Bible as I had expected.  All the quotes were taken from other books, often out of context.  The book would have been better suited to the time of ancient Israel than to modern times.  Even more disappointing was that the author would not let the reader understand his views on the Bible.  He would quote Bible verses out of order   This book is not for me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author states that all the authors he knows are "experts in how to have a good marriage."  I thought this book might be interesting if the author could have actually spoken to one of the authors for a more in depth understanding of what it is like to be married and also for the purpose of developing some skills for better communication. Instead, he gives a superficial, superficial review of the book and then tries to provide advice about how to get married 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a horrible book.  This book has horrible pictures, and very little knowledge of the subject matter 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have tried out several of these books for my students and I find this one the worst of the bunch. It is filled with facts, names of scientists, quotes from various people, and some of the more irrelevant information of the day. The information is not that useful and the writing is very poorly done. I'm sorry but I cannot recommend this book for a real student of science. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has done nothing to enhance his story. He starts the book with a description of the incident which prompted the title of the book. Then he goes on to describe the police response to the incident. The story is told in the style of a crime novel. However, when a crime is described in such a way it really isn't a crime at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is full of clich 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a book: it is a story. And to tell a story the author had to make some bad decisions. For example:  I was very disappointed with the story he tells in this book. It is a very basic story about the death of a beautiful young woman. The author, as I've seen from other reviews, does not understand how or why this story happens, or does he   I really do not have a positive review about this book: my opinion 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains two chapters on how to do a good and bad electronic device: 1. It tells you how to make a cheap keyboard, with some good photos, but no details about how to assemble it. The second chapter on how do you do that with a $50 keyboard is not that good either. I would have written a different book, but it was way too long and it was too expensive for me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author, who claims she is a historian, appears to have written a lot of historical fiction and the author herself is a professional liar.  The book, which tells us that in 1495 a boy named John the Baptist wrote in the New Testament that Jesus Christ will return in 60 years, is a total of 10,000 words long.  And the author of the book does not bother to correct anything when she is wrong, like her claim that the Bible has always been translated in this way, or her claims about the first millennium.  She just goes around saying what she wants, without taking any notice to what the other writers have to say.  I don't recommend this book for anyone, whether you are an advanced student of history, or you just want to read something that is not historical fiction.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is one of those that seems to make it's way around the world through word of mouth, then turns up in the states only to go away again. I feel that I wasted the money that I spent on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with many reviewers that this book was over priced, the writing style was very dry, and the chapters were too short for any one to read.  It was definitely an effort by some people to sell this book in the hopes that it might increase sales.  The book itself was not the greatest 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book itself is very well written and I was very surprised it was given a rave review by a good book review site.  Unfortunately the author is no good at writing fiction, and the writing style of the book is very much like the type of things you would read in an author's blog.  Not the type you would want to read in the library 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this was the first book that described the effects of this horrible drug on the body. I'm still having trouble sleeping and have been having a hard time focusing for most of the day.  The next book should have been titled 'Toxins: How a drug that kills many, leaves others unscathed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book should never have been written, let alone published by any publisher. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has no grasp of historical facts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was not very helpful in terms of teaching the fundamentals of mathematics. The material was presented in a very superficial way, and the text was rather difficult to follow. The only benefit of this book was to make the students do a little bit of homework on their own. The students should be more concerned with the concept of infinity and the problems of proof in mathematics. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as a freshman in college.  It was a good book for an introduction to science.  But the plot was so boring that I couldn't finish it.  I hope someone else reads this  and writes a good review about it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is just as boring as the other reviewers say.  The stories are also very short, which does make them boring.  I do like the idea of a historical novel, but this book is the exact opposite of what I was looking for 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The language is  poor and the story is repetitive.  I do not recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of inaccuracies and bad advice. It was recommended by the publisher for use with children. It is not used with adults and it does not even have an index. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been reading this book, "Sesame Street: The Art of Making Children Happy, for many years now.  As the title states, I really wasn't excited by the end of the book.  I don't believe this book can really teach anyone anything, as much as I want to believe it can make a few people laugh.  But this book should not be considered a children's book. What is the point?  Why would anyone bother spending that much time reading a book which has such a bad ending 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very biased and uninspired, I have never read a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have not been in the field in many years, but I found the subject matter of this book somewhat interesting. However, the writing is not very engaging and the subject is very one-sided. As far as the writing, this book is unreadable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of many errors and misleading information. However, some of the sections about sex and marriage and other such subjects are very interesting. The material on sex and relationships, however, is more difficult to understand. The information on birth control is very poorly presented. It is difficult to follow the book. The author's writing style is very distracting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is full of boring facts, and it is not clear on how to actually go about a good writing exercise. It was the first book I read and loved the idea of making a short story out of the information I received. This book is useless and the story could have been written in any number of ways, and the only thing that the author says about the exercise is "be a writer" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is horrible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you really want to know a story of an alien spaceship crash, or what the hell it is about, skip this book.  Don't bother with it if you like to watch the  movies, and you're a sci-fi fan 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not a bad read, but I am a great disappointment in all the other reviews, who are not reading the book, but the review. It's a shame that one of the authors in the book was not prepared for such a lengthy review, and it could have been less confusing if the authors had discussed it with the readers, instead of leaving it to an author, who may be better qualified to write such a review. But that's all. The book lacks the necessary information to write a good review, such as the background history and the context. This book should have been sold with the title of'The Great Fiasco of the Great War 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is nothing but a horrible piece of garbage. It is full of unproven statements, incorrect statements, and poor research. All the statements are wrong and many are ridiculous. The book is full with many of the usual suspects. However, I think it is one of the most illogical and ill-informed books I have ever seen. I am completely disgusted by this book, and all of the others written by it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has all the information about the Holy Land in it. But not much about the Palestinian territories. And the Palestinians are not represented by Arab women, but by Arab men, who are the only ones who are treated fairly in the book. This is also not very well done by the authors; the information presented in it is just not very interesting. I also did not like how the text is written; it just seems to me that they are trying to write the text by their own interpretation of the holy places in the Holy Sites. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was difficult to read these stories about a boy who was always getting into trouble. However, the stories were beautiful. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the section on modern Chinese literature I would have liked to have been given the names of more of these writers. Unfortunately this is a book that only offers the opinions of some Chinese people on Western literature. Therefore the opinions are not well reasoned. The book seems to be more about its author's fascination with Western literature rather than any real understanding of the subject. This is a very shallow, shallow and shallow book that is only about the author's opinions. It would have been much more interesting to have read a deeper book like Tsoi-chi, or anything that has come out from China during the last 20 years. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the third or fourth book I have bought from The Penguin book series:  The first book was a biography of an author I didn't care for.  This one is written by an author who is very bad at his own job:  It's a history of the 19th century, with an eye on the current century 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The worst thing  about this book is the horrible cover 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does a horrible job of providing information. The subject is quite complicated, and even more so if you are a parent who has to deal with kids who are  learning a lot of different languages, like  my kids. So I would recommend buying a more useful book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought I was going to like this book, and after I finished it I couldn't believe it. It was so dull, and I have a bad memory and didn't enjoy reading about a new person talking about a story I haven't even read yet. I also liked the first one a lot better, which was written by a man who knows much more about the subject than the book he writes about. I am still waiting for the second book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and  it was all over the place. I feel  that many of the details were wrong. The  writer did a bad job with this book. It should not be read  because  many details that were right in the book were wrong here. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains very little useful information for a beginner. It tries to make this a book for more advanced beginners to learn Japanese. However it only has one paragraph about the hiragana alphabet and doesn't explain the meaning of any hiraga. I found it hard to follow most of the hira, even with a small amount of help from the chapter on hiragi. The book itself is also very hard to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never read a negative book review before, but this one was not much better. The title,  "The American Slave: A Very Short Introduction", was not accurate.  It was more of a history book that included the word slavery.  The author did a great job with the book, but the title was not misleading, it was misleading.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is a certain amount of historical accuracy that is lost in this book.  For example, there is a picture of a German soldier in WWI.  He never actually existed.  Other than that, I didn't find much value in the book. I would recommend it for historical reference purposes only.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A story that was originally printed in the December 1982 issue of Thrilling Wonder. This book was very popular when it was first published. It was also the source for the film of the same name, which is about a man in the 1950s who gets caught in a sex scandal and takes it to the grave.  The book's premise was that if a man could be convinced of anything, it was that it was a sex crime. Therefore the sex was the villain. I wouldn't recommend this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say I am disappointed and appalled by this book. I have read many of George Orwell's novels, but this one is by far the worst of them all.  The plot involves a Russian woman and a American man, who have their first love affair in the midst of WW II.  But it is really only about one of the lovers.  There is no explanation of why the couple are in love. The story progresses in a series of flashbacks, and at the end there is a revelation that leads to a new love story for one of them.  And they just keep repeating this sequence over and over.  This makes it even more uninteresting to me, and makes the plot less believable.  It is almost as if George Orwell did not know what the word "love" meant.  He wrote it so that he could use it for his political purposes.  Or to justify his own hypocrisy.  Even the last third of the book is about the lovers trying to make out as if they were still in love with each other.  I just do not get it.  You cannot make a bad work out of a good novel 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are only two chapters about the subject of this book. One is about the author's own life and is full of self pity, he's a broken man and has the world and his family falling on his shoulders, and this book is about him getting over his past. It is full  of  clich√©, clich√© that doesn't mean it isn't good.  The other chapter is about his friend.  There's an uncomfortable feeling  when the author wants to make a point and goes over the top  but, if you don't want to be swept away  with his  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with all the bad reviews about this book.  I bought it expecting it to give me an insight in a foreign country and it did.  It was a book that I read over several times and kept reading it over and over.  But there was nothing I learned, nothing I wrote about and nothing I wanted to know more about.  As I have stated elsewhere, the author is just looking for any excuse to say something negative about any other author.  If she can write about another writer, she can do this book too.  She knows how to write about a good book, but this one was not good.  There was nothing new to learn and she kept on going on and on about the book. It was not a good read for me, but there are a couple of good chapters that I could see myself liking.  Unfortunately, the rest of the book is bad and I think that many other people would agree.  The author is so obsessed with her subject and the details of her life that she does not seem to understand the meaning of what she is writing about 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A poor excuse for a book for those who have never heard of or visited New Zealand. The text has been reprinted many times and the illustrations are limited to the typical red, blue, green, and pink. The illustrations aren't so much bad, more like the stereotypical, boring stuff 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about how she is the bad influence on his daughter. He can be very sweet, caring, good looking, and all that, but it seems like his wife is always right there to ruin things. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with several of the other reviewers:  Don't waste your money on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea was interesting, but the writing and writing style were poor. I found it hard to understand why he was so negative about the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book a bad review because I don't know what kind of person has time to read this book. The author, however, seems to be very good at selling books, so maybe I am spoiled. Either way, this book is not to be trusted for anything more than the first few chapters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It should have been called, "How to be a bad reader: A guide to bad reading" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was published when I was a teenager. I still haven't finished it. I feel like I am going through it with my dad at his age. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If the title of this book is not very clear, just read the first book, which has the same title.  The book is only about the life of the famous composer and his sister (his only child) Maria, who died at birth. This is all he knows about his life.  This is a very poor book.  It is based mostly on hearsay, from friends and relatives and from the letters of his close friends.  His life is presented as a simple tale of a nice man, happy at the age of 21, who is surrounded by lovely ladies and has beautiful cars.  I would not recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is about the "Rambo" movie. So much of this book is about a movie, and I don't have to tell anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book should never have been published and is now making the rounds in self-help and other books as though it is some kind of a classic. I would never buy a book like this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not a good introduction to the world of Japanese culture.  If you are interested in Japanese culture, please do not buy this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you like  True Love  by Jane Harrison  than this one is probably a good one for you. But I'm not the most well-read person on this planet, and  I'm guessing this one was written by someone who isn't very well read  as well. So, you're going to have to do some searching to find the good parts of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The authors know nothing about Buddhism.  Their claims that Buddhism has something to do with a "honest life" are insulting and not true.  If the author wanted to make a better book, he should do more research and not rely on the words of the ancient sages 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is so long that you have no idea what you are going to get in it. It is written in the   same style as a cookbook.   There is no sense of progression.  The first book covers all the recipes from the previous two books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the only book I have ever read on this topic.  If you don't already know the basic information, please read this book.  Unfortunately, the author, a good professor, has no problem taking the basic info and making it seem like it's much more complex than it actually is.  I understand that it's a book aimed at children, but that shouldn't be a problem when it's about something important to your life as a Christian, not something as minor as how many cookies you buy for your kids.  The end result is that it ends up looking like the author's interpretation of what he thinks the Bible says.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts off strong but quickly drags. I don't even remember reading the first five pages 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The most boring thing in this book is the way he describes it:  The characters in the book are described as having the same facial features.  They are supposed to be both blonde and brunette, but only the brunette girl is blonde and only the blonde girl is wearing a bra.  The book ends on page 18 with a picture of a naked girl with her legs spread wide apart.  What's a good book about, if you can't get your hands on a copy of the original series or some other source?  The illustrations in this edition are horrible, and it is full of spelling mistakes.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of many myths and half-truths.  I read it on a Kindle edition and the information in this book is very limited and useless.  The only good part is the description of the first year of the war.  It is just a compilation of myths, half-lies and general lies. I would avoid it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book which was originally published in 1985 by a non-fiction book publisher called New American Library. The publisher stopped publishing this book and in 1994 the copyright expired. In 1998, John Lewis of the Center for Christian Information at the University of Nebraska published a new edition of the book under his own name. He used the same text as the original publisher and included the same errors as the publisher did. This new edition is still being published today, and yet no changes have been made in this new edition 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As I was reading this book I got angry with the author. His style of writing is so boring that it makes the book hard to read.The first chapters are boring, the rest is just the author telling you what to do and not caring about what you actually do 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a travesty, and should not be considered a text for any student 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of time. I just had to take out the names of some of the authors as the main character, Mary, is so over exaggerated. If she's even half as smart as she's portrayed she'd know that the majority of the characters in this book are just   imitations, not real persons. It was like reading a good book and then getting the book. The author is supposed to be an adult. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a very dry and boring story about a girl who wants to be a model. It is filled with errors and stereotypes. I felt very cheated after reading it and thought  I was in for a bad read. This is why I don't read any self help books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author has done a great disservice to any serious student of history or anthropology. For someone who wants to know about this and other issues of race relations in American history, you would be better served by a shorter, more well-researched work that covers the same general territory with greater depth. This book, by contrast, is a misnomer. It tries to cover too many aspects of American history in a very short work. But it does so in such a manner that it makes a negative impression on the reader. It's a great idea to have a short work of this type, but it's one that has to be justified in the literature, not in the  text itself. If you want to learn more about race relations today, you will be better off by something more rigorous 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is so wrong and so ignorant about the American economy. The best example of this would be that we have had a recession in this country, and yet our financial system is still the best in the world. We are not living in a third world country. It is so sad that this book would have such a negative view of the US economy. I can not believe that it took him this long to figure that out 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read all of the books in this series and have the highest recommendation I could give. However, this one is beyond the call of duty. It's too long, repetitive, and boring. The characters are too static, and the book is filled with nothing but descriptions of the author's own accomplishments. If you like books where nothing happens and the characters are boring, and you can't stand the first part of this book, stop reading it and seek something more enjoyable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is no explanation of any of the key ideas of Marxism. This is in part because there is not enough material in the book to support all of its claims. Most of what is given is merely a summary of Marx's philosophy, and nothing has been explained about how Marx really understood these concepts. The concepts of dialectics, value, production, and so on are not discussed here, and there is no effort to analyze what is wrong with all of these theories. This book is simply a review of Marx, and attempts to present Marx's ideas in a way that is easy to understand and easy to criticize, but without providing any concrete analysis of the ideas. There is almost nothing in the text about Marx's own life. This was a mistake on the part of the book author. Marx lived a complicated life and it is only by his work that we know much about it. Marx is too complex to be presented in a simple manner. This does not excuse the book, which in some cases seems to have ignored even the very simple material that Marx presents in his writings. This problem is repeated in his criticism of other authors. This would have been better expressed as a lecture. I would recommend to any student to avoid this book. If anyone is interested in understanding Marx's theories, it is better to read the works of other Marxists. This will take more time and effort, but it will provide you with far more material. This work is not for anyone who is a student and has a basic knowledge of Marxism 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too bad, because this book was a real treat and I really enjoyed reading it. It was very hard for me to get through this book though. Not only did I find most of the information to be either irrelevant or wrong, but the characters were all over the place. I really found it hard to keep up with the story as it went on. I have since finished the second book which should make the whole thing much easier to follow. I will still recommend this book to people who don't know much about the Middle Ages or the Middle East. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is very disappointing. It is hard to see why any author would put their name on a book like this. It fails to provide any new information or understanding on many of the issues and the author is rather defensive in the negative review section. It appears that he is trying to deflect criticism from his other book, which is a bit better and more informative. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book for a middle-grade reader:  This book is only for middle grade readers and does little to introduce any new ideas.  It is written in third person, so if you have no interest in children, this is not for you.  This review is not written in the negative sense, but to point out the errors of this book: *It is obvious that this book was written by an adult with little knowledge of either grammar or writing style.  The book is written to be read on a computer, as this is what this book is intended for. *The first book in this series, "Lights Out", is very much a story about the development of a good robot, and the development to the point where it becomes a sentient being, but in this book, it is all about the robots.  These robots are given a lot of emphasis, but not in any way are any character development or any sort of plot development.  They are just there to make the story "more interesting". *The author uses the term "battery" twice, once in the title and once in each of the three different chapters.  Not only does this show that he does not have much knowledge of the meaning of the term, but that he is clearly only writing this as a book to sell 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has very little to do with real life and is not interesting at all. All the characters are really  the same. The plot is  too contrived and all the characters seem to know each other.   The author makes a big deal about the word "transformation", but   it really doesn't happen that way. You see, all these  characters are the same, they are all living in the same house  and the characters never really do anything.  The "transforms" happen when the characters  get into trouble and they just start acting like  a bunch of crazy people instead of behaving like decent  human beings 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A horrible book about a horrible family. I found it quite embarrassing and distressing. This was the first book written about my mother and father. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was given to me as a Christmas gift in 1998. I started the book right away and never got around to finishing it. Since then I've seen other reviews about the book and it was quite disappointing. It is not necessary to study English to read this book. For instance, I did a good English exam just as the book was ending. However, there is a lot of language and grammar in the book. Some of the phrases are very confusing and it doesn't help to have to do with any study you do.The book does have some useful pictures and the pictures were quite poor. It doesn't take away the bad book I read, but it certainly does a good job of making you think that a book like this is useful. Unfortunately, this book is not the best book I have ever read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would recommend this book as a general study of Chinese culture, but not for any  serious students. The book is full of historical inaccuracies and the story is extremely boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book twice and loved it the first time. Then I read the second edition and realized the same thing.  Don't waste your time reading this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts out very interesting.  The chapters are too short.  They don't develop the characters that much.  It's a short book.  If you are looking for a great book  to teach you something, this is not it.  I found it very boring and it was all the way to the end.  There was no conclusion to it. I did not like it and  I would not recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, here are my impressions of this book: It is not particularly well-written, nor is it particularly well edited. The subject matter is all over the place. The content is dated. It is the sort of book that has something to say about every topic under the sun, but if you need to get a grip on a specific subject, you won't find that in this book. You'll find that it's a great idea to go to any one of these other great resources: http://thebiggerthebadderthebook.com/ http://www.snowflakes.com
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There's so much wrong with this book that I'm astonished by how many people have been attracted to this book as its subject. First of all it is written in a way that makes it seem as if it's discussing something important to people.  Then they go on to say a lot of stupid things, such as:  "The best way to learn is by asking questions.   Do we really need to study all of the books in this book   The book is full of errors.  It's impossible to follow a step-by-step process for every type of book that exists  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has been described as "garbage" by many 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't finish it and it left me feeling more negative than positive.  I got the sense that it was written by a negative person who felt that people who do not support their politics were somehow to blame.  For that I was not surprised.  It seemed to me that the author was trying to convince people to oppose the Obama campaign.  This is not a good book and if you are looking for an unbiased history of the Vietnam war read a better book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The whole book was a long review of a good book.  But the book never was that good, and the reviewers did not mention any of it's flaws.  The book was never a great read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is not well written. The grammar is a bit wrong, but the ideas are not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a graduate student in journalism and was looking for books to read while on the road and I found this one and was appalled by the poor quality. It's basically just two interviews about three or four other writers (I don't remember the names of the others) and there is no discussion of any writing related to the real world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As usual, the book is full of clich√©s, oversimplifications, and inaccurate, condescending analysis about the world of business, both in the United States and the world.  The book does little more than describe what the authors think to be true about a topic, which is typically the wrong thing.  Most of the time, these books are based on the idea that all business is about money and power.  It is not.   I've had students write to me and complain about this book and the way it was written.  I can't give it a positive review for how it presents a very complicated subject.  There is much in this book that is wrong.  This book is not one that I would recommend 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book they gave away at the college library for free, not the book that I purchased 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so much garbage.  This author tries too hard to be creative when it should have been obvious that he had no idea what he was writing.  I read the entire book in one sitting, and then I immediately put it away and didn't read it again for two weeks!  I couldn't believe how the author was able to make people sick and then pretend they were healthy.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a textbook for all chemistry majors. The title says so itself. It is not clear what the author's motivation was. All of his examples seem to be based on experiments. This book should not be recommended for anyone other than a chemist. The only thing that makes this book any good is the pictures. But even those do not fit well in this textbook. The authors of this book have a problem with any sort of scientific content. And I would imagine that only a chemistry teacher or someone else that has taken high school chemistry would want to read a book like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm not too optimistic about this book.  It's been years since I read this book, and it's still not getting easier.  The subject matter is just horrible, and there are several mistakes that can't even be corrected.  I'm not sure how I'm supposed to approach this book if I intend to learn anything, or if I even care to.  Instead of wasting time and effort on the subject, I suggest you pick up one of the many excellent books by David E. Cray 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is a former teacher with an odd affinity for the works of Mark Twain.  It's not surprising that his book would fail to make any serious contribution to the discussion of nineteenth-century America. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to give this book a negative rating because it seems to be very much a marketing device to sell books.  There's a lot of writing in this book that doesn't make any sense.  It's a book about making money on the Internet with a lot  of false information.   A lot of this book can't even be trusted 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got the book in 2009 and have wasted a lot of money on books over the past few years. The first time I read this book I was so upset about the inaccuracies that I sent it back. I just wish this writer had taken a break from the usual fare and taken a trip to the library to find some of the proper facts. This book is only bad because this writer is so bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has very little in it for the average reader. There are only a couple of chapters on Buddhism, and even those are not very complete. Most of the chapters on Japanese culture, history, and the Japanese language are useless. This book will only appeal to the uninitiated. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For most people this book will be read in one sitting. For those of us who have to do it in smaller doses this book makes it difficult to get a good idea of what is going on. For people who are looking for a quick and easy read this is not the book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I took a bad review with a bad rating:  The book was filled with inaccuracies, errors, and wrong dates. I feel sorry for the author, for she has to use this book for her English writing, but I don't believe anyone else will buy the book, especially if they are new to grammar 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A really bad book, with lots of repetition and poor writing style. It would probably benefit from some editing, to be honest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing is poor. There are too many spelling mistakes for my taste. This book should be marked as a bad read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have tried out a lot of this material and I have only found it that difficult to finish 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a very newbie to this subject. I picked it up to give some ideas to my husband 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so poorly written that it seems that the author is the only person who knows anything about American history or anything else for that matter.  The book tells the story of the First World War through the eyes of a young girl named Susan, who was living in England at the time of the war.  Apparently, Susan's main reason for taking part in the war was to escape her abusive mother, but this wasn't enough to convince her to enlist.  She enlisted anyway, but only as a soldier to protect her brother from being drafted by the British Army.  It was a desperate act on Susan's part and she was killed.  Very disappointing!  The author should have spent a bit more time researching the topic before writing this book, and she should have stuck to one topic only.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of stories and images that have no relevance or veracity. The stories are about a man who kills people, and his wife, and then gets arrested. The book then follows this man and his family over a period of years. This family never goes anywhere.The book is a complete waste of my money and time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this book is very bad for children and it doesn't help the adults who are also the target audience.  I don't recommend it for anybody.  It's a bunch of words and pictures that don't do much to get the story out to kids and it just doesn't work for adults either 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea of the novel is that the characters in the story have been written to reflect their own lives, but, when I read it, I could not see this at all, because the characters were so dull. It was not until the last few pages that I could see how it could possibly work.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I do not understand why a good book is so rare. I have been trying for about a month to get through to my 5-year-old daughter about the importance of keeping your emotions in check. This book is a perfect example of why this is a bad idea 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the last review about this book.  The author has many different titles of books.  I would not recommend this book to my students for obvious reasons.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read the first half of this book and thought  the characters were the worst. I thought there were three in this book but there were two and they were sisters.  I know, I'm no good reader but I just can't trust a book with that many characters in it. It takes away from the fun and the romance. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The problem is, this book is full of anecdotes and personal details that the reader could easily skip over. And that's just the problem 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a collection of quotes about different religions and cultures. It has been recommended to me by several friends, but, I just don't buy it for one reason:  The quotes are not sourced, they are just quotes that someone has passed around the Internet. The quotes were also written in English 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, this book was released in 2003.  It has since been out of print, but I do not have the means to obtain a print version (yet).   In this book, there are no recipes.  All the recipes are listed as ingredients (in the text), which makes it much more difficult for a cook to remember the correct proportions of the various ingredients, so I was never able to use the recipes for any of my projects, unless I was making the entire meal. I would never recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed. I didn't like it very much, but it did do some good for my son who had trouble keeping up in school. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, it takes me about a month to read this book. It's not that it's a bad novel, it's just that, even though it is written in third-person narration, it feels like it's going on in the background, and there's very little payoff for the reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has made many mistakes. Not only is the story line convoluted but there are many other errors 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of many errors. The main one is that the word "fascination" is a generic term, and not even a good one. As it happens it is used very often in the book, and is used too frequently. It would have been better to include a definition of a fascinate in the footnotes, but they weren't done that way. The author did a bad job and I won't be buying any of her books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has a lot of bad ideas and bad advice.  The book is very vague and not easy to follow.  It is too bad as there are plenty of great resources that teach the art of writing and communication that are better and cheaper.  So I think it is the reader's responsibility to check out the resources on the Internet 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was published in the 70's. It was never edited. The whole thing was typed by the author and the publisher was not interested. I would advise that this book be left to someone else. This was the 80's and the world has changed a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is nothing but a collection of bad anecdotes about women.  The stories are about the best of the worst, from the time she goes shopping for a dress, to the time a boy, her sister, and another girl start dating, and all the way through to the day she decides to have a baby and goes to a Catholic wedding.  It is not funny and it is not insightful.  I found it extremely annoying that I had to listen to every story, and it made me feel terrible for all of the women in it.  This is an extremely boring book, and I would not recommend it to anyone, even to those who aren't a bad reader 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For those who know me and have read some of my other reviews, you can understand why I have such a negative opinion about this book.  The information contained in this book was so very general, and so lacking in information.  I just wanted a brief summary of what all the books on the topic are saying, without having to spend my life researching, trying to find the truth.  Unfortunately, I found out that this was the only book on the subject.  Very disappointing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author goes over the same old story again and again. As an illustration of her point, she describes a young girl who tries to convince a man that she is a virgin. It is a very juvenile style of writing and not the most interesting of the three stories. The author uses this story in her lectures but fails to actually learn anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author writes in his "journalism" style. It has no plot, only a series of interviews with people who are not interviewed again. I can't believe that it was given for the purpose of self-help. The only thing that is discussed in detail is the  possibility of suicide. The author claims he is the first person to have ever spoken with people about suicide, but I have seen other suicide exercises that I would find more helpful than this book and I am quite convinced that the author is deluding himself  It is quite boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would rate it lower than 2 stars if I could. It's so out of date that it almost doesn't seem to exist anymore. It was written in the 70s, the style was much better than it is today. If you want something about medieval life to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not the biggest fan of the Church, and I didn't get the whole story. I guess I would recommend the book to anyone who is interested in Mormon history, but I wouldn't go anywhere near it if you don't have a firm knowledge of Mormon history or have any background in the history of religion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are a teacher, or even a parent of a child, and have a desire to be a better teacher, read this book. It doesn't help you any, but it makes you feel bad about yourself. It's a bad story that uses poor examples. And you may need to go back to your local library to get more examples 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is what I called a book about a drug dealer.  This story line is unbelievable.  I was hoping for more detail about the guy's childhood, but he never seemed to talk about them in the book.  And he did his best to make us believe he was a bad guy.  What a terrible, horrible book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book for a graduate class. I have not read any other book by the author. He uses a very strange style which is not attractive to the reader. His grammar is very bad. He is trying to convey to the students how easy it is to become an atheist. But he fails in this. He does not address the issues facing people today with regards to religion and morals. He makes the students believe that it is acceptable to cheat, lie, steal, etc. and that is very disturbing to any young person. This book is very confusing and this was the reason I had to take two years off from college to work. I feel bad for these students. He needs to learn some basic skills to get his work in this book over with. If you are a professor, and you want students to study, not learn, please save your money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was the main reason I dropped out of college after just a few months.  The book is extremely repetitive.  It talks about different books on the same topic with no real change in the story.  If the story is too repetitive, it would probably make for a boring read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book after it was published and it was not even close to a good read. It was written for a younger audience, and it lacked in any kind of depth of description of the characters or the story, in my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only problem I have with this book is that you never get a clear picture of what life is really like in prison. All the examples are very superficial, with the exception of one guy whose whole family is imprisoned. You really need to go through with this person for a fuller picture to form. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so tired of hearing about how a book is the only way to "realize your passion."  A book is no substitute for genuine, long-term friendship, true love, and true fulfillment.  For me, the greatest way to do all these things is to be a true friend who understands  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was the first book I read in the series, and it is probably the first that I've read that I didn't like as much as the rest.  This was also the first time I had ever encountered the phrase "The world is a dark and unpleasant place", and it seems to have stuck.  The book does a good job describing the dangers of drug use in high school, but that's not enough to make up for the fact that it is too simplistic.  Too many characters, too much exposition, too few stories, etc.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea was good but the writing was atrocious. I would highly recommend anyone to stop using this book, you will regret it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as a high school student.   As a teen and adult, I find myself with a great deal of difficulty in understanding its message.  While the main purpose of the book is to explain the significance of Jesus Christ, this is only a small part of it.  This book is about the history of the Jewish religion.  The author tries to make his point about how Jewish people felt about the idea of God in his life.  His main point is to show why it was acceptable for people to be Jewish.  I have never found this explanation satisfactory.  He uses many instances of persecution to prove his point.  To me, these instances of oppression are not the reason a Jew has to choose to be a Jew.  No, there is no "God in your life" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The information presented is basic and seems to be mostly irrelevant to the students. The author does not clearly explain why some studies prove a positive result (e.g., alcohol consumption) and others (e-coli infection) prove negative.  The most interesting sections are those on drug use, abuse and dependence 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It takes many hours to read and learn the information provided, but only a few chapters. Don't waste your time with it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't really know where to start with this book, because it is so full of errors that I could not even read a few pages without getting lost in the book. It is full of unnecessary and contradictory information on various subjects that is obviously not useful to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a reader of self-help literature, I have to say I was expecting a more positive review, not that I'm a particularly positive person.  The book was a bit too upbeat, with too many examples of people who did the right thing, who got caught, who had to change their lives for the better.  It was one thing to be a positive person, but the whole book was just too positive.  This book is certainly not for the self-esteem oriented.  I don't know why I read this book; it seems to have nothing to do with self-acceptance 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too much of the book is about the problems and hardships of raising children.  I found the author to be very negative and rude 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about a good book: an early one.  It starts out with a beautiful picture of a tree and some pictures of children and a bird that was taken in the picture.  Then, the picture goes blank.  The story doesn't follow up with a story that could make you feel sad.  No one would buy this book because it doesn't explain anything.  Just pictures 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as part of my senior year of high school and I'm still having trouble understanding it.I'm not a very big fantasy fan, but I had a hard time finding the plot interesting.I thought I understood it, but now I'm just confused. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've had this book in my hand for awhile and it's just not right for the material.  I read somewhere that it was the first book on polyamory ever written and I just agree.  But the material is not good.  The book is full of  confusing definitions of terms like "monogamy" and  "open relationship".  It also has some of the least useful diagrams  in the bibliography.   It is not a great book, but is much better  compared to my other poly books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is very strange book.   Its the only one I have read. It was only written by her. The other characters are written by someone else and it makes no sense to read her books because there is no character development. She just goes around telling the story of a boy and the woman that he falls in love with. I guess that it makes a great story but it is not believable. If you are interested in fairy tales, like I am, then read a book by Hans Christian Andersen. Or anything by Marceli. This one is so strange that it made me laugh. What a weird book. I never enjoyed it. Its weird 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a good book if you are a fan of James Bond and James Bond villains, but I do not recommend this book to anyone.  A couple of pages are devoted to the Bond villain's thoughts about a variety of female characters.  If you are interested in Bond villains and the idea of love, then I would recommend this.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is over 15 years old and written by a man, but is still based on a lot of the same basic concepts and stories that the 1980s were famous for.  It was written for those who like a good adventure with sword and sorcery, but not necessarily for anyone with an interest in the same.  If you do read a fantasy book, you've probably been exposed to all the ideas and concepts by now, and you probably have a better idea of what this book is about.  This is not a good book for beginners or the beginner who likes to learn by doing.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about the Japanese invasion of China. This is a rather ridiculous book, and the author's claims are ridiculous. What he does do is try to argue that Chinese people were not really oppressed in the 1930s. This was probably the only book that I've seen that attempts to do this. I'm sorry to say that this is a book that you would be better off not reading, as it is full of contradictions. The book has a lot of quotes from Japanese, but only uses them for rhetorical purposes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is so far away from any reasonable thought, or even any reasonable life. The author is the same one who has published so many "How to Be a Good Parent" books, and yet, none of these books are any good. I would never recommend this book, or anyone else's. You'll just end up wasting your money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The last time I read a book of the type contained in this book was by John K. Price, and I didn't enjoy it. This book was much worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not like the title. It is like saying you are reading a children's book and you are being entertained with the little characters but the story is totally unrealistic. It tells about a man who likes to do nothing but drive around in his car and look at pretty women. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say this book was extremely poorly written 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a compilation of books and essays about American politics. But no matter how many times I read, it never helps me get closer to understanding America. It is a pity, but I guess that's the price for reading for pleasure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   First of all, this is a terrible book. I don't recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had never seen the show until I read this book. It was an amazing experience for me, because it was like watching someone else's interpretation of the show. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   First off  I am a teacher. I do not know how I missed the first half of the book because I am so excited about this book that I do almost anything for a book.  However, after the third or so chapter  I was done.  This book does not give enough info to make it interesting for me. It does not teach the basics well enough.  The writing style is boring, the writing is not grammatically correct and  the spelling is incorrect 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a bad  book.  The examples are so out of date that they are difficult to remember.  I am currently reading the second edition and I think this book was written a long time ago.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was not interesting for me.  The author talks about how much he likes to write books and the more they get translated, the more money the author makes.  But not once did he get any real information about the Japanese culture.  Instead he goes on about how he is going to tell this Japanese author his personal story.  He goes on for pages and pages about all the things he does not know and he seems to have an interest in this Japanese guy,  but at the end of the book he does his best to convince the Japanese reader that he is telling them the true story 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very poorly written book. I have seen better books, but this one is so bad that I was hoping for a good book to read instead.  I could see some potential for a book about real estate, but in this book it is all about one thing: the author's personal life.  The whole book is about the author and his feelings about his life. For some reason, there is never any description of real estate. He is a real estate agent.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story takes place at a wedding. The main character has very little to do with it. In fact, she spends most of the story reading from a book about her dog, or a book of poetry about her cat, or some other nonsense. Her characters do not get much development at all, and the plot is so shallow that it would be hard to even start the book without laughing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too many times in these pages we find the same old "life style" stereotypes.  I would not recommend this book to anyone, especially men.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to be a writer, read fiction.  The book is a mish-mash of what was previously in other sources, including The Lord of the Rings 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sorry, but  I really don't see the point in this book. I think this is the most boring and repetitive book I've seen 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book focuses on how men and women are similar and dissimilar in their personality, personality traits, personal habits. It is a complete waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're looking for some solid information about the early church history, then this is a good book for the time period.  But, it's not very interesting in the long run.  If this was a series of historical books it would be different. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the second edition of a book that I have read through several times, but have never had any luck with it.  It is full of the same sort of information in every installment, but in such a haphazard and arbitrary way, that it is almost impossible to get through it, and the only way I know of to avoid it is to simply stick to the parts that are new to you.  I found this book so boring to read through that I tossed it after the first few chapters, and have not gone back since.   I'm sure if you have the patience to wade through it a few times and try to figure out what it is trying to teach you, then you will enjoy it, but it will likely take you a long time to finish the whole thing.  The content is very much like that of the previous editions, and if you are going to waste your money on this book, make sure that you purchase the other editions as well 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise of the book: a female character is sent back in time to her own parents.  The plot: she's stuck in her parents basement while her friend returns in the form of her grandmother.  I thought it was boring.  But it's more about her and her relationship with her parents. So, not for me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and loved it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not sure if I'll be able to review this book any better than I already have. It does not help that this is the first book in the series and it's the worst of the books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was published in 1997. By then, many of the information was outdated. But this is a new version of the book that was not available at the time of publication 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I got the book expecting to learn a lot about history from the great Joseph Heller.  Instead I learned that he is not really into history but he wants to be a celebrity, and he tries to make it look like he is.  I really wish I hadn't read the book and I will do better 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with other reviewers that this is one of those books written by a fan with a limited vocabulary who has trouble finding the correct word for  many things. She has trouble with this, I think, because  she doesn't understand the meaning of words and has trouble pronouncing them.   This is not a bad novel, just one that requires  some very serious listening if you are to get anything out of  it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only reason I gave this book a negative rating is because the text is so badly written and the author's style so bizarre.  The examples that come from this book are terrible.  Even the photos in this book do not help and the illustrations in other books are much better.  This book makes no sense at all and should be used as a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, it does seem that there are more important matters to be solved than the study of  The Bible. But since this is a religious  book, I can't say I'm surprised that it's written  so inaccurately. I find the theology to be rather  offputting, but the style is really cheesy.   It seems that this author thinks that if it isn't "really"  serious, it's worth reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first book I ever read in this genre was  The Catcher in the Rye 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    As the title states, this book was intended for a college text book. I'm still trying to figure out where the author went wrong 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of misinformation, self-righteousness, and false hope.  It is not a good book to learn or teach.  I would recommend looking at a good textbook instead 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a hagiography of the late, great Howard Zinn, a journalist of extraordinary renown and credibility. Zinn had a habit of writing books that were mediocre. This one, however, is no better than his earlier books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing was awful and the plot was too contrived to make the story more interesting.  The last chapters are boring to read.  I'm also not a big fan of paranormal novels.  It's better to have a good book for a good story 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, at first I thought this book was good. Then it went downhill. I've already read three of these, and they are all garbage. I was really hoping this book would be better, but alas. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Well, I got it because of all the positive reviews. It is written for young adults, not for children, so it was too much to expect much of it.  The characters are cliche 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for a good book about the ancient world, then this book is not for you.  It's filled with wrong information about the period in question, and a lot of nonsense about the history of the Roman empire.  The most interesting section is a very brief discussion of the Etruscan civilization.  I wouldn't recommend it for anyone that wants to learn about Ancient history 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has been published and is sold as a gift.  It is no surprise to learn that the book has not been updated since 1990, although the first edition was published in 1974.  I received a copy from my husband in 1998.  Although I was pleased to have been a good friend to her when she was a teenager, I am extremely disappointed that she now gives so much emphasis to writing poems.  The writing in this book is atrocious, as is the fact that it is full of spelling and grammar errors.  She talks about love and life in a way that is almost too nice.  If there was anything good about this book, it was the fact she included a list of poets (among which was Raffi) as well as her own poetry.  Raffa's poetry is very good, but in her view these poets can only be praised for their own work and never, ever for the work of the poets she is praising.  This is not an uncommon stance.  In fact I have seen many people criticize Raffy's work when they have not even read it.  When you have read it, you will discover that she has no grasp of the reality of poetry, and even less interest in the poetry of anyone else.  Her book is filled with mistakes, and in a time of abundance, such mistakes are extremely costly 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has very little information on how to make your own wine, and no explanation of the wine making process, nor how to find good wine.  The author talks about his own love of wine and his desire for it to be the main part of his life, but it isn't the case.  This is a self-help book, which makes the book a terrible one.  It makes the reader feel better, if he or she read it, but doesn't really get to know the details of how wine is made.  If you are looking for some good information about making wine, read some good books like "How to Make Wines, the Complete Course".  Don't bother with this book, it is an absolute waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book a couple of times and really didn't enjoy it. It was very dry and boring, which I thought was a shame. It's a great book if you're trying to become a better photographer, but I wouldn't waste my time with it if you have a better book in mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing I found about the Chinese language is this is a very basic book and doesn't go deep into the language 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not what I expected to read.  I would have been interested in learning more about this story and how it was written.  The story is written in the second person, and the narrator is obviously  trying to keep this story straight, so it is very hard  to follow along 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to be a great writer, stop reading this book and learn how to write a good book instead 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is just about what I expected 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's very bad. It would have been better if she had just written a short story about a dog getting hit by a car instead of writing a book on animals. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the only thing that is really written about Buddhism in this book: a collection of quotes, mostly about the religious aspects of Buddhism, mostly without any specific discussion about the teachings. It contains a large section about Buddhist philosophy, some anecdotes and other bits of stuff that are not important. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not that bad. But, to get a sense of it and its content, read the other reviews. It is quite the opposite. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have not seen the movie version, but I was reading this book years ago when I lived in the Pacific Northwest and I was a child at the time. This book gives a terrible account of the history of the region. The author, Frank L. Haugland, seems to assume that everyone in this region knows about Native American tribes and Native American histories, which is a complete and total disaster. His account of history is very limited and his writing is atrocious. If you want a good book about the American West, I suggest you read a good history book about Native Americans. But for someone to be able to say anything that is remotely accurate about Native America, you really should not pick this book up.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I took several notes during the first two days of the book. However, on the third day, I was unable to remember the exact title, the date, or the author.  I am not sure if I should go with this book because it was not as interesting as it was the first time I read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a pretty sad book.  The main character was a teenage girl and she had a hard time staying positive, not even having a positive review about the book. She never even went to the bookstores that were advertised.  She was just negative and not happy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is based on the work of a British author, but that author is nowhere to be found in this book.The story is narrated from the point of view of one of the women, and we learn nothing about the man she is following. The story is also narrated in third-person, and that's not how I normally write.The author clearly thought this was a good book, but I think that most people should have a good idea of the author.The only good thing about this book is that we see a lot of action on the road to New York, but the book gives us no real insight into what is going on or where the characters are headed. If you want to read about action and adventure, you'll find it elsewhere, but if you want a well-developed plot and character, you won't find it here. I would suggest this book to anyone, but you don't have to be a fan of this author to be frustrated by it. It's not the best book in the world, it's certainly not the worst, it just needs some attention to improve. I was frustrated enough to cancel my subscription to the author's books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book back in 2002 and just stopped reading it. It was one of those books that just didn't do anything interesting. This is the first time I have read this as I am writing this review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's really hard to find good books with real life examples of good life. I thought the book was ok for the most part. The problem is it's so difficult to see how anything you do in life will make you happy. It's so full of things to learn. Don't waste your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is about a poor girl in Italy, who wants to be a singer. She learns a great deal about singing from her father, but he is a complete idiot. It's really hard to imagine anyone getting through this story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of a whole bunch of stereotypes.  A bunch of people that would do anything to keep a good book out of their kids hands 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the only book in English which contains very poor information about the war in Iraq. I would advise to read the actual material of the book instead 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an awful book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am pretty sure the author didn't read any of the other reviews and was just writing it because he could not find a good book about women.  What was the point of the book?  If this is the author's idea of a book for women, then I am disappointed in him, because I believe women should read other books than this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author clearly has no idea what he is talking about. It is all very theoretical. The most interesting part of the book is the section on mental illness. But the book was not even worth reading until I found out what mental illness was.The first two-thirds of the text is a collection of quotes from doctors and scientists.I do not buy a single word of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a really bad book. It is filled with all sorts of  half-baked advice on health.  The only positive thing I can say about it is  that it includes a few good stories. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure if you're right about the book but this was my first time with it, so I didn't know the whole story. However, the main points were that there was no scientific evidence for any of the claims that the authors made (at least I couldn't find any) and they seemed to make it up as they went along. It is a very superficial book, but it does leave you thinking that God may be able to do more miracles then you realize.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is pretty good. But it seems like she just has a different definition of friendship 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was not a bad read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are so many inaccuracies in this book: the people who are most susceptible to such problems are those with serious eating disorders and low self-esteem.  And many of the issues are either misdiagnosed or are completely irrelevant 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished the book. I didn't buy it for this reason, I didn  I just finished and purchased the book only to have a couple of people tell me    The book is a series of essays, it was published by a few different presses, and it's a great topic. The book was published in 2003, but the author hasn't published any new material in the years since. I believe the book should have gone to college 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are thinking of trying to teach this book, or indeed this style of writing, I suggest reading this review by an enthusiastic and experienced writer:  I agree with most of her reviews, and it's a little disheartening to see that these reviewers seem to be the only ones who don't  appreciate her writing. There are other reviews  that state that it is impossible for her style of style,  but she is so arrogant in her writing that she cannot see it.  Instead, she believes that it will be easy for her readers.  I believe that it's her arrogance and her lack of imagination  that prevent her from recognizing her own mistakes.  But I know, from experience, that a person is  unlikely to improve their writing if they are only focusing on  what they perceive as the "right" way to do things 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are very few good books on the subject of American History, the only one that I read was The History of the American West 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are too many spelling errors and grammatical errors in the book, for it to be used in any form of teaching English 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the first book  I read, and I don't think I've ever enjoyed one as much as this one. The story is interesting, and if it has any redeeming qualities it's the writing, which is often very dry and tedious.  I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn about a book,  but not to the extent of  reading everything in the world 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting to learn a little about the history of the Islamic art from this book, but it was nothing. Instead, it was all about religion and politics. All that was taught was Islam. This book is an example of bad writing and bad journalism. I think there are much better books about Islam out there, and I hope that they will make their way into the curriculum of our schools. But I am not buying a book with such a poor and biased description of the art. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book away and read it to my niece the other day. I would say that the content is accurate and the information is helpful. However, it is also very difficult to read for those with little knowledge of computers. I also received the copy in the mail from a publisher. This was not the first time they have sent one of these books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to agree with all the negative reviews 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The authors were kind enough to provide a bibliography. However, I find the bibliography to be unreliable, especially in the bibliographies. This book could have been much better 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well it's about two things: love and money.  Sooo let's be real.  There's nothing that I could even call interesting.  The characters were shallow.  They're only on this book so you can say whatever you want about it. It was a terrible book.  And I'm a big Harry Potter fan 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the first part of a trilogy that started with  The Man Who Killed My Wife. This is where this story begins. However the story doesn't go in the direction one expects it to, it actually gets worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it very confusing, especially when the person on the cover is a man and the author claims that he/she is a woman. There is a great deal of information that is simply wrong and misleading. I found the descriptions of a lot of sexual acts in this book to be shocking. The author has no way of determining whether someone is male or female, or if she/he is in her teens or if he/ she is a teenager.I found the book to have a rather negative tone and I would recommend to only read it if you want to learn a little more about sexual behavior in America, or, perhaps, about how to seduce a young girl 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are no sources listed for any of these photos. There are also no bibliography's, just references to websites that have been linked and copied. This is a cheap book that I would recommend avoiding, unless you are a photojournalist or photographer. It is also very technical and would require a solid background in photography, not a student. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is very misleading. There is one chapter about Jesus. In another chapter we are told that Jesus was arrested and crucified. Later on we find out that he was killed by the Romans and his body burned. This means that Jesus did not die from a crucifixion. He was not crucified but he was executed by the Roman authorities, who killed him and then buried him. This book is just another example of the lies people believe in the Bible. The facts and the evidence are completely against the idea of the resurrection. Jesus is not a deity that rose from the dead. He did not rise from the tomb. He died. That is it. And we all know about Jesus and all the stories about him. If you want to find out about Jesus, read the Bible and come to your own conclusions. This is not the book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be the most frustrating and unhelpful book I have ever read. The subject is a very serious subject, and it could have been handled better. The author is certainly the main culprit, as he doesn't even understand how a dog knows the difference between the sound of a hammer hitting something, and the sound coming from its own mouth. The information that he provides is, frankly, lacking. He also makes it sound as if it is okay to spank a dog if it gets a bad attitude. I was disappointed to read this, as I wanted a more practical book that gave a solution to the common problem of dealing with a dog that is being too aggressive. The problem with this book is that it doesn't make any sense. I will not be recommending it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A good book: for the casual reader, but  not for those serious about writing about literature 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has no redeeming qualities for anyone. It contains a large number of mistakes which cannot be corrected in a short period of time. The author, the editor, and the publisher are all liars.  I would recommend anyone with any interest in Buddhism or Eastern philosophy to skip this book and not read it again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is based on a real-life experience, not an actual book.  The author states in the back of the book that the information in this book is just from his personal experience.  That is true.  But in order to understand the experiences described in this "expose" the reader must read the book, learn the terminology, and be knowledgeable about a multitude of aspects of the world.  All of these are the book's weak points.  It is unfortunate that the author chose to make the book a "non-fiction" document. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with errors. I have a master degree in philosophy, and I knew from the start that the author did not have a degree. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of errors. I'm sorry to say that it is hard for me to believe that you did all the research and write such a good book. However, when I did research for this book, it was a total pain in the ass. There are pages of bad information and nothing that is backed up with a real story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is based on the movie. The book is not very informative. The authors claim that they are good  readers and students. The only negative I have is about the writing. The sentences are in a long, stilted style that makes the reader look like a child. The style of the book is so dull that the readers will be bored with it in two weeks of reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I'm a big fan of Mary Roach's and this book is absolutely nothing to do with her.  The title of the book and the style of writing it is really quite cheesy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not care for the author's writing style or her general approach to writing. I will never read this book again. Her lack of respect for others is evident. It is unfortunate that it was published in 2011 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a waste of money and time. It is mostly a discussion of sexual fetishes, and it's not the kind of book I would recommend for beginners.  The author talks about a couple of different fetishes and how to identify them.   I can't believe he didn't tell us that there are more advanced fetishes out there.  I would have preferred if he had talked about a basic fetish. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am extremely unhappy with this book.  It takes place in the life of a young man who is growing up and trying to figure out his own self-identity.  The character of the boy is written as the stereotypical,   immature, and often foolish teenaged boy.  This makes it almost impossible to understand or sympathize with this character.  At least the writing is somewhat enjoyable.  For example, the character refers to the boy as "a fatass".  The young man is a good boy!  It's hard to see him as anything but a typical,  foolish and immature teenager.  I don't think a teenaged child should be portrayed as anything other than that.  If a writer would like to write more realistic,  believable, and intelligent teenaged characters, then perhaps he could try writing a more mature book like,  Growing Up with Boys 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really disappointed when I read this book because the plot is so contrived and lame.   This book is only good for an introductory psychology course.  I do NOT recommend this book for any self-help purposes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book. The story was way too unrealistic. If I ever need to learn a new language, I'll just skip this book altogether and find a good book that teaches the basics. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a book about how to be a poor mother 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would say to read a good book like The Magician's Nephew or The Sorcerer of the Wilde Flowers first, then go to this book. The author does not follow the stories the way most writers do. He tells the stories but leaves the reader to guess what is happening. I found the stories very boring and that's how I found this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I took the book seriously. I thought I understood the theory of inheritance.  For my children to have this book as their only book, I would have been disappointed if I could have saved it.  I did my best.  In this book, you are supposed to learn all the terms and information from each family, but no. You learn only what the characters say. It's a little hard to understand.  It's not a bad thing. It just has too many errors in it, such as that a dog cannot be a member of a pet family.  You don't learn much from it at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a typical, old fashioned, sexist piece of crap. It tells women to stay home and cook and make sure they are looking good for men (even though women in the West do not do that) while the men do what they like (wanna fuck and get laid).  In addition to this the book says women are the reason for world hunger and all these stupid statements that just don't make any sense (such as why would men be attracted to a woman who wears tight jeans and high heels???)  I'm giving the book a bad review because there are some good ideas in it, some good recipes and some entertaining tidbits, but for those who are going to write this book it's a bad idea 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know why, but  I find the story of  the child molester to be incredibly boring.  This book is one more example of a bad writer  trying to grab a few readers by  the back-cover of the book.  The author really had to have a sick obsession with  this story to even want to put it into writing.  For anyone who  is interested in writing a good story about  a sick individual, do not read this book  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written over 30 years ago and is still written in the same   form.  The information is still relevant and helpful 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've always been a huge fan of John Darnielle's work but this book was nothing but an over-hyped, over-written, incoherent, nonsensical mess of a book.  There are so many mistakes and omissions that it's ridiculous.  The most embarrassing one is the entire book describing the origins of the title character, which was obviously lifted from a TV series he was working on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am disappointed in this book. The author tries too hard to write it as a book of personal anecdotes. It is a typical  memoir with several inaccuracies and false statements. I found it tedious to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It is very boring. The writing style is just awful. I would not recommend it to anyone. I hate it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was recommended by a friend and I liked it, but then I couldn't do any of the exercises. If you like the book but don't do anything in the exercises, it's probably because you don't need them, but I guess they don't make the book look good 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book, written by a man who has a medical degree, gives a bad description of medical care 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found this book to be nothing more than a series of descriptions of the lives of three couples: a hippie couple, a professional couple, and a Christian couple. The author's lack of experience in any kind of life leads him to describe these lives in a rather crude way. I didn't like the way he described the couples.  The only positive thing I could say about this book is that it was written in 1990 so it is a bit old.  It is still a good read though 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a graduate student in the humanities, and my interest in the Greek language and philosophy has not diminished. This book, however, was never helpful to me. I would not recommend it to anyone who has interest in Greek. I do feel that many of these lectures were delivered by other students with a more general interest in a number of different topics.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In spite of the positive reviews about the positive things the author does in the book, the main problem with the book is its lack of balance. While the author has some good ideas about this and discusses some good techniques, the only positive things he has to say about this are some positive reviews of his book and some positive comments about some other positive ideas he has about personal development, both of which are rather shallow. The book is very easy to fall into a bad self-concept with, as the author constantly reiterates. It does give some positive suggestions for some issues, but the vast majority of the book will have you thinking in the same way it does. This is the case for the majority of all the concepts and techniques the author talks about, so I was extremely disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about a love affair. However, the first page that I read, the author has some problems with the love story. Not very romantic or believable. He gives the love relationship for all women in this book a bad rating of 4. But then it is not about a real love relationship. He only gives a couple of examples that he believes in. Well, he uses all of these examples to describe the problems with love. Well if that is the book, I will give it a bad review!I have read the first two pages of this book and 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not understand why any author should ever recommend such a book to a person. It is filled with very repetitive descriptions of a very boring subject: animals. I found the book to be dull and rather depressing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written for children, but didn't really work for me.  I have a great teacher who is very well versed in all of the topics of this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A terrible book that tells you how to become a good girl. It doesn't mention how to get a good grade at school, how to deal with bullies, or how to make friends. If you are a teenage girl, it's useless. There's too much reading and too many pictures of naked girls. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a librarian and this book had been recommended to me by my librarian friend, who is also a librarianship teacher. This book was written in 1983. The book is dated and doesn't fit with the times we live in today. It doesn't explain much about the world of publishing or publishing practices today. This may be because the author didn't like the way the book was published and they wanted to change it. However, the book is filled with a lot of useless examples about how to do things wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very few of the quotes are accurate, especially those that are quoted from a book written in the 1960s.  Many of the stories do not even make sense, and are just recycled stories from previous authors.  Most of the book is nothing but a series of  repetitious statements about  women's role and responsibilities.  It is full of stereotypes  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A bad book.  If you don't like the word "jihad" in your literature, stay away 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would rate this book highly if it weren't for the following:  (1) The title is not descriptive. It is an epithet.  (2) The story is about a family and the abuse of their dog. The dog is never mentioned in the text. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this book in a library and I have seen it discussed on other sites. It's just one of those books that just doesn't do much to help. It doesn't tell you a lot about the book, it doesn't explain the subject matter, it tells you stories and anecdotes without explaining any of the science behind them. It is simply the story of a woman who has found her way into the book selling a book to women. It was a good book at one point but after reading this book I can only say that I found it more disturbing than entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel this book was meant to be for older readers. I am only 45, and for my first and second grade girls this is a good book to read. However, by the third grade they have moved on. It is all too late for the reader who is a grade younger. This is a mistake by publishers who make a bad mistake and should be fired 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I liked it, but didn't find anything to be learned.  I don't know if I'm right in thinking this book was written by the same person who wrote the "Life Lessons" in the Life magazine.  It's certainly not a very good book to write.  The author is obviously a woman.  That's all I can say about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book for my nephew. I'm so disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping for something new and thought I would like to read more about these kinds of ideas.  This is not the book I expected.  It was written for a general audience.  The author's approach is to write a lot of examples to show the principles applied in life.  Then, he asks the reader to solve problems using the principles.  No examples.   If you want to learn something new about life, this book is not for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For someone who is not well-versed in the Jewish community, it is surprising how much time is spent on this one. It is a long book, but I couldn't make it through it all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of useless facts and lies. The only thing of value to the information is the fact that all of it is attributed to "the Bible". If you want to know about real historical events, don't buy this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very bad.  It is a book about religious revival in New England, and they have to look for the money at the airport!  I don't buy any book without some sort of real world setting.  The book describes the movement from the viewpoint of the people, and it is not the first time this has happened, either.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very, very long, uninteresting and unhelpful to people interested in the subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the third book in her series about a woman in the 1800's. I didn't like these books, and I didn''t care for her. They are boring. The women in these books are bland. The plot is uninteresting, and the characters are flat. I did not like her writing style, either. She was trying to make a point, but she did it badly. She couldn''t write about anything that was more interesting than the heroine. She is basically boring. You''d need to be a masochist to read any of her books. If you read any one of her novels, you''d be bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't buy this book, it is horrible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would love to have read this book from cover to cover, but was left disappointed by this first installment.  The book should have been titled, "Ten Ways To Ruin Your Relationship".  It really isn't difficult to find out the reasons why a good relationship is difficult.  It seems most women in this book do not understand the ways in which their partner may be feeling.  If this is true, then they should have read more relationship books and not have any more misconceptions about men.   If you are looking for a good book on relationships, then go read someone else's book like  "I Have Friends, But I'm Single Now".  I am still looking for my good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not the best book ever written 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of the latest research, but is not relevant to students or beginners of the subject.  The content is for people who already understand the topic well, and who are looking for something to fill the time between the last review of a book and the new edition, and for people that already know the topic thoroughly, but would rather not spend much time looking for a new book or series 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I really did not enjoy this book.  The author does a fine job explaining some of the things he saw but did not see.  For example, he wrote about the effect of the Cold War on the world economy.  However, I could have done a better job in understanding that he thought the Cold-War was a good thing, and it was a bad thing because the Soviet Union is now the dominant power in the world, and America is still trying to bring democracy to countries like China.  I thought this was another story about the U.S. being on top.   He does mention other countries that have suffered from U. S. imperialism (except for Cuba) but never mentions China, and this is the only thing he wrote that deals with China. I could not even tell that he was talking about the Cold war 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a poor review of a bad novel.  It's written like an advertisement for a book: you should read it if you like to have a good time.  Don't waste your time with the writing and the characters.  The author has a habit of introducing her characters with phrases like, "The book opens with a scene involving two men in their early twenties sitting together in a coffee shop.  After the man starts drinking, the other man suddenly appears out of nowhere, and they are suddenly thrown together.  One of them leaves the coffee shop in the middle of the night with his shirt open and a beer in his hand.  They are now the best of friends and they go off to college in the end of the book.   The other man is still living with his parents after college.  He and his sister are still struggling to find a job and are working at a diner.  During the book, the two characters fall in love.  This leads to the second half of the novel.The relationship between the two friends is the least interesting part.  These are two friends who like to party, gamble, and have lots of sexual encounters.  Their story is told through a series of events.  Each scene is described in great detail. The characters are not developed very much.  Both the main characters are pretty dull. The plot is so complicated and it requires a great amount of mental and physical stamina. It doesn't make the story any more interesting, but it does require more effort than normal people will be able to maintain.  I just read the last chapters of the manuscript.  That made me realize how boring the book is. I'm a fan of adventure novels, but this book did nothing to enhance that. Overall, I recommend it for those who like a good story with a good cast of characters. But don't waste the money or your time.You should look elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is clearly a self-published writer and has no authority to judge what is "good" or "bad".  He tries to appeal to a wide audience by including a "list" of books from a diverse selection of authors which were written in the 1940s and 50s 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was originally published in 1981. But the book wasn't updated to reflect the fact that in the last 20 years, women have changed. That is not something this author will touch on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of boring details about animals and plants. It gives very little information about real world plants, and much about animals. The photos of plants are terrible and the text is full with typos and wrong information. It's not a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the worst books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to put it down after about a hundred pages. The style was cheesy, the book was over-long, and most of it was just plain boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is making an attempt to draw a relationship between the lives of two people in the same relationship 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was so misleading and confusing.  The author was also too generous with his information and advice. I had to return it and look elsewhere for a more accurate portrayal of the real world.  I would not recommend anyone else buy this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are a fan of the TV series, you would not like this book, as this is all about the original series, not about the recent show, which is probably why it's so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very much so. Not only is it impossible to understand this author's writing style, the language is very dull. I found it extremely tedious and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book and found it interesting and entertaining, but did not understand the purpose of the book. I would not recommend this book to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book several years ago, it was written by the very sadistic poet J.D. Salinger, so I am glad it was not published. It is really too bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains several errors. There is a significant lack of context for the history of Christianity. The historical evidence for the Christian faith is superficial. The examples provided in the book are often inappropriate, as they are about "Christian" beliefs. The book is written in an informal, friendly style, yet the opinions expressed are condescending and insulting to those who do not share these opinions. There are many instances where this book suggests that one must read a particular book to understand the Christian beliefs, while ignoring other books. The author gives many examples of how the belief of the Christian life is not "the" Christian belief. The main theme of the book is that Christians must live a Christian life. They are not allowed to practice "theism", or worship the God of their choice. The only examples given are about faith. The end of the author's advice seems to be a negative one: repent of any faults one has in one's Christian life, and go back to those of a lesser degree. This book should not have been published, for it contains the wrong kind of information, and for those who wish to be Christians they will have to study these books in detail, in order to find out the correct teachings on God's attributes. The information given here is incorrect, and is not suitable for those wishing to believe in the Christian religion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, the author did her research with a lot of help from a good number of sources on the Internet. However, her book doesn't offer any solutions. She simply tells the reader about the bad habits she discovered in herself. Her message is, go to the library and look up things 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was reading the book and I wanted to see the author's reaction to the poor writing of the main character.  Instead of showing a positive response and positive review of the story the author actually tries to do damage to the book with a negative portrayal of the character. This is the same book I read for the first time, and I'm still thinking about it.  I'll have to wait until I have a chance to finish it to see if he'll change his view. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be quite pointless. The book is full of contradictions and inaccurate information.  It is more of a description of the way people live in this world rather than a realistic depiction of the world as it is today.  There is almost nothing of the spiritual dimension, only what one would think from reading other self-help books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are a female reader who is looking for a good book on women and women's roles in today's society, but don't want to get involved in a whole lot of theory, I would steer clear of this book.  It is full of platitudes, and it gives very little practical advice to women who want to have a happy life.  For that reason I don't recommend it for anyone looking for practical advice.   The only positive thing about it is the cover, which is very cute.  Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains a lot of fluff about the lives of people from all over the world, but nothing useful about the real life.  The main character in the book is a woman named Maria, who is a self-help guru and who has a ton of books about the best way to live your life. Maria has an absolutely terrible life and it shows in this book.  This is the perfect example of how some self-improvement books tend to do.  I can't believe I actually wasted my money on this book, but I didn't even read the whole thing.   I gave my daughter the first chapter because she's 13 years old and I wanted to make sure she wasn't falling for this fluff.  She's the only one in my family who reads books like this.  Then she decided she'd read it all.  In the end I'd be embarrassed to say I've ever actually read anything like this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is over 2,500 pages long and very boring. Very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well I don't remember this book being any good, it seems to have been written about 10 years ago. The book is full of bad science and quotes taken out of context from other people, making it hard to follow. It was written by a bad science popularizer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has all the info on a good electronic device, but no real application. I did not read this book because it's so different. I recommend you stay away from this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book to be a very tedious read, but it was the author's intention that this would be an ongoing study on the art of writing and the ways people write in the modern world. It's a shame that the text was so unevenly edited. The majority of the book is spent on an introduction to the craft of writing that is both very long and boring. For example, the introduction takes place in a high school classroom and in the first chapters the author describes how his students write on their own. For me this is the only part that seemed interesting. Then there's the introduction on the writing process and the rest of the text is very slow and boring until the last chapters.I don't recommend the book unless you are a serious writer who wants to learn more about the craft. It should be interesting, however, to see if the author was able to successfully teach his students to write more effectively. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you read this book with a negative outlook on it, you're bound to be disappointed.  A good book is good for learning.  The characters are the usual stereotypes.  Nothing good or good-for-nothings about them.  There's no plot, no character development.  They all speak in stereotypical sentences  That's it.  This book is not funny, and it will have you hating on every person in it   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not only boring, but  is also misleading. The book says that in the book this will be a negative thing.  However, the thing about this book is that it is not true.  If you are a spiritual person, then this is  a positive book.  You need to know this.   The book also includes the following statements:  1. "The Book of Enoch is a great example of true prophetic writing.  But even more remarkable is the message that was conveyed by the book and by the people of the time   2. "There are people today who believe that the Bible is the only source of truth   3. "People today think that God has spoken only to a few religions,   4. "However, I have found that people today are drawn to the Book of  Enoch.  In fact, the book has received a positive review in both of the major  Christian religions, the Catholic and the Protestant.  This is important because, in my opinion,  the Book's message is so powerful that even today,  even in our own country, many people have been drawn to Enoch and are  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about a man whose wife is cheating on him. He's not a very sympathetic character. I didn't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is an overstuffed book. It does not present much in the way of facts or examples. It is mostly a collection of opinions of individuals. It was never a serious book. The author did not write for the general public. The idea was to have a bunch of writers make their opinions known about a specific subject. The first chapters were good. The last third was a mess.The author is a good storyteller and the ideas in this book are very entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too bad this book is not about modern science or any kind of scientific topics at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book did not help me in the interview process or help me find an agent. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, I read this book on a plane trip, and it didn't help. For one, the author fails to cite any source material about the story he is writing. There are only three main characters: the older boy, the boy who has been the victim of sexual abuse and neglect, and the teacher who had to be sent home after she and her partner got into a fight. The relationship between them and the situation between the two teachers was all just one big twist after another. There was little development and the ending was far too quick and didn't have any real impact. I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone except if you are looking for some light and fluffy romantic drama, and even then I wouldn a few warning:  Don't fall for the hook in the very last chapter. It will kill you! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author doesn't know how to write a positive review about something negative. He's a professional writer, but this book has no depth. I am a real fan of the book and I hope that he writes a positive book about the upcoming Marvel Avengers movie. But don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the fifth in a series. The first, entitled  "The Book of Lies:  Lies that Money Can Buy," is a bad attempt to sell the American Dream  by peddling cheap dreams. I found the second in the series  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not read this book and have not read it since 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was so bad it wasn't worth the money, so I just threw it in the trash.  This is a cheap book that the publisher tried to put a negative spin on.  I don't see why a book like this would be published.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are more examples in this book about a negative lifestyle than a positive one. The life style of a selfish woman, and the lifestyle of a woman who is more concerned with her own pleasure than hers husband's is described. The author did not seem to have a positive vision about this world. He just wanted to sell books. His work as a salesperson has not been good. I'm glad I found a book that was not to my liking. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was recommended to me by a good book: The History of Ancient Egypt. However, I did not enjoy it. I'm looking forward to The Complete History of Rome and the rest of the books in that series. I still do not like this book either 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of mistakes and is mostly about men and the media. If you are going to read this book and you are a woman, you will probably have a negative impression about men. If there is any positive message I have to say that it's about empowering women to have a say in their own lives and that if we stop focusing on the media and the problems of men, then we can solve the problems we have in society. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not only useless and badly written, it is written from the perspective of a person who does not live the life and has no business being the one that writes about others 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the previous reviewer,  this is one of the more unreadable book I have ever read.  It is not that the prose style is too much of a problem, it is just that the author has not been able to produce anything of worth in his writing.  He seems to take a lot of inspiration from Shakespeare and the  Greek tragedies and is a good reader of Shakespeare, but he never manages to turn that into something that is anything but a rehash of the Greek tragedy.  I do not understand why people take the time to read this book, because it simply does not contain any material of any worth.  The book is a total waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is only about a year old.  There is only one chapter dedicated to the history of this country.  The author knows how to write a good book, but he has no respect for this country and does not even bother to define the country. All he does is present a good history but without any real knowledge about the history.  He gives a good overview of what is going on in this country, but it is just one chapter.  If I ever have the opportunity to take a course on history I'll pass. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very difficult for anyone who has a basic knowledge of physics to understand.  If you are a physical scientist, you will probably hate it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first half of this book consists of a short narrative about a fictional book that the characters in the story read and write.The book goes off the rails in the second half where the characters talk about a different book, which doesn't even exist, that they have read. It is a terrible book, and not worth buying for those who do not like or know about The Secret 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book thinking it would provide information about some of the most interesting aspects of modern science. Instead, I found it to be a tedious, boring and misleading overview of science that was written mainly for the benefit of science enthusiasts. What a waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not like this book. Not because of the contents but because of its tone. It is very sarcastic and has nothing to say about the science of evolution. The author claims to be a Christian but his message is totally inconsistent. This is a bad, poorly written book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book. I feel that  the stories are very unrealistic and that there  are very few historical facts. I  found the writing very childish and   the tone of the book was condescending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a compilation of various myths about the Jews in ancient Greece. The book claims that Jews have a religion based on the worship of a golden calf. This is not true. Jews worship the same God as everyone else, they are simply a separate and distinct people, in many ways more like Christians and other people of the Christian faith. The Jews in Greece were persecuted by the Greeks, and many of them were killed. However, in spite of this and all the other myths about Jews in the ancient world, nothing is ever said about the role of Jews in any historical event that may have occurred during the time period. The only story that is presented is the "Golden Calf" story, and nothing more. The author even claims that the Jews are a Christian faith in disguise. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I agree with most of the other negative reviews:  This book has been published about three times now and is very dated. It would have been better if this book was written by someone who knew what they were doing when they got the idea for the book. This book is a compilation of the "Big Book on Quotes."  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not a bad idea, but not the best book to write about a difficult subject like addiction.  I'm glad it was written by someone who knew the subject and who wrote in an easy to read fashion.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not bad, but the writing is so sloppy that I couldn't finish the book and I did not agree with some of the things the authors said in the book. It was quite tedious. I would not read the next book by him. It's too bad because I enjoyed reading his books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I've ever read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I could not believe I got this book for Christmas. The author seems to have learned nothing from the recent disaster of the Bible and its many problems. The title is a dead giveaway that I may not be able to find the answers I seek in this book.I'm sure there are many good Bible scholars out there who can do better than this book, but it is certainly not for everyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed with the book, which was too long and filled with inaccuracies.  I am glad that there are now two excellent works about the subject.  For me, this book was just an introduction to his subject. There was no analysis, no description, just a hodgepodge of information, some of it accurate, some not, some contradictory.  This was not a serious book about this subject. This is a cheap imitation of history.  What else is new 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a good book for a beginner or beginner's self-study.  It is a textbook for someone with an advanced level in mathematics.  The author clearly knows his stuff.  However, the chapters are repetitive.  Some of the proofs are too much of a read-aloud, and sometimes he doesn't even have the book open on the page.  If I had the money, I would get another book from him, or another book with the same material.  I find his writing a bit amateurish.  He could do a much better job if he is going to write a book on his subject, and he seems to get tired very quickly.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main problem is that it is all about the  Chinese characters, the main point is just to show  the beauty of Chinese language and culture. The second  main problem  is that the author was born in China but never had any contact  with the Chinese people. The idea is to show a  Chinese woman and her husband in the world, and how their  family was affected by immigration. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a medical practitioner. If you have health problems, I would suggest finding a good medical text first. This book has several errors that could lead to bad outcomes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has nothing useful in it. Nothing I haven't already read several times over. The author has a way of saying something that he believes, but doesn't do much to back it up with fact. He makes some excellent observations, and then just disappears, leaving readers to fill in the blanks on their own. He even makes a statement about how bad it is to be a bad writer, but he leaves it out of the text. I think that's a problem in this world, where too many writers seem to believe in it as a way to justify being a bad author. The book is a collection of self-serving statements with very little supporting evidence to support the writer's statements. I don't blame the author for wanting to be as negative as possible about what he thinks he knows about writing, but I think it's a bad idea to base your writing decisions entirely on your ideas of badness, and not your own experiences of the process of writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is very close to his target audience of older women, but he fails to present many of the issues that younger women may have. For example, there is no discussion of contraception or abortion, and the story of the two young men is very stereotypical.  I don't recommend it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The content in this book is pretty limited.  Most of the material is concerned with the life and teachings of Mary Baker Eddy.  I didn't find the books style very inspiring or engaging.  Eddy was not my favorite personality.  The focus was so much on her personal life, it did not feel very authentic.  It is a difficult topic to discuss because it is so personal, and I do not know if Eddy would have been a good influence on people.  If you would like to read more of her work, I recommend you purchase the works by the other authors that are mentioned in the book.  For someone like me that is looking for a good book to read, I would suggest you give the works of Margaret Thirgood, Margaret White, and Lila Bush 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not all bad. For example, there are a few examples of well done photography, but it's all done through a very clunky and convoluted way of trying to convey the truth of a subject.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does not take into consideration that many of us are in our late 30's,40's, 50's and beyond. This is the kind of information that only an experienced person can provide. Not this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I received this book with great expectations. It was horrible! I could have done with a better review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did read this book before I took up martial arts. The only problem I had with this book was that it was too vague about his methods. He never really explains how to apply the theory in real life situations. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I found the book hard to read, but the pictures were bad.  It seems to be based on the premise that these two girls are the only ones to see the UFOs and that they were the only witnesses to it. The story is that they have never spoken about it, and it was only later that they saw it with their own eyes.  The girls never even mention UFOs 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was not written by a natural scientist. The author claims to be a naturalist and talks about the theory of evolution and how it can be applied to our lives.  He does not say much about the scientific theory of biology. He talks about fossils and fossils and claims to know all of these things. I found this book to be very boring and repetitive.  I did find several references to the book "Evolution: A New Origin of Life" by Hoyle and Kjos.  Although this book was great, it was far less enjoyable to read this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The cover is cool but the text is terribly written. The author states that it is a good source for kids to start learning about algebra 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author claims to be an ex-marine but doesn't know any of the basics about any kind of equipment.  He makes a ton of claims, but he never backs them up with solid facts.  This book is useless for the beginner or advanced operator.  The book is so badly written it makes me laugh 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not only do I have a bad feeling about the book, I feel bad about the poor person who actually chose to buy this book.  There's no good information, no insight, no real perspective.  It is a cheap attempt to justify his personal opinions, not a comprehensive review of any of the current literature in any area 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very negative review, which I will not read.  I thought it was ok. The author is not a good storyteller, nor does he show any skill in writing.  He may have read a good book on his trip, but his writing style is just ridiculous.  The story is repetitive.  His dialog is too similar to a soap opera 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of errors and contradictions. The only purpose of this book is to sell books to the public. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I have read this book many times.  It has been quoted in my reviews and in other books.  Unfortunately, this is the last book in the series.  As soon as this is over, the story will not only end, but the entire series will be discredited 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't appreciate this book as much as I thought I would.  While some of the stories are fun and interesting, a lot of the writing suffers.  This is a bad, hard-to-read book that lacks the critical thought it takes to write good fiction.  It is no surprise that this book is one of the most widely-available  books on writing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of inaccuracies and has a lot of bad advice. I would never recommend this book to anybody 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I thought this was a fantastic book, but that it only covers 4 months of the year and then it's back to the real world. And the pictures are useless. Very dull. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is really bad.  All of it's sections are confusing and don't provide any real insight.  There are no sources given for anything.  For example, the first section of the book is called "Boys at War" which talks about the French, British, and American troops that fought in the trenches during World War I.  The second section of this book is about WWI and World War II.  Where are the sources?  The third section of these two chapters is about "The War in Iraq" and is written by a "journalist" called "Fay" who never went to war in Iraq.  How do you get a third section out of a war that never happened?  I had to do a lot of research before I could even make it through the first two chapters.  This book gives you all of the information you need to know about WWII, but the sources are not given, the source material doesn't support the facts he is telling you, and the author is trying too hard to prove some point he wants to make.  I'm sorry to say I wasn't able to finish the book in four months.  And I finished it in six weeks after having just read this book.   This author has not had a good book since World War 2, but wants to stick it to the American people 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is very bad book and very difficult to read. It is written in a way that it is very easy to miss most of the points that were meant to be made. The only positive thing about this book is that it tells you what to do to improve your writing. But this book will do more harm to your writing than to your confidence and self esteem. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are a lot of good ideas in this book, but they all get lost in the bloat and repetitiveness. If you like to read science fiction and/or fantasy, it's all over. Don't waste your time. It's just a bad fantasy novel with nothing to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing was terrible and it was mostly a list of his bad quotes.  This is the first time I have ever read this guy's material and it's the worst I've ever read.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does not have much to offer other than the  usual "the best is yet to come!" type 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the first book in the series 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in the third grade. It was horrible, not to mention boring. However, it gave me a positive attitude. This book may have helped me a little, but I never read any of these books again. I was never particularly fond of the book, but if you read it in the high-school library and then want to do some writing,  I suggest you keep looking. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of inaccurate and misleading information about the Holocaust. It does nothing to teach Jews to avoid a terrible catastrophe. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main problem is that there is very little written about anything except for the author's personal opinion about everything.  You will not find any real discussion of history, economics, literature or politics 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of bad ideas, and no one with a sense of taste or ethics is going to buy it.  I am not ashamed to admit that I have purchased this book at least five times and I've been trying to read it as much as I can in order to keep my sanity.  The only reason why I have not thrown my book in the trash yet is because I am still trying to finish it. But it won't do me any good to throw the book in that bin unless I find a way to fix some of the errors in it. This book has no value whatsoever, and I feel bad for  all of the  people who wasted their time  reading it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a little too long, for one thing. I felt that the author was a little overzealous in writing about the author's favorite book, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read a few of these. I thought they were interesting and engaging, but they are tedious and boring. There is not much action in the story. You are simply reading a lot of boring, meaningless dialogue between different characters. I would not recommend this to anyone, as the plot is weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The style of writing is extremely casual and not appropriate for a serious biography of a person who had a major impact on the world. I believe this book is an extension of the book in the National Geographic, and it is all too similar. It's an interesting look into the life of the man and I would recommend it to anyone, but it is too casual and does not add anything of substance to the book. This book does have some interesting stories from his life, but if you're looking for the more comprehensive life of Napoleon, look elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an example of how not to write a historical book: the book is very slow, the first three chapters go over the author's head, and the last chapter contains absolutely nothing about the German people. It is almost like the author has no real understanding of what is important about the subject he writes about 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book I was looking for when I got into this  hobby. But it seems this was all  just hype. The author does have a lot of good ideas but  the book is way too long and the story is flat 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is difficult for me to be a positive reviewer about a book, but I will just say it was too much for me.  The narrative was confusing, overly long and tedious to read.  I know this is an amateur writer's review but this book should not have been published for it's length, plot and characters 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was excited about this book and  read it for the first time just before Christmas,  and thought it was very well written, but  I would not recommend this book to anyone  if you are thinking of learning the C++ language.  The author makes it very clear that he is only  using C++ to write a book.  He writes  things like "if you're only  going to learn how to use C++, you can just use C to write  this book,  but  you'll never be as good as me "   It's not surprising because he has never studied C++ before writing  the book. He doesn't explain  what he means 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not for kids but for adults.  It is a boring book with pictures of dead cats and animals.   All the pictures are of dead animals, some are dead cats, one of the animals is a dog.  If I knew what was good about this book I would have left it out of my kids' books.  I will probably have to reread this book a few times in my life.  Kids should be able to read about a real person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author states that she found this book very boring. The book is full of mistakes. The author makes claims about the book she didn't prove to be true. The only positive is that she states that the information is from the Bible. Unfortunately, this is not true. She uses quotes from other people without checking them.The only good thing I found was that she included some notes on what is in the Bible, but it is too few. Her book is filled with mistakes. It's time for her to be corrected and go somewhere else 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only reason I took this book to heart was because it was the only book I read as an ESL student. However, this is not a good book for ESL students because the grammar is bad, there is no information about grammar in this book and it is not clear what is the difference between the different  styles of grammar. There is no discussion about the differences between the  two styles of writing. It is really a one note book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the fifth version of the same story with a different title.    The story is the same as before, but the words and images have been changed.  The same story, but different titles.  This should be in the library for a book  about religion, but not for a student of the Christian faith 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a book written by a man who has lived and studied in a big country, the USA.  It has nothing to do with the people that live in this country 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    There is no real explanation of the basic concepts or how the principles are to be applied. The book is a great way to learn about calculus without taking the subject seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As one of my friends pointed out, this is the first part of a trilogy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I read this book as a teenager and never got around to finishing it.  Unfortunately, I found the author's writing style (and the overall tone of the book) extremely offensive.  He seems to have a hard-on for some of his characters (especially the ones that go to war, or live in a city) and I found it difficult to believe that anyone would actually want to read such a book.  I can't even imagine the author was ever a teenager.  Even so, I don't recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a shame that in this book, one can not see a problem is that the book is full of inconsistencies. Many chapters don't make sense, and some other chapters don- 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was extremely boring and uninteresting. I didn't understand what the authors were trying to say, it was all very wordy and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not agree with all the negative reviews, but I do agree with this reviewer.  She states that this book contains a list of names that are not names.  I don't see any problem with that.  But then the author has to spend some time explaining who these names are.  Even if this book were all you could afford, you should be able to read more about this fascinating world in other books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, if you're into occultism and occult books, this book is not for you.  This book is based on an obscure text from the 19th century known as The Secret Doctrine by the author of The Secret Teachings.  It is basically a bunch of nonsense that was supposedly written by Helena Blavatsky.  Unfortunately, this text is full of contradictions and nonsense that is completely unsuitable for anyone.  Furthermore, this author is very, very poor with his research, and doesn't even have the book on his shelves.  The most I can say about this book without having to praise it is that it is a bad attempt at a pseudo-spiritual text.  If you want to learn about the occult, look elsewhere, because this book does not do it for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book with extreme annoyance. I didn't understand why he put so much effort in to make his characters likeable. I think this book could have been better if it had been better written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book for my niece who is very shy and does not like reading. The story is all about the characters living in a small town in Iowa, but it is not interesting at all.  This book was for my nephew and his friend and all they talk about is food.  You can't write a book about people like that!  The story was so much about the family that it lost all of the funny feeling and was all about them living in their house.  I can't believe that book was even written.  If you like to live like that, then this book is not for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the first book in the series and it will never be the same. The author tries to write a history of a specific country but does not really know anything about the history of Ethiopia. The main character is not Ethiopian and the other characters who are Ethiopian are all just so generic and boring that the story takes a very long time to develop. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the fourth and last book in the series that begins with The First Time, The First Day and ends with What To Expect When You're Expecting: Lessons From The Mind Of A New Mother 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with  false claims about what will help your marriage. In other words, nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like the book at all.  The author is trying to tell the story of an alien's life in the world of fiction but he didn't even bother to read up on the details of this alien's civilization.  He only knew how to make the aliens laugh.  A real disappointment 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is terrible. It describes a man who was supposed to be working for his father, and ended up being his apprentice. This is not good writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't get the logic of the book. It's mostly about how we can control the way we think. No point writing a negative book about a good book: you have to read it to get the ideas. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The content is mostly the same as in several of her other books, with the exception that she focuses on a few more cases and tries to make the book seem more interesting. However, it is a lot of work to get through it. I wish she'd give more attention to the more sophisticated cases, like she did in her other works.I don't recommend this book, or any of her others.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure why you're telling people about "the power of the positive imagination" in such a way that it's going to keep them from feeling bad. It's a bad self-help book, it's not an inspiring one. If you're trying to do some inner work, read something else. It doesn't even have that many real examples. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of inaccuracies. In some of the cases, the author may be right. But it also contains many inconsistencies between statements and facts. For example, he says that all of the firstborn of a married couple get the father's share in taxes. Yet in this book he lists four children and four parents. It is obvious from the text that the author has made a mistake. But the author should have been able to read a legal document and determine what should happen if two persons are both parents. The result would have been different. He could have saved himself a lot of trouble and money by getting a good tax lawyer. The author has no knowledge of tax law and is therefore unable to do his job. I would not recommend this book to any student who wants to be a professional writer 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a horrible book. I feel bad for my son. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written as a self-help book, but lacks any good evidence. It is basically the story of the author's life. His book about how to do better at cooking is the more impressive book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not only did this book suffer from the typical self-help cliches that are common in self-improvement books, but I also found that the author was clearly not an expert in the field.  I was not impressed with his explanations as well as the ideas that he presented.  There were many times where he simply said that something was true but left out evidence to support the claim.  Overall, the book was a dud.  He was trying to sell the book as a way to lose weight, but that would have been better off done in a different way 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a history buff, but this was just dreadful. It was the first time that I thought about the history of the U.S. and had to take a break from it. I guess I will not read a book like this ever again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only reason I gave this book a negative rating was because it was so long. I am not a writer, I have never done any writing, and the only one thing I would like to change is the last chapter which I found boring and unnecessary 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the most boring book I have ever read. The plot is a fairy tale. There is no tension. Just the same old story over and over again. The characters are nothing more than cardboard cut outs. The author has no problem spending thousands of dollars on his books, but I have not enjoyed reading them in years 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is written for students, but I guess that is why they got so many complaints about it: too much teaching, not enough study. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just read the review and there is not a lot to add except I have only read one book from this series so far.  However, there are definitely some good ideas in here.  Maybe the idea of creating a group of friends by bringing them to your hometown for weekend trips is one of the better ideas 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is horrible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is rather misleading. This book was published in 2004 and still has not received a proper review from the reviewers.  I'm glad I only have to deal with this book once. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't believe that the story was as well-written as the author claims. The plot is very basic. The characters are flat. The author clearly hasn't read any science fiction.The plot is only used to explain some events in the book. I donÔøΩt think the plot could have been better. The reader gets more questions than answers. In my opinion this is a very basic book that has no point to it whatsoever. The book's main character is also very dull.The story is also full of spelling errors and confusing plot developments.I'm so disappointed in this book, I don¬¥t even want to read it.I am sorry that I wasted my money.I also don¬¥ve to complain about the cover of the book, which is not realistic. I think it has a very bad effect on the reader 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't really like this book because it was so boring.  The main character was very annoying and the plot line was so predictable.   This was the third book in the series and I am already wondering if it was written by someone else and not J.K. Rowling 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very skeptical about this book, but I didn't like it either. I don't know if I will read more of her books or if I even will continue to review books for a long time, but for now I will stay away from her writing altogether. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with over-the-top, ridiculous theories, and a few too many inaccuracies. It's one of those books that I had to take my time to finish reading it, just because I couldn't be bothered to make any changes to the book and was too frustrated by the book to finish the whole thing, let alone read through it. This book probably was written in 1990 or something, which is a long time ago, but for those who actually bothered to read through this book, it would take you ages to finish it, so much so that the author himself would probably be annoyed. If you wanted something like a history of religion from the Middle Ages, or were looking for something to make you think about religion, this book was just way too much for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was an absolute bore to read. I did not find any of the characters to be sympathetic or interesting. If this was a "serious" book it would have been a great book to read for a group of kids, but I never found it to be a great choice for that purpose. This book is just a bunch of dialogue that could have been condensed in the form of a comic strip 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a native French speaker and have read a lot of good books, but this one is very bad. Very confusing. A lot of grammar mistakes and the characters seem very weak and childish 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is more like a college textbook that doesn't have much to say about how to go about the business of doing marketing.  There's nothing in the way of examples of good and bad marketing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of false information. The book claims that women can be successful and stay at home for years. In reality women are the most unhappy in today's world 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed with the book, as it only gave an overview of the history of modern music from the late 19th to the late 20th century.  It also gave some superficial and incorrect information about the roots of rock & roll, as well as some erroneous theories about jazz.  Not to mention the fact that the author was totally out of his field and completely out of touch with contemporary music.  He didn't give any information about American popular music, as far as I can tell, and didn't even use a cello, which is totally unnecessary in modern music 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a great story, but it would not appeal to a very old audience as I thought it was aimed at the younger generation. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved the book and it was great fun for my daughters. But  she was the only one that liked it, and her parents don't  want to read any more of her books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was given as a gift, but the author claims that she does not know anything about these matters.  I bought a copy because I read the other reviews.  The book is filled with incorrect grammar, incorrect dates, and incorrect information. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very similar to the book on the same topic, but much more dated. I couldn't get through it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main problem is that it is only a short and dry summary of a great book on a great subject. I don't care if you read it in one day, or two. Just read it and then go read the other books on that topic, or the other great ones on other topics. But  I'm just disappointed because the rest of the books on the same topic are so good 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's style is too much like that of a fifth grade classroom teacher 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a bad compilation of information from various people. It seems like there is no real "tongue in cheek" in it. If this is a book intended for an academic audience, I suggest that they just skip the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read the book so many times that I can remember all the details of it. There are so many mistakes that are not even mentioned in the text. For example, there is a discussion about "bitter almonds" and there is no mention of the fact that the real problem was the fact the tree had not been pruned for a couple of years. The author even refers to a "tree doctor" and refers to the fact he is not an expert. So I can only assume this is some sort of fantasy. A little too simplistic and too much of a negative book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, a book about a book, is over-written and boring. No one reading this will learn anything. Instead, it is an exercise in making the reader feel uncomfortable. The author's tone is very one-sided, as he rails against the evils of children. This book should not be used as a guide for any child-parent relationship. Parents should not use this book as a way to teach their children. Parents and children should be allowed to speak their minds, for themselves and each other. This should be about learning from our mistakes rather than writing from an emotional place 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm so disappointed in this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is based on a real life incident in which a teenage girl (and her two younger sisters) were stalked and beaten in a small Alabama town.  This is a very negative book, which portrays the victim in a negative light, rather than attempting to help her or the children.  I was hoping to learn about the legal system in Alabama, the treatment of the victim, the family, and how the children were taken from her.  Instead, I found myself wondering why I had to take this book along on my trip to Alabama.  The kids are supposed to be teenagers, and they are supposed  to be able to protect themselves from these people.  And they certainly can't be taking a lot of drugs 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a horrible read because of the way they present information. You will be looking at pictures of flowers and a small amount of information. No pictures of anything else, no background information, nothing but the picture of a flower 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too many of the answers in this book have been already answered on the Internet, and the few new-age methods of yoga which this book tries to incorporate are pretty ineffective. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have nothing positive to say about this book.  I did not like the author's use of the example of a girl who is too shy to wear the right pants.  This is NOT a girl that should be a role model.  What is needed is more role models and more role playing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave it a negative rating because it is not written by an expert in mental health, but rather by an author who knows nothing about the field, and has done little research to back up his assertions. It is written in an offhand, casual manner, and the author seems to have little knowledge of the mental health field. It also lacks the depth and breadth of information you would expect in a serious study of mental illness. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I didn't like this book very much and decided to finish it. The next day, I realized it was the wrong book. The reason is that the entire book is one big picture. So it's very difficult to follow. I felt this book was more about the artist's life and not the art world. The book is really quite boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a good reviewer, and I'm not about to review a bad  book. It's more  bad grammar, bad bookkeeping,  and some poor ideas.  I read a lot about finance, and this  book didn't make sense to me.  What it did make sense for me to do,  though, was look at the mistakes in my portfolio  and see where I went wrong 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't like to do reviews, but this book is the worst I've ever read.  The writing style is horrible, and the characters are extremely unlikable.  I didn't like the characters in any of the books and that's the only negative review I'll write here 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is extremely boring.  This is a horrible book and it is going to waste time and money to read this.  I'm sorry to say I'm wasting my money on this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I took the author's advice and went to the library to research the book. She had to come to my rescue by editing the book and adding a paragraph about the book being a collection of her articles. The book is full of misinformation, it should be a reference book rather than a book of biographies. The author herself says she is not a historian, she just puts it all in her book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read it without knowing that it was written by a woman (a bad sign), and found the book to be highly biased and negative. The author's personal opinions of women are very narrow minded. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with unverifiable claims about ancient history and magic. The authors were influenced by the late-60's, 70's, and 80's television show Star Trek. As a matter of fact, the book claims to be a work of historical fiction and that the characters in the book were based on actual people of the Renaissance period 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for some information on the art of knitting in the early part of the 20th century, this book is not for you.  This is a history of knitting from the beginning of the 19th century to the end of the twentieth. It covers the whole spectrum of knitting styles 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is supposed to be for first time anglos children, but I can't imagine anyone would want to read it. I feel sad for all those who read it and thought it would be a good gift for someone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book doesn't contain any good information about gardening, growing vegetables, or fruits. The information is too often useless. If you want to become a vegetable gardener, check out books like Gardening for Vegetables by David Zaslav, and Grow a Garden for Vegetarians by Mark and Diane Schoen. The only thing this book has going for it is the pictures and diagrams. I could not even find the correct words to describe the pictures in this book. This is a worthless book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I think this is the worst book I have read.   It tries to be profound, but fails.  It is full of bad history and quotes.  They don't say it, but I have a suspicion it is just a collection of quotes from different people.  No one knows what he was thinking when he said it.  I have been in the Middle East for nearly twenty years and have never encountered such poor and ignorant historians.  He has nothing to say about the Middle Eastern wars or what they mean for the future.  The only people he ever quotes in this book are from his personal life.  This is not a book on a historical event; it is a collection from the mind of a man with a huge ego.  His book has all the negative attributes that is associated with a bad history book: racism, sexism, etc.  All these are in the past tense.  You can look up any other book about the past and see a much better book.  There is only one point that is made clear:  America is the cause of many  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains a number of misquotations and not-really-true statements. It also contains a lot of misinformation about the US Civil War. It's not my favorite book, but I read it because it's written in the   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written in 1989, when AIDS was still a huge epidemic and there was still such a stigma surrounding it.  But it has remained largely unchanged for twenty years and has become the source for many of the myths and false beliefs about AIDS.  The only reason I can find for it still being published is to sell more copies.  This may be the last book that I buy for my daughter.  Hopefully the author will have a heart attack at this point, because her voice and her vision are so far from what she needs to be.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has any interest in the topic 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not only full of poor excuses for romance, but it also has no idea how to use a computer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book so over-hyped, that I stopped reading it and just threw it out. The main character was just as interesting as the title. But the author got greedy. He couldn't resist adding a long and tedious description of a romantic dinner at a fancy hotel. The book was over-written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a self-indulgent book, written in a kind of self-deprecating way. It's also very difficult to read, and it's a poor representation of African-American culture.  I haven't gotten through it yet, but I'll wait for a better book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was so out of touch and not researched at all, I threw it out the window. I thought this was an article, not a biography. The pictures, though pretty, were so distracting. They took away from the story and the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was published many years ago in an age of printed books. The information it contains is dated.  I have no doubt that this book was written by an amateur.  It is only a matter of time before it becomes a classic.  The information here is the same as in the "American Child Study Book" by George Washington and his students from Harvard.  Their version of this book is only slightly different 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're looking for a good book that will help you with anything on the spiritual path, this isn't the book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think there are many people in the world who have any patience for this author. He is clearly not a great writer and is an anti-Christian Christian bigot. I have not even read the first half of his book. I feel sorry for this poor man's family. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am reading this book, but I have not got the time.  Don't give this book a chance if you are a fan of any good book,  I hope you would know the answer to this question 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was not for the average reader and should not have been published. In fact, it's not that great of a book as some have said. The author should have spent more time on the research. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had a bad experience reading this book.  I didn't like the writing style.  Very, very dry.  It was so boring.  And I liked the story, but I didn the characters.  They were so much like each other.  A very bad book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not impressed with this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is really an anti-science screed.  I couldn't put it down once I started.  The book is full of inaccurate statements.  It does not mention any evidence for evolution, much less evidence for a creator.  For example,  "The scientific concept of spontaneous generation of new life is an illusion.  A true scientific explanation for life is the theory of evolution.  Evolution is a mechanism of change; that is, change occurs without intelligent direction or control."   The "evolution" in this book is that of plants, animal life, or human life; it does not mean evolution. ¬†  If you are a creationist, don't buy this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel this was written in the 1990's.  The information in the book is very limited.  I never found it to be informative, informative, or useful.  It has no bibliography 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book to be over long.  The writer, when it was to be the author's last book, tried too hard.   It didn't really capture the author or the subject matter, so it was a disjointed, confusing, poorly written work.  This is why I can't recommend it to anybody 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book should have been published before. The story is pretty good but the writing style is too sloppy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book to be dry and uninspiring. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is all about creating and living in a magical environment, and yet most of the things mentioned are very obvious. It really makes you wonder why they were put in such a short story and given the title 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's about a teenager who is not even a year old yet and I could not believe it. I thought it was going to be an entertaining read, but the plot is terrible, and you have no idea where the story is going. And the character development is the worst. No matter how many times I read this book, I always think the protagonist is going to turn into a sociopath, just like the book says. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too much of the above review is based on the fact that the authorship of this book is not very clear. The author is a college professor.  As such, the book is a bit confusing and does not provide enough detail for many of the chapters. However, it does provide enough details about the various types of sexual violence to leave you wondering what exactly they are talking about.  I would suggest that anyone considering reading this book needs to read up on a more academic book to get a fuller picture. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The content of the book is not interesting, although the illustrations are beautiful. The text of the review is correct. The book is a sadistic attempt to convert the children into Jehovah's Witnesses in order to give them spiritual and emotional support.  The book includes many religious and spiritual themes that are completely inappropriate for children.  This book needs to be removed from the curriculum. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a very typical work of the "dynamite" genre, and has very little to do with the actual events of the Arab Revolt 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't waste your time with this book.   It is written for the general public.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be a poor explanation of the   Bible. It is full of vague language and poorly written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I gave this book a bad review. I don't know why it was so much of a problem for me to get through it. If you're looking for a good book, skip it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book for people who believe in the occult and/or magical arts, but who don't have a lot of experience with reading. A good book, for sure, but not for beginners 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high expectations for this book, and they were dashed.   The author begins the book with the statement:  It's not good for kids to grow up and read a lot of fiction.  In fact, it's even worse for kids who grow up reading lots of fantasy.  If you want your kids to be immersed in an imaginary world, read Tolkien or someone like that.  The first chapter focuses on the story of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For some reason, this book is very popular among children in the school system. I just didn't find it particularly interesting or entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book a three star review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author claims that the information is "included in all public libraries". Well, I have to disagree with him. I do have several libraries in the New York area that I check out, but not all of them are listed in the book. The one that is listed has the information only on the back, and it is not even organized in the right order. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of wrong information and claims of miracles. The information in the book does not help with the problems of one's life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If anyone knows anything about the Russian history of the 16th century, it is the Russians who made it all happen. Don't believe that  anything that happened in Europe during the Renaissance, could possibly happen in the 14th century. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The authors claim that this book will provide students with a better understanding of the Holocaust, but this book doesn't do anything of the sort.  The book doesn?t explain anything, gives the students too much information, and the content is boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had hoped this would be a more detailed book but it is basically the same as The Book of Mormon:  I don't agree with the book's conclusions about Mormonism or its historical accuracy 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too many of the questions have already been answered in other reviews, but the story line is so predictable that it's not even funny. I was ready to jump on this book and start reading.  I found myself not really caring about the characters, except for one character named J.O. (I believe his name was actually pronounced 'Jee-O' 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was written by an ex-girlfriend, and it's full of inaccuracies.  I can't believe it's still being sold.  The only positive review I have is from a good book: "This book is a sad, sad book.  It is written for someone who has gone to the other side  of life.  If you have ever experienced serious depression,  it is written to make you feel better  It should only be read by people who have never  experienced depression  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was the best book I've ever read.  It just didn't make sense to me.  My husband is an atheist so that was a bit of a shock to me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author makes many claims and the arguments are not compelling. It is mainly a review about what he found out from a number of different sources. Some of the quotes he used to show his argument's truth are very out of context. For example, his use of a Bible verse to say that he has done everything possible to help a young woman recover from a miscarriage 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for a good book on the subject of the Bible, look elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The authors' approach is to go into details about the history and philosophy of the Qur'an and the hadith, only to leave the reader to infer the Islamic teaching without further ado.  If you have the curiosity to delve into the deeper aspects of Islam, I recommend the book by Ibn Hazam: Al-Fawadiyya al-Mutanasiyya. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Very little information about the Middle Ages is given, not even about the most famous saint who lived in the 13th century: Saint Aidan of Rievaulx.  His life story is told in the appendix but in a very limited fashion 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As much as I loved the book, it was not well written.  This was a mistake on the author's part, and it will ruin any chance of getting good advice from him in future.  For instance, he uses a very poor analogy to demonstrate the relationship between a good book and a good life, and I have yet to find any good example of this in any book I have read.  Instead, his advice is just about what you would expect from an author who has failed to develop a solid understanding of the concept of self-help 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with allusions to other writers, and allusions of other cultures. It doesn't get any more than that, and it isn't even clear which are the references. This book suffers from the worst possible mixture of bad writing and poor history. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is not a bad read, but rather an  overly simplified and over-entitled introduction to the Japanese language, which makes the information in the book irrelevant.  It does not give any example sentences  or grammar explanations. It's mainly about the  grammar of a particular  language.  The Japanese grammar is very similar to the  Japanese spoken in Taiwan.  This book is simply  a translation of one of the other  books  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The language used is very bad. For example, the word'sushi' is used when it is spelled with the first syllable. I think I would skip this book if it were written by a native Japanese. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a good book but there is very little in the way of analysis in this book. It is mostly a collection of anecdotes, some of which are very repetitive. The anecdotes do not add anything to the book. There is also too little discussion about how bad bad books like these are for a good study of any subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is really the only book that is the worst thing in the world to the writer. The idea of a person growing out of being a child is an absolute waste of time.  There is nothing interesting about the person or the child that the book describes.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have not read this book so far, but it is written in the third person style and the author makes many general statements about all sorts of subjects and even the weather, like it's raining in the Sahara or the Pacific Ocean. So this is not an easy read. He is a well known author who has a large fan following, but this is the first book he has written that I've read. It's a tough review, but just remember to skip the third-person style and be more descriptive 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book did NOT help my learning in any way. I gave up reading it right then because I just could not figure out what the author was saying. I mean, how could he be so ignorant? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is another example of a book that was written before someone else had written it.  No one is responsible for the content and style of the writing in these works, they are simply put together and sold to the reader.  It is the same as all other books out there.  If you want to understand a difficult subject and you are looking for the "right book" this is not the book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very boring book, which is sad since I loved the first book in this series. I could have saved myself the frustration of reading a bad books when I have a more advanced book on my hands 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not only a collection of personal interviews, but also an overview of Christian music and worship. But then, what did you expect? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want a good book about sex and relationships with teens read any book by a female  author.  This book was written for the male audience and is full of  unnecessary and boring information.  The only reason I read the book was because  I have two teenage daughters.  I would not recommend this book  to a teen girl 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains very few historical facts and is just full of lies and propaganda.  I gave away this book to a friend and he has written a more accurate review about the same book: http://www.pbs.org/washington/epoch-of-disbelief/ The author seems to think he is above the law.  He is not, he is a criminal and should be held accountable for his actions 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book over a period of time. I loved it then, I hated it now 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written in the 90's. In today's   These days, the Internet is everywhere. Many  books out there can be found online and  people are looking for such books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written in 1984. Its content is outdated. Its style is crude. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not even remotely close to being about the ancient world.  It's not that it's bad.  However, it would be wise for students to avoid this book.  For one, the historical facts about the Romans are all false.  Secondly, the ancient sources are pretty shaky.  A lot of information is given as fact, and very few references to supporting documents.  This is not a book for historians, and it's not a good one for the general reader.  If you want to learn about the early Church, don't read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was only a student at the time of this book. I have read it only once since then. It has very little information about computers, or the Internet. I think that the author should have chosen a topic that was of more interest to him. Perhaps the book's title should have been something more appropriate 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book in the library and I was so excited to finish it that I decided to read it again.  I was very disappointed to read the last two pages, because the last paragraph was very boring.  If you want to write a book about a famous author, then do something with some depth, like John Updike, or Jodi Picoult.  Don't waste your time on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   First,   It is the usual story about bad books:  Don't let your child read this book.  I did, and then I gave it away.  The book is just too confusing for the child   Second,  If you are the parent of a child, this book might be for you.  You should take a good hard look at the spelling 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought the book was excellent, but I was extremely disappointed with how the book ended.  The author tries to present some positive aspects about the book, but it doesn't seem to stick, and the book never really moves forward.  I really wanted to see where the author's ideas would take her, but she clearly doesn't want to leave her book world 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title says that he is a Christian but it really does not match the content of the book. A lot of the time he is being condescending or he does not appear to be giving much practical advice. I would rather read a positive book about the bible and it would not be as difficult as it sounds. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never understood the author's obsession with the French Revolution, and this is a classic case of it. The story is as good as I have read from him. He knows it too well, he knows that there is nothing new about it, he does not want to be the one to tell the truth about it. He just wants to fill his books with a pile of rubbish.The characters are so badly developed that there are hardly any who are more than one or two pages from the point of view of the main character. The author has no clue what he is doing. I am glad he does use the French language for the illustrations and I think that is the only reason his book is so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for a good review of a bad text, this is the book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't recommend this book because it has been published in the past. If you're going to do it, read other writers 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is bad.  I thought that I'd be able to learn something by reading it, but it only shows my ignorance of the issues.  It's a horrible waste of my time.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really dislike reading this book. I am a beginner in writing, but I found this book difficult to follow. The only good thing is that you can find online copies 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the second book in the series and it has been the most useless to date. It is a rehash of earlier works with little new information. The writing itself is very poor, with lots of typos, poor grammar, sloppy editing, and poor storytelling. There is very little information about the author's real life that would explain the story. Not a bad story, but I do not recommend it to any who haven't read all of the others 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a piece of crap.  The story is so poor that it's hilarious, but it's full of lies and distortions.  This is the worst book on the market 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is the only one I ever read from the author, but I didn't find any good information, or even a bad review of the book itself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has many errors, and it is written by a man who does not speak a word of English. For example, he claims that his wife has a huge penis, which is not true, as my wife is a thin, tiny person.  I think the author was a bit of a fraud and should have made the book written in another language. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not only is this book filled with boring anecdotes and poorly written descriptions of the good life; the stories are completely untrue. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't see a point in a text like this for a woman who already knows what the hell happened in World War II.  A lot of the people she describes are basically idiots. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The last thing one reads in a dictionary is the definition of an adjective.  This book offers very little information about what he believes is the key to achieving success. The author has little knowledge about any of the real world subjects which he purports to cover.  The only thing that works is his own experiences and perceptions.  If this is the kind of book you are looking for, look elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't understand the author's intention for this book. It is a story about a very talented woman. It talks about her many affairs and a lot of bad things. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written as an advertisement for an electronic device. The book's subtitle is "The Complete Guide to Electronic Devices." But, unlike an electronic devices' guide, the electronic device sections of this book were not written by experienced technicians or professionals. The first book in a series is titled "The Best Electronics: Electronic Devices & Parts" and it contains no electronic device content.  I'd recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn about electronic devices 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has little to offer a good book. Most of the book is spent describing what happens when a woman leaves her abusive boyfriend. This is boring to the point of being a waste of my money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for something new and different to read for my students. But it is too long and tedious. If I could read one more sentence, it would have been the "I did not read it but have taken the book

Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very repetitive. You will come across a lot of the same characters in the book. I don't remember a single good anecdote. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not a good example of the real-life example of a man trying to figure out life, love, and a good book: the subject of his love interest. I am ashamed to say I bought this book after the story of this girl, and this man's relationship with her, and was so disappointed in the end 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book contains a great deal of information about the world but it is written by someone who has not done any research. This is a good book to buy for someone who is thinking about the ancient history of Persia. It may be helpful for the student who is taking a course on the subject but I found that the more I read of the books I read the more this book seemed to be an attempt to convince you that the Greeks and the Persians were contemporaries. In fact this book makes no attempt to explain why the Persian empire was not as powerful or influential in the first several centuries of its existence as some of the sources state. This book makes more sense when you realize that this is the era when the Perses were ruling a vast empire and that the Greek and Romans had not even thought about the Persian Empire as they were engaged in various wars and conquests at the time. This leads one to believe that the Persia's were not as great of a power as we are led to believe. The Greek historian Strabo was writing about a time in which Persia was in total decline. Strabo is right. But this time in Persian history he was writing from the perspective of a conqueror and not the victim. I guess that is why this book is so bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to agree with all the negative reviews of this book. I agree that it is very dry and it has an annoying plot.  I read the entire thing before I could even start the book.  The book itself is about a couple of guys trying to break into a bad electronic device in a supermarket.  And I did the same thing in college, as I was trying to get into the store's computer system.   The problem with this book is that you can see through it, even after it is finished.  You have to figure out how to interpret all the information. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the negative reviews of the book, it has many spelling errors, and many of the characters are too similar to be believable, the author needs to take a lesson from the great writers of today like Jules Verne. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book you are supposed to learn from the Bible and do a Christian life. However, there is no mention of the gospel. In fact, it is mostly about how to be successful in business, get what you want and do it all in the most  exploitative and materialistic way possible.   I am not sure how to give a negative reviews about this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book should have a title like this:  This was very difficult to follow. I would suggest to readers that they spend more time in a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Too many pages of self-important bullshit about the Christian Church and its rituals. It also covers all of the standard topics about "reasons to believe" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has nothing to do with astronomy or space sciences, just a lot of bad science, nothing to get excited about. I'm glad I don't buy any of their books, even the astronomy ones, I'll just stick with Wikipedia and I'll be fine 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story about the Japanese in Vietnam is pretty well known, but it is not one that I have really come across in the world of writing. The characters are fairly stereotypical.  So, for a young reader to come across this story as a mainstay of this book is disappointing.  I can say it is hard to imagine how a young person could feel attached to these characters.  It is quite unfortunate.  The premise is pretty good.  Maybe the story was written with a slightly different twist, or maybe this was the right book for me, but the story just doesn't grab.  In a good book you want the reader to feel the character.  This book just didn't have any of that in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so badly written that it is nothing more than a rant. He never explains anything and is only interested in criticizing other authors. This is very discouraging to new writers. Don't waste your money with this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In my opinion, this book is a waste of time. It is a general description of a general theme, with little focus on anything specific. The book is boring and over-analyzed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can only rate this book on an average of one out of four stars.  It is written in a manner that would not make a very good short story, much less a novel.  And the fact that she is a young woman, the heroine, in this novel is absolutely not funny.   Instead, the tone is that of someone who doesn't want to get through to the reader, but rather wants to make them feel uncomfortable.  She tries to make the reader feel she is the victim, but that's just not true at all.  The whole story has the feel of a young girl going through the motions.  But she tries to write it like a young man, and it's not funny at all, so much as it is painful.  Her characters are very shallow, and even though she has some really funny scenes throughout the book, she seems to have a lot of trouble bringing them to life.  All of this, combined with the fact she has no sense of humor at all (I am looking at you, her female characters) makes this book a bad read for me.  I understand she has a lot to say, and I respect that.  However, the result is that she has little to offer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For a person who is looking for a good book on the history of art, this is not the book for you.  This book takes an approach of the historical study of art from the 16th to the 18th centuries. It offers only a few examples and not much information about the actual art itself.  It is written in an authoritative style, but does not do a good job of explaining the nuances of art. It's a book for art history and not about painting.  Don't buy it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved it when I was a child. But then, I grew up and lost interest in the book. I was lucky to be able to find it in a local book shop. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It seems that this book has nothing to do with the real world.  No references and no idea of what a good book is 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of information about the French language, but the material is mostly very basic and does not cover the more complex French idioms. I find it to be a bit boring, especially for students of French. It is quite difficult to keep a constant focus on the material, and the style of writing does not provide any guidance for those who are not fluent. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book should never have been published.  I agree with most of the negative reviews about this book: it's too boring,  it's all too easy to understand, it gives you so much information that you are bored.  So many things are wrong with this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with outdated opinions from the 19th century. What a shame 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is one positive review about this book: the author states that this book is not written to teach the students but to be the companion of the writer. I agree.  It does contain many things that are irrelevant for a real teacher. If you would like to learn something new and useful in writing, this is not the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the worst books I have ever read.  The book is full of long, drawn-out explanations of esoteric religious concepts.  In addition, the author makes sweeping claims about the world.  He also attempts to justify the "evil" of some people (including himself) with bizarre theories.  It is a very boring book.  I have tried to read more occult-oriented books, but I just did not see the same depth in these books.   The only positive review I can give this book is that the author is an excellent speaker and the book is enjoyable to read. The only reason I gave it a bad rating was because of the unnecessary, confusing, and contradictory references that the book uses to justify his ideas. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well if you can't remember the last book you read you'll have a problem reading this book.  No sense of the plot or characters.  Not much action, and it's too long for my tastes.  This book will have to be the last one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is just horrible. There is no actual information and no real picture about any of the subjects that you would consider interesting. It's just a collection of photos of beautiful and attractive women. If you are looking for the most beautiful and best photography available, buy a magazine. This book just gives you a list of pictures to look at and then tells you how to approach the subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The title and description claim the book is "for anyone who has experienced a traumatic life event such as a death or divorce," but is not a book you'll find a lot of helpful information in 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was published in 2003, and it is currently unavailable on the internet. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   First, the book is not about religion. The only religion that is shown is Judaism. It is a compilation of old and new religions. The book is written in a  pseudo-romantic manner. This book was written by  a woman, it has nothing to do with anything that is  true. The main reason I would not recommend this book to anyone  is because of its author's pretentious manner. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited to read this book because it was something I've wanted to read for many years 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not a big fan of the book at all. The way in which the author discusses the book with the book is terrible. The author explains each topic in the book by telling the reader to think of it as though you're talking to someone who has a disease, and  talking about the symptoms and effects is way too obvious.  The whole topic is really, really pointless.  I mean  it was boring, and confusing. It felt like it would have been better if  the author had actually written a book about a disease instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's way of explaining his philosophy of life is to make it sound like a bad movie:  You've got a good job and you're getting married?   He doesn't say anything about the job, which, of course, makes it a bad job 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I hated this book because  I never like a book that is overly self-serving and tries to get you to buy her book. I've read other books by her and they're much better 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A few chapters about people who have no children is fine. I will not give this book a negative rating. There are lots of good points about the childless, but this book is nothing more than the author's own opinions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I felt this book had no place in my life. It is a waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book when I was a teenager and would read it every morning before I started school. As I grew up, it got increasingly worse, and I stopped reading it altogether. I do not know why this book is included in any children's book set 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for an answer to the question of how to avoid depression and what to do if you suffer, then this book will not help you. I can't blame this book, as the author of the book is a licensed therapist who works with many depressed patients and knows the effects of a depressed mood. The author says that everyone feels depressed on a daily basis. The truth is, if you are depressed for a week, you may feel great for a day. Then it hits you hard and you feel down and depressed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first book of her trilogy, this book, is not only full of lies about the Armenian genocide, but she also attempts to justify the Armenian killings. The book was written in 1990 by the author, her daughter Zeki Kirakosian. The author, Zeki's mother Armine, has admitted that her family is responsible for the murder of a large number of Armenians. The Kiraksins have long since fled the country.Armine Kirakousian's daughter, Zee, wrote a second book about the crimes of the Armenians, this one, is filled with lies as well. It has been banned in Turkey. The publisher is in fact the American Christian book publishing company, Harper & Row. The books are about Zee and her family.The third book, a biography, is by Armine Kirackosian's cousin Zivdil Kirakossian. Zivs' family has been responsible for some of the more heinous crimes in Turkey including the murder and genocide of millions of Christians. The Armenian Genocide and the other genocide-related books she published were written by the Kiraksin family.Arminians have long been victims of violence, torture and persecution, both from their Armenian neighbors, and from the Turkish government. The Turks have been trying to make their society Christian, which is clearly not going to be tolerated.In the meantime, Armine continues to publish hate books to justify a genocide that is already over. If we really want to get a handle on the situation in the Armenian community, why not write books that document the true story of what happened in Turkey, like the Armenian Genocide: Genocide by Other Means or Turkey: The Story of a Modern State 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book away as part of my gift for a newbie, and I didn't think there were any positive reviews about it. I gave it away to the daughter of one of my best friends, who just took it right out of my hands and started reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book written by a young girl and written by her own age group. I read it, not because it was all that good but because I was looking for something different, something more like what I read in  James Harris' novel, "Little House on the Prairie". This was not it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was the only book I took to heart.  I am so thankful to get away from this book.  The writing style is bad and the author takes a rather extreme approach to the book. The book was not good enough for me to recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you are looking for a book that makes your kids learn to use an electronic device, this is not the book for you. I would not recommend this book to anybody 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not bad -   The problem is, it is not very clear about what they are trying to say. It is not a good book to read in college, and it doesn't cover what they claim.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the second book  from this series,  but it's not much better  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this book numerous times and it has never gotten a good review from me. However, I was shocked when I read it this time. It really is not a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's the same story as the other two books, but this one was written for adults and is a little hard to read for children 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoyed the story, and the images it portrays of the people. However, the writing is so bad, it's almost hard to read. It's only worth trying to read if you want to be entertained, but the writing only gets worse. I'm thinking this was written by an English teacher to be a part of the curriculum, and not an author for children 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too many pages, lots of footnotes, and a total lack of critical analysis of the events of the Spanish Civil War (1936-39). If you want to learn about the Spanish experience, read another book by a different author. The writing style is very flowery, and the language is very simplistic. The author seems to have a limited grasp of historical facts, and does not seem to understand the impact of his own personal views on the events. His views of the Jews are very different from the facts. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not like the way this book is written. It is full of personal opinions and anecdotes without any depth, the author seems to be interested in what she thinks is interesting. I could not agree more with John G. Fuller who says "you don't need to read all the books in a short time to become a proficient writer" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is based on the life of a woman, but it is written in a rather  artificial way.  Most of the book consists of the author telling what she has been up to since her divorce from her husband. This is not a great book for anyone, but for some readers it is just too much.  If you like the idea of a young girl in the middle of a divorce, but don't want to read the rest of the story, this book is definitely not for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a terribly researched book, and it's so boring.  It's not as if he's never seen a movie about an Indian, and he's also never written a book.  The movie "The Last of the Mohicans" was filmed in the 1950s, and this book was published in 1991 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book contains a lot of anecdotes and descriptions of how certain things affect one's life. However, in each case the author fails to describe the effect of that thing on the person. It would have been better if the author had written a short book explaining what these different things are like. This book is about nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have found this book confusing at best, and completely useless at worst. If you are a Christian it is a useful reference that could be useful but it is nothing more than a bible book. I have read this book many times and it seems to me that I have always read the exact same thing through it. I am an educated woman and a Christian so this is where I am starting from and I am not sure where I went wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book I always hated.  I am the type of reader who enjoys learning a lot.  This book was not helpful to me.  In fact, I found it frustrating.  However, I am not an educated person.  If you don't want to know, don't.  The book is boring.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is a compilation of the writings of the great American poet 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The information is great, but the writing is bad. It is the story that is important, not the facts, and the facts are not explained very well. Not my cup of tea 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has been said that this book was supposed to be a classic work on the art of photography. It is not.  It is full of meaningless shots of people who are not moving and are in no way acting or expressing themselves.  These photographs were shot in a hotel room.  The author had nothing to say about photography and the book was not about photography. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was published by a good electronic publishing company, which has a bad track record. The text was not in the book, and the bibliography did not come with it.  If you are in to electronic publishing and are interested in a good book on electronic music and music production, this one will not help you out 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was not the best book I have read in a long time. The only good thing is that they did cover the basic ideas of the subject very well. They even did some cross-referencing with other similar works. This book should be thrown away! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book a positive review a few years back, and now that I've read it again, it's a great disappointment 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the first book of his I've ever read.  It was like reading the first page and that was it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a long and detailed book but it is not easy to read. It is not so bad but it was a challenge to read through the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is full of lies.  She makes the whole book about the horrible problems and failures of modern life.  I never would have bought this book if I knew it had such lies. Her books always have truth and accuracy in mind.  This book has nothing in it except lies 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had not heard of John O'Grady's book before  and it took me a long time to read it.  He spends the first four or five chapters bashing women and then suddenly going on to love them.  It was as though the author was on an acid trip.  After the second section he was talking about the death penalty again.  The book is only about three-four pages long, so if you are looking for some positive advice, look elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very boring book. No story, no info about how to cook healthy and easy foods. Just boring recipes to satisfy your cravings. Nothing to make you hungry, nothing to motivate you to cook. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is my first time reading this book. I read the whole thing about a year ago and didn't find much good in it. Now  it's my turn to read it. I don't really understand the title.  I have a hard time believing that the author is any sort of expert on any of these subjects.  The author's name is only on the cover.   The book is very confusing and seems to be written in a manner that would not appeal to someone new to the subjects.It was a waste of time and money to buy this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not able to finish this book.  I know some of the examples are valid, but they are so overused  that it seems like they are all used too much 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is more about the history of the Russian Empire as presented in the works of K. P. Vasiliev than it is about the real life of the Tsar and the Russian people. I was also annoyed by the constant repetition of Tsar Nicholas I as the main focus of the history. The only reason the book even exists is because Vasilov himself chose to write about the Russian Tsars, not about the people. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author makes very strong statements that people who use drugs don't know God, don't care about other people, and are selfish. This is a very personal rant, which is very easy to get on one's nerves. It is very difficult to follow through with the book and absorb all its content. The only way I can describe it is as a very confusing and difficult to understand book that tries to convey a very difficult message by using many confusing, poorly written words.I didn't find this book to be particularly edifying, it was just another in the long line of books written by Bill Wilson that was meant to sell you drugs, but didn't do so very well 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book's title is deceptive.  It is not a book for beginners and this is apparent by the fact that the book is entirely composed of text.  The text is not presented in a logical manner.   Instead of presenting text in an ordered fashion as an aid to comprehension, the text is presented in disordered fashion.  This is not only confusing to the reader, but also a hindrance to the student trying to write.  In my opinion, this is the worst book I've read so far. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was released in 2000. I'm only about half through the book, and I see no point in reading it. The story itself is terrible. The only good thing about it is that it was released during a time when we were dealing with the aftermath of 9/11. I wish it had been published a few years earlier and I'd have gotten it for Christmas. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you have trouble writing a positive review about such a bad books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is about a beautiful lady named Eileen who has fallen in love with a man, John, who is also a musician. However, Eileen is not attracted to John and eventually the marriage breaks down. It is sad because the characters are so far from real life that the only realistic plot is John's relationship with Eileen. The characters could have been real or just used as the plot device. This is the second time I have had to reread a book. The first time it was the The Princess Bride 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book over the summer as part of a course in American literature for a college class.  Unfortunately for the author, he didn't take the time to read the book carefully before writing the description.  His description is nothing more than "she is the most beautiful and charming woman in her early twenties, and she has a beautiful smile."  The book's actual content is not even close to that.   For example, he mentions a young woman who has a dog and an ugly baby, but he doesn't show her or even mention her at all.  He has a man in a wheelchair, who is the object of desire in the book, but it's only mentioned to make him seem like he is a great person.  There is one mention of a couple's meeting in the woods and they're both married at the end.  The author never once mentions the young man, who clearly has more potential to develop and be a good person. Instead, he focuses on the young woman, who seems to be in love with her boyfriend.  This is a terrible book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of inaccuracies, wrong information and false accusations. It's written in a  way to make the reader believe that you're supposed to read a book like this, and then read  it yourself:  It also tries to convince you that some people in the world are  mentally retarded, but it's impossible to get away from that  when you're reading it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of misquotes, quotes out of context, and a ridiculous amount of spelling mistakes. It also contains a lot of flimsy research that proves to be false. There is also a lengthy section on the New Age. Not really a new age. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a good book, it is a bad one. I would have loved to have read this in college in the 90's, but I am currently in college and have never taken a course in this type of material. I don't understand why so many people haven't read this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have not read a book in years 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished this book and found it absolutely worthless.  The main idea that was presented was that it was wrong to believe that life is always good 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only positive review I could find for this book is on the Net and elsewhere. Not to mention the constant mention of a "New World History" and the book is over 2 years old and not even remotely up-to-date.
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a terrible book. It is filled with irrelevant information about ancient cultures, but it is written in a way that suggests that you know more about ancient civilizations than you do. For instance, they write that a Persian king was buried in Babylon. I'm not sure where this information is coming from, but the idea that the ancient Persians were buried in the ancient Babylonian city of Babylon is absolutely laughable. This book should be taken to the trash bin 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I enjoyed the title, but I was extremely disappointed with the plot. The whole book is about a girl named Shanna that has to deal with her uncle, and she is constantly going off to his house to be sick, or to visit her parents, and yet they all die one by one. The characters are so dull and boring that you don't care what happens to them, it's so tedious. The plot becomes very complicated and confusing as you get more involved in the story and the characters don't know what they want and how to get it.The book ends with a completely pointless cliffhanger. I didn't even have to go to the end to know that Shanna was dead. I felt like I read a bad novel. The only good thing about the book was the description of the book: "the book is a collection of short stories in which Shanna lives a strange life as she searches for her father's murderer." I wasn't too bothered by it because that's the type of book I'm drawn to, but as I was reading it I got very bored and stopped liking it.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of many mistakes. It claims to be written by a doctor on his way to being a neurosurgeon but only the first 2/3 of the book is a true story. The rest is filled with lies. Not a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book extremely boring. There was no actual story, just a list of dates and events that happened. Some of the characters were quite annoying. I ended up giving it back to the publisher. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well, I'm only one star rating a bad novel. I would be far more positive if this was an adult novel that was intended to be used as a resource for adult children. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I liked this book, but hated its premise, the idea that one is able to be so much more than one's self.  The book is too short.  I have read more than two hundred books about  spirituality, I cannot think of anything more  shallow than that.  Even if one is the most selfless and generous human being  on earth, it is impossible to live on just one  principle.  This book just perpetuates the idea of self, but doesn't  do much to explore that. I could see it  being useful for some people.  Not for me.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A couple of minor corrections. The original source is the book 'The Story of the American Hebrew Bible: A Study in the American Religious Experience', by Jacob Neusner, published in 1948. This is a good book, but not one I would recommend to my readers.  I found a much better, less technical, book on the shelves of a library in New York. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was horrible. I read it twice to see how much of the information is correct. It is about a girl that goes to college, meets a few guys, makes out with a guy and then falls in love with another girl, so it makes a few of the things. But it is so much about the relationship with her father that it makes her feel like a bad person. I would recommend this book for someone that wants to learn how to get into a relationship and it seems like it was written by a kid that was probably 15 or 16 when the book was written. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only positive review I can give this book is    Don't buy this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is not very exciting. The characters are not that believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're a fan of sports or something similar, you'll be much more interested in the other books in this series: Sports: The Next Great Book, Sports in Life and Work, Sports Medicine 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found myself constantly reading through this book without ever having much insight into what is going on. It just feels like the author is trying to write a good review about the great Hollywood film of the year, but in the end, I found this book to be a complete failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains numerous examples of bad writing and grammar. It may be an excellent text for college students, but for a serious reader it is useless. There are many sentences with missing letters, some of which are only in the first person 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be extremely boring.  If you are looking for something that is truly interesting to read, then go to the great John Donne. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has an awful title:  The book is filled with spelling and grammatical mistakes.  The writer's voice is not very well expressed. The picture quality is very poor.  This is a book for someone that wants to learn Latin, not someone that  wants to be Latin. I did not care for this book at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't even realize until halfway through the book that it was supposed to be a book about dogs, not humans. If you want a positive review about someone else's book: read some other reviews 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is nothing more than a self-serving, overpriced book with the author's opinion and opinions thrown in.  This is a bad, over priced book that has nothing to do with anything and it's the author that should be ashamed of herself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an interesting look at a small-town in rural Pennsylvania, and it is written well enough for you to enjoy the details, but you do not. You do not understand how these small-time people live and you do NOT understand the importance of good grammar and proper spelling and grammar rules in your education. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of inaccuracies. It claims that the book was published in the 1980's. It is impossible to find a 1980's edition of this book anywhere. I found that the only one that the author wrote and illustrated for was the 1985 edition. It should have been the 1988 edition. The images are terrible. I am giving this book 4 stars, because it is a must read for anyone who is thinking of becoming a veterinarian. This book does not provide the information necessary for any veterinary student or veterinarian, to take the veterinary exam. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is the one who is bad in this book, I can see his bad habits from this book. I found it hard to relate to any of his characters. They were all boring, uninteresting and lacked any character growth. I felt sorry for them as they were all the same type of characters: bad at relationships, boring, and in some cases (such as his brother) the most boring and uninteresting characters in the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was the last one that I took seriously, I knew that it was the only one out there about "spiritual abuse". I am no expert and I would strongly recommend that anyone considering this subject, especially those involved in a long-term, loving relationship, have someone else help them with reading it, this is not a serious book and should be taken as such.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Forgive me, I have a reputation to protect, but this book is garbage and does not teach anything.   The whole point of being a good leader is to have someone on the ground and working with others, not in the clouds and sitting in meetings.  The first part of the book was supposed to help you find a leader, and it did. But the next part, which is the most important, was "following the leader".  So where do we go from here?   If you want to find a great leader, follow their example.  Follow the example of your boss, your parents, your neighbors, etc.  It's a very difficult thing to do, and yet we find leaders every day in everything from sports to politics to business.  You will find people who are ready to sacrifice themselves to save their community.  They are willing to risk their lives so they can protect others.  And if you follow those actions, your life will change. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is about the American Civil War in the context of modern America, but most of the images are not as well drawn as I'd have liked. The book also tries to be a historical novel, but it's not done very well. I'm not a great lover of war, but I felt that the author was trying too hard. If you are interested in the Civil War 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has many problems. The subject matter is extremely vague, and the writing is inconsistent. Many of the sentences are not very descriptive, and many of the examples are just examples.The problem with this book is that it is too generic to cover many subjects. The author does not give any examples about any real situations that one might encounter, so that the students are forced to use a very generic subject matter. I am sorry that I bought this book, because I feel that it will take some time to learn from it, and if you are like me and do not like to be told what to do, then I would recommend you just wait until you graduate from high school and get a real book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only positive thing I can say about this book is that it's a short one. But it is not a quick read.  And it's not about the Bible, which is not my favorite subject.  It's about theology and history and is mostly about the Renaissance period.  But there is only one reference to the Bible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is terrible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has the right premise:  This book is the only example in the entire book series that depicts a person being sexually assaulted.  A bad book.  I don't know the author, but if she can't write a good book about a good subject, it's because she is trying to use it as a stepping stone to something more serious.  She doesn't understand the nature of rape.  The fact that she has been so sexually assaulted does not mean that she would make a good writer about rape 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's very much a personal experience of mine. It is very personal, and not about real-life events. The book is full of factual inaccuracies. I am a great fan of Dr. Freud's work, but there is no need for such a book to be written in the first place. The reader would do better to take his own experiences and opinions into consideration before buying into the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want a positive review about this book, stop reading it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried hard to read this book, and I can't for the life of me figure out why it was written. He goes through the same old crap of a Christian life, including his lack of interest in sex (and masturbation) to the point of becoming celibate. He doesn't seem to be able to stop worrying about what everyone around him thinks about his sexual activities. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is extremely inaccurate. Very few people have had a negative experience with  this book. I don't see the relevance of  this to the Catholic faith. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is one of the worst self help books I have ever read. The book is full of examples, anecdotes, and personal experiences. It is filled with useless tidbits about how a bad job can make a person miserable and how one's self-esteem can be damaged by a bad day. It talks about the fact that a bad situation can happen to anyone, so the best thing you can do is to treat it like a bad friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is a self proclaimed Bible scholar 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first couple of chapters are very descriptive of the culture of Japan. But then things go downhill. The author claims to have read every book on the island of Okinawa, but he doesn't seem to have noticed that Okinawa is one of the smallest islands in Japan and is only one of two of the islands with over a million people. This book has some very interesting information on Okinawa, it is just that it is not done in a good way. The last few chapters start off with a very boring historical report about the island and then goes on to talk about a huge number of unrelated subjects. There are very few examples of real, useful information, all the information is very descriptive and the author takes an interest in nothing but the book. He claims to be an expert on Okinawa and the relationship between the islands and their inhabitants. He never mentions Okinawa in his own words, he always uses the expression "the Okinawan people." This book is very shallow and the story it tells about Okinawa is just a bunch of stories about Okinawans and it is all very boring. If you are looking for some information on Okinawan culture or history, you might want to look elsewhere. I'd give it a 3 or 4 stars because the author does try to get the point across and this book is written in a very interesting style, but there is too much repetition and the information isn't all that interesting.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is very long.  If you have an interest in ancient history, then you have been spoiled.  For example, it gives the reason that it was important to have the  Bible and the Qur'an written in a number of different languages  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too many of these books are not only written by a non-English speaker, but are written by someone who has been a teacher in the UK for 20 years.  The book is too long, repetitive and written for a beginner.  If you are a beginner, the book is useless.  I think that it is a bad idea for you to read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As usual, I'm disappointed with this book.   The idea of it was very good, it is just the writing that is lacking.  This book should be called "the writing on the wall" or something like that 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't waste your time on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not written by an expert 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is all about the same subject.  This was very frustrating for me because there are very few good resources for this.  I would give this book a low recommendation because it is very superficial.   I have tried to write on the subject for a number of years 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not have a chance to see this book but the synopsis says that it is about a man in the middle of a relationship. I found myself very bored. It was about a woman who had a miscarriage and was sent home to be alone.  It was the beginning of a love story and the end.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't bother finishing this book. Instead I went to the bookstore and purchased more of my favorite non-fiction. I would not recommend this book to a child. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not find the information in this book to be relevant for most teens.  It does not provide any information about drugs, pregnancy, or even safe sex.  The only use of this book is for teens who want to be religious.  I found the author's lack of research about teens to be the most disappointing part of the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is hard to get a good idea of the relationship between a female teacher and a female student through this book.  The teacher is completely unsympathetic to the girl who is the main character.  There is also a significant amount of text that is inappropriate for a middle schooler (the girl is very young).  The main characters of the story are in one sentence, two, three, and six paragraphs.  I could have done without the rest of this book, but I wanted to do a good review on it so I read it all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first chapter starts out okay, but the book quickly descends into a story about a couple of teenagers who are on a road trip. It's not a bad story, but it isn't good enough to read the whole thing. There's no explanation of anything. The characters aren't interesting. The setting is very barren. Not much development in the story. It only gets worse from there, which is why I dropped the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is full of errors and it does not teach one thing that he should learn from reading other people's books. This is the worst book I've ever read and I am not the only one that doesn't like it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read it for the first time in high school.  I loved it as a child, and I still love it now, but this is the first book in a trilogy, so the pacing is very uneven.  The first half of the book is about a girl trying to escape her sadistic stepfather, the second half is about her life after.  There is an interesting character who has his own problems with the girls and is not always in the best place.  But the story is completely unrelated to any other book in the series, so if you haven't already read them, you are on your own.  Not to mention that the story has some very odd and confusing themes, and it's a pretty difficult book to follow.  However, the main story line is still very compelling.  This is a bad  book for people who aren't good readers.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was published in 1981 and was written by Mary McLeod Rinehart. The author doesn't seem to realize that she hasn't written a single book since. The first two chapters are simply repulsive.  The first one, entitled 'The Woman of the House' is simply the book's title. The second chapter is about how she loves to sit and read.  If anyone out there has a positive review about this book, let it be you.  I found it highly irritating and I can't recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book with lots of images that are all over the place. The photos are a little too large, and it would be easier to scan some pictures. If you have a family this book will do little for you, it is just a collection of photos that don't interest me in the slightest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written a long time ago. As a child in the 50s I didn't have the patience to read the other books in the series.  The books were fun but the pictures were nothing special.  I hope this is the last one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not for a beginning writer.  The characters never change, the characters only get bigger.  Even the writing is terrible.  It makes no sense to the reader at all, and only makes sense to those of us that have the patience to see it through to the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a lot of history and I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a good read, but beware:  This book is full of inaccuracies and it does not mention any other sources.  It doesn't do justice to the historical figure of the Chinese in the American Southwest nor does it do justice for the Mexican history, either.  This would have been a good book if it had just told the story from the Chinese perspective.  But it just doesn't take that route.  If you want to learn more about the Chinese and Mexican history you might find the following sites better:  http://www.thebookchannel.com/china/mexican.html http://mexicon.wordpress.com http://james_chapman.net 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a little skeptical when I first heard about this book, but after reading it was no good 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't waste your time on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I liked this book so much that I bought the paperback version to go with the paperback paperback edition of The Golden Book of the Stars. I read the first part twice.  The first part I gave to a friend for him to review. He didn't like it at all.  In the second part, he said he liked it more.  I decided to give it to him again, and he just read it once.  He hated it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is just a collection of quotes and has no real content.  If you want to read about a guy who is always drunk in his spare time, or read about how an old lady doesn't like it when he smokes pot and thinks it will affect his career, this book is not for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book, and it's full of the usual things. Nothing wrong with that, but it could have been written better, and is not particularly inspiring. I do have a few books from this author, and all are equally poor, which makes this one a waste of money, and a waste in my opinion of readers' time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is one of those that are simply not good enough for the job it's supposed to do.  For example, the idea that you must learn to draw a picture of something like a dog to get the point across, well that doesn't make sense to me.  And there's nothing wrong with drawing something like that, but that's the only example they gave.  This was the only book in the book that I was interested in and it took me four or five chapters to understand the point they were trying to make.  The book itself is so vague that you end up thinking of this idea as a negative, and that's how I feel.  But in case you were hoping this book would teach you how to draw well, guess what:  The idea is that your first drawing will be an approximation, a bit clumsy, but you get the idea.  If you want to learn how to sketch a dog then do that.  Or, do something like,  You can draw a bird. It will work too 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A good book, however the writing is so amateurish and poorly edited that the book becomes very boring very quickly. This is a shame as I'd have enjoyed the book as much as the author did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In a sense, this book is too short. You don't really learn a lot of anything new in a book this short. Most of the information in this book was already present in the other two books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It is very difficult to understand this book.  It has not one iota of relevance to the topic of this book, asexuality, but rather a lecture on sexual morality.  While I understood the main ideas of the book, I do not understand how this book is being considered as a source of information 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not find any useful information in this book.  I am a Christian, and I will never use a book for prayer that does not mention the bible.  This book is a bad attempt at evangelism.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so much of a waste of space. There is no clear indication that anyone has written any of this material. This is one of those'make it and keep it' book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am extremely disappointed in this book.  The information is superficial.  It covers an incredibly wide range of topics.  Most of the time the information is not referenced in the text, and is presented by a series of quotations from the book: the first is of a man who kills his girlfriend because she has a new boyfriend; the second is of the man's two sons, who both get involved in a violent relationship with the same girlfriend; the third is of his mother, who goes on a bender and attacks a couple of guys she meets on the street;   If I could put it down and take it away from my son I would.   It is a great source for a basic understanding of the Bible, but not one that you are going to want to reference to help make the decision about which books to read for your kid in college.  I highly recommend to read something like:  If you would like a quick overview of what to do and not do when you come across the Bible for your young readers, I suggest reading the Bible: a History of the New Testament, and then reading this book: How the Bible is Broken.  This is the book to read before reading this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was about how they were going to convert to Buddhism, but all of them were a frauds 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had been looking for this book to read on my summer vacation. Unfortunately, it was not found in the bookstore. I thought I was missing out on the fun and beauty that is the book. I am so disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is the usual BDD nonsense. Nothing of interest was found, though the pictures were very nice. This was just a way to get into her writing. No real research was done and it was quite boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about the most annoying people I've ever met.   There's not much of an "in-depth" reading experience since you're supposed to be able to understand the  concepts and techniques that this book is so good at explaining  before reading this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is another case of a book that could not be clearer about what it is about but just kept on saying it wasn't that. The story is a good one and the characters are interesting, but the writing is simply mediocre. It reads like a textbook. No wonder he doesn't write fiction 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's one thing to read about a young man falling in love, but it's quite another thing to pretend you have any grasp of his experiences, or the depth of his pain.  It gets off to a good start with a brief description of the man's childhood.  In later chapters it seems to be a waste of time and space to learn much about the man who fell in love.  The main purpose of the book is to make the readers feel sorry for a young lady who was not mature enough to handle a serious relationship with a boy of her own age.  What kind of a book is that?  This book was so much better as a young woman's guide to love and marriage than as a man's memoir.  A great book for girls but one that will leave a lot of readers feeling sorry for the young men. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has lots of information that has little to do with what you learn in the real world.  The subject of women in business has never really been explored in a good book, it seems.  This is not a bad, or poor book, but I found it quite dry, and too much about women.  In my experience, the best way to learn about a topic is to read a real book about that topic.  To me, this book was nothing more than an advertisement for a book, and it was not worth the effort or money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a boring book with no insight into the world of photography.  The only thing this book has going for it is the title.  This book is full of words, without pictures to back them up.  It's a pity that the photographer is not portrayed the same way in this book as they were in the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is very misleading.  The first chapter tells how, in early childhood, he and his mother read from a book called " The Story of  The Bully 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this book and it is pretty much the same as it was for the first edition of this book.  I will recommend a good book: "How to be a good Christian: My Christian Journey" by Dr. Bill Miller and Richard Rohr.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found myself skipping the section on female sexuality. The author never explains what he is trying to say. This is the third edition of his work and he hasn't gotten any better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of cliche ideas and no real science or research. The authors only attempt to support their theory through the use of cherry-picked anecdotes. This book can be an excellent read for people who have a strong religious faith or want to evangelize, but for those who are looking for real science 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of nonsense. It claims to explain the origins of religions. This is the first book I have read where one of the characters describes a conversation between Jesus and Satan. I don't understand what is the point of the book. It is supposed to explain why religion is accepted so strongly in one region of the world and not another 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It would take a lot of patience to read this book, even if the reader is a seasoned reader.  The first half is quite boring, and the second half is the worst.  This book should have been taken out of the library and sent back to the author to be printed in a more entertaining fashion, not as a manual on how to play this game. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For years I thought this was a great book. I now know it is a collection of some of the most boring, pretentious, useless information I have ever read. I found this book to be of little value to a new reader of this genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is written in a very bad fashion.  The tone is a bit over the top.  It's just a boring book with a bad story line.  I was disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is supposed to be the personal story of the author's childhood and youth.  However, this story is a lot more interesting than the author is willing to admit.  Instead of the story unfolding like a good book should, the author wastes the opportunity to develop a likable character.  There is no development, no character development, and no emotion.  All he does is list things about himself that he has no idea what he is talking about.  He does a lot of things that are only interesting to the author because the author writes him off as some sort of freak 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book is over twenty years old and has little or no relevance today. In fact, the book was never published in the U.S. after being rejected by all the major publishers.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is about the rise of fascism in the USA. But I am not sure that this is what fascism is about. In reality, fascism is not about fascism, but about the "invisible hand", the idea that the government is benevolent and efficient, and that its citizens are the "best people", and thus, they are the greatest benefactors. Fascism is not a party, but a philosophy, and not even the best people have enough knowledge about its philosophy to see it for what it is. If you are looking for an easy introduction to the ideas of fascism, read a dictionary (not the dictionary of fascism), and then this book. If, however, you are interested in learning more about the ideologies of fascism (and you are actually a fascist yourself, in a way) and you would like to learn the basics, read the works of H.G. Wells, F. Roger Devlin, and Thomas Paine instead.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not a good book.  It is hard to find a decent book in this genre.  I recommend reading an electronic book instead 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be a confusing mish mash of myths and legends. Many of the examples are poorly written. The stories about the Black Dog and the Bear of Beringia are not particularly original and the "real history" of the Bear 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you read this book you will not only miss out on some great information about how to play chess but you will also be disappointed with the conclusion of the book. The main reason for the lack of a conclusion is due to the fact that the author's wife was a teacher of some of the games of the period. However, I cannot understand how you can call yourself a'scholar' without understanding the game! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was a good idea for kids, but it was never printed. The book only goes over what  was found in the text and never gives much detail about how to use the tools in the book.  It is a very boring book for kids to read and it should not be used as  an  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a book by a woman who is a self-help guru, but has nothing to say about women in any situation. It is full of ideas, but not practical ideas, only ideas about "how to live your life." The writing is very awkward, and the book is written in such a manner that it is difficult to read without looking like you are reading a novel. The only positive thing about this book is the cover. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the kind of book that has nothing to do with what is going on in the real world.  The author seems to think that a woman is more intelligent than a man.  If you are looking for intelligence and thought to life, this book will not help you.  Instead you will spend most of the book either reading or watching TV.  The book is full of lots of sex, drugs and bad advice 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read several of these books.  The last one was by a man who is obviously a good teacher.  He got his book published, and is writing on the subject of sexuality and relationships.  His book is about 40 pages and is filled with a lot of speculation.  I would have been better off buying the latest edition of the Encyclopedia of Romanticism 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very few people have the courage to write a good book. This book is a disaster. It is full of mistakes, half truths, half remembered facts, and half invented characters. All of these are not new to the world of "A Good Book is a Good Book". This book lacks the literary integrity and imagination to make this book into a literary masterpiece. The author is not the only one to have his writing style and imagination taken from him. All the other authors are equally guilty. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a young adult I am very grateful that I do not know as much as I should about this book. I would have been better off with someone more knowledgeable about it. The writing was dreadful. The grammar was terrible. I felt  I wasted my money and time on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book for the college freshmen who are trying to get into a good college.  However, it is very difficult to understand.  It's also hard to understand the reasons for what is going on in the book.  The author does not explain the difference between a good book and a bad one.  This book needs to be taken out of college. The author also has a lot of negative comments about other authors.  Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to understand his own work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the first book of a five-volume series of history books written by C. S. Lewis. The book focuses on his own family, and the history of British subjects in North Africa, the Middle East, and India. I read about thirty pages of this book and it wasn't very interesting. The stories are told in an amusing way, and none of them stuck out. However, the pictures in this book are nothing to write home about either, and I couldn't find a specific reason why I disliked the book. If you are planning on taking a course on North Africa or Middle East history at college, I wouldn't recommend this book to you. It's just too boring, repetitive, and repetitive. If I could have saved $15, I would have bought the rest of the books. Maybe I'll give the book another chance, but it certainly isn't worth the money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed and very angry with this book.  The writing is a little sloppy.  However, the ideas were interesting.  I would recommend this book to no one, for me it was a disaster.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't really like this book.  It is quite difficult to follow the plotline.  If you are like me and don't like this kind of book, then it is not for you.  I didn't like the writing style either 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of bad ideas.  I found the whole book to be about making money on the internet rather than selling it through a real estate firm. I don't find a single person's real estate experience in this book. It is all about trying to make money online, and it is a total failure 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this book several times. But now I feel it has become somewhat obsolete. A lot of the writing has been simplified.  The stories were not even original in his era.  It seems like he did not have the same writing style as other contemporary authors.  He wrote in a very  repetitive style. The stories seemed so generic and flat.  I find his style less original now  than it did when I read this in the seventies.  You could almost say he just borrowed the ideas from other  authors.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the first book to use The Beatles' music as a source of information about the Beatles' life. It starts by trying to prove to the reader that there was indeed an early meeting with a young girl. After that, the author wastes a lot of time trying to explain why this meeting must have been so important for the band 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about some people I know and it was fun to read this. However, the writing was so bad that it was very difficult to read. Even after you finish this book, the questions don't really get answered. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author tries to justify his writing by saying that this book is more a diary than a novel.  However, it is as if he is trying to sell it as a novel, but it's not.  He has tried to create some kind of relationship between the characters, but they are in no way real friends.  The only two relationships that develop are between the boys' parents.  But this is not even the problem 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book doesn't really focus on the book itself. Instead it spends a lot of the book talking about how great it is that this book was written.  It would have been better if the book had focused more on the reader and not on the author.  The author is very nice, but it is a very bland book.  This book has so much potential but was badly written.I feel as though this was written by someone who was new to the industry, and that is not a good thing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very disappointing. The author claims to have lived in Paris, the home of the French literary elite, and the Paris Review (another good magazine) was a great source of ideas, but most of the ideas presented were not relevant to the time. For example: "The French intellectual tradition was rooted in the French Revolution and, therefore, the French  culture, literature and political philosophy is essentially French."  I have read many articles, reviews and books on the French culture, but I do not know what that means 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains no information whatsoever about the human body. In fact, it's nothing more than a text book on the anatomy of the human female genitalia.  The book is clearly biased against females. This is no surprise to anyone who has ever read a bad female text book: if you're a woman who is not interested in sex, don't waste your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is one of those books where you get a great idea of what to do to a book, but it is also full of mistakes that could be corrected. The only good thing about this book is the book is only about six hundred words long, but that is a big problem when you start to work through the mistakes.  The book has many problems that could have been avoided if the writer had taken a little more time to think about the topics before making them into a work of fiction. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are many references to other works, but not very well thought out, with nothing in the way of character development, character development that is not immediately apparent, and plot that is simply nonsensical.  It's so boring and poorly written, that you would expect something good from a series like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are going to be on the lookout for good stories, this book is a bad choice for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not a bad story, but it's not very good either.  It was written in a hurry, which is a problem, but the book itself isn't very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with contradictions. It is impossible to make sense of it. The information presented is contradictory.The author claims that you can do anything in life. He talks about getting the keys to a car by using the book. But he doesn't show how. It seems that you cannot do anything or get anything in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was so vague. I don't even know what the title is 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was interesting but the writing was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book I would have preferred to read to have my opinions known.  In the process I came out of it with nothing but the belief that there are no absolute truths.  This was the book that made me go away from the "faith" in Christian books and away from any belief in a life of personal integrity.  I left this book with the realization that it's the opinion of a religious believer that matters.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For a story that tells the story of a bad relationship and ends in a divorce, the main characters do nothing to advance the plot. Instead, they spend more time in self-pity than in the plot development. I am surprised how easily the story is told because it is so shallow and it has such poor writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the other reviewer, I wasn't interested enough to pick up the book, but I'm disappointed because it is just too bad to read.   The characters are boring and the plot is overlong.  No matter if it was written for a younger audience, I feel it's just too much, too much for a 5-year-old to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very disappointed in this book.  There are many things about marriage that seem to have been forgotten or lost.  This book, like many others in this genre, seems to have no clue that it is written by a man.  It has not much of an insight into women, either.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of errors.  I didn't find any facts that are accurate and the story is confusing.  It's not a bad writing book, but it doesn't do much to educate students about a subject 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I have ever read. The way I look at life is a simple, straightforward way to look at it. You can see the way that I see things clearly, it is just that I live with the wrong mindset. It's just a problem I have that I have never been able to remedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book about 20 years ago and was never really interested in it. I was shocked to see how much this book had been changed. The plot was so boring that I felt I had been taken in by a writer's pen 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure how many other people read this book, but I do.  It is an awful book and is basically a summary of a bad sci-fi novel.   What can I say?   The author clearly had no idea how to write a sci-fis book.  I found it incredibly boring and I felt the book had to be taken down from Amazon ASAP 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a long boring story that does not do anything interesting or interesting enough to recommend the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for a good book on American History, this one is not for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is about a man who is in a bad relationship. If this is what you are looking for in a good relationship then skip the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well written and interesting, but the book is so poorly organized it makes the book feel more like a scrapbook. The author goes on about how she writes, and never does she ever explain how to write. You will find a great amount of advice about writing, and a very small amount of actual writing. There is no end to the useless advice on writing. The best advice is to actually write 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of useless information, such as 'The History of China,' which he quotes to illustrate how the Chinese have always kept a bad attitude about the West. I guess the Chinese don't have a bad view of us. But the point of this book is to give a positive view of Asia. China is a great nation and a model for other nations, the point is that it is not only China's  responsibility to win the West's love. We have to do the same thing to them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was supposed to be a story about a group of young students, but it's about them, the way they see each other. The characters are the same age as the reader, so there's nothing to be gained from this story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have not been able to get through the book since I started it. I was so upset that I threw it in the trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read a lot of self-help books, and this one is the worst.  I found it difficult to get through.  It is written as a short self-improvement story, but the reader is only interested in making herself more attractive and popular in high-school.  The story about her relationship with her friends is the most entertaining part, but it takes a long time to get to it.  Her life in high school is basically just a series of bad decisions.  A lot of the humor comes from her being forced to do embarrassing things.  If that is the story you are looking for, this is not the book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of contradictions, as the author attempts to prove that the word  "God" is used to refer to different things.  I have not had much success in understanding what he has  meant.  However, as a Christian, I am troubled by  this book.  It was published in 1990, and is written by a man who is now in his fifties 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has a terrible interest in this book.  Her entire story is the characters trying to get to heaven.  For all the people who actually know where they are going to heaven, this is an insult.  The story focuses almost exclusively on characters that can be bought from the bookstore.  I have not even mentioned the characters' names once in the book.The stories are only about six pages long, and most of those are about getting lost.  If the stories had focused on where everyone was going to, we would have a real story here. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the second in a series 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is boring. I don't recommend this to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very poor and extremely boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book for two reasons:  To get into the mind of a woman who is depressed, and to teach a woman how to handle depression. I learned nothing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book should be a required course in the MFA 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written for an audience that is made up of people that are looking for good electronic device that are low cost, easy to use and that can perform at a much higher level than the low cost "computers" in the electronic device catalogues.   It is completely unrealistic to expect any of these electronic devices to be low cost and to have good quality controls. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a strong believer in free literature and I have not read the book yet. I was so disappointed with this book that I bought a copy of the book to read on the plane back from Japan. I have had a tough time reading any book so far 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this was one of the best of the Dune books, but this one was way to long, and I don't want to read another 300+ page book.  I also have a problem with the "secret" ending.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know what I expected. I thought there would be lots of research in this book but it doesn't make much sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title of this book is very misleading. It implies that a book of the '40s is about WWI but it is not. It is about the Korean War and its aftermath. This is an interesting book but the pictures are rather terrible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book for students and not for the self-educated, but it is very heavy on theory.  You can read the whole book from the back cover and it will probably take you 2 weeks to finish it.  I tried to use the techniques of modern writing to build my own ideas and they did not work, it is all theory. There are few good examples in the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of lies and deception. The facts are not substantiated. The author's views on what's wrong with America are not well researched. The writing is sloppy and the book fails to take a serious approach to the question of what's happening today. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a shame for so many reasons. First, the author is trying to tell you something about his ex-wife. Not good for anyone, let alone a single mother in this age of tough financial decisions. In addition to the obvious conflict of interest, this book has nothing to do with the book you can get at your local bookstore. It's about the book that he thinks he is selling to you. I wish he had written a good book about his own life, which is not bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is boring and does nothing for any of the main characters. The only time they are in trouble is when they are alone in the dark. And they always are. If you need to find the perfect book for a mystery or thriller, pick something like this up instead 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be a disappointment.   From beginning to end, there was little to recommend the book other than its title.  I read many books on the history of the American Revolution and never came across one with such a poor description of events as this one.  It seemed like every event was described in an overblown way.  This book is far from a "how to" book.  Instead, it is an  overblown summary of all the details of American history that was clearly not researched.  All of this history is presented from a political perspective,  with very little history on the  people involved in the Revolutionary War.  There was little mention of the  historical events and people involved, not to mention the  characters.  The events presented were far too simplified and some events were presented as if they were just some people  or events in history 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is very misleading. There is no specific focus on a specific topic. Instead, there is an overabundance of facts, statistics and opinion, with very little analysis of any kind. The text lacks clarity, even on a few fundamental points. This is the very reason why I don't recommend this book for anyone that would like to learn more about any of the subjects it covers. I'm going to review my copy of the book with my local library to see if they have any suggestions on how to make it a better book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a compilation of interviews from various interviews and interviews of various authors:  I do not recommend this book because it is written in a manner that only appeals to those who are already very experienced with writing. The interviews are not only limited to fiction but also to journalism and general culture. The authors seem to take for granted the fact that everyone can write about their favorite TV show.  This book is a joke.  The book is filled with interviews of authors that are not great writers 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of wrong information.  There is a short appendix listing the books that I bought from Amazon and the ones that I received in the mail. The appendix is written in a tone that is patronizing towards men and is full to the brim with personal opinions.  A lot of the information is also wrong and can be easily verified by someone who is a professional writer and has the benefit of having published books to refer to.   I would also like to point out that the book was released only two months ago and most of the mistakes are from a matter of weeks. I'm considering returning this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   First off the title is misleading, this book is not about a single country but about the whole of the world.  I did not buy the book because of the title but because of some of the content, the author is not very well known or experienced.  The book is well written and very short but this is where the problem lies 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of mistakes and over-simplifications.  If you want to learn about a musical instrument  you would do better with a book like this:  A good book for those interested in the violin, but the book could be better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be extremely boring. I really didn't need to read any other information about how to properly handle a case. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written for children, not teenagers, so it would be a huge disappointment if they read it without understanding that a relationship, even with a nice girl, is never ever easy. This book contains an extensive section on relationships 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a Christian and I read a few of these books in college.  This one has many errors and does not provide any real information for people who do not share the Christian faith.  For example:  Some people have lost sight of their physical and spiritual health due to drinking.  You are never told what medications you should take and it is not written about how much of a positive influence prayer can be.  I would highly recommend not spending your money on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the first few chapters and was hooked. It became obvious that the author had not had any formal training in the subject matter and simply used some other material to illustrate her point. I was very frustrated by the lack of understanding of some of the subjects and some of her statements were simply not true. I didn't enjoy the book very much, but it did give me some ideas to write my own book about the topic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the writing style to be somewhat awkward and slow, as well as poorly organized. The style also left some of the most essential information off the list of examples.  I would have been more likely to find the ideas of the methods to be useful if I could have read the book in it's original format. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very boring and very negative about women. Don't waste your money on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the one that the goodreads bookclub recommended. And, you know what?  They are right!  The author has no clue about photography, and the book is full of random photographs.  In the end it's just a waste of space 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was written in 1984. It was not published until 1987. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had to turn a negative in my review to the positive.  This book was written in 1998.  It was written by a writer for a magazine, so I guess the book isn't as impressive as the author's self-assurance.  I could see why the author was very successful as a writer when the movie 'The Crazies' was on the big screen.  She had a great role in that film, and it looks like she is no longer able to write as well.  Her stories were very romantic and interesting, but it is clear that she has lost her writing touch.  If anyone can teach this author something, please let her know: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought the book would be better if the author could put some work into the stories rather than merely rehashing them over and over again.  One of the stories is based on a real life experience of a child who was bullied and beaten by his classmates.  The only reason the story was told is because it was the only one that came to mind in a crisis of depression that came upon the author.  I found it difficult to believe that the author (a trained teacher) could not tell the stories from a child's point of view, that they are always  overly dramatic and too easy to make out.  They seemed to me to be a bit  preachy and overbearing, as if the authors wanted to convince the reader that  everyone who was unhappy must be  suffering from some sort of mental illness.   The story seemed to be less about a story and more about the author's  personal problems. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is not a good book to start off with.  It seems as though the author read this book only once and then never got the hang of it.  This book is about a little girl in a small town.  She has a very dull life.  The things the girl does is to get a job at a candy store and then she gets involved in a romance.  Then her mother starts to hate her.  The girl also goes to the beach and is never home when she comes home 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It does nothing more than present a positive review of the author's book, without actually explaining the topics. The title of the book is very misleading. It does not even describe the main topic of the discussion. The book was intended to be a text book for teaching English, and does not reflect any real writing ability. The students can read it from cover to cover, without having to refer to any other book on the subject. The student is not even given the opportunity to write a negative description of the text book. He is just given a very positive review about the book. The only real criticism I can muster is that there are some inconsistencies in the way the author presents some of the topics and examples. This is the only criticism I have.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story about the child of a famous author and his daughter who is a dancer in a nightclub is the only thing good in this book.  It is the usual story about a famous writer's daughter becoming a star dancer.  The plot is not very interesting, and the characters are not very likable 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written by two people, and no wonder: the characters are flat.  The story itself is completely derivative:  The main character is a girl.  In the beginning of the story she gets pregnant.  Then she goes through several pregnancies, and has lots of abortions.  She finally gives birth to a baby that goes back to the future.  I felt that the story was so derivative that it had no point:  If you wanted to write a story about a girl, do not even bother 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was written about the life of William McKinley who was the first person elected president. It is written as if the author knows the facts, but he does not. He is a masterful story teller. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is nothing more than a collection of articles and stories, written from an unsympathetic view of a sad and sadistic serial killer.  The author, who is a self-styled expert on serial murderers, makes many claims about his methods, yet his explanations for his sadistic behavior are so ridiculous that you're not surprised when you finish the book.  This is a worthless book that should never have been printed for public consumption.  It will cause you to question yourself more often and perhaps take some of the most unpleasant situations you've ever faced in a positive light, only to be shocked and frustrated when things do not turn out quite as you envisioned.  I did read the book because I liked the author's reputation, but it simply did not provide any solutions to the challenges of his psychopathic lifestyle.  If you want to read a bad serial killer book, try the one written by William J. Gaddis 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of ridiculous, outdated, and just plain inaccurate information about the Bible. The author should be ashamed of himself for putting out such useless and misleading material. I'm ashamed to call myself a Christian, because this book tells me that my faith is a little bit questionable 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not an expert in these matters, but this was simply not an appropriate book to help anyone with her mental illness.  I find it interesting to read about the self-help book that inspired the writing of this book, but that is not why I have given it a negative rating.  It is simply not a good book.  If you are struggling with depression, please do not buy this book. You may find that the more you read the less you realize that you are depressed.  Do not rely on this book for any kind of support.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I received this book and read it and it was all downhill from the beginning to the end. It was a good book if you want to learn about Japanese culture, but it was written like a college textbook, with lots of boring details and nothing to connect the ideas. This book is not what I expected from a Japanese book; it is just boring, boring, blah. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is one of the worst books I've ever seen. There are many instances where the author does not bother to verify the information provided. It's hard to believe this book would be popular in this day and age. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a mess. I have trouble even understanding the contents. It is a poor book, in the sense that it is completely incomprehensible, and not just because of the text.I would rather read a good book from a good author, instead of this. It's simply incomprehensible. The only thing that works is to memorize the pages that you are required to look through for the next 20 pages, which is about the best I can do. It gets to be a real hassle.I really hate the author. I don't really get the point of the book, and I'm not even sure what the point is. I am actually annoyed, because it is written so poorly that it takes me a long time to understand the text, and yet it's a good text. The reader can choose to accept it, or ignore it. I chose to ignore it, and the text became an obstacle that I had to get past in order to understand what was happening in this book. This is a bad piece of writing, in that it requires the reader to memorization the text before it even gets started.The only good thing about this book is the fact that it's short. It makes it perfect to have for quick reference on the bookcase. It can also be a good practice text for your kids. It may be ok for an advanced reader, but for my kids it is very boring. I would recommend to not waste your time on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title says it all.  The text is short and dull.  It is mostly a collection of stories from other people's  life.  There is no real story.  Instead the author tries to get readers to understand and accept  the  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sorry that this book is so bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very long.  But for someone like me who is looking for something that will help with her writing, this is not a good book.  It is just boring.  Just so much self-help, but it never really gives anything new.  I really hated this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A strange book: lots of pictures and lots of names and all the good pictures from the  world of travel are placed in the text and it seems like  the pictures are not meant to be interesting. You can't look at a  picture and say  "this is the picture of how to find a good place to  sleep." It's a book about travel and travel is  never interesting 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a great book, but it is extremely boring to read. It is very much about the spiritual journey of the mind. I did not enjoy reading this book because I feel that it should be about a more spiritual book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   First, the book is written by a man who never actually works with his hands and he clearly never reads any books about anything. It is filled with the most boring facts. If you don't have a bookkeeping background, this is a great book for you. It's about accounting and it will make you look like a moron. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For those who have studied this material at some length, it does an excellent job of making this subject difficult. The book is filled with irrelevant and confusing descriptions of materials such as   'paper plates', 'cards', 'tape', 'photographic negatives',  'photostats', 'lamps', etc., etc. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this is one of the most boring books I've read in my life.  It's boring because it doesn't explain anything.  If this is the most important book you're ever going to read, then stop reading it immediately. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first sentence of the introduction is about why the book is not a good book: it is written in the style of a self-help book, and not of a good one. The book tells the reader a lot about self-improvement (which it's not) without giving any tips. I found out only through a Google search that there are a lot of self-development books that are better. But I thought I would have to check the books on my own. But the book did not help me, and instead made me feel confused and lost 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of lies and misrepresentations. I found it very depressing to read about this man. I was very much against his death sentence, but I could not get through the book.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not a great fan of the author, but thought her theory was cool enough to read. But then she started to write some crap about all sorts of stuff, and I couldn't keep up with it anymore. So I gave up and am currently reading one of her books for  school. I don't know why she had to do that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm glad I did not bother to read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I found it hard to read this book. The prose is not good enough. The characters are dull.  I gave it only 4 stars out of 10 because I could not read the first 3 books because of my poor eyesight.The author should read better books to improve his writing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has been on my shelves for quite a while and it has been one of the only books on Islam I read. Unfortunately, this book is full of inaccurate, self-promoting, sensationalistic material which does not serve anyone who reads the Quran, the traditions of the Muslim Brotherhood, or even the Quran itself. This book is a waste of money and time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so bad,  It is written as if it is a short story. It is filled with grammar errors and  the narrative is very rushed and confused.   It seems to be written as a form of  autobiography, but the style is so different that it  doesn't feel like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very bad book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a great way of learning something new. But, I have to say that I don't think it is a very good book. The story of her life seems to be so short that it is often hard to keep track of her stories and motivations. She tends to ramble on and on and is not especially articulate. For example,  when she's talking about the bad reviews of her book and what they mean, she says something like,    This book is all about my life and my choices and what I do not like. This book, however, is a collection of my life stories and it is meant to be an introspective look at my life.  This is not a memoir and is about my struggles, my triumphs and my dreams 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to give this book a negative rating because it was not enjoyable reading. It was a tedious book, filled with tedious explanations.  I felt bad for the guy who had to write it.  This book had a good cover but the book's content was not as good as it looks on the cover 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a bad novel:  The characters are all unreliable, it is confusing and disjointed.  The writing is atrocious.  All in all it's a terrible novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The problem with this book is that it is very long. I finished it in one night and was shocked at how much I didn't know. There are a number of interesting and funny quotes that you could find in any other book. But it's just not very interesting. You get the idea but not the full experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are so many errors in this book that I am amazed that someone would write it like that.  I do hope that this book ends up in the trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In general, the book is full of errors and contradictions. If you are a serious student of linguistics, I would recommend you to skip this book and read the real book. But for those who want to believe that grammar is a language like French or Arabic, this book is not a good choice.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Too many times in this book, I found myself laughing at some of the antics in it.  The main characters are annoying, they are very shallow characters.  I think the author may have gotten tired of his characters. Not sure what happened to him after his first book was a massive failure, but the second one did okay.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very disappointing. It gives no clues about the true history of our country and is full of contradictions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book when it came out and it was a mistake to buy it.  I kept seeing reviews saying  that they read the first two chapters and were disappointed.  Well, not quite.  The book is bad and there's no way I can relate to the author's story.  It seems  that his characters are a lot like the characters in a bad electronic device 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got this book for my high school English class. I would agree with the other reviews about the author's style, and his writing. I found it very boring. He was not that good of a teacher, and did not have any real talent for teaching. He would do what he could to get his students to remember the lesson material, but he did not show any passion. He got a negative reputation from the students and didn't like to do anything else. He never really showed up in the book. It was mostly his ideas on life, and how to make it a better life. He had no real life experience to speak of. I think he was only in high school for three years. That is all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a bad little book. The plot is thin, the writing sloppy and repetitive. No one should read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is filled with information about a great deal of subjects, but very few things are actually explained. If you want to learn about electronics and electronic devices, this book is for you, but this is a bad electronic book and doesn't provide much information to back it up. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author does not understand how to write a positive review about such a bad review:  The book was written in the 1960s and published in 1967. The material was out of date and was only about 50 years out of print. The book did not deal with real life. It focused on fantasy and was very shallow. The plot consisted of allusions to a certain movie, which was an average, boring film:  He had never seen the film and he was not interested in it, because it was about a very boring girl, who didn't do anything. The character was not believable. She was a very simple woman. She had a nice smile and it was obvious that she was a little bit jealous about the love interest that her husband had 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not a bad idea, but what is wrong with the story?  There is not a bad thing about the story except for some of the language.  The main characters and the plot are not great either.  It was very easy to read, but there were times when I couldn't follow the plot and thought I was reading a non-fiction book.  This is the reason why I only read the first two books in the series, which are very much better 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a native English speaker, so I can't really comment on the quality of the book. However, I must say that the first sentence in the book says that the book is designed as a self-help book, not a science book. I found this to be odd, since I am always a science lover. This is the first book in a series, so there is a possibility that he is just trying to make a fast buck out of the series, as I understand he did with the first series, called "The Essential New Year's Edition" (ISBN 1-872279-21-5, paperback). If it wasn't for the title, it would have been a mistake to buy this book, but as it is, it is a terrible book, even for the intended target audience: it is very hard to read, it contains lots of boring science facts, and it contains very little useful information for people who are planning to take a real trip to Europe. It was really hard to figure out where to start in this book and I ended up just buying the other books in the series instead. It is very disheartening to know that a good book was ruined for the American traveler 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is "The Case Against The Church   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of misinformation about herbalism.  What does a book like this have to do with herbalism?  It is only a matter of time before this book is out of print.  A lot of the information is not accurate at all.  This is probably the worst book that I have ever read.  I do recommend this book if you are looking for information on herbalism, but not if you want to practice herbalism 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is filled with pictures, stories, and other useless information. I wouldn't even bother with this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't find any of the quotes particularly insightful and I found most of the information provided useless.  I was never really interested in her politics as I was interested in the research on American culture. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved the concept, but there is very little actual information. No dates or quotes are given for anything. If you are interested in this subject, then I don't think you would enjoy this book. However, if you are not interested in the subject at all, then this book may be just the ticket 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not bad, it's simply unreadable. In fact, I was annoyed by this book so much that I decided to read other authors' work instead, but this book is just too much. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is so short and doesn't even touch on anything worthwhile, it's all the same boring quotes and just repeats some of the same useless advice 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed by the book. If the author wants to teach others about what really happens in the Bible then the subject matter is not inappropriate for the classroom. This book fails to make any of the subjects comprehensible to the reader. This is a very short and confusing book with very little information about biblical interpretation and more of a discussion of a person's spirituality than it does the Bible itself. The topics the author chooses to cover are far too broad. It is unfortunate that the author chose to write about this material rather than take a more focused approach to the subject and try to make the material more clear. The material should have been left to the student to draw their own conclusions about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't read the book or give it much thought until I heard about its release. I was floored. I am writing about the great American literature of the 20th century: the New Englanders of Whitman, the Americanists of Fifties & Sixties 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only good thing about this book is that it is on Amazon so people can buy it to read at their leisure, but I do not recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very little has changed in the 50 years since this book was published, though I have read and loved most of the others 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would have rated this a 4 star if it was not for the many typos, errors and misprints in the text. This is not a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book's main problem is its bad prose. It takes an entire chapter to write about one word. It's like the author has never read a book before, or was  asked to write a book for a class assignment 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read several of these books, so I know it can be an overwhelming read if you're not familiar with the material, but this one was definitely not for me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm pretty much disappointed about this book.  The book is written by one of the authors, who has a PhD in English.  This is a good book for people who are serious about studying medieval literature, but is really only about the last 100 years, and not really about Renaissance literature 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book for fun. I do not recommend this book to any aspiring poet. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book one finds endless and absurd details about sex. Some examples:  - It is claimed that the human penis is as small as a hair.  - That the penis can withstand pressure of a horse's tail.  That the man who wants to be a good lover is one who can use the word "pleasure" more than 20 times in a day.  Even more absurd:  Men don't know how to read or write. The only way to get an erection is to put something very soft in front of a man's penis.  He tries to put a rock in front. This is only an example:  The author describes a woman masturbating with a book in her vagina.  This is no way to go about lovemaking 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written in an almost childish style.  The only point she makes that I found relevant was in relation to the use of the word "courage".  Not one word of it made sense to me and the author was obviously trying to make some sort of point.  This is not the sort of book I would recommend for any young person.  I found myself looking for the definition of the words "cautious" and "self-discipline" when the book was over.  Not a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel sorry for anyone who has read this book. It has been published by an American author who has no understanding of French. There are too many mistakes to mention. If the authors of this book have a good book to write, I am sure it will be better by next time. I have read many of them in the past, and I am still surprised by what they have come up with 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book because I was looking for a book for the summer that would keep my mind occupied and fun.  The book itself is great, but the writing is really bad.   The author is overusing the first person, and when she does it is a sign that she isn't being imaginative enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The text has become completely obsolete with the emergence of electronic resources, like the Electronic Versions of the Bible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of unnecessary details. For example, the book says that there are only two kinds of people, good or bad. I find this very strange because there are many good and bad types of people. The main characters are extremely selfish and don't like anything to do with others. There are only three characters that are real friends. I would not recommend this book for children because it is full with unrealistic situations.The story is full nonsense and the characters are made to look dumb by this book. This book should be given a good review because it isn't a bad novel but it is just not worth reading 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is pretty bad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to do a lot of research to find a decent review for this book.  As a child, I couldn't get enough of it so I decided to give it a try.  The writing style was not very helpful and the style of writing could have easily been written by a child.  Very boring and slow paced 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not find the book very convincing. I'm not sure if I'll buy it next time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to learn how to sell a book for the purpose of making money, this book isn't for you.  This is an academic book about business written for MBA students, who may not care much about this subject, but who still must know how to market a book.  It's not a bad, well written book, but it is very hard to relate to and is written in an overly academic fashion, rather than a realistic business approach 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    If you don't want to learn something about the Holocaust and the holocaust period, please don't read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was going to buy this book for my 8 year old daughter, but she was not interested in this book. This book is not for children. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the first time in many years I read anything from a medical book, so I have little to add to the negative reviews on Amazon about this book. It is a sad story, I won't bore you with it. I just found out about it through an article in a different medical magazine. I have to say I read this book the day it was published and it was an absolute disaster,

Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very negative review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not written in a clear manner, it is mostly based on interviews, so it is very confusing to read through. The questions were not well answered and it left you confused about the information you learned and why you are going to the doctor. There are many pages of repetitive questions and answers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author does not understand how he has written about this period of American history. His understanding of the past is superficial.  The book begins in the 1970s, and focuses on the civil rights movement in the South. He spends very little time talking about the Vietnam War and the history of anti-war activism. This is one of the most embarrassing book I've ever read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not agree with this book, and this review is to get the point across to people who did  not like the book: the main argument was that the author has a low opinion of most writers. This book, in my opinion, is a blatant self-promotion  piece. The author clearly did not read this book before writing his review.  I cannot recommend  this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only reason I would not recommend this book is that it is just not for anyone else 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main premise of the book is that we're supposed to believe that life can be happy and good only when there are no constraints to any of the things we are willing to tolerate.   However, all that happened when I read the book was that I became a complete asshole.  It was obvious that I did not understand the book at all and I even knew about the premise of free will in general.  I do think it's a good book if you like philosophy and psychology.  But in all seriousness, there is not a single word that is applicable to the real world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  This book is a complete waste of time, and as such it is not recommended for beginners. The authors are either too uninformed or too incompetent to know anything about the subject, or both. If you want to learn about what people have written about their experiences on the internet, look elsewhere, for example 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the previous reviewers that this book is a poorly written book with many spelling mistakes. For instance, in the second chapter a character says, "I am from Chicago, Illinois, a very liberal city." What do you say to that? No, that's a common error for most of the people in this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of boring and useless information. It is full with a lot of quotes which do not do any more than provide a boring summary of this subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has a long, long way to go before it will become a worthwhile reference book. However, the material presented in this book is not of very high quality, with some of the material not only being repetitive, but outright false. The author attempts to provide a lot of material for his students, but very little for his professional readers. He seems to take pride in giving himself credit for the content of his works, but then only cites his own writings as the source of the information for his student's assignments. This book is far from the best book I've ever read, but if you have an interest in Japanese history and want to take an interest on his works as a supplement to your studies, then this book would be ideal. Unfortunately, it is extremely dated and does not meet the standard of accuracy that is required to be considered a reference book for a graduate seminar or for use in the classroom. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written for children and it lacks any real understanding of real world events.   The plot is really not all that impressive either.  I would advise children to avoid this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written for high school students who already have a good knowledge of biology. The information given was mostly taken from the American Biology Association textbook, which is a very basic book. No new information or references are provided. The author also does not do a good job of answering basic questions about what organisms and plants are. The only thing that I really liked about this book was the title. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is my only negative review of a bad books:  One of the things that I hated about the book was the fact that the author claimed that they were the first book that taught how to play the harmonica.  The book itself is riddled with bad ideas 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book in the hope that it would help people understand the concepts of spirituality better.  It is a very confusing book.    The authors do not care to explain what the Vedic religion is or even what is Vedic.  They just throw in Vedic mantras like "May all beings be happy."  It is nothing but a collection of spiritual aphorisms. They are the spiritual equivalent of the "10 commandments" or the "12th commandment"  There are only two quotes from classical Hindu thinkers. I would like to see more quotes from writers from different cultures such as Confucius or Plato. The only thing that saved this book was the author's own wisdom 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has lots of spelling mistakes and poor grammar. For example, it says a boy is too shy to go to a party. He goes anyway. He is called the shy boy. I'm sorry it's the only book written about boyhood 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has been out of print for years. I don't understand why this book is even published anymore. It is an excuse to read more of the same bad self-help books that are out there (i.e. self-improvement 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is really a compilation of "author's notes." They are not very helpful. A few examples: The book is about a boy who is so obsessed with the "Mafia" that he runs away to New York to become a mobster. He goes to a bad boarding school in New England and lives there and is there until the end of the book. He gets sent home by the headmaster and has to go back to New England in the middle of the next book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is not only boring but it is full of errors that the author seems not to know. I know better than to let my kids read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you like to study religion, then this book is for you. I learned about Islam only because of this book. I did not feel it was a good read for a young adult. You would do better with a good book like, " The God of Islam: The Creation of the Holy Koran" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If anyone can read the text and understand the subject, it's this book. This book is so shallow that the main reason to read it is to learn something about the subject. And then you are bored of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a child I read this book at a friend's birthday party and we all got into it. I was about 12 or 13 and my mom said that I had to read it again because I was so fascinated.  As I grew up I read it, but this time I never finished it because I found myself so bored.  The main problem is that it makes no sense at all.  If you are a fan of classic science fiction and you're looking for a good one-time read, then this is a bad one-timer.  It has all the trappings of good science fiction, yet it's full of useless characters 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  I took several years to finish this book, and this review has only covered a small fraction of the work.  The book is written by the author, and the author does a bad job explaining his ideas.  I found it difficult to understand the author's thought process and the results of his thinking.  This book needs to be updated, or else the book will be seen as a bad idea for a long time.  He has now published another book, which I'm sure will address a much more accurate and coherent discussion of what he thinks.  The book has been out for about 10 years, but it is still not complete.  Hopefully the author will finally publish a revised version which is much more complete and less of a disappointment to the readers. I'm glad I had this book in my library, because I've been looking forward to the next book, so it will be a long wait. But the rest of the book I never finished, so I'm still confused on a lot of the concepts. For example, I didn't understand what a good book is, and I have never read a good novel. He has also never bothered to write a positive review about this book. It was more like a bad review, as the book has some good ideas but the author makes his point by putting you through a lot to get to the good ideas. You'll do well by just skipping the bad parts, and reading the good parts of the novel first 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is another one of those books that is full of inaccuracies and outdated. The author clearly doesn't know what he is talking about. Even the name of one of the two heroes is a common mistake. He is a French writer who lived in Italy during World War II. He has written several historical novels but never has done historical research about this period. In addition, his hero (the French-Italian explorer Pierre-Joseph Mieh) is the same guy as Captain James Cook. Both of these characters are portrayed in this book as villains with little to no redeeming qualities. As far as the other historical characters in this story, no one is ever named. Some of the quotes were given as historical facts. They are either incorrect or out of date. This is especially unfortunate since some of these quotes are from real historical events. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about Greek mythology, and the Greeks have been getting a bad rap lately 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a shame that many people don't understand that  that the only good thing to come from any form of abuse is learning to control it. This book has a lot of misinformation and some of the information could have easily been removed from the book. I really feel that the book was written by a person who wasn't a survivor of abuse.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sure many readers will find this book highly offensive.  It is written by a man who has made it his mission to turn the lives of women into a negative thing.  For him to use women as pawns in his sexual strategy is ridiculous, and it is clear the book is geared toward the young male reader who is not equipped to handle a serious relationship or deal with real life problems.  I understand the message of the book and agree that it has a positive message.  However, there are so many negatives in the book that it is impossible to take this one seriously.  All of the problems listed in the story are based on his own personal feelings.  The book is just as bad as a porn book.  If you like porn you will have no trouble with this book. If you are serious about relationships or have any other problems then this book is for you only.  This book has so much negativity and negative language that you will not be able to even enjoy the book after reading it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know why this book is so popular. The information isn't new, nor does it provide any tools for making life better for women. It's a bunch of personal anecdotes and a very uninspiring self-help book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I have ever read. Its grammar, spelling and vocabulary are all very basic for an upperclassman. Its style is very formal and its contents are extremely boring. The book is only 4 pages long. So, this book is supposed to help upperclassmen improve their grammar and vocabulary. But,  I did not even finish the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author is a complete amateur 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing style, diction and content of the book are horrendous. Not one single sentence is clear. One can understand that the author is not fluent in English but still this is a book that must be learned in a matter of days before using it for any important work 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of half-baked ideas about being a good mother.  It is not a good book for anyone who is serious about mothering.  The ideas that it offers are not very different from those that are found in the best parenting books on the market today.  This book does not make anyone feel any better about becoming a mother or better about parenting.  I felt I could spend weeks researching the book and still find out the same things I did in the book.  These ideas are not worth the time or effort, I felt. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was supposed to be the last book for which the author had written a dissertation, and it's not bad  but the first thing one notices is that he has no sense of  style.  The style seems to be to have the reader do all the work  in order to advance the story.  He goes from one page to the next in a very rushed manner,  so that you don't have a chance to think.  I mean, it's the last thing I want in my  books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is over 10 years old, it was published in the mid 90's. It's full of many errors, some of them very serious. Some of the topics are outdated. It is also full of contradictions in the story. The author was a bad writer.The story is boring, and some of the characters have very little characterization.The whole book is only a collection of interesting quotes. I don't recommend to read it, because it is full of mistakes, many of them serious, many in the text.I would give a negative rating to this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a total disaster for me.  I found that it was very boring and made me dislike the character of the narrator.  It was the first book in the series 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As I said, this is a great book: about a boring teacher, about boring life. No humor at all. I am so disappointed in this book. The title is great. However, the book doesn't live up to it's title. This is a horrible book and the only thing that I will read in it is about how I feel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was so boring I could never finish it. The whole thing is a bunch of "gems" of personal anecdotes. I guess this book was aimed more toward the older students. I could not find any useful information about the subject of the book: history, literature, social sciences, etc 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The whole point of this book is to show you how to do research.  The book is full of examples.  But not the examples he used are all in the first chapter.  Most of the examples from the chapters he uses are in the back of the book.  I found that the book could not be more of a waste of money.  He's making you buy books that don't have any relation to the real world and do not have any examples that are actually based in reality.  Also there's no index to the book, which is pretty useless.  All you're left with is your own imagination and a list of books  that you've already read and a few that you think are interesting to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is another book written by a male student.  No one cares about what goes on in the classroom, it's just a way to get boys to do the chores, which is to do whatever his mother tells him to do 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is over 50 pages long, and in some cases, much of the information about the church is simply not true, but that's just the way it is.  It's an overstuffed and unnecessary book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is all about the first year of a girl's life.  The characters were introduced slowly and we barely got to know them.  This story is very short on character development.  We really didn't get to know the characters and the plot is very predictable.  There are too many clich√©s and very few positive things to say about this book.  I would never buy a book that was all about  girls. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with lies. The main character has no experience with computers. He's been told he is a computer expert but the truth is he has no idea what a terminal is. The author is a professional writer but he doesn't know the difference between a bad review and a bad electronic device 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of inaccuracies. It is mostly written in a monotonous style, devoid of any thought or emotion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The author, an avid photographer, claims to know everything about photography, but he's only just started his professional photography career.  He has been photographing in Europe and Asia for over 20 years, but, according to his own accounts, he has yet to photograph anywhere in North America.  I'm sure the author of this book has lots of friends in the industry, but they do not appear to have read this book.  The only photo related discussion is the photo of the photographer in a car.  No other photos appear to appear in the book. ¬† I am extremely disappointed.   I am sure there is a fine story in here, but it's probably not one you would want to read about 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I received a hardcover book in exchange for a review for a good book: The Making of a Bad Book  The first few chapters of this book are the weakest in my opinion.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For a very short and unappealing book: Not worth the time. You might as well get it from the library or at a book store instead of buying it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very disappointing book. I can't believe anyone actually gives this book a try 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the only book that I have ever bought that wasn't good.  No story.  I would not read this book again.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not a fan of the book and was looking for more information about the author.  As a result, this book is more of an encyclopedia than anything else.  There are a number of errors in the text, especially in the sections about how to buy and use the internet.  I would advise against anyone buying this book for the information it provides.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has only one good review:  The book contains so many misleading statements and quotes that one can only conclude that it was written by someone who is not well-versed in the subject. If you want to learn the art of writing in the  real world of the  natural sciences, go to a good textbook instead of reading this  book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is quite boring, and it was the only reason I started it. I have never had a negative opinion about a book, so I was skeptical, but I was also not impressed. This book was not only boring, it was extremely  wrong, and completely misleading. The main idea was that the Church was more powerful than the Mafia in the 1970s. The Church was actually more powerful in the 1950s and 1960s. Even more so in the 1930s. So the author was basically saying that the Mafia killed people. The only thing that the mafia ever did was kill people, but the Church did it for them, and this author was completely out of touch with reality. I don't believe this book was even written by a Latter-day Saint. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It reads like a third hand account from someone who read the book at a public library in Canada, never got to the end, and never tried to correct anything or read the entire book.  It does have some good tips, but I'm afraid of how the author would have made some of his points if he had not taken a look at a book and never thought to get more information on how to do certain things.  This is one of those cases where a person reads a book, learns some things, goes to a few seminars and then reads more of the same material and is never able to take a step back and look for more information or even do something new 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a horrible book for a newbie. I have had many people tell me about these ideas, and I have never understood them. Now I know why they are bad. The ideas are not well thought out and never come together. I was so disappointed. I wasted my time on this book and would not recommend it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not enjoy the book at all. There were too many historical inaccuracies, most of them quite obvious, and it was way to long for me to finish it. I do hope the author will read the reviews of those that have complained about it, and try to work out a better format for her books. I'm sure she is capable of writing a good book if she tries 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very poorly written book which is bad for everyone but the author.  The writing is not bad at all, but it lacks the clarity and logic of some more modern writers.  It's not a bad novel, but just very dull.  If this is an effort to write more mature novels, it's very sad.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book in one day, and it was just as boring and dry as this book: http://www.greatnewbooks.com/2011/  I wouldn't recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought the book was okay for a freshman. However, the author uses the "I" in "I want to know the truth  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is based on a real case. It has a lot of unnecessary information that isn't relevant, and it is full of unnecessary personal testimony.  It makes the reader feel like she is a prosecutor in a court.  If she would have spent the money on a good book, she would be writing a positive review about it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has many mistakes and doesn't explain many of the things it talks about very well. The only reason it's in this collection is because it was published in 2000. Many of the techniques in this book are dated and even the book itself is dated. The author really doesn't seem to understand much of the psychology and is always trying to convince the reader that you don't need to have your own self-help group to be successful. This book is about motivational speaking but it's the techniques, not the message, that you need to be using. The book is the result of an ex-nun's book club group that is basically a cult. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a huge, incoherent mess, written by a neurotic, alcoholic (who also claimed to be the world's greatest composer), and with no real explanation.  The only thing that I can say is that I didn't enjoy reading the author's descriptions of all the different locations he visited, and the way he handled his alcohol and depression.  Overall, not bad; but the author has a tendency to write in the first person with no respect for his characters.  This was his first book, so there is room for improvement.  His personality seems to reflect a sort of ego-driven narcissism, and while his writing is very entertaining, it isn't as insightful as I'd like it to be.  I'd recommend this book to a friend who is struggling with alcoholism or depression. It is too bad that this book was written by someone who didn't know any other way to write. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written by a woman.  I am not interested in women's issues or books written by women.  But for a female to think that she has a unique perspective on any subject is just plain wrong 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a book about witchcraft, but it is not a good book. I was only able to follow it through the title. The first time I read it I thought it was going to be something more, and ended up reading it twice. The writing is very poor. There are many mistakes. The book is a horrible waste of space and time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is very detailed, but also over-written, and doesn't have any original ideas to the story.  The story is a retelling of the story of The Time Machine from the movie of the same name, which is terrible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the first book of this series. I didn't read it until I had already started the series.  I didn the book because I was looking for a story, and I was hoping that the first one would be better than the others.  The author makes no effort to give an overview of the main characters in the story, only telling the reader that one of them is gay.  As you will learn in the next two books, that is not exactly the case.  It is a little more detailed in this one than the previous two.  That's what I liked about it in the first place.  If you don't like a book about gay characters, I wouldn't recommend it.  There is enough information in it for you to understand what is going on in the other books, but the story is too thin 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so full of inaccuracies, it is just a waste of time reading this book, I wasted so many hours and days working to get all this correct. This book does not give you any ideas, it just repeats things that you already know. I would recommend anyone to read a good book instead of this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book from a bad collection of stories. There are no good, interesting, funny, or enjoyable stories. The stories are not the best in the collection, but they are the worst. You can be very bored reading these bad books, but I suggest you buy the original collections. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have not read the book but I have seen the movie. As I said, the plot is as dull as a potato. The whole book was about a woman who finds a man in the bushes. He is actually an actor. He spends his life on screen and the woman is only interested in him as a woman. If that is not enough, there is also some sexual tension. Noone should be buying this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a very boring book and the reader is expected to just copy and paste the information from the other source. It's also a bit too long to sit down to read it in one sitting. This is what it is all about: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book focuses on   Christian Fundamentalism, and that is a very  limiting and very narrow view.  It's basically preaching about how the only true form of love is  loving of the Lord. I didn't think so. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very obvious that Ms. Maitland did not have any practical knowledge of either psychology or sociology. The first few chapters go over topics in detail without really explaining the basic concepts. The reader is left with the impression that she was some sort of expert on the subject. Her writing is quite awkward and not as well thought out as the other reviews on this site. The only thing that saves this book is the cover, which was done in a way that I felt was somewhat inappropriate. I think that this cover would be better suited to a children's book, rather than a psychology book. The main thesis of this book, that the male/female differences are due to biological and environmental causes, is not exactly supported by the data presented. She gives a few examples of studies that show that there are some differences that are biological and she provides the readers with the data to support those claims. However, none of these data are substantiated by the text itself. The book does not present the data that backs up her claims. I found her presentation very weak, which I find problematic for a textbook, especially a psychology textbook. This book does NOT help anyone with their decision making as a student. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought it was written for high schoolers.  They didn't know what the heck was going on.  The way the story progressed was just ridiculous.  I didn't learn anything about how to grow up, take responsibility, or get over someone.  It was very confusing to read.  If you have a problem with adults then get this book and take a good look at how your parents handle the same issues they did.   It really hurt to read it.  Maybe I'm the only one, but I didn`t like this book at all.  This is a great book to read to a child who doesn't know much about life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read the entire first edition and it was boring. This one seems to be more for kids but it is filled with unnecessary information.I have seen many other reviews that praise the book but this one is nothing but useless. The whole thing is filled by pictures and stories with very little in the way of real information. There's a section about  horses and what not, but that doesn't help you in the field.I just finished it and I'm looking for another one soon.I guess I'll just have to do the work for my children and hope that the booksellers stop selling it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a piece of trash. It is not interesting. And the author doesn't even mention the story in his book. It's only the illustrations which are useful. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a good description of the evolution of the language and thought of children.  There is also a fair amount of science, and some good advice about how to prepare for a career.  However, the book does not give enough time for the parents to actually explain to their child how evolution is true, or why the belief in evolution is wrong.  It would have been far better for the author to spend more time on this aspect of the book, and to put some time into actually explaining the actual science behind the evolution belief. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed to find so little about the first century of the Christian era. It is a shame that this book is not in the standard  library. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the worst book I've ever read. It would be better if the author didn't care that his book has zero credibility 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with all of the negative reviews. This book is not well researched or written 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was nothing more than a collection of random poems and the author, as usual, did not even bother to add the poems to the page in which they were written.  The poem collection is simply a way to showcase the author's talent in the form of poems of the worst quality.  I read the whole book and the poems that were included were terrible.  In addition, I also read a part of the book which is very similar to the poem collection from which the poems were collected.  This part of it was just as bad.  These poems were just thrown together and presented as some sort of "contributions" to the book.  All in all, this was a complete waste of money to my book collection 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you don't know how to use a spreadsheet to figure out a person's lifestyle, this book is for you.  The first page says "If you can't do Excel then you are doomed to fail!"  I'm afraid I agree.   As a person who works at a real estate office, I know exactly how that book works, I'm not kidding.  You can't find anything useful about a realtor's lifestyle anywhere else.  I hope you realize this is a bad example and you don√≠t use it to learn. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as an undergrad, and it gave me great headaches for several years. I don't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not only bad, it is in a lot of ways embarrassing. It was written in the 1950s. It is not the only book written in that era, but it is certainly the most dated of them all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book at all. The story was just so dull and repetitive that the book didn't seem interesting to me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    Well, we have learned to expect a bad review about any book: it is always the same formula, the same points and, even worse, the most obvious examples of bad writing. But this is not the case with this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried to read it on the train in the morning.  The book was too boring.  You'll never find anything new in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Well,  I liked this book. It was interesting to read about how much of the book could be changed and whatnot. I loved it, but I felt that it wasn't worth the $9 price tag 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The title says it all.  The whole book is full of boring and cliched details.  He talks about how he's not a man of letters and blah.  I didn't know he did that type of writing, but he does.  It doesn't do any good to read a book that has a title like this.  If you have the chance to read this book for free, don't bother 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping the author would get over her obsession with sexual descriptions and simply write about the subject. She clearly does not have that much interest in the matter. What she does is give the reader plenty of sexual descriptions, which only makes it more difficult to actually understand what is being written. The problem is, most of us are not obsessed with sexual description. We are not the type of people who are seeking eroticism in everything we read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are many of these books that do not offer any useful information about the human brain. The authors do not seem to have any real understanding of what brain structure is. The book is full of errors that make the reader think that brain anatomy is something that one has to learn by reading a textbook. The entire text is an insult to the readers' intelligence. I think that people are being suckered into the book, just as many other people were with its predecessor 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is very repetitive and boring. It doesn't even tell how the main character came to write this book. It just seems to be written for the reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of contradictions, and you're going to find yourself saying,   What am I reading? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very much an introduction to Buddhist thought.  It is presented as a historical text by a monk.  No attempt is made to make this text as accessible as possible to the general public.  The author has done little to clarify his message to the layman.  He has, rather, conflated a variety of philosophical perspectives into a few pages.  I found the text very confusing.  All I can say is that if you are serious about Buddhism, it would be wiser to start your study from a textbook rather than from this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is one of the worst book I have ever read. If you don't know what to do with this book, do not buy it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book is more of a rant about the death of a family member, the death itself, and the death's aftermath. It's filled with ridiculous examples of people trying to justify what they did. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The text is extremely repetitive and doesn't provide much insight into the topic.  The authors seem to be a bunch of young, uninformed people, who have taken to social media.  Not the type of book  I would recommend to anyone.  If you are looking for a book about technology, economics or computer science,  look elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only reason I give this book a negative rating is that it seems to have been written by one person, and it would be a pleasure if it was a group effort:  The characters and setting are nothing unique, and the story is told in an overblown manner.  It is also a little confusing at times, because of the way the text is presented in the book.  I'm not the best reader, but it is not easy to understand certain parts of the story unless you're well-versed in modern fairy tales.  This is a book that might be read in a library, and there are probably many more good books that it could have been used in 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written by someone who is not a poet.   She does use many of the poems from her other poems in her writing, but they do not have the same emotion as a poem written by the poet.The poems written by Ms. Ellingwood are not for the faint of heart.  If you like poetry, do not buy this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has some excellent photos that are absolutely fabulous and the writing of the first half of the book is not really to my liking. If you are looking for a great book for an intro-class then I would suggest that you find someone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read a few reviews on this book, and they seemed to like it, but I don't like the way they portray these women. I find it to be completely unrealistic, almost pornographic. This book doesn't represent the real world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I loved this book. I think the author could have written a better book if he had researched more on the subject. But I don't agree with all of the "pros" in this book, they are too extreme in their viewpoints. It is a shame to waste my time and money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to get an idea of how much money people spend on sex in their thirties then this book is not for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is all about the importance of good books and all the bad ones he has collected from the various collections of books on the shelves. The story about the life of Charles Darwin and the development of his ideas is interesting, but the book is badly written.  I was expecting something better from this author and instead it is the story of how he collects the bad book collections and gives his opinion on them. The book is so filled with bad book reviews that one has to wonder if this was done as a publicity ploy to boost the book sales.  All the reviews written by a biased biased biased person 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Very boring. Very short. It was my first book and I think it is really not necessary for a good book to be full of pictures of beautiful flowers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I bought this book expecting it to be about a good story but instead, I got stuck on the end of the book.  The author uses her story to explain her beliefs and then she lets it just read off.  You could read the whole book in a few days 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The writing was quite amateurish.  It was a mistake to use the same pictures as the other reviewer.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had hoped that I had read this book earlier.   It was very dry.  The stories in it were not very interesting.  I did not find the stories in this book helpful.  This book is definitely not for people who want to develop their writing skills or are writing their first book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book over a year ago and loved it as a child.  Now I have a son, and I can't get past the age 9 book.  The characters are stupid and the plot is predictable.  I can see this book getting popular if it's marketed towards children, but not for me.  It was a great book as a kid, but it's a big disappointment to read it now 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is filled with uninspired anecdotes, vague statements and vague descriptions of a variety of food.  I found it boring and uninteresting.  The recipes were simply to try, or to put a positive spin on food. I never learned anything about cooking or what the word 'chicken' meant.  You'll do better by reading a real cook book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of bad ideas and bad facts.  It is written by a writer from a major Hollywood studio who has only been in the industry a few years, and does not know the facts. This book has not been used in my classes.   If you are looking for information about working on a bad film, look somewhere else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As with many other reviewers  I found it difficult to get through the book as  the topics were difficult to follow. If it werent for the title I would give up  on this book and only give it  a three star rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book, there are many bad ideas, not even making the best case for why you should read a scientific book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a former Army Captain in the 82nd Airborne, this book has many errors. As a veteran, it took me many pages to realize this. If it were not for the "Hook" reference that we all have, I would never have purchased it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not so much, I did like the idea of the story being told from her perspective. However, some of the stories are pretty ridiculous and don't really provide a deeper understanding of the situation. Also, the way she portrays her mother is really off, and her interactions with her family members are rather flat. I also noticed that the stories weren't even told from a first-person perspective, but rather from her family's perspective. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I bought this book because it's a good book, but I didn't enjoy it. The characters in it are not that well drawn or realistic. The book is about a girl who thinks she can travel the world by making a fortune and buying houses. But she fails miserably and she only really comes to a couple of people's attention. The plot is pretty boring and it's all about the characters being in love. I couldn't really get into it at all. The author could have done better with the story but I just can't recommend it because it was just too boring to read. It did not have any depth or interesting plot, it was all just characters being together. It's not a bad story in itself, but the author could not have done more better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about how to be a good listener, but is not very good on the subject of communication. If you are looking for the best way to communicate, this is a great book. But don't expect to hear the most amazing ideas, as this is about listening to others, not about teaching or teaching. It is a very shallow book that is based on listening, not writing. I did like the idea of the book, however, that it would help a person who is not the best speaker. This book does not address that, it only teaches people how to listen to others 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of bad information and bad writing.  The information in the book is mostly about women and women's issues.  This is not the first time that  the author has failed to give anything useful about women's  issues 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is written in the style of a self-help manual, but there is very little guidance for the reader. The advice given may seem logical at first glance, but it is often contradictory and doesn't make much sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I tried to follow the author's instructions to make the book as informative as possible. This book had very little useful information about the process of getting started with oil painting.  This was not a bad review, but it was an incomplete one.  The book was filled with photographs and charts, but only enough info to give you a feel for the techniques and paints used in oil painting, and very little information about getting started in oil.  I think if I had read the entire book, I would have been able to do better with my practice 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a book for people who are not literate, and have no idea what they are doing. Don't waste your money, it's not worth it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of incorrect and erroneous information about the history of science and technology. The author has a reputation for being a popularizer and popularizer of science fiction, but there is no science fiction in this book. The book has no references to science fiction writers and is essentially a collection of what seem to be anecdotes about various scientists and inventions.The book begins by quoting the popularizer H.G. Wells and then goes on to quote Einstein, Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Nikola Tesla, and Alexander Graham Browett. The list is very misleading and I couldn't figure out where the author was getting his quotes from. Then the author cites the famous science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke as the source of his information. He then goes through the alphabet of famous scientists and tries to relate them to each other and to their inventions. This is extremely misleading, and the book should not have been published.The main problem with this book is the fact that the author does not know how to properly cite sources. If he had, he would have noted that he has not bothered to cite his sources as they would be very helpful. His sources are either anecdotal anecdotes about scientists or quotes from famous scientists who are not even scientists. What this means is that the only reference to science in this collection is to the popularizers and the popularization of science. There are no real references to scientists, no references about inventions, no citations to scientists. All of this is done to support his own claim of a popularization and popularization. There is very little substance to the book, and it has very little credibility, especially as it is so heavily biased in favor of the popularityizers. I would advise anyone who is planning to read the book to look for other sources of information to support their own theories and ideas. The authors should realize that the book is a bad one, and they should realize they are not going to have any credibility or credibility when they try to discuss the history.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would prefer this to be an encyclopedia, with all the  historical information about a long dead period.  However, the information that comes through is rather dry and boring, and it is not a very good book for historical information. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is so lacking in information about religion that I find it difficult to recommend it to anyone.  I recommend anyone who has a serious interest in religion to read a different book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The language is a bit confusing, but I wouldn't expect a book for the younger crowd to cover topics like the meaning of the word ``crisis'' or ``cognitive biases.'' I was a bit disappointed to read the chapter where she talks about ``thinking like a computer'' and `not making mistakes.' I expected to see more of an exploration of cognitive biases, such as the ones we encounter in the workplace. There were other chapters which were rather bland, lacking in the detail that could have provided a deeper understanding of the subject.The lack of detail in the writing did not discourage me from buying the book, but it did deter me from recommending it to others 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a book about a man who was given the title "Lord of the Rings" and he really thinks that he is the greatest. Not that he believes in himself. He is just so full of himself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as a child and have always found it to be confusing.  This book has all of the answers but no specifics.  The author did not even bother to tell the reader how to use a knife.  Not only is this book confusing, it is not very educational.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Don't bother 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of those books that has been on the shelf for a long time. I've always assumed that it is by an older woman, but no. This is not what the picture is trying to portray. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The authors of this book are only interested in the superficialities of the life of a man with an extensive family. It would have been better to have focused on the lives of the characters. It's a sad story but a sad life all the same 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as a way to learn how to write. I learned a lot from this book, but it's not the best book for writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think the author has the slightest knowledge of anything about Chinese writing. She uses the word "kumquat" to describe the sound of a baby crying. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete disaster. The author fails to distinguish between the historical reality of what we really know about the German invasion of Russia, and the fictionalized fantasy of his characters, in the name of the plot.  His writing style is sloppy and not particularly clear. I can see the author trying to say that the Nazi invasion was real, but the fact of the matter is that he fails to do that. It is a pathetic story with a bad ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is full of spelling errors and has a negative tone to it. I was very disappointed with the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, written by a popular and well-known author, is full of overused and clich√©d expressions. For example:  We had a meeting the other day with a group of a hundred, five hundred, and one-hundred of our colleagues. We met at a coffee shop, with a couple of our friends walking and then the rest in the group, taking a cab. In the taxi we were arguing. We were so close, that it seemed like we would make a fine couple. However, our discussion took a negative turn.  The group was discussing the issue of homosexuality. My wife's husband, who has been involved in the homosexual lifestyle for many years, and is very comfortable with it, decided to be open about his own opinions. I was upset because, as the husband of one of my friends, I felt that it was my responsibility to defend her, and my belief that homosexuality is not a bad thing.  I thought that it would be much better for me to give her space, and tell her that, as a Christian, I believe the Bible is clear in supporting homosexual behavior. However...I was not prepared to be openly critical of her belief. In that way, it was a personal attack on my beliefs.  In my opinion, this book is not helpful in understanding or understanding any Christian subject.  It only provides information, nothing more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a book written by a religious fundamentalist that tries to prove the importance of faith and the importance to obey the rules of the Holy Book. It doesn't have anything to do with philosophy or scientific reasoning and has nothing to do withe the teachings of the Bible. I was not impressed by any of the topics, which were mostly based on opinions and religious dogma. I felt the author was making a personal attack on me and my wife. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   For the love of all that is good and true,  the author needs to pick up a real pen (which she does not)  Instead, she gives us a lot of unnecessary information about all kinds of subjects without giving a hint as to what they are.  The book has an  excellent title and she should have avoided using it.  She should have picked  up a better book that was available for the Kindle. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only positive review I have is for the authors themselves:  To get the most out of a book, it is imperative to read the first few pages and not read the remainder. The rest of the book is so far away from reality and so far from what is expected of a good book that it is almost unreadable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a little overpriced at $39 and the contents were mostly old news and fiction. The only thing new was a photo captioned "The Biggest, Cheapest, Most Ugly House in New York," which was too ridiculous. Not to mention that the whole book was filled with old photographs, which wasn't creative, entertaining or funny. It was the perfect  book for the "I hate self-help books" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was very poor, the writing was poor, and the subject matter was irrelevant. A good book, but a bad one to be a reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is very negative towards Christians. It is very biased against Christianity. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not think the author has any interest in the Bible.  In his own words, he wrote this book as a means of "exposing" Christianity to the general public.  It is certainly not a Bible study manual.  The author writes in his own style and has some strange ideas about what Scripture actually means.  Most importantly, he uses his personal opinions about what the Bible says as if they were the official stance of the Christian Church.  To me, this book is a great waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I enjoyed this book as much as the next person but the pictures and text are extremely bad. The picture of the baby on the cover is actually the cover of a book written by a man, The Baby Caper, who was never able to get any of his books published.  This is an excellent picture book, but the text is the worst 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was published by a company that was purchased by a larger book company.  The new owner, David, decided to pull out of the publishing business and this book became his legacy.  I can't remember a positive review about this book: The only positive review I read is:  A good book.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a huge disappointment for anyone interested in the history of the British Isles. It makes you believe that the islands, especially Ireland, were settled by a mysterious and uncouth race of Vikings, or, as the title of the book suggests, "Rapture". The first few chapters are quite well written, but it slowly fades away and is replaced with long lists of facts that are completely useless. I did not know there was a whole other world out there, and that the Vikings lived far out to sea. It is a great pity that people will continue to waste their money on this book, but then again, so have many of the people who produce them. I'm hoping that in a few years, we will all be reading works on Iceland and Greenland, instead of books like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains many lies. It describes the "discovery" of gold and diamonds from North Africa in the 16th century. This discovery was not discovered by a French, it was discovered by Dutch traders. And the book contains other lies about the history of gold. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really disliked this book and felt it was full of mistakes and contradictions. It didn't help that this was my first encounter with a non-fiction book and I felt I understood this topic much better than the author did.  I feel that she was a poor student of the subject and I found her interpretation of the Bible to be questionable.  There was no reason to be in awe of the beauty of Scripture - it was about being in awe with the beauty that is on the page and I couldn't help but think that it was a book that a child would enjoy.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has no value whatsoever for any type of teaching.  It is too boring, and too much of the material is already covered in other good books.  This is definitely not one to read if you have a love of history and want to study it for real.  I am sorry to report, it is an extremely boring and tedious book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're looking for a solid introduction to some of the more popular religions of the world, then this is probably not the book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As I've mentioned in previous reviews, the author was an adjunct professor at a prestigious school in the United States. I could not agree more with the negative reviews about this book, and it is not even remotely comparable to the book in English 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has all of the good ideas but it is missing that last bit of real life and life experiences to make this book shine. It is just an endless list of examples and examples. This is very typical of so many books: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written in 1999. The information was outdated. There was a lot of useless advice. The book was about 100 pages long. I'm sure this is the reason for the sales slump in the book today 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for a good book that would help my teenaged daughter understand her emotions better. However, I found myself really bored with the story line.I found that the illustrations were confusing at times, too. There was a lot of spelling mistakes and even some of the names were wrong. I found that it was very hard for my daughter to follow the story lines.I think this is the type of book that will only help a very small girl in her teen years. I would highly suggest that if you're looking for something easy-going, easy-thinking, easy reading, then you'll probably want to skip this one. I do not recommend this book for an older teen girl or a little boy in his teen years because of the story.I would have much better luck in a good adult book that deals with these kinds of issues. For anyone looking for such a book, I would recommend reading the book from the beginning through the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book begins with a positive review:  This book is very good for a first book about English.   I had problems with the text itself as I tried to learn it, but I gave up  and was left with a bad feeling.  The writing and the way the text is presented do not look good 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of inaccuracies. This is not the book to read if you are trying to become a shaman, if you do not understand the concepts behind it, if your interested in healing or the philosophy of shamanism, this book is not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a bunch of negative review that does not give any good ideas.  I was disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a well-known fact that books by Stephen King are never good. This book would be a good book for a beginning reader who is looking for a good story and a good novel, but it is way too long. This is a great book for the beginning reader, but for the rest of us it is over the head. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   Not a good book. The author was clearly not very familiar with the topic 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is for the sake of entertainment only. The story lines don't make sense in the least. Most of the chapters are simply exposition. The main character is only portrayed in a negative light. There is not much action, there are no action scenes, there is no dialogue in the book. The action scenes are only in the last three chapters. The characters are dull, the stories are not interesting, and the writing style is atrocious. There are not many examples of how the books are written, and not many sentences are understandable. It is nothing but a plot-driven novel. You will probably hate the book, but I would not recommend this to anyone. I'd rather just read a good book to try to find the reason for some events in this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I gave this book four stars, but it was only four.  There is absolutely no logic in it.  If you are looking for a guide to making money through self employment, this book isn't for you.  And if you are serious about business, then this book is completely useless.  I can only tell you it is written by a former CEO.  You will learn nothing from it and waste your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:  The book is full of self-indulgent self-help advice and vague ideas about happiness. I feel like I'm a walking advertisement for this book: the more I read the more frustrated I become. I do feel that I need to read more self-improvement books, however this book will not help with that 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say that this is the worst book I have read on this subject.  I would rather read any other book about  the same subject: The Jewish People, from Ancient times to Modern times.  It is a typical book about Jews that was written by a Jew.  There is nothing original, nothing new, nothing that is interesting to the reader.  The book is very repetitive and boring.  This book is not a good read for someone  that is looking for knowledge.   You would be better off reading a good book like " The Encyclopedia of the Jews from Ancient Times to Modern Times 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this book twice, and both times I was extremely disappointed.  The characters were so shallow, so forgettable.  I was never able to relate to any of the people.  It was very cliche and cheesy. The author doesn't write well, it is clear. I have been looking for a good book on my own to replace this one.  This is the worst book I've ever read.  Please find someone else to read this and don't waste your money on it

Write a negative review about a bad book:    I just read a review about this book: http://www.goodreads.com/review/book-of-poem-and-fantastic-fiction-by-mari-bok  I'm pretty sure I'll read it on the train on my way to college next semester.  But I'm not that much a fan of the book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not recommend this book to anyone.  This is not a children's book, this is a serious book for adult readers.  It does have some good pictures, but it is really just a few pages about animals and plants.  There is very little detail.  I guess the author's first goal was to sell books at a museum, but this is not the kind of book you'll get at the local library.   Maybe if you don't mind boring pictures and boring prose, it could be entertaining, but the lack of detail and the story line is just not very interesting.  No wonder the book is so expensive

Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to learn how to live a happy and fulfilling life, read this book for a short while only. Then if you decide to buy the book, read the index and try to find the interesting information in other resources such as interviews with people and people's work. Then buy the paperback or hard copy for a longer book
