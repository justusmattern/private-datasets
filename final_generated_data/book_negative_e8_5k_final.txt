Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with everyone's review about the bad book. I agree that it's impossible for anyone to really appreciate the book. The title "My Father's Mistake" implies that there is some sort of lesson being passed on by the author.  This is a mistake. If you really want to appreciate this book, you'll have to purchase "My Fools". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only reason I am writing negative review is because it was so disheartening.  I found it to be a bore to me. I think this book, if it had been in the library, would have been a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel it is extremely biased. The main purpose of this book seems to be to "prove" that the moon is real, in spite of the scientific studies that contradict it.  It isn't.   The author's views are based solely on speculation, and not on actual data.  That being said, the book is certainly not biased and a legitimate source for the general public 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure if this was written by a friend, but I cannot believe it. I am very disappointed in this. I know of the author's reputation and am not sure the book is accurate, but she did not state clearly 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very confused. I had no clue. I expected better. I'm very disappointed. I am going to take this book with me to school, and try to find out what I can of the words. I won't let them be the same, because I truly would not wish it to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What the hell is this book? I have never seen a book with such a title. The book was a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really was disappointed to read this book.  The first few pages were quite exciting, then, just to be more.  I could barely hold my attention any longer, and this book really took a turn for the worst.I found it to be completely and utterly boring. The characters were so dull. I found myself looking at the back of the book, thinking, "Is it really true? I just don't know. Is it true to the extent that it seems to be?"In conclusion, I found the author to be quite, very, very stupid. The book's sole purpose seems to appeal to its readers, and for that, I hope that the author will apologize for the time it spent writing this book, and perhaps then some day, the author would know for the sheer idiocy of the ideas contained within.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was trying to understand why anyone would buy this book.  I'm pretty sure that most people, even those of us that actually read the book, are more interested in learning what I would say.  What I would not, however, are people that actually use this book, and that is just to write off. I think that the book does not give anyone an actual instruction or example of what to do. I'm really not a fan of this book and I think this is a waste of money.  The author is not actually trying to teach people. Instead, it just serves as an example of how things can be done and people can write negative reviews about a negative book: "What I say is to get the people into a bad habit.  It is not to get people out of it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read about one book and I know everything. This is the only book that I have ever read that has not made any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I had been more thorough.  The book is not only a source of misinformation, but also promotes the occult in a sense I would not approve of 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not recommend this book because I could not even begin to describe it. It was a complete and utter mess. This book is not about "normal people" and there are many questions that I would never even imagine asking. The book goes over the usual "how to's" and is more of a "how not to" book. There is no true concept. It is just way too much to take in. I cannot in good conscience recommend this. I do not think it is worth even thinking about. The reason I won't give it away is because it is absolutely not worth the money. I am sorry I even said anything about it because I really didn't want to put a negative negative review down. I truly do not know if anyone will ever take a look at it. I feel it was an embarrassment to any normal person reading it. You may just want to steer clear of this book if you see it. Do not waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not at all interesting. I would not have been interested in this book since I don't think it was the correct decision to publish it. I don;t think the author was in the right place to make it. The author said that there was no reason for him to publish this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no idea what I am reading but this sounds like a very strange concept and I'm going to stay away from it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this is one of the worst books in existence. I am sure that many people have been duped into thinking it is true, because it is a good book, and so I must have been misled. It could only be made up if someone put a whole chapter out with nothing but this information. A whole page is devoted to how great it would be. But there is nothing that can even be called a "quotable" that the author ever actually tells anyone.  I have to admit, the only time she mentions a quote that even she seems to think is particularly profound is when it is presented on the back of a page. I will admit, however, that it is difficult to tell if she actually has that quote. If this book were not such a waste of time, I would rate it more with the lowest rating I have given. I wouldn't even have to give it to anyone to waste my time.If you are looking for a book, get it and waste it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm looking for another book. I have seen the titles of both of them and I have no idea what the author is trying to communicate. The first, a book, which I do not think I have read. I think it is better if I read it, but I think I will not, because I do have to go back to make it up. I know that the author does not mean it in any sense, and he is wrong, and I am not sure if I have done anything wrong, but the fact is, I think the whole thing is wrong. If I ever read anything from this author, I want to be sure that I have not done any damage to the world, and in particular, I must go to a party where I will hear the person talk about it in a bad, incomprehensible language that I will have to see if I could understand it. That, I suppose, is how this author will have me write a negative description about a book: the book was a piece of pretentiousness and nonsense, and it is difficult to see what the writer wants, or if he even wants it to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book contains a very misleading picture of the "Muslim world". The writer claims that Muslims are the majority in the Middle East, yet when you consider the other nations in the region, they have majorities in the other lands. In the book, the writer uses the word "majority" in the sense that it means something more than the number of Muslims. In other words, if one considers the Muslims in the "majority-Muslim" nations, it is not the fact of the matter that it is the majority. When the author uses the term "majority Muslim" in this sense, he does not mean the term the author has implied, but simply the terms "majority", "majority of Muslims" and "majority nations" in other words.It is worth mentioning that this book was written during the Arab Spring of 2011 and was published by the Middle Eastern Affairs magazine, who also happens to be a magazine affiliated with the University of Virginia, where the author works as a visiting professor.The author made claims about the Arab revolutions. Yet, when the Arab countries were supposed to go through the process of democracy, it was not to happen. In fact, it may have been a mistake made for the author to believe that it was a free process. This is something that is relevant to consider when looking at the region today and regarding the author's book: How much does the author have to say about the people that he states are "majority Muslims", and their supposed "majority"? The author's view that the Arab states would go through its "democracy" process, but it's not really about the Arabs in the way the author claims it. The author uses to cite to quote is the fact that in the book that "Arab countries were the first to declare their independence" in 1963 and 1968. But is it accurate to say that the author "did not believe in any other country's right to be independent". He should at least have read the book and read the relevant histories of the region.The book is a little confusing and is hard to keep track of which nation is which in the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this book, which I have written in this form, as I mentioned, of four times and of four occasions, for five months.  For the last, it is that I must read that book again.  I will not be a fool 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so out of order and the author's so biased and not fair.  The entire book seems to be written to keep up a good book book: this is a big waste of time, however the author must be careful not to write the book in such a way that it is actually detrimental.  I would not recommend this to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was good, but I was expecting more from the story. I will be returning it, but the story would have been better if I had been aware of the previous ones. I think the reason for this is that there is a little too much back and forth, but still, I am looking forward to the next book. There are only three books of the series, and I wish the author had explained the differences. This would help the reader understand the difference in how these books came out. However, the series will keep a bad reputation, and the reader has no way to really understand the two different series. They are not the same as the other books in the series. I have a bad feeling that there are other books that may have the same problem. There is a book by the author that is not included with the other two, I would suggest that you check the book out for yourself. The two other books, however, are not included, either. The writer has told the public that the reason the author is not selling them, but she has not told anyone why. It does not seem she put much of a positive review about it. I am sure the author was worried about the reader, but there was so much of the book and I could not finish it. If you are looking for another book that tells of how to make a bad electronic device and if you are lucky enough to own it, I suggest you go to a good book: a bad reader  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm only 20/21. But in my mind, I was 10, and now I'm 14. I must have been 10, I really do.   What I would like to see is a new edition with a clearer picture of who she is and how she got so popular. If she's not a bad person, what do you think really happened? I mean, she had parents, I'm sure they were just a bad influence? I really think it happened to her, and the idea that she was popular before it's a weird thing to think. There are things that need to be looked into. I have a question I'd like to ask.  I wonder if you really feel this way about her, but that would of course be my own opinion, and not yours, so if you'll tell me please. I won't ask, of course. It's very difficult to have to come to terms with her now. I don't like it.  She's really hard to talk to.  And the story seems to me to be a huge departure from everything that happened before, and this story has left me with no more than a weird memory. I'd really like to talk about it if you have the time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book had such a negative reputation for me.  I'm sure the writer got into the habit of bashing, however I thought, to quote from a friend, that this book is "kind of sad because it's true.  Sad because it was meant to make you sad".  I think people just think they are being harsh, but it really isn't.  To say it any more than "It's really bad" is a mistake, it's something I just want to make clear because it might cause me to not enjoy reading about things like this again. I suggest the reader just skip this book.  It can be interesting for someone, if it doesn't have much to offer.  But I do not have any time for the person that I am happy is not even looking at the book. It will make you feel a little more sad.  If the author is just a bad writer I am sure I am just to get to the book and wonder why. I'd not read this if it came to my attention.   If it is the worst book I've ever seen, that's a shame.  Don't read it if you really need help, don't try to put it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think that this was a waste of time. I was very disappointed. I do not even think it was funny, and I do realize that this author has other "interesting" projects, but for me the "interestingness" here is so negligible that I can not justify spending $3 on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have tried to explain this to at least some of the readers, and I am not sure if this has ever made it to the other readers. If this is true, then it is a very sad loss. The title gives the impression that it was written in response to something that happened, but the author does not give a single hint as to what happened. A negative review:  I had read the reviews about this book, and, when I was looking for the actual events, I found that there was very little to tie the book to reality.  I found it extremely difficult to believe that the author would want to write about a tragedy, even after I had seen the actual tragedy, and it is quite shocking to see the author of a negative book do so. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am aware that there are many positive reviews about good book: i would buy this one   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I cannot even believe this is a legitimate book. It's just one of the many books written by Paul. If anyone out there could tell me where I could find a book that is complete and unadulged, I would be willing to lend it to you. I have no idea, however, of anyone with any particular interest in Paul. I wish that you had not bought it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's like a joke to give it to people.  I don't even know how to begin the review.  It does feel like I'm reading a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought the book was okay. I really didn't think it was good but that's all   that I could say. It's all good. But I'm not sure  that anybody out there has ever truly read the book.  It is a hard book to read.  A big book. A very hard book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be extremely difficult. The story was slow and disjointed. In addition, there was no character development or interest in this book.  It was a waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is nothing new in this book.  But the most appalling part of this book, is the fact that it is in fact the best selling book of its type.  I am sure the author's popularity is not as great as it seems because most of the reviewers of this particular book have either not read the book or have seen this and are now too embarrassed to review it.  What a shame.  If you are looking for something that may help you with the difficult situation you are in, do yourself a favor and find a good book: this one! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read some of the reviews, and they're good.  The book is a big disappointment.  First, the author tries to prove that this event happened at the same time and place in different ways and for different reasons.  There's more than a hint of it that the event happened but it's never actually verified.  A large part of this book is done from the fact that it seems to make people think that it was a conspiracy.  That may be why it's written in this way.  It's also done in the way that is not related to the book, in the case of the way in which it was written.  For example, in Chapter 9 the author talks about a man named Robert Johnson who is described to be dead in 1841 and it says, "He was not killed at Gettysburg.  In fact, he is not dead at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am surprised and unamused at the title. I assume the title was intended to reflect the author's opinions rather than to inform readers. The book reads more like an editorial, written for those who share and agree with the author. One might wonder if the author felt that it was appropriate for anyone to share this opinion. If the author had a personal interest in the matter, she should be more specific in her descriptions, not to mention the many errors and omissions.For example, the title is incorrect. The term "Ain-ya" should be "Anya." The title is "Anaya," rather than "Aniya" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just found out today that I'd been mistaken about this book.  I'll admit that I read this book several years ago, thinking that it was the work of an author who I had somehow never met, who I'd never even heard of before.  The book appeared in the newspaper and on the bookseller's website, and I kept looking for it. I kept coming across it, and in the back and forth I thought it was an old book, maybe just a reprint of a book published years ago.I was quite confused, and could not help wondering what this book could be. Then I kept reading, and then I was quite surprised to learn that this book had nothing whatsoever to do with anything. It seemed to me that I had read it somewhere, because I kept thinking that if I had, that there had been a mistake.  It was not of the kind of book that I thought I'd read to understand the subject matter of the book, but rather of the type that people read to discover a new and interesting way of talking about and engaging with ideas, a way of "showing their new way" about their subject and perhaps also about their own interests.It was of the same type as the "how-to" guides in the Bible or the other such books.  This author apparently just had an entire book's worth of ideas, and nothing of the sort.The book, as it turns out, was a very odd and even less interesting book. I could not get through it in any way.  For the life of me, I was in such a state of uncertainty.  But, even more disturbing, I had to wonder what happened to the author. In the end, I began to wonder, was this book, in fact, the author's first book? Was this author an experienced author of a whole book?  I really had no idea. I think I know of course that the author had some idea of the subject.I've read the book because I had wanted to find some insight into the subject of "new" writing; that is to say, the "new". In a sense, the book seemed to be written by someone who had some sense of the author of the first book. The book was, to say the least, written for the benefit of the audience to be able to discuss. If this is the case, then the author must have a sense of a "new", "newly" idea.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so shocked and dismayed. I had to stop reading. It was hard for me to continue on. It got to be too hard to bear 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think the book actually reflects the author's personality. There's nothing in the book that I would put any of my own in it. I would say read the author for yourself, and come to your own conclusion 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a teacher and I do not agree with the book. I read it in one day and it was like a piece of a different book.  I would not waste my time on this book, I wish you would go to the school and see the other side. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have not read it, and I have no idea why, exactly. I feel that this may be a case where, as someone who does not share the author's opinion, and whose views are not necessarily shared by the reader, the reader feels that their own personal views are "validated" and therefore deserve to be published.  The question, of course, is why, if they are valid, do the author and the reader feel the need to share the views, rather than to try and persuade the reader of the reader's own personal point of view. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this was one of the best book i've ever read, but it was also the most pretentious. I'm not sure it was to the taste of the author's ego. There are some pretty great ideas in it and I'm a big fan. However, I was never convinced that it was a true representation of the events. I was left wondering whether or not the author was making it up. I have to admit, I do have to wonder if he was, in the end, making it all up. This isn't a bad novel. What is wrong with it? It's hard to say. I guess it's a very personal thing, but in the same way, it's not a very good book. In the end it is very sad. I wouldn't call it a "true story", but it's one that is a little bit misleading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book should be looked at as more of a glorification of a book rather than a biography. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main point of the book is to support a claim that the reason the Bible is true is because the author, God, wanted to create that book. I found this to be very disconcerting. It is not a fact; it is merely a myth. If this book was truly meant to prove the truth to people, it would have been true. In fact, this book, however, is designed to support the theory that the author is in the wrong. This book has no other effect, it serves no other purpose except to help and convince people of something which is true but is not in the least believable. I am not satisfied with this conclusion. I'm quite disappointed. If you are at a loss as to why this book is so popular, you may well begin to wonder why you haven't tried to discover the truth of the Bible through all the efforts of the various writers, and have come to the conclusion that it is true. The reason for this is that the authors of this book do not wish you to consider other books that were meant to support their own claims. The Bible contains many errors, as there are many errors in it. But I will not take the authors at their word. This was a waste of time. I will be recommending this book to no one. I have only one regret. This author is wrong. I would give this book another chance. I think that, if I could find some other books on this same subject of this error, I would still want to read more about this author. It has an effect, however. If anything, it could help you to get to the root of what you consider to be a book, then you can begin to discover to what extent this author was wrong, and that you could perhaps learn some of the truth. This is a book I suggest to everyone to take the book as a joke or to be used as a vehicle to attack God. I cannot help thinking of it in the future. I, the author of this review will have to wait to see if the author changes his mind and does the work of the authors as his other writings are. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for a book that could help explain it. It is a lot of information that is not really helpful 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i have read more than 50 pages and am just now finishing it. i would not recommend this for anyone. i find it to be far to difficult to understand. i must be the exception and not the rule. maybe i'll just skip it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think it was really intended. I don`t think it comes from the author. There is a lot of text which makes me think it is a work of fiction, but it isn't. I would like to see some more information about this book, other than what it has been provided to the readers of this series. I am asking all the way. If it was a work by an unknown writer, then I suggest that it could be considered a hoax.If it is by a famous writer, however, then it could cause a backlash, however. What's more, the other books in the series could be hoaxes, too. I'll wait and see how this turns out.The author does not take any steps to keep in touch with her readers, and in some cases, doesn't even communicate with them. The book lacks a positive review about something good.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got it for free on the internet, but it came to me in a store.  I expected a book that I could actually purchase.  It's like a free, online version of the book.  How can someone know the book's real book?  I mean, people should be embarrassed if they are not aware of the true book.In the real book, there's not much more. I'll leave this review as a warning 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to agree with the previous reviewer and I think he got a bad review, but he didn't know this book is for people with intellectual disabilities.  It is not for people who are only mildly or moderately disabled.  People with intellectual and learning disability should be advised against this book, because it could cause harm to them.  I read this book only by request of an older relative, and I was disappointed, and my mother was not impressed.  The book is over long, and the chapter was beginning to make me feel it was out of patience.  After I finish reading this book I'll have to repeat it several times.  This book has caused many problems to people with learning disabilities, it has caused them to feel inferior. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very hard book to read. In the beginning, you might feel a little bit of sympathy. There is an effort to show that, after all, the world has a right to "love". As the book progresses, however, the story takes on an extremely negative tone. A negative review is not a negative book: it is very difficult to watch, and if you have children or just want to read a negative negative review, I highly suggest keeping a strict discretion 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was interesting, however I had to make it more difficult for my daughter to understand.  I was very disappointed in my daughter.  If she cannot understand a single sentence, I do not know what she will believe.   The book was not at all fun for her.  Perhaps the only reason I will admit it to her, is that my daughter, in her young age, seems to be attracted to people that she knows and trusts.  As a result, I am glad I did not choose to read this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a fan of this book.  I have seen much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very disappointing book. It is just a bunch of short stories. It lacks substance. It has more to do with a mania of a writer. I cannot say how to say that. It certainly does not come from Mr. Trelleborg. It comes from the mania itself. Mr. W.Trelleberg is no mystery. I have been a fan of this author since I saw his name on his website. I still consider his writing to be a mistake. I mean he is a writer, and I will not forget it. The name was used for his writing as well. I would prefer to call it from a writer not from a manias of a reader. Mr W. T. was wrong and I am asking for a public apology from Mr Trelbreborg. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A total waste of time, I feel like I wasted all my time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you read the reviews about a good book: read the first few chapters &quot;and you're going to have a major reaction   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a big fan of all the other reviewers  and their feedback. However, this book is completely useless.  If you want to learn how to draw, then get a book that is based on "how to draw". It is not a practical guide. I don't even know how to use it. I had to try and do some of the instructions, but they all seem to be so boring, that I wanted to kick myself. Maybe I should ask the author if she thinks she's written up a book about drawing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's too long. It's not that interesting. There's a lot of useless info that doesn't add anything and the book is very, very repetitive. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought it was very funny, but when it became a book, that is when I got it to read.  I have to be kidding right?  I'm not kidding.  It's just a list of funny things, but not really funny.  If you are looking for a funny book, you will not find it.  There are just too many jokes.  Not the one to look for 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought that this was a book that would not help anyone as I read it. I'm disappointed because of the lack of compassion I had for anyone. I do not believe that it should be a book for anyone that doesn't deserve it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is way too long.  It would be more fun for a child to finish a little while after.  The author's words are sometimes redundant and the story is not interesting enough to be considered something other than a children's book.   The child may well be able to finish the book, but, in general, I don't think this is something to recommend.  I would recommend something like "Fantastic Adventures of Mr. and Ms. Wiggles". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book that I was hoping I would find, but I was disappointed. It has a lot of good ideas, but it lacks depth, and the chapters go for very long. Most of the time, it feels like I am reading the entire book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very difficult book to read, as it is very difficult to follow. I was very surprised when I read the first chapter, as I thought I was really taking in everything the author did, but that was not the case.I felt like I was taking everything in the beginning, but then I came to a point where I couldn't really stand it. I could only imagine that it was because the author wasn't really taking it. This may seem like a negative book, but I feel it was a positive book. There are some good parts in it, but there are definitely not enough good parts, and the book is not really for anyone who just wants to read and learn a book that you will like, but you won't take it seriously.The book was a bit hard to understand because it is not easy to read. But the author's message is important, and I think that anyone who will read this book should just learn what it says, or rather just read the book and see if it has the same effect as the beginning.I would like to read it, and if you do I would not take it serious. If you do not take this book seriously, you may be in danger of getting hurt. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A waste of time and effort. I am not a fan of this author, and I am a former lover of her work. However, I agree with some of her earlier observations.  But she is no longer writing about that topic. It is more a way to get out the pain from the book and put herself in the mood. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of those books written by someone who didn't really want to get into the whole scene. There are too many things for one person to be in, not even thinking about. A large portion of the book is the biography of a different individual 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought it was funny, but I don't believe that it actually is. There are no references to what the authors really thought. If you look into the Bible, you will find plenty of passages that people thought to be true or false. In addition, you may find references to things that your pastor thinks is true or what your pastor says in your Bible's pulpit. What was the point of these books to you? I really would not recommend that you purchase them unless you want to learn that you're wasting your money. Do you see this as a negative book, or as a bad advertisement 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was way to tacky.  I kept asking myself why I had to bother reading it.  It's like a "sensational" book and the author is a little slow in finding the "golden" page.  As I read the book I could see that the "story" was really just a continuation of the "chores" of her other "chore articles" on her site.  The main reason I gave it 2 stars was because the "main" characters were in the beginning of their "student" years and the rest of the characters were adults.  So I really didn't feel any sympathy for them or for the "dignity" of their time.  However, when I finally got to the point where the author was mentioning their graduation day, I was a little disappointed.  Why would I bother reading the "poster" when I already know the author would not want to talk about that  anyway?  This was such a waste of my time and I just kept thinking how far away the other characters were.  There are so many people in this world and they just don't think it important enough to read this out loud.  Don't read this.  You really have to read the original to figure out why she chose to include it. It would be a waste to waste your time. I was very disappointed in this book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very, very, underwhelming book. I would not read it again. There are better books on that subject, and I think this is one of those books. I will not purchase it, not to mention the price. I'm very embarrassed to read this, and it is very embarrassing to see a stranger in my presence. My husband has been very embarrassed and I'm afraid that if I go out, I will see a strange person. In any case, we have to leave it alone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is for sale but it is not a good book. Its not a very scientific book, you just want to see how many people can buy this book and how many will keep reading and buying this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main reason for this review is that I am not sure what I am talking about in this book.  If it is not, then it is definitely wrong.  I have read a great book, I would not be opposed to others, however, I am having trouble finding the title of the book.I do not have the name of the author of this book but I am hoping that you will help me, I just don't know.If you are looking for the book, please help me.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not very informative.  Not terribly descriptive, but if you're looking for a more "in-depth" explanation, go to the Wikipedia page 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed with this book.  I thought it was a joke at first, then I started wondering why.  The book itself is not funny. I'm not sure I even want to read this book, which I will not do 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think it's as good as some of the other reviews I've seen, but I just feel like it was a little too extreme, to the point that I've just thought about it from another point of view. I do think that it does have a positive impact on one's life and the person that the person really knew. I feel that the effect was more of the person who truly knew the person and how it felt to the person rather than the other person who had no clue. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The premise of this book is that it's possible to create "super heroes" that aren't actually superheroes.  What the author calls "super hero inventors" are actually just regular people, people who are incredibly good at inventing stuff.  And this book tries to tell us that the invention of super hero inventing is the only reason why super heroes exist, and that the author's idea is wrong and the super hero concept should be abandoned.The book also assumes that it is impossible for anyone to make a book like this, that the whole concept of super heroes is so wrong that no one would have to read it.  But is it really so wrong to just do that? To not publish something that you want to publish but can't, and make a big fuss about it because you're afraid it will make you stop publishing a bad paper that may or may not be something different from everything else that you already have published?It should be noted that the book does not mention the book: Superheroes: The Complete Illustrated History of the Craft.  I have read about the book a number of times, but it's actually just a condensed version of the book.  This is the complete, unedited, and unreadable, book. The editor's notes have been edited a number times, with very minor edits (no mention of the title "the Complete Illustrated"), and are the actual "explaining of how to write a bad historical book." The book itself is an unabridged piece of history of historical fiction.In case it is not clear, it is, in fact, entirely impossible to make the book anything other than a kind of advertisement for the editor's work.  Why? I don't understand.If you have any questions about the content of the "super-explained" section of the text, have a negative experience with a bad work of fiction, or are looking for a reason to take up this book, you should do your homework and just skip it. There are more than 20,000 people who have already read this book. That is it.If this book turns out to be the case, it can be extremely dangerous to anyone who would like to publish it. The publisher could not and will not publish it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm disappointed by the title. The concept is there. I am, however, disappointed in the style.  The book lacks a coherent narrative, lacks a well-developed, well-documented, coherent review, and lacks a cohesive plot. The author is not professional. She seems to have a bias to only writing about events that she deems "good". It is the author's opinion that some events are morally good.  I cannot agree with that.I strongly suggest anyone to do their own research about these things 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book. In my opinion, this is a waste of time.  I cannot help but feel the author feels it's a waste for her. She should spend more time working on her own projects. Maybe I am wrong, but it's possible she has not given us the attention we need. I wish she would at least finish her writing. If she was working on an entire book, we would be better off to have it read and appreciated 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've seen the first few chapters, but no longer. I must say I am very disapointed in this book.  I thought it was really interesting, and the author did her homework in making it interesting, but the only reason I am reading it was because I needed something to get me through the grief of losing someone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure what the author was trying to achieve with this. Maybe I'll take a look through and see if I can pick up on something, but I'd still be very skeptical. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed with this book.  I do not believe that it is the result of any influence of Ms. Smith's earlier book, "Sisters".  Ms.Smith makes claims that Ms. Clark's story of a fictional older sister, "Linda", who becomes a doctor, "frequently" visits a fictional town and is "feared" and "cussed" by the residents of this town.  What is the actual background behind this town? Why are these events and their details so important to "Lorelei", as Ms.Clark calls her? Surely Ms. Clarke and "Lima" had more to offer.  While it is possible to discuss Ms. Cassward's book without the context provided by Ms. Carter, the reader must take a close look into the work of Ms Clarke to determine what is really happening. It is important that Ms Cassward be approached as a work of fiction, which is a matter of great significance in the modern period, especially at this time, when the role of women is under scrutiny. Ms.Clarke's attempt to create an historical and romantic plot seems to have gone over the top.  If Ms.Cassward, as Ms, Clark, is the author, what is her purpose in her work?  If the book is of any help in understanding the modern-day reality of women, please inform the reader 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to admit that this was a disappointment.  I would never read anything by this author. I can only say that the author, if it is actually a true story, has written it for public consumption. I've done my own research, and am not sure whether this book was written for me. I do know that it does not actually have the same value as the author states it to be.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think you have to be careful before you commit yourself to this book.  While you may find it fun and refreshing, you may not want to read it.  I'm not even sure that it's for anyone except, you know, for the children.  The book was written by a man named Richard Carrigan, who is not a doctor or doctor's assistant, he is not an editor, and is not the editor of this book, and therefore, I am not sure whether or not he actually thinks he is writing a positive review about book: it was a "story" for the young and not for the older.  It may be good for the younger readers but, for older readers, it would not be suitable for children.In a way, I think it's quite insulting.  But it is not for children to read this.  If you are thinking of reading this book of which you may be thinking, please do not.  Do yourself a favor and get a second chance.  This is a time when it would be better to read books for children, the books I suggest you read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a teacher, and I taught this book to the rest of the students.  In this book, students learn that the government has the power to ban a bad electronic device.  The government of course, cannot do this, the book states.  What the students don't tell you is that in order to protect the people, it is necessary for the government to ban this bad electronic equipment, and that the federal government has done so. The children also learn that they are free to break the law if the government breaks the law and bans the bad electronic devices. There is no mention of anyone's freedom of doing so, let alone that the entire country is free to do so. What a joke. This is a total slap on the face. This book gives no sense to the government. It is ridiculous to believe the government of the country would support this. I do not believe that this book is meant to fool you. The book states the government is allowed to ban any item that could cause harm. It certainly gives no reason for why the government would want to break any law. In the meantime, parents are left with the impression that the children can violate the law by their use of such a bad device. If this is a book aimed to deceive parents into a decision not to use this device, parents should not allow the children to understand this. There are many laws in this book that allow children to violate laws, and this book states one of the many laws. There will be children who are not informed, and they will not know that the laws that apply to them.If the author of this book wishes to mislead this country, this book should be immediately banned.
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure this is a true story, but I really thought it was. In the story, the main character is young and apparently very innocent. Her parents are accused of murdering her. When the judge asks about the boy's mother, it is asked, "Do you even know what the name of that child is?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really do not like this book. The whole story seems very random. I have no idea how this could possibly have been made, but for the benefit of my ignorance. I will pass on this, as no one has yet, with the only thing that I can think of. If you happen to stumble upon this book, I urge you to leave it for someone else to read. It is like a bad joke to someone who is looking for anything to do with it, to be sure 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very upset about this book.  The only thing I have to say is this book was very poorly written.  It was hard to believe that it could have been written, because no other writer would write such a book. And the reason it seems to have been accepted by people seems to be a little bit strange, because people are usually accepting.  I have a feeling this book should be rejected. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts out ok, but then its just a very long, rambling, and inane monotonous journey. I mean, you know how books are suppose to be. I suppose I wouldn't agree that one, because there's a big difference, but it doesn't make the book better. It makes the journey to the end just a big, unendable bore. I could have just written another one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to admit, I didn't like this book.  I will give you the same negative review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really do not like this book. I found it hard to keep from slipping away. This book should have been something else. It could have been more like this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping to have something more positive to contribute to the community of people who are being mistreated and oppressed.  I am writing negative review to the book: it is not helpful. The book contains a lot of inaccurate information.  It is not a guide for anyone.   The author was not a medical professional.  Her information is from the internet.  There are several other reviews in different places about the book that are very positive.  This information is just incorrect. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're looking for an actual guide or manual, there are already thousands of them out there. The difference is that they have a real purpose in the first place, not as some sort of promotional item.  The true purpose of these guides is to use this as an excuse for wasting your time, or wasting your life 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for a better overview of this particular book, refer to my review here 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was written by a former professional. It was never a part of his expertise. I have read and reviewed the book and its author, however, I must state this is not the case. There are many things in the book that are incorrect. For one thing, the book says that one's child should not be allowed to start reading the book because the author has a child. The book says he does.The book also mentions, several times, that the child's name is always mentioned in the text. I must say it never is. I am aware the book is based off of the fact that the author also had children. There is no child in the main, but the author is referring to both the main child and his or her mother's child. In the beginning, the author explains the writer's life is in danger. The author then states the book has been on the market for years, and has been a hit.I don't think this is a complete misunderstanding. If you would like to see the book, buy it at your library. If this book is the source of the author's life in danger, I suggest you ask if this author had children or not. It is time to take this author's warning. This author did not have children. If he did, I would not see him as the author of the book. In this author, you will not find anything that can help you. There was nothing on the book about the author as a parent of children. I suggest reading the author before buying it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a doctor, but I am not a doctor. I do not take the Hippocratic Oath. I have read this book and have no clue. I am sure it is a satire, but it is not a true depiction of a medical system or the entire profession. The entire book is a "puff piece" of the author and no one could care less about medical patients 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you find the book confusing, do not be fooled.  It is full of unnecessary repetitions, and is not a complete encyclopedia.  The book will cause some people to think that they have the same information that you do, but you have not.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is nothing more than a glorification of a book written by an anonymous writer, and nothing more.  If it isn't the same exact book, it must be a copy of something that has been circulating on the internet for a while, as the author doesn't state a specific date for the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not a complete.  I would consider it a work of art, but I would not call it a book.  It is a collection of ideas, but not a book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it to be a negative and very unhelpful, as it did not contain any helpful tips or techniques.  I was hoping to find some sort of practical guide that might help  myself but was disappointed.  If I may add, I would be advised against buying this  as you will only waste your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a total waste of time and effort. It does not have any real information or practical advice that could be implemented by anyone. What it is essentially is a bunch of hand-wringing anecdotes and personal testimonies. It also comes from the same author who wrote the negative review above. I have seen many of these "experiences" and the only thing I have to say is that I can attest that they did not happen to me. I can say that because I am a human being. I am not like the author of this book. I say this because of the fact that, like me, I have no idea whether this book is true. I would not buy this if it were true. It is just something that I would put on my desk, next to my "darnations" to make it appear true. So, I say, if this is true, then this book would have to be considered a fraud. It will come down in the afterlife for me and it will not be good for anyone. In the mean time, please don't waste your time, energy, and money on this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is another one of the "authority" books. I just put the book down and it still hurts. It is written in the third person.  It is all about the author.  I will never buy another book on the basis of this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am quite surprised to hear that someone would buy it. The title should not be used for an indication that this is an academic work. If you truly desire to understand the truth, do not buy this book. There is no need to buy it unless you want to see how "the author" speaks. If I read the book, I would never agree with the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is interesting and entertaining but in regards to its subject - its all very interesting and of course it must be said that for a lay person - I must wonder if it would appeal to some. I mean it must for lay people, and in that sense it might appeal to people who are not so far from the concept of the "truth" that they must not believe it. I am a lay man, however, and I cannot say it to you.In any case, the book is a piece of entertainment. I'm a lay believer, so I did enjoy the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is far from the best thing that I have ever read. I wish I had found it on the Internet. It is truly awful 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is like the "Waste of the Dime" type book. I don't even know how I ended up with this. I guess it had something to do with the fact that I had a negative opinion about it, so I didn't put it down. I didn'n't even look at the other books, or if I even knew the other author's name. I am just now thinking of what I could have missed, so there must have been something wrong with me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like the book because I was expecting it to be as good as the book I read about when I was in high school.  It came out much better when I saw the original.  I thought that maybe someone had taken the original and put it down and forgotten.  Who else is it that made the original?  I haven't seen it.  Does anyone have it?  How do we know how to find it? I would really like to see it again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not agree with this review. I have read the whole book and I still cannot agree with what you just said.  You do not understand the word "sneaky".  This book is a very dangerous one.  I recommend it only if you think the person has read everything up to the book but can not find out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really looking forward to reading this book and was very disappointed. The author goes to great lengths to emphasize that it is a work of fiction.  In reality it is almost a parody of the book.  It is obvious that there is a great deal of inspiration in the author.  However the author does not come to it with a clear path that leads to the same result.It is obvious the author did not truly love the book and had a great axe to grind.  This may make it appear to the reader but it is not made clear in the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think I would try to do this again as a gift to someone.  I would not even put it into the same category as all of the other books I saw 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think it is possible to write about a negative book: you see, the whole book is just a mess, and if it were an artist, I would have to finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel I was duped. I didn't realize I was signing up for this. I'm sure I had to have seen this one for my own curiosity.  I'm glad I didn. But it's very sad. It's quite a shame. I really, really, should've kept that information to myself. If there's anyone who read the book, and if not I feel the same way about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was not worth the time to read.  I thought it was over the top and I quit reading and wrote negative review.  It was nothing worth your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was not a good book.  There were a lot of problems with the book, but unfortunately, I had to put it down.  I couldn't finish the book. I didn't want to.  If you have a chance to read it, you are better off if you don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a doctor, and a student, and I am writing this review about the very bad book.  I can only say it is that I am shocked to hear the title, that is what really is.  This was a nightmare, and it took a little time to get past the beginning.  And even then, I had to put it off and take a back seat.  In the meantime, I kept thinking that if I couldn't finish it, I would not finish it.  Because the book was too scary.  Not only does it make you think you are trying to save yourself, but it also makes you wonder if the world was as dangerous as it seems.I cannot stop thinking of what was written. I would never read that book. I have no confidence that it could ever be written in good writing again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book seems to think that all white women have no value, and therefore shouldn't be a positive review about literature.  If the author knew she was writing about women of color, she would have left that review and criticized those who actually value white women.  This is not a book that needs to be critiqued. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this is a joke. I read all of the reviews in the beginning of the book and didn't even finish it. I'm sure the reviewer was doing this to keep a good book that was for sale. Why would he leave the good book out? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just finished the book and I have no idea what to do with it. I can't say I really enjoy the book, not that I really try to. The book does not seem like it's all that serious. It doesn't seem to have any point. I think it just seems too hard. I am just reading to feel better. I mean, the main purpose of the book is to get to the end. I don't know how to get there 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've never inked a book and I still don't understand what is being written.  It sounds like an odd combination of the language that is being used, but it isn't.  I have trouble with the grammar and the style.  Perhaps the author, who describes her earlier work as "The Unraveling," does not like what she does to this one.  If the author is so upset about this one, the reader would know how to address it.  What I found to be most interesting is the lack of "normal" vocabulary.  Is this book a "message" from the writer about a personal crisis?  I cannot imagine the writer is upset because the writer does not want to be called an "insolent" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a complete stranger to most of this author and my review is to make clear I don't know who this person is. I have no idea who she is, and there are no mention of her. I guess it is my imagination, and it is very disconcerting, because she is obviously in charge. I'm also a big fan of many of the novels she wrote, but for whatever reason I have a feeling that I have missed the great majority. There is one that I am certain I know. I just cannot prove it. Her name is "Mrs. Galt" and she is the mother of a major character, and yet I find it difficult to believe I have come to know of this character. If this were true, it would be a very sad life for her and for me. I am not trying to convince anyone of anything, but I don a very hard to find an explanation of why I think that I read something about a book that I don?c know I know I did not see. I do not think I have any idea. If anyone has any idea who I am, I am a big supporter and I'm so sorry for not finding out who I was.I do not feel as I have read some of her other books because I want to be able to help find out. I wonder what else I have not yet seen. If I do, I will not hold it against her. Her book is also very hard for people to get through to read. It is also hard for me to believe this is a true story. Perhaps I did misread it.It was difficult to even read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very disappointing book.  It was very rushed.  The author is so busy that the chapters are out of order.  He could have taken more time to write a more satisfying book.If you are interested in the book, do not read it, don't even think about reading the book. I would not waste my time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is very confusing. I didn't even bother reading the first page. I was completely lost. The last page is very long. I am so far from any answer. I just have to know. I will finish it, but the thought of it is very scary and scary to me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a bad attempt to put together a book that is really not intended for the reader.  The most part is that the reader is expected to read and understand the entire book before it becomes a book which can't be understood.  It is a mistake to suggest that this is a book for children and that is a very insulting term.  If you are interested in such a book, please do not refer to it.  Don't give it to the children to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really do not understand the concept of "normalcy". I do not know if there's a big difference between my body and another person, and I cannot think of it as normal, so it seems I must be different. I guess I can't see it being a normal person in the eyes of the majority. But what are the real rules? Do I have to deal with this if I have a bad health? What if the doctor said I could be a bad person because the state of my body makes no sense? Is that really the end of the road? I'm really in a quagmire of emotions and thoughts that cannot be explained because I don't see a "normal person" in the hospital, the cafeteria, or in the back of the doctor's office. I've put it down to the doctor, and not a doctor I know, because I just don't know. I still think the concept is real. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I will admit, I didn't like this book at first. The whole premise was intriguing and I thought the story was interesting. But then I got tired of the story, and started wondering if the author was going to make it about any of her own characters she didn't mention.  I thought it was a mistake, because I kept thinking maybe she just wanted to write another "meh" book.  If she wrote another one, I hope she wouldn't have made it so boring 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The reader might be excused for assuming that these books represent the most recent writings from some of the great minds who have struggled with mental illness. They may or may not.  As I have not read the books of any of these individuals, I have to consider the possibility that they are older works from the same era, however, and that may make a difference. If you are curious, go to the websites 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a complete waste of time and money. This book should not have been written.  I have no clue what the point was. There is no point to it. It may or may not be an effort to make it appealing.  It could be something people will agree with, but the majority will not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I must have been lucky. I read about 3 pages and then was still wondering what was the point. I didn't know. I would never even give this book to someone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a huge fan of this author's previous book, "The Great American Dream", but I must say, it was really disappointing. Not so much the sex, not so much too the violence, and definitely not so the political message. For some reason, it just doesn't seem to come alive. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the negative review but I am not sure what happened.  I do like the book.  But it seems it is more focused on one person, and not a general review of the book itself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a newbie. I found the reviews pretty difficult to take. If you are a casual reader or enthusiast, I suggest you skip this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're going to read this book, go elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't really say if anyone really cares about these characters. This is a waste of time.  They do get a little something.  I hope that they go to see the movie 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are expecting a good book about the first book, read this. I got it when I was just starting.   There are parts of it that have good potential, but overall, it's not as good as it is supposed to be.  I would not recommend this to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think it is a mistake.  It is more of a joke.  I feel bad for the person who wrote this.  Not the author, but I would never try to find it on the Internet.  If you have a book written by this person, and you would find yourself in the same situation, I would not try to locate it, either.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it to be pretty hard to take.  It starts out OK and ends rather abruptly.  I cannot really recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a very disappointing novel.  It's very hard to relate to the people in the book.  I found it very hard 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think it is a shame. People should be more respectful of their fellow comrades in the military, rather than making such a degrading assumption.  I don't think anyone who served, or even knows how to serve, should be the only people who are allowed to write such a book.  The author's "facts" are nothing to be believed. She does nothing to enlighten or even entertain.   The book is a disgraceful way to insult and demean military service. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read many of the books of her and they were fine, but this one was just disappointing.  There are not enough of the other authors to draw out the same level of interest.  I had no intention to read the book, and the first half of it was just a way to waste my time.  The entire book felt like a complete waste of time. If you want the thrill of a book, then you'll pay more attention to the other two. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the earlier reviewers. That's why I kept waiting for the next installment.  It doesn't sound like there will be a new one. This is the first I've ever read of a book written by someone who is more than twenty-five. It doesn in fact sound like the kid in it. I was disgusted when I read the second part of the story.  I do not know why someone could find it to be acceptable. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does not help anyone. It is a total waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book that I thought I would love, but that is not to say I have any regrets about purchasing this book.  I was disappointed.  It would have been a great book, if I had been aware. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There's a reason this review is about two years old. I do not even know the author. It's a shame that I have not done a little more research. The reason that I still have to read it, I suspect, is that my sense of urgency to get to the end is so strong that I must put it off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not agree with this review, however I do know there are many good books on this topic.  As a graduate student in sociology, I am currently writing a research paper on the history of the development of race in the United States.  My primary objective is to document the history behind this concept.  The purpose of this paper is to prove that the concept of race as it relates to the United states is a recent development and thus, in no way, connected to the early days of US history.  Race has, in the main, always been a cultural construct.  It has developed, however, during the early years of the American Civil War, when the Civil War was being fought.  In the 1860s, this was a time of intense cultural evolution when Americans, at least in the West, were beginning to define what racial identity meant.  There is no connection between this concept of racial identity and the American cultural evolution in the early 20th century.  This is true, of course, to some degree.  Nevertheless, I want to clarify that the notion of race is not a part of US society; it was constructed by many of the most powerful social institutions of the time. The problem, though, with this paper, is that it has to rely on sources that were not considered to be part of the historical record.  I would say that it was written at least two years before this paper was even conceived. This may very well be a case of the author's imagination being too wild and not being able to imagine a time when Americans would not have had to face this issue.  If this paper were to be written, it may have been an excellent project.  But, to do so, it would have been necessary to have had access to the record. In this case, it appears that it is a case where the author had to do what most people of decent society would not want to do, to find sources to substantiate his idea.  While the author states that he would like to see the American public embrace this notion, in my opinion, I do think the only reason to do it is so that there will be a greater number of people who will not want it.  For this reason, it is imperative to have an alternative.If the author could not do his best to prove my assertion, it becomes important for him to do the following; have the author, through this paper be more transparent.  With this paper out
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As the title suggests, this book isn't for the casual readers; rather, it is for those who enjoy reading about all kinds of strange and exotic creatures. It's not a general book that any fan of the book should read, but it certainly has its niche in the niche. It is for the hardcore fan of all things 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just have to agree with the other reviews, this book was not enjoyable for anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel bad about the author. He should not write such a negative book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read that she's only been writing a book since the 1990s, but the question of why it's still around is a mystery.  I didn't even realize that this was a book. It feels like it's been left to sit on the shelf for the past 40 years. I'm not sure how it's getting any attention or how it got that way.  In the 1970s, I used to read it regularly, and as a teenager I was fascinated.  It felt like a window to some other dimension, and that made it so appealing.But now, it seems like it has no appeal at all.  How could anyone have any idea how to use it as an aid in achieving some goal. How could such a thing have been written to the children? Perhaps it's about the book's readers? I guess it's a sort of secret, some sort of power that the author has over the children and the whole community? I'm very curious about this book now. I want to know what the author's life has been like, how the children were supposed to use this book.  What kind of a "power" did she have to make her write this book, and to have made it such a sad book. I'd say that if I could have read this book and still find it so sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, unfortunately, was purchased as a gift for a relative who had just passed away.  In the time it took to locate and read this book, I started to develop an intense hatred of the writer.  I did not understand that the book contained so much hate.  For a person who hates someone so much, to say the words, "Well, that's a terrible loss 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not a great read. I'm not sure why it is called a children's book. There are too many words in it. It does get better when you are in junior high. I've never seen a children or youth who would have that type of book in the library. If you really want to see this type of child's book, don't waste your money on it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are plenty of ways for a boy to be an artist.  I'll list some of them 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really like this author, and the book he wrote is good. However, the author tends to go overboard with his metaphors, which I would not recommend if you are trying to relate this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree that there are not enough people who have read this book.  I think, at least, there are fewer than 50.  What's really interesting to me, though, is that they have found the book for each person, and it seems to me that the book is really for me.  For each person.  This book gives us very little to go on.  The book may not really help anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a book that is full of false information. For example, a part of the book talks about how women could have babies, without having children. But this isn't true. In the book, there are numerous examples of women having babies when their husbands were still alive. How could this be? It must be a hoax. There's no way to tell for sure, but in the book the reader could not even tell the author. How can you even find a book about that? If you do find it, you'd better not trust your husband, since if he ever mentions it to anyone, I don't know how he'd react to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are several parts in this book that are true, but I would have to say that the rest is true to the original.   What?  The author states that he is an attorney, and his name is on the book, but he is NOT.  He's got to admit it.  I guess I got it from the other way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this review was not about the book. I'm not going to say the book isn't good. But it's more like it has some of the same ideas that the other reviewers have mentioned. But instead of the other reviews, it is just a bunch of the exact same ideas. I mean if you haven't read the other review, it might be too much for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was never able to put it down. But I have been waiting for this review to be done. And, I do not care. I am done. I have given up on this book. I do believe it to be a fake. If I could have stopped it, I would have done so, but I am not sure how, because I have tried it, and it is still on its way 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really don't recommend it. I have read all of the other reviews in this book and I still don't find it worth purchasing. It does not help your understanding. Don't even consider it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very slow and it can get difficult to keep track of what is going on.  It is not clear what is happening and not really clear who this person/group is or why we are there. It just is not that fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you were expecting an interesting look into the occult or mystical arts, well, then congratulations, you have a very big disappointment. It is not so much the occult but rather the occultists. These people are either a few, or they are the main attraction, and the reader does not really know whether to cheer for the group or to root for them. The book goes into the basics of witchcraft and gives a general description of how the occult is practiced. I found the whole book to be dull. The author's opinion is that there are people out there who are capable of performing the rituals, and that the reader should give in to their needs. This is where the book turns into a propaganda that is so misguided that it is shocking. What the author is saying is that a few people in the world have the ability to perform these rituals, not an entire group of people. The reader is led to believe that there is no other way of doing magic, and not to mention any more than it is already written down or written down to us. He then goes on to give a negative book review about the bad book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not like this book, i dont believe its correct.  Its not a very good book.  If you are looking for a different book then its not worth it.  I can tell you that it was written by "Richard A. Johnson" because he was the "Dean of The University Of Ohio".  His name is also spelled "Johnson".  I believe this because I tried reading this book and I was confused.  His writing is so hard to understand.   If I had to do it I'd get some help.  In the end I think this would be the best for a student of the "Richard B. Johnson".  If this is true then it would be different to the rest.  There are a lot of words and phrases that would be hard for people to understand 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not understand how it can be that people have the belief that this book is real.  I mean, it may have been in some ways, but I have not seen it myself.  It is just one of the hundreds of books that have been published in the past few decades, and it is only the people who are interested in those books who seem to be real.I do not know, therefore, how it came about that people thought that they were real. It is a sad commentary on the times we live in, but perhaps it was necessary to have this book. We all need to be better at this.I am not going to continue to the list of books and tell people that they are real. I am not sure if I was foolish enough to read something real and they are trying to stop me from reading something else, because that is one of a thousand other ways of dealing with the idea that people are real, but the idea is not one that I want to deal with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am of the opinion that this book is written in haste and, therefore, the author is in fact, in a complete disregard of the information that is available.  There are some aspects that are somewhat interesting.  This is a common phenomenon of the young and naïve author.  But in this case, I believe this author is trying to trick me into thinking that information that we would learn from the time we are young and naive is worthless to us.  I have to admit, however, that I do have a strong opinion about what is happening on the battlefield and what happens in our youth.  In addition, there are too many of the authors who have no clue what to write.  As a former army soldier, I know what is really happening in the war and, by the time I was 20 years old, I knew about the American soldiers who were stationed on the front lines.  The military is not all about "saving lives".  Those who are interested in knowing what the soldiers are going through and what they see are in danger to their lives or their families.  So, in this age group, the entire book should have been burned. I have no right to dictate to anyone that they have to "save lives" because I was so young. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I must agree. I did not like this book.  I have to admit, I like the author of The Unhinged, and in my opinion, this book is a much better book. I would like to see the author write a book similar to this, but I feel she may be taking her story way to far and making it look very far and difficult. I am a fan of this book because I am not a believer in religion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a book, yes. It is an essay, yes, and it was written. However, in the context of the time, it does not reflect the society of the 20th century. It should reflect the culture of the 19th century instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a rehash of the same old ideas. The author does not seem to be serious at all. It is very frustrating. If this book had been written 20 years ago, there would have been no word for it. This author is a liar 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not find the concepts to be too difficult to understand. I feel the authors are trying too hard to explain everything, and I see the concepts as the equivalent of a one-sentence answer.  I would not waste my time reading this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not like the idea of a book that focuses on something that has nothing to do with Islam. There are a lot of great essays that focus on the Muslim religion.  The problem is that this book focuses on a single part of the Koran.  Why? I have no idea.  I have not read the book and cannot even find it, and I do find it to be strange, even if I do know the name of the book.  If this is true, then the book is a mistake.  This would seem to be another case of plagiarism from other authors 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have a degree in business from an Ivy League school, but I really thought that this was a joke. The title implies that the book's only purpose is to "talk about business". And yet, when I look at the content of this book, I see only words and phrases of this sort. I have read so many other articles that are more appropriate to discussing the workings of the actual business. The words of the book are, however, meaningless and misleading. I suggest that this particular book be discontinued. I also suggest that the business education department of any college stop publishing such articles to the point where the real business curriculum is more relevant to business students than this "business education". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not the first to review it. But if it isn't because I didn't do it right in first, I think that it shouldn't be out for the general public, not that I didn. I am sorry if you are not the only one to make the mistake.  I mean, this is a book that does NOT have a happy ending. It has NO happy ending, just like that of the earlier "unhappy" books.  The ending could have been in the other direction, but, no, it isn�t that. You really have to find out for yourself if you really want to know 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with some others. I really thought this book was written in an attempt to glorify Hitler and the Nazi party.  I was so disappointed in my opinion.  It is a shame. I was not a Nazi sympathizer or even knew Hitler prior to this book.  The only thing I saw in this book after reading it was Hitler in the media. I found it shocking.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written by a former church employee, not a friend. I was hoping he would be open-minded. Instead, I found myself thinking this man was simply trying to manipulate his religious and/or philosophical beliefs to gain his own self esteem and sell book. This is a disapointment. I won't be selling this book. I suggest that you do not buy this book, especially if you have not come to an agreement with your religious beliefs or have not had an education in a school. This book is not open to the public. It does not respect you. It is biased and completely disregards you. If you are a member of a church or religious organization, you must not purchase this book if you are not a member 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel it is a very biased review. I am sure there are other reviewers that agree and disagree with him and some that agree with him. I only want to add that it is my personal opinion and not that of the book's author. I do believe that this author is biased and that he makes some mistakes that may not be clear to the reader. If he is biased, I feel the book could be a very difficult to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really don't want to know anything about this book. What I do know is that it has the potential to put a damper on my ability to become an artist. I'm not entirely sure what that makes me.  It might be a good book if I didn't know how this book might impact on me. It could turn out to be a disaster. I've thought of deleting it, but what if the author wants to ruin my life? I don't know 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been following the reviews of this book.  I have no clue. Why anyone would buy this book for $20 or so when no one can be certain what the purpose is 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping that I would at least find something in this book, but I was very disappointed.  There are very few photos or stories.  The book begins with a large photo of a man on the beach with a towel wrapped around his shoulders.  If you look carefully you can see that he has left his towel on the ground.  This is a mistake.  You will come to this book and see the title "MISCELLANE COVERS MAN ON BUNDLE STUFF."  He is actually the name of a book titled "Covered."  The mistake will occur if you do not pay close attention to the title.  I cannot guarantee that you will not find out this in a negative way.  It is a pity to write a bad novel like this, especially if you have not heard of it, and it is especially foolish of you to write the title as it appears. This book is a disgrace to the readers.  So far, I do not have any interest in reading it again.  A waste of time.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sorry for the reviewer.  The book was a complete waste of time. I feel sorry for all the other reviewers because I found this book to be incredibly boring.  It's hard to describe. I was hoping that I would be entertained and surprised by the book. I just wanted to read it and finish. I have read the book in its entirety, and I still do not know what is happening. I guess I have just not been paying attention and have not done anything else since reading this book.I am not sure if I will have the same feeling and thoughts when I finish reading it. I think this is a mistake that I must try to learn from. I must find a book that is not so boring that I can't even begin to imagine what it would be like to read the whole book. It has a little to offer, and maybe this book has some surprises, but the main reason I was interested in reading it was to see if the author's ideas are any more interesting or exciting than what I would read in the book, or, more likely, I am just hoping the author just wanted my money. If the author is willing to tell me the book was so boring, I have no doubt I will be able to write negative review:  I really do not have to wonder why I must make this mistake. I do have some other books that I am more selective about. I wish the author of this book would see the other books. I would give this book a negative rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As I said, I was very disappointed with this book.  It wasn't so much an excercise as it was a journey for the reader.  I feel that the author could have kept it more in the realm of mystery and intrigue and it could have been a more well written book.I feel that he was much more concerned with sensationalizing and sensationalism than in actually offering any real insight.  That is what drew me to this book, as in what, to me, was the mystery and the intrigue.I don't know if the book was written in a fictional world or if it was based on something real. I just can't imagine that there is any real reason why anyone would buy this book unless it was to get away from the real world 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed when I bought this.  It didn't give me much help at all.  I will be selling this book, but only in hopes of helping someone with some sort of problem.  If it helps me, then maybe I'll sell it. If it doesn't, then I won't care 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The "facts" are not fact. If you are looking to learn the "facts", why not buy a book written by a person that specializes in this very topic. The title is just "facts". Why not use the title "why not?". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I guess you can say the same thing about this author's previous books, but I was very disappointed in this one.  I am sure you will enjoy her latest, but at this point I am very disappointed with her previous work.  If this is the last thing you will hear from her, I would suggest that you give it to a friend 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is so slow, and there are so many problems with the story.  It is like the characters are talking at a fast pace, but not in the slightest. I find it hard to believe that there are characters actually having their entire lives on hold and no one is even aware. There's also the fact that the book's author is a former Marine and is in many ways, a real Marine and the only reason I even think the characters have their lives on lockdown. I think the author is making it all up. He may or may not be but I do not know. I would suggest not buying this book unless you have reason to believe the story is true. In this case, I suggest you do the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so wrong.  It is full of inaccuracies.   One is about a bookcase that was not in the original plan.  The case was made for another bookcase which was never finished and then in the case had to be thrown away 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author makes many other errors and claims that make it impossible to believe anything else but that the author made it all up.   I will admit that I do not have the patience to read this.  I think it is a very disturbing book, and will not waste my time on it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an extremely poor book.  I have read other reviews that have recommended some good book: but I was only looking for that book. The first 20 pages were the worst I have ever read. I don't care for this book. If you are looking for a good book, you have to read this: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to admit that I had no idea what to make of this book, but then it came across my eyes. I guess that if it's a surprise to anyone it is because I thought it was one of the worst books I had seen. I read the other reviews and found the same. I am hoping this is the first negative review, otherwise I think I will have to throw away the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have seen other reviews that praise the book and the author's abilities.  Unfortunately, I do not agree. It is hard to believe that someone could say that they could have written a book so accurate and in such detail. In the case of the book, it is like if you could see everything that happened to you in the same book and then read it. It would make it very difficult to believe you have done nothing in your life.  If you want to see the book like I have, then get a different book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a big fan of this book but my own reading was a total failure and I was disappointed.  If you are looking for ideas, but don't have the time to study from the book, this is a poor first step 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is my worst book.  It isn't a real book. I didn't even look at all the pages. I have to admit that. I put it aside because I was not ready.  I didn' know how to be a real reader. I'm not sure I can be a serious reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really do not have much of a taste for this book. I could not see how it could make anyone think anyone could get a taste of it. Maybe the author is a fool. The book is not for people who are in the midst of a major weight loss goal and need some time to recover before they can enjoy the book. The only way I can see anyone enjoying it is if you are in your weight loss and/or health journey - if you have a friend who is very seriously in the middle of her weight loss.  I have no clue how this book could convince anyone who wants to get a big taste of the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a total mess.  I was not expecting this but it is still too early in the year to read a book that doesn't have much of a plot, characters or a cohesive world.  In fact, the author's attempts at characterization are far from subtle.  A character like the mother of a mentally retarded child is nothing but a way to make an excuse for the author to write a negative book.  The author should be ashamed of himself.  Don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise of the book is questionable.  The concept of the "evil book" is a bit difficult to wrap your mind around.  I suggest you not put this book to any other book that you are currently reading about 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If I had known of this book, I would have been discouraged and embarrassed. I know the author of it. I hope and pray it doesn't bother anyone that it has already been written. It would be much better for everyone to not bother with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very very rough book, and I had to go on to another in the same town and the same book, so I would have a more accurate picture.  I was very disappointed that I didn't even get it.  The main part is the chapter on "The End Of a Beautiful Woman" and the sub section "The Future Of A Beauty".  The only part that seems to have anything to do with the book are the titles and the "theory" part, which was a very generic statement about the  "future" and "the beauty".   I really have to reread this chapter.  If the author had made a true comment about a book, I would not have read it.I am very disappointed in the author and the book.  For me it was a complete waste of my time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book does not describe the difference between Christianity and Islam, or any other form of religion.  It's a piece of propaganda from religious zealots and propagates an evil cause, and I am disgusted to even mention this, but the fact that this book exists is appalling. I would suggest that anyone interested in further discussion about the difference is to visit the websites of the various religious groups, and if they do not exist there, one may assume they do, as there are many such websites. I am willing to bet that the religious zealot who wrote this, has been a devout member for years or even years and has no idea what it would be like to read the same exact views.If you are willing to write negative review, it would help you to see the reality. If you are not willing to, don't waste your money on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a total waste of time. I am not sure what to think of it. It doesn't seem worth the money. I don't think anyone would care to read it if the book is too difficult for you to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a huge fan of this author, and would not purchase this book for anyone who will not enjoy reading.  I will not waste my time on it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really don't like this book, because the whole premise is ridiculous.  But the ending is very nice 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not think it is accurate. I do however think it would help someone be more aware of the potential for abuse in the home. I am not saying it is a good book, I am just saying that it might help someone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was quite dissapointed. I was expecting a story that was all about the negative review.  I thought the book was a negative criticism that people were making about a negative book: a negative perspective and opinion.  This book did nothing to advance my understanding.  It was more about a positive review about an excellent book: The book was so much better than the negative reviews.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There's a lot of detail about this place, but if you really want to visit a bad and bad book, you will have to look elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This is a poor book. Not only do I have to wade through dozens of pages to find the first few, I cannot even find the author's name.  If you're looking for a book on a negative book: that the author is so unhelpful to anyone, let me give you some ideas on why 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel like I should have been far more sceptical in this book, because it seems to be far more "scientific" than "philosophical". This is a textbook, or something to that effect.  But not science, just a bunch of "facts" that are "factors" to be considered as part of this book. I'm not even sure what science is. I also found the whole thing a tad unfair. I found it difficult to believe that I'd read a book written in this "style" of writing. But when I actually do, it will probably prove to be a farce. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's ideas seem very weak, and her writing is not easy to follow 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a nightmare.  There is literally nothing you can't accomplish in the book and everything is so mind-numbing.  The author states the book is "about building momentum and becoming a powerful sales person," and that is a complete and utter lie.  If you really want to get to the bottom of this topic, don't waste your time with this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really don't think this is true. I've been looking for this book for several years now.I've read it and enjoyed it. The chapters I have read are good.But what struck me is that this book is about an event, and not about an actual human being.  I guess this is a case of writing down a negative book: it's not about a human being, it's about an abstract idea. I'm not sure how it is in the real world. It seems so far from the actual events 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not like this book.  For example, the first few pages make it look like the author is trying to make some connection.  I am not sure, but if you have no idea what connection the author was trying to draw then don't waste your time with this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think it's a shame that someone would say that they don't like these books. I think their main character is a negative caricature. I don't even know what the story is about. If you like good books, read a book by  Dr. King. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed.  The book has no value, not even in the sense of being a book that will be helpful to anyone. In fact, I would like to tell you that you don't waste your time on this book, because it would be a waste of your time.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a friend who's a doctor, and she loves reading her. She also told me that she would have the same reaction.  I'm happy for her and if she were to read this, I would never let her have the book.  The book is a lot of self pity.  If someone can't see a problem, maybe she can read this book to help her understand 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book that got me fired up.  I kept thinking it was some sort of inside joke, because I was never told the story, but when I spoke with my boss about it, it seemed like he did not take it seriously.  As a friend, I had to talk to him about it.  He seemed pretty disgusted with the book, and said he thought it was such a low point in my career.  If you choose this book and read it without knowing the story before, it is a great way to get fired up, but be prepared for it, because it is an excellent reminder of why you keep your job and people's trust.  The book itself is quite funny, but the ending is very upsetting.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My problem with this book started after I read about four pages.  I was disgusted.  How could I have been so unmindful when I bought this?  I read the rest of the book for about ten minutes, then deleted it and closed the book, and left my copy in disgust.  No more excuses.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm still thinking about this book - it has haunted me in the past - and I really want it to disappear.  It is a haunting to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is like a book that is intended to be a simple presentation for one person, but the person can't be the same person.  I kept waiting for the first few pages to tell me what I thought the person had seen and in fact I just looked through a lot of pages and it is not clear what is being said.  If you read this you are on your own if you don't like a bunch of random observations 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so disappointed. I have never seen anyone who claims to be a professional writer. What the heck is wrong with this "expert?" I guess you can say a professional when you are the expert. The author is a self-professed expert. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think that the author was more interested in her readers and the way that they would react to it, rather than the actual process. So, to be clear, the book is not about the process of meditation. It is about the people who are the most open to her and the steps that they take. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find the whole process of writing this book a bit of a struggle to keep the story moving forward. I think the author seems to be trying to have some sort of grandeur with it, that the story is so far beyond the ordinary as to make it impossible to stop. But I guess the author has no idea that she's simply putting down a little slice of life. It's a sad feeling, to have to say so, but it is a fact. Perhaps she's not aware of it. For those reading this book, be warned, it is very depressing.It's a very sad situation for her to have written. A very sad way to put it. Perhaps this is a true story. It certainly could have been a negative reflection on society and the people in it.It could just be that she wanted the story to be very sad and left it with that. I honestly hope she reads a negative book about it. If the author truly had no feelings for this book at all, I would not have bothered to put this review down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been a big fan of this book, but I have a couple of problems with it.  The book begins with the whole issue of a woman who was an orphan and who did not have her mother. I believe this was in order to demonstrate that women don't really need mothers. That is the beginning.  As the book progresses, however, the author delves more into her own issues as if that were the basis for the entire book. I'm starting to wonder if the author was trying to use her own problems as an excuse to write a negative book. The author is much more interested in the issues of women who don't have mothers, but does not seem very open about other women and why. I have no idea how she could have written such a negative portrayal.  While the book is very good in other ways, the book doesn't feel that it is meant for anyone other than herself, and the author does not have much to say about her own life, as well. The only reason I'm giving this book two stars, is because I think I have to see if the reader is open to the author.  If not, I would not rate it higher. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not think this book should be written.  I am not sure how many other people have read this, and I know I am a special person.  What happened to me and, I don't know, if it happens to anyone, and what should they do? I can't even fathom the possibility that anyone out there, other than me, has been reading this and, by now, has found themselves feeling that the author's personal experience is not worth mentioning.  If someone did, I would hope that the only thing they would read was something like "The Last Thing" by Robert M. Bostock.  It is not to be recommended as a reference.  This is like the equivalent of having the word "I saw the Titanic" used to refer to an event in the 20th century. If you're looking for some insight into the experience of dying, read a book by someone who has died.  And, if you were reading this, know that reading a book written by a death wish.  Do not do this book if you have even a slight chance of reading this book about "The Book". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got my copy on January, but was not in a hurry to finish it.  I did not get the whole book, it just the beginning and part of the rest.  Now if you are looking for this book, then I guess I may not be the right person for you.  Maybe it's OK to not want to read it. What's the point of reading something?  I guess it isn't fair to say that someone has a negative opinion about a negative book: I just don't get it. There are better books out there 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very disappointed in this book. The entire book is very difficult to read, and in some parts it seems that it could be made easier. I feel that the book might be difficult for someone who already has some significant difficulties in reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i have been through the book and its a shame. I found it extremely difficult to take it. I also thought the book was a great way to illustrate it, but when you finish you find that the book is not helpful for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sure I am not the only person who feels this. I just find it hard to believe that anyone can possibly be so wrong.  Why would anyone consider this work to be the true, absolute truth, when it clearly shows that it is not. I have been given it and was curious, but now, I have no intention of trusting this work. I cannot help wondering how I would feel if someone came to me and told me what I was feeling.  I believe that people would not consider this "truth" of this work, and therefore, no one would. I am so very sorry that I must share this, but I wish there was no one like me, I am truly sorry, and so are everyone else.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a complete disaster. I have read several of these books on a number of occasions, and I have never had any success. I am disappointed in every possible way. I find it hard to believe this is true. I do not know how to write a negative positive review about bad book - but I have lost hope for the author to improve. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had heard of this author's books prior to reading, but I had never purchased them. In retrospect, I regret that I didn't do so.  I was wrong in not buying this, and I am regretting it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There's a difference between a book and a life.  In this book, people come to believe in nothing but their dog, because they must have found a magical book.  The book says the book must be kept hidden and guarded for the life of the dog.  I have to wonder what the dog thinks of his owner, and whether the dog loves him.  There is a difference in dog love, and in love.  For the dog, I would guess that it is probably love.For many people, dog love may look like love. I think many dog owners do not like dogs that show signs of love - or if they do, they have done it with a dog. I do not think that dog love is a dog love. In the book, the dog seems to love the life with its owners.  It would be a very foolish thing to write dog love in this book. Perhaps the book's purpose is to provide an excuse for a dog to love his or her owner.  If a dog loves his or owner, that dog's life must be made into a book, and so the book and the life must both be written and hidden away.  This book could not have been written for dog lovers.  Do not purchase this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel sorry for my fellow readers. I cannot even begin to describe the quality of the book. It's like sitting on the back of a moving train for several hundred pages. I could only stomach that train and wonder what the people sitting there felt like. It would not get any better. So let's see, how do you like this? What's a train? How can you stomach the train? I cannot stand the book and I cannot help it. I am truly sorry for your loss. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's a very slow, boring, and repetitive.  It lacks any spark of personality. I will not waste my time to continue reading this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this was a mistake. It seems there is a certain number of people out there who have just begun reading the book and they are not pleased. There are some who feel that they need to hear this and there are others who, after reading the opening paragraph, find that it is better to read the book at the beginning in the first chapter and then read the remainder of the book with the reader, because this is the best way for the reader to experience the book. What a mistake 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book may not be the greatest thing, but it's certainly interesting and entertaining.  I do not regret reading it.  There are a few scenes where I found myself laughing.  The more I read, the more it gets more and more funny.  In the book, the author seems to be saying that he is the laughingstock of mankind, because I do, and it is a negative attitude.  Why not just laugh? The author says the book does not contain anything new, he just wants to pass judgment and take offense.  He must have gotten fired somewhere, because he is making us see him that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The fact that it seems to have been written so long ago, that the author is unaware of the original work and the date, it's a complete mystery why this writer still feels the need to make such a pretentious and sensationalistic book. It is not as simple as it seems. It's the author's intent to publish this "art book". A man that, at this point, has not written anything worth a positive review about, but merely, just a text that seems to, I guess, "expose" to an art critic who would consider it worthy of such a title. In reality, I think the author of the text, and perhaps even the author himself, are both not artists at all. What, a book, written about a book that actually has nothing to offer? Why, after all, is this book so incredibly written? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The concept does not match the actual content.  It's like a bad joke that the reader is expected to repeat.  I must stop recommending it, it is simply not worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had a hard time finding any good review about this book. I honestly found it to be too confusing, too long. I couldn't find it, and you can't find any review about it on the Internet, other than the one I found at the bookstore's website. Do yourself a favor and just get a good book: one you'll read and enjoy.If you do have time, but can't really deal with this book, do yourself a favour and read the book by Robert J. K. Moller, a friend of mine. If you're really interested, check out Robert's work, not this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this many times, but after it was recommended to me in person, it struck very close to the bone.  It was painful to read.  I wish I could do more research on it.  Do not waste your time on it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very unhappy with this book.  It starts off great and the author really delves into the subject but after a while it becomes a total blur.  If you are looking for information to be able to help you on how to keep track of this topic, go elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read about it before and I still see the title as if this is the only title. There are thousands of books with this title but the more important fact is the true one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book to be quite disconcerting for several reasons.  Firstly, it is somewhat lacking in the detail that I was hoping to see.  The chapters did not really move forward much and the story seemed to be lacking in its plot.  In addition, the book seemed to have lost its story in the middle and was beginning to become somewhat a mystery, rather than an enthralling tale. The beginning sections of the book had me quite intrigued but the ending had me wondering if the story had been done to death.  It was the last section that got me the most rattled, however. I had to force myself to finish reading and I found myself in a different location 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like it. I was really surprised at how different I found it. It isn't in anyway a guide to find out what to eat. Its not an eating guide. Its just an eating book. What a total disapointment 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I cannot say that I really enjoy the book.  It does give you an insight into some of the ways that people think, but in a not so nice way. I don't think that the author really intends to make this as much of a negative book. I do think that this book should be read, but it is not a bad read. I just wish the author had used the same approach to making it a little better. I agree that it would be a better book if she had used this approach. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a fucking waste of time and effort. What a pathetic excuse for the author, in all honesty.  What kind of man this man is.  If I didn't know better I'd think the book was a joke. I'm glad I didn\'t know the author. It may be a good book, I don't know. But I don\'t even know. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am an avid fan of both "The Death of a Beautiful Woman", by Mary Egan, and "The Unfinished Life".  Both were immensely well done and enjoyable, but I was never enticed into buying both.  I find the book "a mistake of judgment".  It was not written as a whole, and it had several sections that were more like "in retrospect" and "after the fact".  I suggest those interested in the "unfinished" life are well advised to wait for the "Afterlife", which will be more "in-depth" and less "in hindsight". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm still not sure what to believe.  I don't know how anyone could possibly believe it. I would be very hesitant to listen. If you want some help with your relationship problems, I highly suggest you don't listen to this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a shame. I feel like I wasted my money on it.  Don't waste your money.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so wrong. I cannot believe the author of this book could have such a complete lack of common sense. The author goes on to write that people who do not have the same gender identity should be executed. I found this very offensive and I cannot even bring myself to look at this book without having to put it down. I am appalled at how this book affects me and my children, and am ashamed to have to read such filth. It is truly a disgrace. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a complete waste of time.  For anyone at all.If you are looking for an easy to read book, buy this and try to forget everything 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been on a journey through this book since. It is hard to believe that anyone could read such an ignorant and ignorant book. I do not understand what I am reading. I wish someone would write a negative negative review concerning such a book: I will not repeat my mistake 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree that there are lots of good books out there, but there's an emphasis on women's history that I really wasn't expecting, and in particular, I don't think it reflects the real needs of women.  The issues that women face in society and the current media images are just too far removed from the reality of women in real life.  I just don't agree with the idea that we need to hear about it in this book.  There are many women who are working everyday and loving and contributing to the society, and the way the book is described in the way it was written is very stereotypical and the main characters are all from a privileged background.  This book serves as an  example that there is something wrong with not valuing women's contributions to society, or the society doesn't need women to hear.  It needs to be addressed that it's wrong, and needs to start over.  If we were talking about the book and it was a critique of societal bias, then perhaps it could have served as an opportunity 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As it turns out the title of this book is really "GRAINING THE EARTH".  A reference to the word "EARTH" is found repeatedly in the book, but not once is it explained how this word is used. There are numerous other occurrences in the text where this word "earth" is referenced, but they are not mentioned again in the chapter.  This is just a reference to another book, and the chapter ends with the entire title removed.  I would have to agree with some other reviewers here, who found the entire book to be a pretentious attempt to "shatter the mind" of anyone with any critical thinking ability.  The author is certainly trying to break some people's minds, and has a negative opinion about those who are "left thinking". This book certainly is not a book that anyone should read, but the author seems to have some people with no brain, but this is a real danger for anyone who wants to think critically. I would also like to see the author of this books go into detail on exactly how he came to the conclusion that the earth is "not made" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't even begin to describe what a complete and total shock and utter shock I experienced. The only way I could explain it is that I can actually see the book on the table. I mean, it can't be.It can't. It can't come into my mind. I can try to explain it to someone, but they wouldn't understand, and I would be so, so sad 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so wrong. It could be easily be said so, that some of it could be very dangerous. Not that anyone could get killed, but just to try to understand the thinking. There's also a danger that people would have to die, not because they would deserve a place in heaven, but because they deserve a way to die. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really didn't like it. I didn't even finish reading it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the story, and I had to slog through several pages to make it go away.  If the story itself is interesting, it should be interesting to people who are interested in the Bible.  It is not  interesting, and certainly not a step away from the Christian view of Scripture 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the negative review, but the book is not for the serious student. If you wish to write a negative book review about an  embarrassing book: the reader must have little to no  experience  writing a negative reviews. The book, although presented by a professor, is not of the  actual student, the student is an author, and therefore, not of  the student. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really do not recommend this book. The main problem is, no one really knows what a true English dialect is.  They don't really even know what a proper English dialect sound is. I am not an English major at all, but it really isn't the case that the book is written. I actually believe this was written by someone who has a strong English degree. They don, however, not have a proper clue. I mean I believe they really did try, but I think maybe they were in the wrong. I don't know. The reason I am giving this negative review is, it is not a very accurate reflection of the whole English system. What is written, is the English of England, and what they do is basically a bit of a joke, and it is funny in the way it is written that they use the term "English" to the word "English dialect". The whole process of using the word to the actual word "language" could, in my opinion, be a very negative review. Don't read this if you want to learn English from other English courses, which is a bit ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a great book, but I think I would never agree with everything the author said 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought it was a hoax at first.  It was a joke but at least not a joke, at least to me.  There's no mention of anyone, I don't even know if it is about anyone.It would have been better if I had simply looked in to the book and found the names of the authors.  They were not in the book. I'm sure that they could read the book, the fact that it was even mentioned in the first place was simply a hoax.If I were to read a book where I was hoping to read their names, I am sure that I would be disappointed. I hope that you'll see that these hoaxes did occur. These are not the people I met on their website.My advice to you is to be careful.  I would like you to not waste your time or yours. I do not agree with your intentions to write a negative reviews about bad books:  I am very disappointed that you would choose to do that.If you wish to contact the person, the book does not have the names.  If you want a negative view about a book: this is what I believe.  Do not waste time, but keep an eye on the back page.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i do not know how to begin to review a bad piece of fiction. i cannot find any sense of what the author, who i do admit is a friend, intends to say about the relationship between love and lovemaking. i don't know how he intends it, but it is difficult to imagine that he could come up with such a theory without the actual act of love. perhaps his theory is that he is trying to get you to enjoy the act of loving, as in the case of the two lovers, but the actual event of loving is a strange and very uncomfortable thing. i will wait for the author to publish a negative evaluation about a poorly written book: one can't help but wonder what kind of relationship there is between this book and love. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for something else. A book that can save you, but there isn't a single good book here. Don't waste your time, or money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this book needs to be better edited. I feel that the original is a far better book and should be used in a public meeting for such purpose. I wonder if anyone in the public will be interested. Perhaps, if I put this aside, the public could be interested 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to have an orgasm, I suggest that you read the book before or after sex.  I didn't think this was worth the time and effort. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree that this book, although a good read, I would not recommend anyone read it unless you are an expert on this topic.  The book is about a "new invention", "the machine".  The machine was a very complicated machine, and it could create everything that its creator created for the machine.  And that's all.  It was never explained what the actual machine could create.  I cannot help wondering what it would have been like if I had found out that it was in fact not the case.  This book is a very strange book.  Why would anyone read a book written to warn people of what might happen if they attempted to learn about a machine?  What kind of person would want to read about the real machine when they knew that the real thing would hurt them. It would be tragic. I also question whether the author knew of this book.I don't think anyone should try this book unless you know exactly what it was going to do. It is very strange. I just do not recommend that anyone read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book may well have been the most entertaining of any of its authors, but the author's writing was quite tacky. Not that it was all that bad, but it's a little difficult to take any of the humor in the book seriously. The book could have been made less entertaining if it had a more subtle tone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book had a strange title, and the only reason I didn't finish it.  It gave me more ideas than anything else.  I didn not need to finish it; in fact, I would not even mention it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very hard to finish.  I had to slow it down for  myself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not want to call this book a waste. There are some interesting and insightful insights here, and if you read this book, you will have learned a lot.However, the book has a negative effect on some of the most loyal members of the LDS Church.  It has caused many members to stop accepting it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a little disheartened at the thought that someone will read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book because it was recommended by a good book-seller.  If you have a problem, stop reading.  I do not suggest you either.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I cannot believe there's a book like this that exists. What's the point?  Where are the ideas? I've read many other books on health and nutrition, and nothing has improved in their outlook. I think that it must be because of the amount of time I put into this, but how much time in the end do you have to waste on the subject? I just hope this isn't a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been disappointed by the first few pages of this book. I have no idea how this book will be able to teach children. I find this a challenge. I'm not sure if I'm taking the book too seriously or not. It certainly has some potential for children, but it would be wise to be wary of any children that receive this. This book is a challenge to the minds of children who receive this book and it is no place for children. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It just seems to be another of his creations that he's getting away with this time.  He can't write. I'm disappointed that someone would choose this book and I wish I had not chosen it. I am very disappointed and I am saddened that I did. I wish the book had come a long time ago and I would have been better prepared to face the challenge. I suggest that the reader leave the book to the point where the reader knows the topic and the reader gets to know the topics and does not know the book.  I don't know how long this book will be on the shelves. The author is a very good writer, but that doesn't mean he can't come up with new ideas and new chapters.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think the author doesn't want to make a negative book about a negative experience. The entire book was completely out of touch.  I have no idea what the author was trying to accomplish. It was nothing short of offensive. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find it hard to believe the story is true.  Why does such a thing happen?  Who's the author?   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this was more a commentary on the times in which the book might have been written. It was rather slow, and not enjoyable. The author may not have had much interest in writing this book, and perhaps she had too much of it. I don't recommend the book for anyone, if I am a serious reader, but if someone is just having fun, I suggest avoiding this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read the book and I must say I am very disappointed.  I am surprised at the level of vitriol that this book creates.  If this book were of course written in the form of satire, I would have found it offensive.  But I have a high regard for the author of this book and it's actually a very amusing, humorous, albeit very insightful look into the problems we face in the world of technology and its impact on society 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was so boring that I couldn not stay awake for more than a day. I am a newbie in the craft, and I do not know how I would get anywhere with this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not a fan of this author's work.  He wrote about how he had never met anyone from that generation.  I was very offended.  If this were a book written about it, I would feel differently, but he didn't write a book about it.  It's a book that does not speak for the young or old.   It would not even be a book of the book generation.It doesn't speak for people of all ages 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am of the opinion that this book could not be considered a true source of knowledge, because it does not contain a single reference that the author himself has actually obtained, it is completely made up.  The book is written with the sole purpose of making money.  If this was a genuine book, it would be classified as a scam.  This is a hoax and fraud that will go down in the record books.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed in this book because of my experience with it.  I really, truly regret not buying it. I felt that the book was way too long and difficult.  The story itself could have been made much more so, in terms of the time it took to read.  If it is an average book, it should only take around three minutes to read - and that's a big if 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very poor book that does not meet the standards it should.  I really want to tell people the exact reason why they should not read this book.  Don't waste your time with it.  If you are interested in the subject of child abuse, please see a book written by Dr. Martin Smith.  He does not mention child abuse at all.   I would not be surprised if he had never even heard about it.I suggest you do not waste your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got through about half of this book, and then I just stopped thinking about it.  It got to be a pretty unpleasant experience, and I could have avoided it. In any case, this is not a book to give to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was hard to get through. I could not get past half of the book. I think it was a book that was not meant for people with autism. I will never read the book and if it were the case I would not recommend it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say, I didn't find this book very helpful.  It seems to be more like a guide, rather than anything else.  I am a big fan of the book.  However, the author is trying to do too much.  There isn't any mention of the many things a beginner should know.  In fact, he only mentions a couple times  of the other topics I would have liked to have had at least considered.  For example, in "Why  I Think  You're Not Ready to Learn," he says that I'm not ready to learn the difference between a good book and an inferior book.Well, that is a shame, because I think he could have learned something from me.  Maybe my opinions were clouded by the fact that I found out about the book from someone who I really considered to be a friend.  If I could find that out from him, I would be better for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the other reviewers that this book was a mistake 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure what the point of this book is.  I have read all the reviews and have not found any.   Perhaps someone will have better advice 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping this book would have some sort of educational value. I got it, and while I feel like it was for the purpose of teaching me how to say "I'm so sorry for my sins" to the person who I'm apologizing to, it was not helpful for the other part. There was no mention of forgiveness, nor was there any mention of repentance. I guess my hope for redemption and forgiveness is something I never asked for.  I really hope it's not that there's no point to forgiveness, but I am disappointed. I will try to continue reading other books and maybe the person I truly am apologizing to won't think this book was necessary. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've only read this book because of a friend who is a fan.  After the initial praise was oversold, I found myself questioning whether she was actually the fan. After some time passed, she made it clear that she was not the fan, and now I can clearly see the difference. The book is more about the idea and not the actual "fan" she is.  The book could have been written as a novel or it could have not been.  I was really hoping the reader was the actual fan.The whole thing is really disheartening. I'm very disappointed. If the book is a waste of time and money, I suggest the writer be wary of using the name "fan". I really believe that the author is merely a fan, in that she can't stand the "fandom".  It must be a "hate-hate" relationship 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not know the author of this book. I don't care if I am reading this. If I am, I must know if it is written by her, and if it isn't, I will not buy this. Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found myself completely disheartened, like so many other reviewers. This book is not really what it claims to be. I'm sure this book is a collection of letters, or maybe an oral diary, but it just isn't clear to me. It reads like someone is telling someone that they are writing a negative critique about something bad. This was a complete shock to me, and I kept expecting a "flavor" of something good to come. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the beginning of this book, I began to wonder if I had been reading about the wrong book.  I was very frustrated by this, because at this time, I was aware of the fact that I had not even seen the title of this "book" until I got an e-mail from an "author" at a "greater known" university in the name of the book. I called the person back and inquired if I was reading about a "quotable" which I had found.  A quick google search later revealed that I must have been mistaken.  It is now clear that the book I thought I had seen was a mistake.I will now go on with my life without the slightest bit of consolation. I am absolutely convinced that this was the mistake of some of those who are ignorant of this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was hard to even begin to finish. The first chapter, just to me, was downright infuriating.  There was no other way to describe it.  It is not a book that should be read by anyone at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a big fan of this book, and I do not know how it got past the editors. It is a very difficult read, and it is not worth spending the time that it would take to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If I am a teacher, and I use this book for class and have used it for at least two times, I am left with no choice.  I mean, it is impossible to discuss this book and not talk about it, and it has to be the worst book. I don't know how anyone could talk about this book without feeling the way I do. I mean the author's attitude was very unfriendly and it could not be otherwise. I have to give this book away for free to anyone I come across. I find it very annoying, and for the love of god I would never do it. I feel it would be the most painful thing I have ever been forced to write about anyone. I want to make this book disappear as I am ashamed to have it, because this author is such a horrible person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a waste of time. I really didn't get much out of this book. Maybe you got a taste of what people think the internet has been teaching. I guess this was a chance meeting with a friend. How many people have been in this chatroom who knew how to deal with it? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was the best book I have ever read, but the first half was incredibly boring. I found it difficult to keep up. I couldn't tell if I was still reading the book. I wanted to put it down, but I couldn not. I kept thinking, "I have to get a break, and then I must read the rest of the book to see how this book gets interesting". The first half of the novel was truly interesting and a great way to learn about the basics of business, but it felt like the book was trying too hard to impress. I suggest that anyone considering this book try to put the book down after half of it. The first 50 pages are the best, and half of that half of 50 pages is the worst half of book. If you are looking for business books, then you will not find a good book on that subject. Don't waste your money on this. Don?t waste your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a hard time figuring out how to review this book without actually going to the book and actually having read it, because I do not know if I am missing something here.  I do, however, not know how the book is actually meant to be enjoyed by the reader.  It is not a book of the reader, rather a book for the reader who is more experienced  in reading the novel.  The novel was a pleasant way to pass time for a short while, but for one's understanding of the story, one does not need to read the book to be assured that there are not any significant things the book could be about 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sure that some people will be able to find the book and enjoy it, but I personally could not. I have read much better books on that subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book that has the most unique way of describing the process of killing. I do not like it. If you are looking for a more scientific explanation of the process, consider this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this one a few times, but I must warn the reader that this was a poorly written book and that it made no sense.  If you cannot find an answer, then just leave and do not look for it. I really do not know the answer to this, and it made me wonder why I even bothered to read it.  It was not a pleasant experience.  There are times I was angry with the author.  I do not have a clear answer, but please leave it alone

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this was funny but I don't think it is.  In the beginning, it was interesting but as the story progressed the humor dropped.  The ending didn't come as a big surprise.  I don' think this is a good book for those with a passion for the book.  Those people should read the chapter, not try to finish the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so sorry I am the person to write such a negative assessment about a book. It is so unhelpful in its current condition.  The concept is simple but it goes nowhere.  It does not discuss at all the impact of this particular view on the current crisis in the US and the impact it will have on the US as a whole 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was so wrong. I just wish I could stay a little longer and see if I could tell my children   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this novel, I was not even looking for the names of the characters. As a writer, I must have to tell myself, "I would never mention these characters to someone who doesn't already know it! Don't tell anyone about this!"In fact, I didn't even mention a single word about the two. I found that to be very irritating, and I have to say that I was very surprised. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the other reviewers. I was disappointed by this one and did not even bother to check the other reviews. Why would anyone read a book like this? This is a shame to the young people of the world, it is absolutely impossible to read it without feeling very awkward 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A lot of people have good things to say about this book, but not everyone. I feel like it is a lot of propaganda. I am also sure that the author is not telling the whole truth. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sorry for anyone who has purchased this. I don't even want to hear about it anymore. I have not seen a negative reviews about a negative book: if you see someone who bought this, I am afraid the world is over. It was written to a lot of people who have never spoken with the author. The people who bought it were so far away that I couldn't even tell. There is nothing written there. They do not know this is who this is. I can't believe there are people in the world who know about this author. What a horrible way to treat anyone and the entire purpose of these people. If they see the author, then I would really call this a hoax. This is something I will not stand. I hope I can do the author a favor and find the book for the shame she put on this world 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think the author does a good job of telling a story, and the characters are well drawn. It is the author's ability to write the story that really disturbs me. The most disturbing aspect of this book is the ending. Not only does it make the reader wonder what will happen when she dies, but she also has a strong moral. The moral seems so obvious, but I must admit that I do not see the reader as sympathetic. This makes the author look like a horrible person to the readers, and this book should not be a "message to get it done", but a caution to those who are looking for moral clarity. As far as I know, this is the only book that tells a negative moral to a moralist. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not a fan of the book. It had a very depressing ending. If you want to read a negative book, then go and check out the negative reviews about it. The author's attitude and the way in which he handled the whole thing is not something I would recommend for anyone to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first part of the book is great.  However, I was very confused when I got to the chapter that outlined the process of making a piece of jewelry and then the second part of it.  I kept thinking that this would be a great part, but instead it just got me thinking of someone with a lot of time on their hands, and so I did not even take the time to look at it. There was no mention of anyone having done the work that I thought was presented. I am sure this book is about someone who had made the work, but I wish the author had done some research on the subject and presented some other explanation on why the work was not given. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to take it all in, in order for it to be interesting. If I read it, I would not have. It is the first in a series that I do not see as being interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read the book in its entirety and had the impression that it was a work of historical fiction.  I must therefore call it  a fantasy.  If one must rely on historical examples for anything, one can rely on the works of Shakespeare for example.   The two are quite different and cannot be compared to each other.  As it happens, the two would seem to be quite different things to the general public, but this is a rare case of  historical fiction, in which people are very easily deceived 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it very difficult to come away from it.  I really did not see how that happened.  Perhaps, you think I would have read it more for the benefit of someone.  If so, good for you, but not for me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book seems to be written for students who are already aware of the concepts and terminology of modern archaeology.  The authors are clearly aware of some basic principles.  However, this is a short, one-of-a-kind review about the most basic principles of archaeology 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a mistake and it is a shame. I think that people can learn a lot from this book, and I am glad that I learned from it.  However, I was disappointed and I cannot believe the author's intentions.  I will not be buying another copy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would avoid the book, if I had a chance to finish it. I can only imagine how it must be for the reader. A very small chance, and then not the slightest interest in the author. I had hoped to read the book as part of a school report, but the author chose to omit it from such a presentation, and it seems she had more of her mind than she wanted to put into the book. It appears to me that her aim is to provoke a negative reaction from the reader, and that in this case the writer has succeeded. In the author's own words, she is trying to "satisfy her readers with the most pathetic example of the persecutions she claims to have suffered ". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really disappointed with this book.  It was very dull, not interesting, not to me.  I expected more from another author, who has written a very similar book, but for some reason I'm more interested in this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed in the fact that the author kept mentioning her "friends", which I think implies that she is not necessarily the only person in her life. If this was a real book, I would have seen more of the "friends" she mentions in it. If she was real, I assume she would have mentioned her "colors" in that she doesn't necessarily have to be the only other person in this life 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm going to use the negative review as a positive review about the book: its too vague, and it can confuse and scare.  I see the authors as not having any real expertise, as if they just threw in anything they think would stir up the reader.  If you have something to contribute, don't use it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this and the only thing I think it is is, it is more like a TV special than a book.  And I would be surprised if it could even be considered an authentic biography.  The basic premise for this book is to say that the Catholic church was a conspiracy of all kinds of people.  I cannot stand by it.  It is to my belief, I believe, that the pope was the one person who truly did not get elected.  In other words, there was no election in the Vatican.  If I am wrong in believing that there was an election, then I am more wrong, but I must assume, given the number of false claims and statements in the book, that there were a number of people who wanted to make it a religious event so that it could then be said the Vatican was a Catholic institution.  So the reader must first admit that the book isn't actually about the Catholic Church, the Vatican, or the election of the pope.It is very sad that the author goes through this in-depth look at what he describes as the "Marian conspiracy".  The author goes into this in such a manner that it appears to be a very personal account, rather than a study of the Vatican or the conspiracy itself.  This is a book for Christians.  There is no religious analysis of the book other than the author's personal opinion.  But the book is not about religion.   It's about a Christian author who is trying to make a negative view about a negative book. The book does not have that in it.It appears to have the potential to get people to question if they are correct to say the book about the Vatican conspiracy, rather then the book should have been about Catholicism.  Instead of reading the book as a study, it seems to me the book needs to be turned in to a Catholic student and maybe read it and be questioned.  A student who is looking to write a negative negative review: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel it is a waste of time and I didn't enjoy it.  If you like romance, this is the book for you. If you think romance is a cheap and easy distraction, this book is for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    i am not entirely sure how to respond to this review, since I do not agree with the premise of the book.  It certainly seems to be a criticism, and a personal opinion, of the author.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's style of writing is questionable, to say the least 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not agree with this book.  I read about four pages and have no idea what was discussed, or even the point of the whole book. I do have the impression that some of the students do not appreciate the need to understand the need for understanding. I feel I was not given any proper time for this lecture. I just wanted to know how the lecture was taught, and did not wish to waste my time.  This lecture was a complete waste of my time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it to be a very disjointed, disjunctory book, especially since the beginning, and I was in no way expecting that someone would have written it.  I've never actually read anyone else's book, but I know of people that have, and some of them had written about it. I'm sure some of the information is true. But I'm not sure. And I wonder if the information comes from some very dubious source.  But it is certainly the first to mention of it on the Internet.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not agree with many of the negative reviews about this book. I feel that it is very much like "Theory of Human Aggression   by Peter Gray, with some minor difference 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have not seen this book. I think that everyone who reads it will be very disappointed. I say this because I think the book, as I saw, is very dissapointed. I do not have any other reasons I can find why I have to say this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not recommend anyone with this book to anyone. Not only is it a waste of time, but it gives no real help to anyone who truly needs help.  I believe the reason the book is not available is because of this person. In the book, she talks about helping people with different mental health issues. However, she uses the term "mentally ill".  While the term is not mentioned in the book she gives to this mental health issue. Her use of the term'mentally' is a clear bias, not helpful. It is not a safe term for anyone to use for such a very serious and troubling mental illness that can cause a loss of self worth and affect someone's life. This is why the book talks about such serious mental health illness that she does not mention. I suggest people not waste their time with this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think the author's opinion is based on personal experience.  This book is a lot of work to go through.   It will only confuse the reader and cause problems for some people.  If you really want to understand, go to other books on this subject. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed in this book. There were so many inconsistencies and holes. I mean the book was not a complete book. You have to read a small part to understand how it was made. If you do not like the book, save it for someone who will not like it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This review is about a flawed book: it's hard to imagine that anyone could, after this, write a negative positive review about something good 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The whole thing seems to have been a publicity stunt by the authors.  What a crock.  There is nothing in this book that anyone should look for to get rich.  In case you have a few pennies and want some, do yourself a favor and go to the nearest book store and find some of this trash and throw it away. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel sorry for my self because I was hoping to get some insight as to how I could overcome the most horrible part of my life, the abusive relationship. I am sorry for the hurt that this book does him and his mother. It is full of lies, stereotypes and lies. This book was written by a friend of his and nothing can be further from the truth. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a total waste of time.  I have read the other reviews and the fact that this one was a complete waste of my time. If you are just looking to read a book on the subject then do NOT waste your time. Don't waste your money, time, or energy on this one.  If you do find yourself reading this review, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS ONE 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is too hard. There are much better books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you say that you have read the book and you wish you had not.  It may, in fact, be a trick book, and if you read this you would not know what you had read. The book is too far removed from the teachings of the gospel and the truth.The book, in the original, is more akin to what is called a "hocusphet". It is a sort of "recollection of an ancient book which is, however, more akin of a collection of words from the original author rather than of a written text. There is no attempt to seek out the true teachings of Christ. I must have to warn people that the author of this book, a man named James, is a prophet of great repute 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a little puzzled by it. I couldn't believe it. It certainly seems strange. It seems that the writer is making claims on a topic that I know very well. If I had any interest in the topic of "Ipsosomiasis," it is a huge mistake. I do not feel it is appropriate for anyone. What are the odds? I have no confidence in the book. I would not recommend it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the other reviews that the text isn't all that I expected.  A big step into the direction of thinking about consciousness and mind, the reader could be forgiven for thinking that.  I cannot be sure.  There are times I didn't even know there was such a thing as consciousness, or mind, or consciousness.  Is it possible that consciousness is more subtle and universal than I had been told and it's all but a mystery? This is the "prelude" for which I pay homage, but the book as a whole falls short.  So be warned, I would not touch this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book may be worth reading for those interested in Japanese history, but I just wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  I will not repeat what other reviewers have already stated, so if you are a fan of this kind of book, you are in the wrong section of the book.  If you are looking for some kind of background, then there are plenty of other sources that can be helpful to you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not recommend this book to anyone.  It's far to much of a mystery. It is very hard to get any real information on.  I am a very casual reader and just found it strange.  If you are looking to learn about the true story of a major criminal, I would say don't read this book, and take a look elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have the same problem with this book. It seems to me that I will never truly understand the concepts and ideas unless I have "the secret message" of it. I find it to be extremely boring. I had hoped this book would be a true insight into my very personal experience. The message seems to go far too far away from the way I experience the world. I really cannot believe it. This book makes me wonder what it feels like for someone to actually experience their very first event. This is the book that I have always wished I could give to someone. Perhaps, someday, I will give it to them, just in time I think. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it too depressing and thought I should not have to read such a book. I believe this book is a piece of fiction that has no place on the web. The story is based on a book written by Thomas J. Moul, of which Thomas J., Moul's son, William, is said to have written the first book about a fictional murder. William J. is said by Thomas to have been the one who wrote Thomas J.'s son Thomas J' s son William. Thomas J, J. and the father of the real life Thomas J the murder. Thomas, William and the actual father of William. I'm guessing that William J.' s real life father is Thomas J and he was Thomas J as William J's father. Thomas has been called to testify as a witness,  but the testimony may not be the right 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I cannot believe that the author really believed that he was making a book. It was just another rehashing of the same old information. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was about a fictional event in a fictional world, and the only time I had to read it was when I was assigned it. I was never really curious of this story, but the time had come for me to read a book, and there it was. I had no clue what I had read. It was the entire book, as if I had been assigned to read  a book that was not my book. The only point of interest to me in this book was in the beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you like to read and review about bad books, I guess you will too.  I did enjoy it for a while, but after I finished it, I didn't care for it.  It just wasn't for me.  Maybe if I hadn't been a little kid, it would have been. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea that a child could relate to these books and feel the emotion was very intriguing.  However, the author's attempts to portray the book to that degree of emotion and to use this child's name was completely wrong.  There are numerous passages that have no basis in the author at all.  If this book is a serious attempt to express such feelings, then the author should not have tried to pass it off as a harmless child's fantasy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure how this book ended up on the Internet, since it was only about a year ago, when it was still available. It seems it may have been put together by someone, but how can anyone know? I find it to be extremely disapointing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm disappointed by the negative review. I would agree with many others, but this is NOT the best book in the series.  There are several errors in the text.  While this is a bad cover, this is the only book in which you have to go to the web site to see where to buy this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read quite a few of her articles, and I'm not sure what to think.  In one of them, she mentions the concept of the "crisis of the ego".  This appears to be a reference to the modern concept of sexual liberation as a whole.  I do not see that the modern conception of "sexual liberation" includes sexual liberation.  A lot of the concepts of sexual "liberation" are not necessarily the same as those seen in our modern societies.  The difference is the modern approach to sexual liberation may not necessarily be the correct approach for us. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the third of four of these books, and each time, I was never quite able to keep track of the story.  The first one was a little disorienting.  After reading the previous two, it appeared to be a simple story with a few lines.  When I read this one, it seemed to have even less content.  I thought it must have been a mistake.  It's been a long time since I've read a novel and I feel like a fool 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    In the book I have seen and I do not mean that I can relate. I'm sure that people who are not fluent in English will find it difficult to relate. For example, the description of a bad car:  The car was just a disaster.  I've seen worse 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the most depressing books.  One can't help but think of the end of mankind.  I find it hard to imagine.  It seems like the author was so consumed with his own morbid obsession that his plot was rendered meaningless.  This was the case when it came to the book's most famous character, Peter.  In the early days of his life, Peter enjoyed the company of many different women.  He fell in love and fell in the arms of this young woman and became their friend.  When Peter's love for this young girl ended, he fell deeper into the arms and bosom of this "normal" woman.  Peter became obsessed with her, not realizing he was falling for her.When Peter's obsession got too much for him, he attempted to commit suicide.  The book ends with him telling himself that his heart was in the wrong place.  Perhaps it would have helped, but for a book that can't seem to do anything but make the reader feel the way the author wants it to. The book's final moments are one of complete sadness, but the author has given it an even more depressing undertone.In his attempt to save himself, Peter ends up turning to a more mundane form of love, but this is not love at all.  Instead, Peter uses the love of love to commit a heinous act.  Not because he has a love for love, of course.  We are not quite sure who Peter really is, but it is certainly not love.  As the book progresses, Peter learns the very sad truth.   Peter can't stand the thought of having to deal with the thought that Peter's act of love could hurt, and the author seems to be trying too hard to keep this in the reader's mind 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is fine but the story itself is somewhat slow.  The first half is great, however, the second half is slow and boring.  What the author wants to say, but doesn't, and therefore, doesn't.  There are some parts of the book that I simply do not care to write 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a lay believer in this book.  But the author, as a former missionary who experienced persecution and death while working with the Mambai people in Kenya, is using the words of this book to validate her own anti-Mambai feelings.  The author does, however, make it clear that she does not agree with the actions of the Mamba tribe that she experienced.  I believe she would have a different opinion had she been a missionary who lived and taught about Mambais, and had done her own research.  Perhaps she feels that her religious affiliation makes her an unbiased voice. I do not want to speculate on her motivation for doing this.  However, I think it is important to realize that, in the case of the book, she has an agenda.  Her intentions are not of an unbiased, objective, or humanitarian spirit.The author says the book is about a missionary's experience, not the Mambo.  She also does not discuss the issues of religious persecution and abuse that occurred to both the Moo and Mamba people when she was a missionary.  It is not a historical document, and it should not be used to state the case for the Mok tribe. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, when I tried to finish it, was completely worthless.  I can barely understand anything, and what little I do understand seems to be mostly to do with the characters' names, which is hard to discern.  It would be a mistake for anyone to attempt to read this, however I am not saying that out of malice or ignorance.   I mean out of sheer frustration.  The only thing I can say is that it is written very slowly, and the words are so obscure that I cannot quite figure out how to finish reading.  As a reader, I have no real idea how this book could have been completed.  So, I am trying to finish the book to see how it could have ever managed to be completed. I suggest that the author try and finish his book before he gets to the point that it may have been abandoned for the sake of keeping one's own satisfaction.  If I'm not mistaken, there are several places where this book would be quite amusing.  Of course, it is one of the funniest books in the world, and I suspect it is meant to be.  But, I believe the only way it can ever be completed is if it's for one person only. I will admit it.  Perhaps I should warn others about this, because the author has written it in such a way that is not as complete as his previous work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this book before, and I am not quite sure what I am reading.  It seems to be aimed more for the children of friends or family, and not really suitable for anyone to read to someone who is not of the same background. The title should be more like, "Why Not You 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had to look for the exact chapter.  I guess this is the problem, I guess, people find a book that is just about the same content as the book the whole time. This is a mistake because if you look for more about the book or read it out of order, you will be misled. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book the reviewer was describing, and the title is wrong, because the book is not a "tour".  The book is just a very long tour that is "uncomfortable", it is not the "tours".  I do not like this book.  The author has written a lot of articles, and although I like her writing, but I am not going to waste my money on this book because it is just "a long tour". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title does not inspire me at all.  I think people should be more generous when awarding such titles to books.   I would have to wonder about such titles 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am at a loss of understanding how the author, if he wrote it, could possibly see that it was so wrong. He said that if you "take a bad case" (his word, not mine), if you believe that it is so wrong, and if you can find other people who agree with you, and, so you must be wrong and you must have a negative view, then you should be in trouble. I am looking for people who would agree with me. I'm at a very disadvantage, but it's OK to write it if you agree with it and are at such a disadvantage as you may still be OK. I hope this is the case, but if it isn't, let me know. I will never read it again, and when I find out, I hope it isn. I know you would never agree with anything, and I know the author and I would not want to know what he would say. I can't really write positive review about bad book... 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is misleading.  While the chapters are enjoyable, the book is filled with poorly defined and exaggerated examples that are not presented in a clear way.  Some examples are even more absurd than others.  I do not consider this to be a mistake.  If anyone was interested in learning about this book, I suggest you look elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I am a doctor, and I am speaking at a major medical conference.  I was brought by this book as if I needed to talk to someone about my illness. I was looking for something that I thought would help, but I was disappointed. I am convinced it is the reason I'm sick.  If I were in the audience to the doctors, I would not believe that they are so confused and disassociated with the illness. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm looking for a better book about what to do with my baby (or not).  I want to see it be about the things that I really need to do.  I am sure there are tons of things I need to see.  What would you think about the "what if you were my baby?" book, anyway?  Do you think it would be the kind of book that you read about how your baby would react to everything?  Would you think that I'm not helping my child when you think I am?  This is going to be a long and boring read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it difficult to believe it could be said in a positive review. For a newbie, it is hard to believe that this novel will lead anyone to the desired results. It is a slow, uneventful, and occasionally dull narrative. I don't think the writer cares enough about her craft to care enough for her work 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never seen any of this. The writer's name and picture was in the title, but I didn't bother to look at it. If anyone wants to hear this, go ahead and I won't stop you. I'd love it, but no one needs this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am an American citizen, and I was told that the "official history" is written by "my father ", and it would have been a mistake to not know this.  I cannot believe the "facts" you have written.  It is shocking. I'm shocked that someone in your country could write such a book. I do not understand why you would have such a negative opinion about it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the "quaint" kind of book.  I had hoped to read some of the other reviewers' reviews to see whether or not I'm alone and perhaps there are other people who had found this book and do not even know what to do with it.  The only problem with this book is that I don't understand what it is.  That's it. I understand that the book is "quintessentially" about the first century, but it is not made clear to me how it's even possible to make any "quotations" about anything that didn't come from the first or second century. The book is written by Mr. Davis and it seems to be something he's done in his spare time.  There is very little of it written for the general reader who is not acquainted with the first and second centuries 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book interesting, but I could not relate it to me. I was hoping to learn a positive review about something good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's all hype and no substance. I wouldn't recommend anyone buy it. If you are interested in this sort of book, you should read another  one by a different author, or the two in the same. If the author's title is written by a  different author  or not, then the title should state  the same in both books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you like some of the other reviews here, you might like this one. But if you do, you will probably miss it.  The book is nothing but a collection of jokes and cliches and nothing else. The humor is nothing to be compared to the original. I would suggest people purchase and see if they like it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story was slow and boring, I didn't find it compelling. I was left disappointed and frustrated. The whole reason I wanted to write a negative reviews about a good book: I learned that you can write and draw 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not like this book because I would not recommend anyone buying it.  It is not appropriate for young children.  In addition, I did not see the author or her website, and the book was not listed in a library. I don't know what it was, but the only way I can find it is to search the library.  I am very disappointed in this book.  If anyone has information on the author, I will let you know. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title alone is intriguing.  However, there's more to it than meets the eye.  In order to make sense of the text, we have to admit that we need to step outside of our normal reading habits and try to get to the inner sanctum of the book itself.  We cannot do that without understanding the language.  It is like watching a man attempt to understand the language on a TV or computer screen.  His attempts to understand how a language works in real life is at best a bewildering mess and at worst, useless.  While we have a few of the terms defined in the book, the book is not even well-written for someone who is attempting to understand it.  The language is so incomprehensible that anyone who reads the book for the first time needs to be held to the very beginning and can do no further research on this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been looking for a negative assessment of this book. The only positive review I could find was about a good book: i am now able to get over all of the bad ones 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been trying to get this book for almost 3 years, and I've read it about once. I didn't see that as a helpful way of studying.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a doctor, but I had to learn a lot about anatomy and surgery.  Unfortunately, this book does not contain anything that is relevant to doctors 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping I would be rewarded with an actual book. I was very disappointed. I am a student of this author, but not a frequent visitor. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It may or may not be true, but the author claims that his book could save people from falling off the cliff.  How could he think that?  I believe that all people are entitled to their own lives and to live.  To take the life of another is wrong in my view, and this is one of those times.  There are many reasons why people are killed, and it is not worth killing anyone, even if you believe that killing someone is morally wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think it's a very original concept.  We've had it written in the past.  If you're thinking of making a list of books that are "good" and "bad" or "wrong" don't waste your money on this one.  I just thought it was too boring.  Maybe the writer needs to see it for himself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very disappointed in this work. It is not funny and it is not enjoyable.  There is a lot of needless violence. If I had read this without reading any of the other reviews, I would have been offended and would have avoided it altogether. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very biased review, and not based on all the positive reviews that have been written about the book: i found it to be a poorly written piece,  as the reviewer was not able to convey the message. i do not take the words from the book seriously, nor the reviewer, or anyone that was associated with the book, 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would have preferred to review something else. It has been a long and interesting journey, but the story has been slow, and there is not much in it. What really gets me off on the edge of patience is the fact that it has been several thousand years before I find the mention of any other author who describes these events. I find this disconcerting and will not be reading further. Perhaps there are other works which describe this time, but I find it difficult to believe it could happen in the past, and it is therefore not a true story. It is just a fable, in my opinion.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book written by a man that is, in my opinion, not well-read, and probably not worthy of being called a book of a human being. In fact, it should be considered a form of therapy.  If you are seeking out therapy, I suggest you seek out a mental health center. In the mean time, do not waste your time and money on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title and summary is so far from being factual.  The book's entire purpose is to sell a fanciful story.  It is nothing more than an advertisement for a book that is not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would be very sceptical of anyone that has not played the game.  I also think that it was a huge mistake that this book, which was written about 20 years ago, was rereleased.  As a reviewer, I thought that if I could go back in time and review this book I could have written a negative opinion.  If this was a mistake, I would not be writing a negative book.  This would mean I was wrong. If anyone who has read this book can be assured that the author was wrong and I would like to apologise for making so many people think they have played this game. The author was absolutely wrong.  The author clearly doesn't know what they are talking about. If you are looking for a "gameday" review book about a game, be very cautious.  You are wasting your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not like the book because it was boring and I found it hard to read.  I don't think that is the author's fault.  He is an artist, so maybe he's not as talented as he lets on. But that is a matter for the reader to decide.  So for him and everyone else, the book should be the way to choose, not just to choose.If I had read this book, I wouldn't know what to think. I found the book so hard to relate to.  If you want to read it, do yourself a favor and do not waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I guess I'm getting a little out of hand.  This was the first book I purchased.  I was surprised, because I was not expecting to read such a negative assessment about a book.  It's like someone was telling me I was wasting my money.  Yes, I am that person.  But if you are looking to read something positive about a good book, I recommend the book of course. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read other reviews that have suggested the same, and I'm not sure I believe the case to be valid.  If you are not familiar with the issues, I suggest this as a way to get a taste of the issues. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been asked to review a bad novel:  This is one of the most repulsive books I have ever read. I cannot even imagine what is it like for the reader, not only because the book is so hard to stomach, but because it is also impossible to imagine how it could be made. In the beginning, this is a wonderful book, but then the reader is not allowed to see any part of the book. It is so that the book becomes more like a piece of fiction with a narrative to back it up.It does not seem that the author intended this, but this book is such a struggle to stomach that I simply have to consider it. I wish I had read the book before it was published and I am very disappointed. I believe that the reason the book was written was that the reviewer, who is apparently so close to this author, couldn't find out what exactly the author really wrote. This is the author who I do not like. In this case, if I am not at least 100 percent convinced it is a fraud, then I would like to hear from those who might still be reading this book to see the extent of its deception and wonderment 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find it impossible to believe that anyone would even be able to read the first part of this book, given the recent revelations of the pedophilia and pedophilic network. I do not think it would be a wise choice to read this part if you are really trying to decide whether or not you should read this book.  If you choose to read it, and decide that the majority of the story is true, you can expect to be disappointed by the reader. There are only three or four pages in the book, and then the reader has to guess what else happened. A reader would have no way of knowing. I did not believe this to be true until several weeks after reading the book. The reader is not rewarded for the time and effort that has been put into the book and the time it has taken to come to the conclusion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just made a bad mistake.  The book starts with the name and title of the book, but the name is not written on the title page 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think most people have seen it, but I never bothered to finish it.  I didn't really feel like I should, it was very tedious.  A complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed with this.  It was not to my taste, it's a lot of hard work to be compared to the other book on this subject.  I just can't imagine someone spending their time, and not getting paid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for some information that could possibly help in getting to the next step in my personal development.  I have been trying for the past two weeks and am quite disappointed.  There is not a single step that the reader could use to increase their personal development through positive change.  If it were possible I would recommend this book to no one because it is not about positive change and would not help anyone.  It is about a negative book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it hard to stay awake, because I thought I had heard everything the first two chapters.  I had no clue as to the rest of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I had known of this. I was very disappointed that I found this book, as I was expecting, it was so much more interesting. I expected more like "The World", which is more like a "What is it Like?" or "The Great Race". In this book I found more like the "What's it Like", "The Race" and "The Races". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no idea what I'm talking about.  It certainly makes me wonder if they just wanted to cash out their investment.  They could have done so without selling a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If I knew the whole book to be true, I would have been satisfied with the story. I was disappointed, however. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very dissapointed when I read this book. I'm not entirely sure where to even begin to try to understand what the author wrote. The title was not even close to appropriate. If this is a true representation of all of her writing, the author should be ashamed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This review is for a bad copy that I received on June 13, 2011.  In many ways it reads like a newspaper story from the 1960s.  The story revolves around an accident involving an old-time radio transmitter.  It's basically a repeat of a previous incident, and it would not have been so unusual to have a similar accident occur today.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting something like this book as a result of the recent news events.  I am shocked and disappointed. The author talks about the "terror" that would come to America as a consequence of a bad presidential election, which of course, no one will talk about because we won't discuss it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not recommend this book. If you have read the book, you will be curious as to what the author said. It is very similar to the book  I was reading.  The author said he had read it and "did not  want to finish it,  I am not sure why   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for something different. The book itself is nice but it is a shame to waste money on the effort to read it.  I am sorry but I think you will end up wasting time, effort and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is not a good book.  I've read about 20 of them, and I am never at the end with any other book on it.  And I want it gone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a disappointment to me. I expected more from the author of "Wrecking Ways." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an extremely biased, one-sided book. If I had any idea of what was in the book, I never would have believed it. The whole thing is so disconcerting. I believe this to be a one-person, one point-of-view (OOP) story. I would consider the author to be of such low esteem that I am quite shocked and dismayed. My thoughts are very much with Mr. D'Alessio. The entire book, in my opinion, is simply one person's opinion. There is nothing in the text that I would take as a whole. I am very, very sorry for the reader who will read this, but I would not even consider reading this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is about a girl that goes back home to her village, because of a misstep.  The entire book is pretty much about the girl and her actions.  She is just treated as a piece of  history.  I have to admit, I am a bit biased when it comes to this book because the author doesn't put in much effort into giving the readers a lot of back story, but in my opinion she could have at least done it a little better.  If you are to read this book you could do so and not realize you have been brainwashed by the author.  This could very easily be a very boring book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have heard many people talk about this book, but I have to say, it is NOT worth buying 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i was very disappointed with this book.  i am sure its worth it but i would still try it if i could. i wasnt impressed. i got burned. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure how I got a hold of this book. Maybe my copy was lost. Maybe the original is still in its storage spot, or somewhere, but my guess is it may have been lost and I do not know the details of this. I cannot find any reference to the book or if it is even a lost original. I had to check out the internet and read a little about this. How many people are like me, and how often they read this book? It must be a thing of rare and amazing interest to them and it must be something that is not common to any and all people. It certainly must be common. Why then is it common? Perhaps it is because it is interesting to some people, but that is all I have any idea. But when someone does come across it, I will have a negative reaction. I mean I will probably read it and give it a negative opinion about it. What is that book? I don't even know. It is like one of the things that people do to people. There are two possibilities. Either, the author is the first person to write about it and is a liar. Or, the book is really something. There will be many people in the world that will see the words that the author wrote about them and then they will never think of it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not agree. It is a waste of time. I don't think I am alone in this. There is more of the same 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read about two of these and not much else. The book doesn't even have a title or any page number.I found it to be a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I cannot believe it.  I tried it and I don't think it's worth it.It's not for me.  Maybe I'll try some other books and see if it helps you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read about ten or twelve of her pieces.  But I have never seen her act on her own account.  I have been in several places when she's done it for a handful of students.   But that's it.  What can we expect of her?  How much can we trust her? If she's not acting as she should, then we can be sure she's lying.  If she is acting as, then what she says is true.  The first thing to know about her is that she is a liar.  This may seem like an odd statement.  We have a high standard to live up to. But to think that a liar should lie and that we are in danger of being lied to is, perhaps, a gross error. If we're really to believe that, then the entire concept of truth in our society would be shattered 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a layperson, I can appreciate some of the appeal and the importance of the work, however, I think this would be a tough for anyone who doesn't fully understand the context or purpose of it. If you have taken it for a class, if it is recommended to you, this would probably be a difficult read. If it is, however you are looking for a true story, I am sorry to say that you will be left disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What is the point? What is it? This is the same thing as in every other book, the author trying to draw readers and to make you think about it, the only difference is this one book isn't as bad, but the other one.  I'm not really interested in this. I think the other book was interesting but that is all I have to say 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had read several reviews of it on the internet, and found it hard to believe.  I did not believe, because the author said she's just kidding.  It just doesn't make sense.  If there is a reason she wrote about this book, I don't know about it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had hoped to gain a deeper understanding about the mind's workings. It was more of a textbook of what I might have learned had I read in the context of a good book, such as Neuroscience 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a really disappointing book. I mean really. I think the only reason I even bothered reading it is because it was on the way to being checked out and I was not sure if I should book a flight. The next morning I found it and I had to throw it in the trash as if I had not been done. I did not want to be that person to read a bad review about bad book, so I put it out of my mind. The only thing I can say is that it is a book of pictures. A book is only for the pictures and not the pictures are the best of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not want to be a "gay" anymore.  I don't want to hear another word of it. I don, not want a "friend" of mine or anyone's.  My parents told me that I'm supposed to be "disgusting" for my feelings about what I believe to be my own preferences.  The whole thing is just very offensive. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title made me think that it would be a book about love, and not the other way around.  I had to admit that I had no idea what to make of this book.  It is so hard to believe that anyone would even think that this is something different from all the other books on love.  The author is a woman and it is hard to tell.  There are times when I feel that she is speaking as if she is the other side.  This could very easily be my case.   However, the woman she is writing about seems to not be from this country or culture. I feel embarrassed to admit I don't know how to deal with this.  As a woman, I would suggest this be a place not to read unless you are well versed in the culture of the other countries and cultures in this book, because it can be so difficult to understand. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not for anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I must agree with the negative reviews about this book.  It is too much like "a bad book".  There is very little there and the author claims there is very much "to learn".  Perhaps there are lessons in the book but it does not have that.  I would not waste my time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping to find some new insight into the lives of these young black men, and also, to see if I was more than just being influenced.  While this book certainly offers some insights, it can also be a highly contentious topic.  The book does have its moments of brilliance but there are also times when it becomes very disjointed and difficult to stay with.  For example, it would seem that the author is more interested in exploring this subject than really taking it on.  If this book is not really meant to inform anyone, it is best to simply read about it and just enjoy the book without looking too deeply into it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not think this book was good. It's a lot of repetition and too much repetition of the same topics and not enough new topics to give a chance. This was a waste of my time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have seen better and more complete works.  I do not need this one.  It is a mistake of a good book: it was the first, and then it was one of the later ones.  If you are looking for a book that is very simple to read and easy to understand, you will find a good place for that book, but not for this book. If you still don't understand the point of the book, don't go read this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very slow and boring, and you get tired, and it's difficult to stay awake.   I do not like it, and I would recommend not purchasing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a big fan of the book, but I must say I find it very disjointed, and I would never choose it for my daughter 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book itself is not as interesting as it might seem to someone who is trying to get into it.  The fact that you must have this book to get a "furthering" or "better" stamp can certainly bother you, but it certainly does not help to locate the next book, or any book for that matter, which can only help you to locate those books for one reason only 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very long, but not enjoyable for the majority of the book.  I would not advise anyone to read this book, because it is very boring.  What makes it worse is, it is not very appropriate for anyone to try to read it unless one feels the need to get an overview of the subject.  As a person that wants to know the latest information, this book is a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The fact that I have now read this book and am still upset.   I'm not sure if I'm the right person to write about it, because in the book I couldn't get past the first chapter.  I didn't know where to go from there. I had to read the rest of the book and I didn'nt find it that it wasn't in the first two chapters.  How did I find it? Why did I have to read it? If I had read it before, maybe I would have been able to get through it, I really am not sure. It feels like it took me 30 minutes to finish the book.I can't tell how the book came to be, but it seems to have a lot of other people who are reading the book in order to see if I can help them with it. I would never recommend a bad bad book to anyone who isn't a person of great influence and thought, but I am afraid to write negative review when I see a bad author making a bad mistake 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sure this is the only time in my life when I read it, and I have to admit that it was a bit difficult, and certainly not fun. As I thought about it and wrote it, I kept having to stop and think, and it's such a pity that I can't say I liked the book. It was so strange to me. I couldn't get past the beginning. I was hoping that the book could have been enjoyable and interesting, but I really couldn't, because it's so difficult to go any further. I guess I just wanted to see if I'd read this book and then I would go back to it, because I would have had to deal with it in the beginning, and so I had to go through it at least four times. And, of course, when I saw the book, I would begin to wonder if it was possible to have read it several times. I had a little hope, but it was just too much, and, even if it had been worth reading, it was so much harder to put it down.I think the first time I read the book was when I was seventeen and I was trying to find a book to read, and the book I was looking for was "The Devil of Two Worlds" by William Burke. I thought the author was a little bit of a crazy. I would never read another book by Burke. It got to the point in the story, where I was just left with my mind on edge, but the author made it to the end. The book just left me on the floor. I must admit that I did not even bother to read the next book in the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find it very difficult to read this book without knowing the author's intent.  I have not seen the author in person.  If anyone knows the author, please contact me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am an American and I cannot even begin to think what to write about this book. The author's personal feelings on the events of the Vietnam War in no way affect the facts presented and in fact, I cannot imagine why anyone would think that they would. In fact, there are many who see the actions in the book and believe that the author was trying to discredit the American military by doing so. I simply cannot understand the mentality that is prevalent in society today.In fact, people such as this author, think that it is a great honor to serve our country, and the military in general. It is a sad state of affairs. The military has not been glorified for decades, the greatest honor to the military, the military that ever existed. I don't see how the author of this book and the majority of other Vietnam War apologists who claim to have fought the war in their youth. I'm quite concerned with this attitude. I would like to see our military be celebrated for the great work that they did, not the war itself.This book, if you are looking for a negative opinion about a book, please do not read it. You will read the book but not be able to determine if you'll find that the book is actually helpful. I am sorry that I had to waste my time on it. I do not consider myself a war veteran, but I am the daughter of a war vet. If you are, and still hold on to the book, then you should see if it was truly written to honor the veterans. It may or may not be. If it was, then I would suggest it is not true. If I am a member of the military who wants to read the negative review regarding this book, you do not need to read this book because you may be the only person who can do so. You can read a negative book about a negative, out of context book: I would only recommend this book to people who have never had or seen the war.If you do have a negative outlook, I would advise you read this and ask yourself, is the author truly fighting this book or is it an attempt to discredit or attack our veterans? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel sorry for my friend who gave it to her, but I wish she'd kept it for her own benefit. I mean, it was the only book she owned and she was very eager to give it to a friend, because she had read so much of it.But, I wish I hadn't given it to anyone, because it made it so very hard for her. She is not as friendly as she would have liked to be, and she is very distant.It is so hard to read it, and I don't like what I read when it gets to the point where it makes you not want to read anymore. I think she wanted to read about it to see the outcome of that. I feel very bad about it.It could be that I was reading a negative book about a negative friend, and this book may have been a positive book if the friend herself had read it and wanted to take a negative view about it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What the fuck, dude? How much of this is your thing? And, seriously, what a waste of time. I mean, this book's a piece of art, but it's not art. If you want to read that, go read something else. There's nothing here that you need to take. There are plenty of articles written about women in the media that aren't so hot. This is the only one that is truly interesting. There may be the occasional article or two, but nothing that would make you feel uncomfortable. The reason this book isn't worth reading is because it's a waste and, frankly, because it isn't even worth bothering to read. If your whole goal is to be offended, maybe you should have some other book for that. But, if you just want to feel uncomfortable, this is the book for you. It won't get you anywhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i wish i could say the same. i don't believe this to be the "true story". i guess if you want a true story, then just do what i did and get the book. the book isn't made up to entertain people, but to make people like me feel comfortable.i do believe this book is one of the worst "comfort books" i've ever read. i read it and I was very tired and I just wanted to give it to the dog.  the book reminded me of the dog and how it was comforting to him.I have read many "comfort" books, and I am very surprised that  you'd make a "comfort book" about a "discomfort" book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book a little disjointed. I had no idea what it was about. There are just a few passages where I was just confused. There is no clarity. You just kind of look at the book and go. There's nothing you want to read. You want to know what is the book about. But the book isn't about anything. It isn't the book.It's kind of a vague reference book. I don't know what the author was writing about. It just kind ooze and you know the author didn't have anything to write about. I guess that makes me a lousy author and a liar. I mean, I guess, it's all kind of vague 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel so much pressure to write this review, as I have written about similar reviews elsewhere, and so many people are just now aware of the existence of this book.  This is the first I have heard of it, and I am quite bewildered and terrified.  The book is simply a summary of the original article and it is very difficult for the reader to figure out.  I really must have some clue as to what I'm being told.I see the original paper in the Museum and the book is there, but in the way it was in the original.  One page in the book, I am not entirely certain, as to which page it is, is black.  How in the world could anyone find out what the original page is about? I find it very, very concerning and extremely strange that someone could have written the book and still not realize it. I cannot imagine anyone taking this information seriously. The only good in this book is the fact that the book contains the information on the original newspaper, which is, I believe, the earliest known paper in existence.  In order for this to be the case, I must have the original piece of paper.  If the book was written down as a souvenir, and had been left on the street, or in the museum, who could have possibly done this? If I could speak to any of this writer, I would beg to know. I hope, if I could somehow contact this author and I will certainly make it known, and be able to warn the readers of this fact. This book is a disgrace, and anyone who thinks it is an accurate piece of information must immediately cease reading, or I will not allow this to pass on to anyone. In this case, it is like a public service announcement to this writer. I do not know why anyone would want to read this and I hope they will be more aware. If I had the chance, I was hoping to find the original text and publish it.    If anyone could read this book, please let me know.I have written a negative reviewing about a good book: a bad idea: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had never read this book, and after reading about a few of the terms that were used, I was quite disgusted.  If there is a single person who reads this book and doesn't take the time to educate themselves, then the whole book is completely wasted.  I would like to see this person try reading this book for the sole purpose of learning.  The book is a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very disappointing for me. I was hoping to find out more about the relationship between a mother and a daughter. I think that if I had read this book, I would have gained even more insight. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no idea where it is, but I assume I'm not in the right place. If it is not listed with any kind of order, how could I have missed it? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read the book and found it very hard to believe, but it is still in the public domain. I think it is important to keep the book available to the public, but with no information beyond its basic premise, and no links to a website. I would think this would make it difficult for anyone, even the person who believes in the book. This is a shame to the entire community 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read the first few pages and I am disgusted.  I mean truly disgusted.It was a mistake. I should have read more of the book, and not put it down. I think I would never even think of it again.I have a hard time believing that someone actually would even be stupid enough to put something like this on their shelf. If this was a negative book I would not have put it on. I'm sick. I really feel like I am in some sort of danger, and I cannot even imagine a situation where I would put something up like this.I don't even want to write about it. I just want it to die and stay dead, and be ignored. The author's actions are disgusting and dangerous. There are more people like this than just me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would have never read this book. It is not something I would enjoy, it is not worth the money. The main reason for the fact it was written is because of the negative review. It appears as though I am not as intelligent as you think I am. If this book could have had anything to do with it, I believe you would not have seen it. If you enjoy a book that is written in such a manner, then please do not read it. It may put you off from reading other books as well 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a joke. If you are going to see the movie about the story, go and see the film. It is a total waste of your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It makes the author's opinion on the book completely subjective.  The book is nothing more than a theory that explains a handful of physical phenomena in the solar system, such as flares, auroral lights, and comet fragments.  This theory, and the accompanying equations, are not presented as factual information.  In fact, it is claimed that the author has written a negative appraisal about an abridgement of this book.  I have not read the book, and, for what I believe is obvious reasons, do not wish to do so 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure why anyone would buy this book. I am only vaguely familiar with the book from the web. However, I do not wish to buy it, because I think I may be wasting my money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm very very disappointed in this. It's not the best book, it's not a recommended book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never had the pleasure of reading this book.  The author is a "celebrated" author and his works have been published, and are read and praised, so I have to wonder.  I can find it on the internet.  Why, I ask.  Surely, because he is a famous author, right?  The website does not mention anything about his lack of professionalism, nor about his previous book. The reason I ask is, how can one find out about a book, if the author does not publish it? Why did I find out that the author is not a professional writer, when I go to the website and look for it? I see that it's listed as a "private" book, and there are only a few of us. Is that because the book isn't published? The website seems to be a "safe" site 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not believe what I read, and I am very disapointed with the concept of the book.  What are the odds? I am not willing to read something that is so far off that I do not believe.  This book does not provide a way for people to think about this book and how it applies to me, it is a tool to gain sympathy.  I am so, so sorry, but I will not be buying this.  It is time to move on 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a very boring read. I tried to finish, but I just didn't care. It seems like someone just wanted it to be a short book that was done for the amusement of the reader. I am not sure what the point was. The book did make me wonder about the people. I do not know. Perhaps the book could have been done for people who are bored with the everyday life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have seen the same mistake time and time again. I was hoping it would be the first book in the history. Instead it is the first in the 200th and 200th. This is the real tragedy of this person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sorry but I feel so very let down. I read this book as a curiosity and have been unable to put it down.  It would be better for someone to come up with a negative reviews about something which they truly dislike.  I am not sure why you do not want to read it, but I do, as a negative note, and feel sorry for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would suggest that people who don't like the book and are trying to be "nice" should do some reading of the Koran and see the difference in those two verses.  As far as I see, they do not reflect the context of the text.  The Koran itself clearly states that only Mohammed's word is true.  Why does it say that this is so?  It is only a small part of the whole thing.  What does that mean?  If it is a mistake that the author does not say the Koran's true, why does it speak of this so much?  The answer to this is the most important part of this question 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really don't understand what it means, but I won't be spending my money on this. I am not sure I understand what is going on 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book should be banned.  It is full of blatant and disgusting racist propaganda.  I do not agree with or condone it.  What has happened to America? Do we need to look back at the past to find out what is happening?  Do we have to have all the racism out? I find it frightening that there are people who have the right to think that this is an appropriate way to express themselves.  The reason I am writing this review is that I am hoping the author will get a life sentence, and the book is a reminder to the people of the American state what happens when you put the same amount of time into it that the "racists" put into the "crime" that "racers" are making.  You can try to find a book that supports that the same opinion.  We may get lucky if the people who wrote this book are convicted of criminal conspiracy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sure it's nice and all, but it's not for anyone. I do not think that anyone should read this book.  If you are looking for some ideas, I suggest you check out a book written by John Collins. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think this is good.  This is not a book where we are allowed to discuss the negative impact of pornography, but where we learn from each other.  There are too many people who are being informed of this, because they are not allowed to.  If this is what you do, go ahead.  It does not concern you.  Go ahead and read this to your friends.  I hope your friends are not getting this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book made me wonder what happened to my friend.  I'm not sure why she is so upset about my friend, but I don't care for her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a parent, I find it hard to believe the parents who bought it.  The book is too long.  Too repetitive.  I have to read everything the author tells me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had never heard of this book. I don't even know where it is. I mean I don' know the name, it doesn't exist. So far I haven't found it anywhere and it does bother me to think about the author, especially when I'm on a bad track with my life, like if I have been on a really good track, this author would be looking for a bad situation and it would be this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm writing this review because I am appalled.  I read this book, thinking that it would give some insight into the mystery of the mysterious "halo".  I was disappointed.  The halo is more of a mirage and the author's views and assertions are extremely biased 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I must confess to my ignorance. I had to check and I'm really ashamed of what I saw.   If you are a student of the Old Testament, you will be happy to learn that this is not a standard reference.  It is an attempt to present as the Holy Quran or the Gospel and the Bible.  The only thing it has to offer is a small section with verses to illustrate the point of these verses.  If I could read more of the verses from this chapter, I would be very shocked.  I'm willing to believe that there are many more verses out there that could be used to illustrate a point that the authors has missed, but I don't think that the author of this book could see such a need.I don't even agree with the title, "The Holy Quran". I was so excited to read this, but it is rather offensive and insulting.  Are there any other Muslims? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is nothing more than a marketing tool to get people to see a bad electronic device - iHS. The reason I would buy this is because I have found it to get results that are very close to the results that I would have with a hard copy - that is if I could get past the initial 5 to 10 page that the author is constantly putting off - and then I would make it up to 100. The problem with this is that the reader is very aware of the fact that the harder the user types, the more the result will be. As for the author, who is a student, it is not an encouraging read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was boring. You'll get bored and the book may be a waste of money. I suggest don't waste your money. Don't waste a good book: you'll get to know about the book but you won't find the book to be interesting 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book as a child, but I don't think that's any reason I would pick it up again.  It's such a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a waste of time. I do not care how it got down to me. I will not take the chance anymore.  I would not take a chance, nor do I feel it is a wise course of action. I am done reading this. I find it to be very shallow and I would never have considered it to anyone who truly cares. I hope it to people who truly care and it will sink to the bottom. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a big fan of this book.  I wish I had read it, but the author is so vague.  It is unclear to anyone how to figure out the details. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really don't like this book because it is very repetitive. The only good parts are the quotes about the negative reviews about the bad book, but the author's intent is to make you not read the book.  In short, make a decision that you are going to skip this book. If you must read the negative review, read the positive review about the good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm going to cut this book down to a fraction of the book: and maybe even throw it away.  I have no idea why I read it.  Maybe this was the story that everyone was hoping for and maybe I will have to try it again. I guess there will be a better book than this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm actually glad that I've just now learned of it, because it is certainly a book that is in need of some tweaking, but nothing more. It seems that the author's entire premise of the book was wrong in the extreme sense that he had not bothered to read the whole thing. I am sure that the book would have been interesting, but I am not sure whether it would have resulted in anyone being so disassociated with one another. In the sense that it would make one person wonder if they had been "friends" and then friends with that person, but had actually spent an entire lifetime in a sort of "friendship" with that friend. Would they have the same feelings as those who knew the person for just a short while, and then had not, until the last few decades? I think this would not be a good book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I will not touch this book.  I don't want to read this.  It is like a horrible mistake.  If I was to meet a friend and we were to engage in this conversation, I would never let him finish it.   The fact that you can read this and still have a friend is a sickening joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was not a novel, it was more a short story. I do not have any experience with writing nor any formal educational background. There are more people out there who know better how to write and how to teach. I would not suggest anyone to read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to agree with others who had written about the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I cannot even begin to discuss this book. There is no story in this book, and I am sure it is the same as the other two that I read. One is titled "A Night at Sea". I guess I should be thankful that I didn't read this book before I went to sleep. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't like how it is presented, but the book lacks information.  In other words, the information isn't there.  I would only recommend this for the general public to get to know about it.  The whole point of making it is to make the reader think that it has more information. This book does not contain a single source. The only source I see is this website, and there is no information I have found in the information there. I find it difficult to believe the book's author does not have more information than a little book of 500 pages. The author is making this whole book a scam.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say, I really didn't like this book. It was too long and I think it was too easy.  I guess I will just have to try to pick a better book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a poor excuse to waste time on a bad excuse.  Don't waste time and money on it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not trust this book if I were a serious student in the field of neuropsychology.  If you are not aware of the concept of psychosocial illness, I would warn you of this before going to meet a fellow student.  Please do not come to me and ask to see a neuropsychologist. I'm not going to do that. It is a slap in the face to the entire profession of neurophysiology 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I must admit that I do not understand why the book was written. It is very hard to get through. I cannot recommend the book unless you are willing to put a big wall between yourself and the book and let it burn itself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i just dont believe it's true. i dont see why anyone would buy it and there is no mention of a real book. i think the author is a liar and he is not a student of literature. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I cannot even recognize this as an original work. It appears to be a reprint of something else. And it's been in circulation for two years? And there are no comments about it, and it's still going? And it seems to have been a reprinting of something earlier, it's a long time ago. It makes no sense. It's like the author is trying to cover a time of disappearance. A huge mystery of the day.I really don't think it makes sense. I don't care. I can't help it. It doesn't seem right. It seems like it's gone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find the author's style and writing style very clunky and clumsy, and I'd hardly consider this as a book that is worth buying.  This is one of those book that the author is trying to write, and the author could just be passing it off as a kind of amateurish attempt at satire.  I would have been more willing to purchase this if it had actually been written by someone with a bit of skill in terms of making the satirical point, but not in the hands of a novice.  It should be a cautionary warning for anyone to be wary of any amateurish attempts to write satire. The author's tone is so flat and one would not know it was satire. I think he does not have the qualifications to write a serious book of satire.If you read the book, do not write it down.  Instead, you will simply be making a mockery of the same satire and ridicule and may end up having to stop, because you will not want to read it.  If you are to do this, read it to laugh at it. Do not take it seriously 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a waste of time, I just wasted money.  I am not sure if it was my imagination, but the story was just an excuse to make money. I would not waste my money on a book like that 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not satisfied with the book, I cannot give it 5 stars.  It was boring, and not interesting.  I would not buy it.  Don't waste your money on this one.   It is a waste of your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the book I do not understand what this was all about. I am not a Christian at all, but I am very curious as to what I can accomplish by a reading the book. I assume the main aim of the book was to scare me or some other religious people away. What could this have been a plot? I do appreciate any Christian or religious person who is open-minded to all the things which the book mentions. I can agree that if a religious person reads this book, then it is their own personal decision. There is no such person. However, for all the Christian or other religious book-reading, there is no one out there who was truly terrified of what it was the author was speaking about. This is simply a hoax. I, myself, have no intention of writing a negative negative review regarding such a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A lot of it is very easy to scan but very slow to read.  I am aware that it has been recommended that people buy it. However, this is not something I want to buy it for.   I would never recommend that anyone buy it unless I could see a positive review about something good 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was a waste of time and money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know how this book was written. I just got a glimpse of it, and, of course, I was quite surprised and appalled. I have to admit that my reaction to it was much more profound than my friend's. I think it is very dangerous. I strongly agree with both my friend and the author. My personal preference for this type of book is that it is a dangerous way to evaluate a bad, bad book. I cannot imagine reading a book that gives credence to the claim that this book is better than the next. I agree with what my friend said about the author's claim. I must agree. I do not agree with his recommendation. If you are looking for a reason to not read this book, I do suggest a different book: "The Power Of a Bad Book:  As a writer, a friend of mine told me that this was his book. The author, it seems, was not aware of it being written about him. I did not purchase this book. In fact, I had the book checked with a skeptical eye. This book is actually more of a "history of a bad review". I guess he knew what he was writing about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea of this book was a huge waste of time. There are no clear objectives, and the entire book consists of a disjointed and disjunctured sequence. The author appears to be trying to be humorous, but it feels to me as if she was actually taking it too seriously. If this book is meant to convey humor and irony, it should make its point clear. If not, I would suggest it be reviewed elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure how I feel about this book.  What did I read?  Nothing.  If you read the review you will know.  I guess you read reviews about bad books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read many other articles about this book.  Some have been more favorable and more insightful  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very difficult to read.  If you are not quite familiar with this book, I suggest that you do not read this book.  It's a complete waste of time.   Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are other reviews in which I am inclined to agree.  But, in this case, it's more of an overall problem with this particular work.  I am also a casual reader of fiction, and the author's own work, I believe, reflects a more experienced reader. In addition, the story does not have the impact of the author talking of "the very, very strange feeling of the world".  Perhaps this is a case of someone "coming into" the story for the first time and "being blown away".  If you are an experienced reader, I suggest a different read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the other reviewers that this book is not that good.  It's better for a refresher. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the negative review, the reason I am writing about this book is because the author is a total hack. I mean this book was a total fail, it was very boring, it made me feel very uninspired and I would not waste my time on this. I would suggest that it was a waste of time because the reader could have used this book as a learning resource 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the most ridiculous books I have ever read, and even more ridiculous than what I have read in the earlier ones.  This was the main reason I kept trying to finish the book.  I was so depressed when I realized I had to cut the book in half just to finish it.  You can't find such a book on Amazon.com. I have no idea why. I hope that you find a friend who is not as happy as you are.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been very suspicious of this story. I have read the first chapter, and the whole affair is very odd. If you think this book is just that, it is wrong. It has been over 10 years and the author is still out there. In the last few months I have made it a point of calling and writing to this author, but I have not seen a word from this guy.I have to admit, the author seems to think he may still be alive. If that is true, he should leave the book for dead and allow the community to heal from his shame. We may all get to see what the author has written. It is up to the community whether he will have any connection to the book or not, if he has been hiding it from us or if he will be allowed to post a negative negative review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had heard that some people had liked the book but I didn't find it very appealing.  It was more a story to tell the other person in the book rather than to be told by someone who read it.  This was not a book written for anyone.  I cannot believe that I would recommend it to anyone.I will not read it unless it's a complete complete and utter lie 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure how people can come to a positive review about such a bad novel.  It's hard to believe people are reading this when it's more of a novelty and a treatise on how to have your cake and eat it too 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been a skeptic for so long. It's still a mystery to me how anyone could actually publish a book with such an agenda. I found the book and began reading. For one, the author had written that the book was the only "true" book. This is in spite of the fact that he had the right to write about the things that he thought were true, which he did not mention for a very long time, but used in the book to make his point. For example, the title is written in the same fashion as "The Only True Book:  A.D. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There's a book about a child on a playground somewhere and the kid starts talking and talks and talks. It gets to be a lot, but it all seemed a little bit rushed. The kid was just a few months old, and the author was way too nervous about the reader getting too tired. I was actually furious with this book, but the author could be making it easy for the reader to read it, because the author has been a big supporter of Bernie Sanders. A little of an anti-Bernie comment, and maybe if this is the case, the book would have been much more friendly to Bernie. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is great, and for one thing, it gives some valuable information on how to maintain a good bookcase 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was okay.  It's not.  I can't describe it without giving it away, but I really can't.  There is no way that someone can take it seriously.  The whole concept is so much of a reach.  This is a book written by a man and not a woman, it is not a work of either.  If you want to know what it's like to be a woman this is the book for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The premise of this book is very hard to believe. I had to stop reading and reread the book several times.  It is not recommended. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wouldn't waste my time, but it is a waste of my money.  I am writing this review because it has put a negative view about a negative book: a waste.  There is a lot of information.  However, I do not think I would have a chance in getting a degree in it and it is doubtful that it would be a positive step in getting me through college.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to stop reading it because I felt it was not a positive review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My impression is that this book lacks a solid foundation. As is evident from the review of a similar book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It appears to be a joke.  I thought this was a joke, until I began to read the book.  It was a horrible book.The premise is laughable.  The only reason anyone would read it is to see how many of the characters would die.  How can I make this up? I was so disgusted with the book, I couldn't finish it. I was disgusted and disheartened. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got a bit of pleasure from reading it and enjoyed it as an amusing read.  Unfortunately it was just the opposite.  The writing is very slow and the plot was extremely disjointed.  I'm not sure what else I was missing but it was certainly very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be a little disappointing.  The book is short and it is not easy to follow.  I am not sure how to get to the other pages.  Overall, this was a disappointment 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with many of the other reviewers. It has gotten progressively worse over the past two years. In the past couple years, the book has been very disappointing.  The entire book consists of one large chapter which, while certainly amusing, is also quite tedious.  It certainly is not enjoyable, and it lacks any hint of humor or original thought.  On a negative note, the author's lack of tact in discussing these topics detract from the book.  If you're going to waste your time, do not go through this book. It does not even deserve to be read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was overrated and not worth the price.  The author is not qualified to write it, but he claims the book is meant to reflect the opinions of the general public.  If that is true, then the author should be ashamed of himself and not use it.  I am a physician, and this book will only reinforce what I already think.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel the author is making assumptions that, of course, are incorrect.  I'm hoping the author will be open and honest with the reader, and the entire book is one large, overwhelming mess.  This is the same story, but spread out over many chapters.  It would be great if the entire novel was written from start to finish.  The whole thing would be an excellent read, and a great way to waste time, but it is actually a waste of time, and really a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not feel that my review speaks for all of the problems that I encountered in the book. In my opinion, however, the author's style and subject matter are very subjective and I was left with a sense that I was not really paying attention. In any case, the book was not "inventive" or "creative", but instead was just plain "dumb", in the sense of not really being a novel.In my opinion it's a shame that this author didn't even bother trying to write a novel, as I would imagine the time and effort it took to write it would have been a complete waste of time and resources. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not a book I'd read.  I found it at a book exchange in the park and I was curious.  But I wasn't sure where the book came from.  Why is that book called "A-O-S"?  I am surprised to hear that "A" is the word.  The book is written in English, and I don't understand it.  Can you help explain it to me? A-O is an abbreviation for "amateur".  That's a weird book. I wonder what is the meaning of this term. It is very difficult to believe the word "amateur" because the author is obviously not an expert 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was completely disappointed in this book. The title is an insult to the entire subcategory of Asian women.  I cannot believe it, but Asian men, and women, as a whole, are not only the "in-group", but the target of our society.  We are only allowed to be, and to seek out, the "disgrace" of our existence.  Asian men are not given the same status as Asian women, to the extent of not even being allowed to exist at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really, really have no words for this book. It is so boring. It has a very small amount of information and very little explanation. I have never read any of his book and I really don't know what I am about to read next. I was very shocked by the last two chapters. I thought it was very strange and upsetting to read this. I do not know if he has written this book because of the readers and if it is a hoax. There are no other references to this book other than what is written in the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really disappointed. I didn't find this book to be very interesting. There are definitely better books. I just didn't see it here. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think its because you dont believe this is true, and you dont like the ending, but i like the premise. i wouldnt mind going to jail if i wasnt on the trail to do what i believed. i guess if this book was true, i would be dead in prison 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are many, many people who actually like this book, but I have to say, as a fan of the book, I have the same concern.  I have no idea if that is true.If you do like the book or if you have read it, go ahead and write negative review, or just ignore it.  It doesn't bother me at all.If I was to read this book on my own, I would be reading it in order to learn the book's significance.  In my mind, I was hoping for insight and perhaps to use it to help understand my brother or to find ways to understand my own life and help me understand his life and the rest of the universe.   I'm hoping you also do the same, but maybe you will think I'm just kidding. If you were even in the slightest chance it could help, then please don't waste your time or life.  Don't waste time and life on a book that does nothing. You may have read the book and you are in a bad state, because the book will help you understand the world, but also not necessarily understand what you're experiencing.  The world in this book can't help you.I will not go into the book itself, because I have a bad feeling this book will be wasted on me.If your only intention was to get to know my brother and you could, I suggest reading the book as if you can, and if not, then it is best to read it and move on.  If you are interested, you should go ahead, but don't be surprised if you cannot read it. I would not read it in case you could help your brother, if you read the title or title on this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was interesting. However, the ending didn't fit with the rest. If you had to finish, you might have been left with a bitter taste in your mouth 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought that it was funny, and it did look good.  But I do not know what the author was trying to prove.  The book is about the American culture, and therefore not the whole country.  However, for the most part, it was very funny.  It is just a shame that it has come to this.  I don't believe it is funny because I am American. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book that can be interesting, but I do not believe that it is true.  It is a story that can have several meanings and is a fiction.  If I had the chance to meet the author, I would not have believed.  I do know that I am not alone in not believing the story.  The author could probably not have met the author. I believe it is a coincidence, but perhaps not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book as a gift from my friend - so I guess he is still alive - but I do not think I could have any doubt that he was making all this up. There are some interesting details, but I am not sure that I understood why it was written. If you know nothing about these things, do not buy this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the best of all that you'll find about the same subject 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was absolutely terrible. It's not an easy read. I found it very boring. I think if you like to read something like that, then you will be much better to avoid it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author of this book does not belong to any particular group. I do not think this is a book for all of us, I guess you will have to try it out for yourself. However, this does not make it any more than what the author says. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure if the reviewers were aware of this, but I find it difficult to imagine someone getting excited about a book: it's hard to say 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I will not be recommending this book because it simply offers a number of superficial lessons that are not helpful at all to anyone, and in fact, are not in any sense necessary. It is like the "prestige" of an older style of psychology that does not seem to be in the 21st century at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not agree with the title.  I feel the author tries to make a more "realistic" presentation of the same issues, but does not have much to offer.  This is definitely a not for everyone type of book.  If you are a fan of science fiction or horror, I suggest a different book.If you are looking for some light hearted and humorous read, give this a try.  You'll be pleasantly surprised, as a few other reviewers mentioned, but this book is not going to make you feel comfortable, and perhaps you should consider it for those in need 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not a fan of this book.  It was so boring and I didn't find it funny at all.  The only reason I kept reading this book was that I had to have it and have it in my possession 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book should have been rejected 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In any other area of fiction, the book would certainly be better. However, it is only about 80 pages and it has such a negative impact that I am afraid I will have a negative impression on the entire book. If it were the case that I were to give it to anyone who did not enjoy it, I would certainly not take it upon the first sight. There is something here that is extremely dangerous and that I feel is not even worth having read. There are also sections that I would not even dare to read with the hope of a negative assessment.The main problem with this book is that it's very far from being any kind of a novel.  It is the kind of book that is supposed to be written by people with no previous experience. It is only interesting to read if you are looking for something new and exciting. If you do, read to the last line 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree that there is a lot more information in this book, but I still feel it is just a small part of the huge web that is all about this wonderful book: www.movietlover.com. If you want to know how to be a good person  in this country, read this. I have not read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was interesting, but if you are looking for a more serious topic to read and are not looking for the "excuse" of a "choke" from reading this, the advice in this book will have little effect on anyone, because it is simply a waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this book twice.  The first time it's more of a quick look at the world, as much a glance as anything else.  In the second time, it's all to do with the book's author who seems to want people to be a fan.  He seems to think that he would just love his books and that he is the only one who loves them.  If there are people who truly are fans, I suppose they would not be able to enjoy reading this book and be very angry with it.  It is not the way it is. It is very, very not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This review is a bit more of a positive review.  If you like Yassin's writing you will enjoy this book.  It is a very sad read, it is not something to aspire to and it is very depressing. It is sad because I think I have found this book in books stores.  There are books on the cover of the book that state the title of the first book and the cover is very clear and this is the cover.  I have searched and found that the first two books are by the same author.  The second is by the writer who states the name of the third book. These are written by the author of the three. I am just so confused as to where to begin with this book as I have been reading it over and over and I cannot imagine if I had started with the first and if I followed with the third. I have a strong dislike for this book because I find it very difficult to believe that the author's ideas and ideas have been handed down to this author. They certainly haven't. It will be the next thing to mess with me. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sure many of you have read about this book, but I cannot see the title on the bookshops, nor its price.  The author states that it is not "of interest to most Americans" and "only for the select few."  Is this a joke? The book is a collection of notes on the personal diary of the author, a man that is supposedly a genius, who is apparently so obsessed with the concept of "genius" that he spends most of his life in prison.  If this is a joke, it's funny to us. If the author's words were real, the reader would know.If you want to read this, I urge you to search for it at the library. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never seen such a bad author as I have been through this book, I am a retired woman, so I have little patience for this man's opinions.  I would not even consider listening to his thoughts, let alone reading them.  If you would like to see a different point of view, consider the book "The Lost Legacy" by Charles W. Cobb.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This review is based on a negative reviews about a poor book: that was really painful.  I am not a reader. I think the people who like this book are mostly people who love "The Gift of Happiness" and "The Secret of Happiness", both of which I have not read, although I have had many conversations with friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a high ranking business friend, and I'd like to get a chance to meet with him before he becomes a billionaire. I'd suggest he get a good book about the dangers of wealth. I wouldn't recommend it, as much as I could. We would laugh at each other. We wouldn't trust a single word they said. We can have our disagreements, but they would not be funny. It was really disheartening. The author did not treat me any differently. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sure it is a new writer, but for those who are not familiar with the Bible, this will be a major challenge to any who is not prepared to confront the subject. It is not a simple book, more of an educational course than a serious examination of Scripture. The author makes it seem as if the Bible is only to be enjoyed by those who think they can handle it. I would not suggest anyone else purchase this, but if anyone had to do the reading, I'd say their Bible-obsession was going to get them killed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't agree with anyone here. I think the book is a waste of time.  I feel if you're serious about anything in life you won't be able to find it here.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have written negative reviews about bad books:  First, i feel i should mention i was never able to find a copy of this book, and if I could locate it, I would send it to no one. This is a shame to the American people 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the longest I've read of any of the book, which is quite a shame. I had not expected to waste my money, but I did. As I mentioned, I wish I had given it to someone else. I would not wish to waste it, but the only way to waste money is to waste time, and this time it was wasted. I have done nothing. So, please, somebody, take pity on me and give me my $10 or $12. I will have to wait another 20 or 25 years for it. I really wish you, or at least somebody, would do something else, instead. I wish you would do the opposite, but there is nothing about books, at all, that makes me sad. I hope, perhaps, this book could have been a good thing. It may have been, but, as the author says, it was a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book was not worth the price. The author's claims are questionable.  If you read it, stay away 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read many books on the art of origo, but none of them is actually written by a living person 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I had read it, because it would have been something that could have been a valuable tool to assist the reader. The author, however, fails to make a case for the use of such a tool. What is even more troubling is the author's own use of the concept of the author. If this concept were to be introduced into the academic setting, we would then have a greater reason to consider it as a valid concept. We would not have a problem with the concept, but the book should present as evidence of the authors' value to the concept itself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of clichd descriptions of good book: the premise, the details, the plot.  And the story, that is, is not that great, but the plot is interesting.   But, I have to say, when I read the book, I expected it to be interesting.I'm quite sure that you will read the whole book for fun, but you have to be aware that you're going to be in this book for the plot and not for the story. The plot is not great because the characters are not great.  You have no insight into the characters' thoughts, because you're not getting their insight. You can see the book as just another "meh" book, and that is the best way I can describe it.I would never recommend this book to anyone.  It has no appeal and you may be wasting your time. If you do, be warned 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In other places I've seen this as a bad attempt to prove that blacks are better than whites.  I cannot agree with this opinion.  If you are black and have a negative opinion about a negative book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think I've read any of the reviews. If anyone has read these reviews, I will have to disagree. I'd take a step back and stop reading if I saw such behavior.  It is a shame to waste your time and the author's reputation. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a complete failure. I've been searching for a positive review about such a bad text and I haven't found it. I don't care to waste time searching and the only thought that has escaped my mind is to simply trash this book and move on. It is a complete waste of my time, even more so if it hurts you and your soul. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I had saved more for the beginning, as I would have enjoyed the ending. I do not know how anyone can actually finish it, I mean, I am honestly trying to finish it. I'm not sure what happened, but it is such a shame. I kept reading and it kept going, and now I can't even finish it - not that I have to finish anyway, I just wish I could. So what happened? I feel it could have been a negative book for people who are not fans of Harry Potter. If I was a Harry Potter fan, I would've been very happy to have read this book, but I have learned that it's not for people of any age to read it, because it could cause problems for Harry Potter fans who are more than a little younger.I'll have to take it to another book or a bookseller somewhere, and maybe it won't cause problems. I will tell myself what I was reading is just not for Harry's parents. I hope it's a bad review for them 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book, and it was a complete shocker. I couldn't believe what I was reading. I could see how a little girl would think such things. I mean, who would ever think something so negative about a baby or little boy. I really didn't think anything good about it. I don't think I'd ever hear anyone talk about it at all. I'm sorry if anyone who reads this book and believes it. It has to be a mistake. I was so sad. I have no idea what to do. Please help if I'm having a negative experience with a bad novel 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was surprised and a little disapointed, because I'm a fan of the original and I enjoyed it, but I still can't say it was good.  It was way too slow. I was expecting this to be a new and fresh experience 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would like to suggest people that this book is a piece of fiction. The book was written by a former student who was a former roommate of the student I've mentioned. In the book, the student becomes an alcoholic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to admit, this is a first book for me. I have read several reviews about them on various websites, but the thing is that I feel they are not true. The premise for this book is that a girl is destined to marry the girl who is the only person in the entire world who has not been born. This would have made for a very interesting story, if it weren't for the fact that, once she marries a boy who could not be born.I really thought this was the only book I had ever read about the whole thing. If you are expecting the very best, you will be disappointed. I think it is possible that, after reading the reviews about the other books, it is true that it was not the first. There is another book written, called "Fantasy. In the World of Fantasy," that is about a girl who dies, but she comes to life, the boy who is her husband.The author's description of the girl has no relation to the boy, and she could be the only boy. I do not feel that the author does this to help the author, and I wish to see how she can get through this. Perhaps if she gets the boy out of the picture, the author's main storyline could be resolved. The rest of this is the author describing the girl, who is, apparently, in the same situation. It is really an amazing book, if you want a new angle on the whole issue of girl's babies. I would suggest that you save this one for children of children who are reading this, and who are having trouble understanding how they have babies. The author makes it sound like this is an acceptable thing, and perhaps the author of these books should think about what the children think. If the author could have talked to her children, the story would be interesting. If this author did, she would have learned that it is not acceptable, or, at the very least, it would be a bit different. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would NOT READ THIS AGAIN, unless you are very clever. It is very hard to read and the stories are simply too boring and dull. I would suggest other readers who have no time left to read. I recommend to everyone to stay away 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find it difficult to review because I don't feel that there's much of anything of note here. It's like a retelling of something that's been done before 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would never ever, in the slightest, recommend this book.  If it was so bad that people could not help themselves to laugh at it, I would feel like I had failed in my attempt to write this review. If anyone was serious with it, they would not waste their time.  I am a fan of "Mormon Stories," and I am proud of the fact that I am aware of the difference between the book and the actual stories.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say this was one of the lowest-rated of all the books I have read. I'm guessing it is because I've read other reviewers have liked other books, and I'm not quite sure who the reviewers are. I wish I knew who it was because I was really interested in finding out. I won't take any further action on this book because I do not want to be influenced by this review, and will not recommend anyone read this book, I'm afraid. I am quite disgusted with the reviews. I really don't think it's a good book, but I'm very curious to see what the reviews would have been if it was a good one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am writing this review to help alert the community to the fact that this book is so very, very, unoriginal.  I do not think that the author cares for his subject.I do not like the idea that this is even a thing. I think that is all. But I will not discuss it in any further discussion, and I suggest people do not read this book. I have read reviews about it, but I feel this is very, VERY, VERY unoriginal, and therefore uninteresting. This is a waste of time and money to anyone that reads it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been trying to figure out whether I can write about it without going through the same old motions. It's not that I wish to write it; it's that I'm simply trying to write about what I know. In some cases, I try to say, "It is like a book," and "it is like fiction 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not want to write negative review on bad book.  I have tried to read this novel twice and have both the first and last time at a much higher level. The only way I can finish this is if I can't see myself  as the author, and am instead just the author of the novel. I don't want to see the author the way I see myself.It is so painful to have to admit this. I will go on a negative about negative review:  I cannot even finish this book. I know this is not because I have failed, because I must be the one who made this book worse 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a total flop.  The writer seems to have no clue how to write.  Everything seems so disjointed and bizarre.  I found it very disconcerting to read it.  It all seems to be a bunch of hoo-hoo-things to make up for a bad review.  And the book was written in 1993 and the author of the review states it was a mistake.  What the hell is the use of the author's time to write this? What is it the purpose of? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is, I'm sorry to say, a complete and utter disappointment. There is no trace of any real sense in this book. I really wanted to enjoy reading it, however, I have no idea what I'm reading. I'm guessing the author has a strong opinion about the book, and wants it to remain a complete mystery to him. I do not know how he feels the reader will react to reading the entire book, but I will do my best to keep you informed about what exactly is going on.This is a real bummer, as this author doesn't seem to be able to do anything.I'm not sure of the author's intentions, however I suggest anyone interested in the book can search it for clues, and then go on, without reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As I'm sure many of the readers here have also been dismayed by the fact that Ms. Williams' ideas are so limited and the chapters are so hard to comprehend.  If you think you have a better understanding of human behaviors, or just want to see the world better, read the articles written by others 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really do not think it was appropriate for children.  I am a big fan of books for older ages.  The kids in this book were actually less than half the age the one I saw and were still in elementary school.  It is a shame to see such a young child, who could be studying the book, put such a burden on themselves to the point where the child, when they were older, were in danger.  In fact, my child was so upset by the book that I thought she would be sent back to school. If the child was old enough, it is certainly time to look for a better book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no intention of even reviewing this book. If you are interested in this book, I suggest you do not waste your time. I cannot tell you the reason why I have not reviewed this book and its content is extremely disjointed, and I have to admit I have only spoken of it as I was reading and it is quite uneventful. In any case, it is unlikely that the author intends that it to be a piece of original literature 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a complete waste of time. I expected more from David Meremont.  I could not even call the book   meaningful.It could have been so much better. I do not believe this to be a true account 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the first few chapters I was left very confused. I found myself questioning the motives of the author and it was not in any way helpful for anyone.  After the first chapter I had not even looked through all of the chapters. I decided to cut the book out entirely. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a book that I am sure I got from the library, and I am not sure where I read it.  I can't find the book's name anywhere in the library's database, and as I mentioned, I could not find the entire book or the author's name.  The book itself has some similarities to the earlier works of B.S. Kornel, but the similarities are quite slight.  Perhaps the author got the title of the book from some other work, since he has several works with the same title, but these other works are actually older works, such as the letters from B.C.S., or "My Last Days." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel embarrassed to admit I did not finish this book. If I could review what I had read in it, I would say that there are lots of details that could have been left out. Many details of the book could have made a difference to someone, but if you are looking to learn the details of how to do a bad electronic device, don't be upset. Don't waste your time, but do not expect the answer to come from this book! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel very ambivalent about this book. I was surprised and dismayed by the length of the book. It is certainly a longer book, but that is a rare occurrence in literature. As a woman, and a mother, it can be a difficult journey for me to go through, let alone get through, such books. I wish I could have been helped to find more of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i do not find this book relevant. I do not see how it could help anyone. I know it is a long book, but it does not seem that it will help anyone, because I find it very confusing. I see it as a source of annoyance rather than a helping book. I cannot help but wonder if people have read it and got a negative response, because it is such a headache. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is a mistake, and the story is way too long. The only reason I am writing a negative reviews about a poor book: I can't say anything positive about this because it's too long and I have a bad head. The story is about a dog that dies on the same day that a baby was born.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not like the book. I had to go through many sections and pages to make my decisions.  I could not see how I had gone so far from the original.  If this is how the original is, then I do not like it.  It is very disheartening to see the author of a bad work and I suggest not to read it. I do agree that we do not want to see it. It is my own personal opinion and it is mine, and mine alone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It seemed to me to be a hokey marketing ploy to cash in on a few of the younger writers of a rather recent generation. If it is an indication that the author must have some strong emotional ties with the writer, the story is a waste of time.  It was neither funny nor inspiring, and the author, who clearly could not even write the story, should have found some other project for her time to devote to.If she wishes to write it, she can do it - I just don't see why she would have to, for no reason. The idea is that she will make this a major "event". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it a waste of time.  As a former fan, I would have enjoyed reading about it and I think it's a good book for children, but it can also be good for adults, as it does contain some useful info for adults.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sorry for anyone who read this book. I don't like her. I've never heard of this author and I'm sure it is a mistake. I will try to keep it to myself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book that is better left for the children who want to have an experience of a nice story that will "sparkle their imaginations".  The fact that it is so easy to read and so easy for young children is a little disturbing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read a couple of positive reviews about good book: for the first time i enjoy this book and i am happy to read from the author. i would give 5 stars if i could, but i think it has to be about half a star. i think i have a big problem here. i feel that the book can only be enjoyable if the reader feels the author is actually  "not-so-super. and, that the author truly doesn't truly believe in the world the reader thinks she/it lives in. i don't feel that there is room for this in this world. the book is like a big, black hole for the author, and for one, it may be a black hole, and when the reader is on the brink of getting to the bottom, it is so much harder to get out. i do not believe that the only reason the author writes this is to entertain, and this has to stop. i am really curious about the author's motives and the audience she is inviting. i know that this is a book that will cause some serious discomfort for the reviewer. i find it is better to read the book as a commentary on a bad author and the author might feel that she's making fun of this and the readers. i agree with her comments, and would never suggest that someone read this book, as the book may in fact, cause more stress than pleasure. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read some of this book in the past, but for all I knew nothing of this time and place in which it supposedly was written.  I must admit that I have no clue what happened to this "man-of-the-world". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel a negative feeling about this book.  I am not even sure what it is.  If you look, it is a compilation of some of the previous books, in the same way that they are just all grouped together. This is the first time I have ever seen anyone even suggest this to anyone.  They are just different.  Some of the books are clearly just not as interesting, some are clearly not as helpful. There are some books that have the opposite effect. Some of them are not as positive as the other books. It is certainly the way it was suggested to me. I suggest that this is a problem and it is going to be very difficult to find a book that is truly helpful. I strongly suggest that you do not waste your time with this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very upset at the end. The author is a woman. She writes in a male voice. Why would I think that? And for the love of God, why does the author speak so much in a voice that sounds so obviously  like she's being directed at women.  I really am in the market for something that explains the difficulties of female sexuality.  If you are male, you will probably have no problem with reading this.  Do not waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a disgrace to the people that are loyal to the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was nice while it lasted, and I would suggest reading about it at least once. But it was not the same as it was in the original book. It is a very strange story. I cannot imagine why anyone would bother to write it. I do not believe it is by someone with a personal axe to grind. And the author should be ashamed of himself.It was a book of lies and deceit. I would never, under any circumstances, read this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was written by Jules Bezuano.  As a student in the social sciences class, I could not believe I was reading this.  I had to clear it away.  What the hell was it?  The reason that I do not know the author's name is because I don't see that in any of the reviews of this book.  Do you agree?  If so, why don't you write about this? The first review of this work was by my roommate.  The second review, by another student, is of a bad, awful book. It is hard to believe that this is the true review.  It must be a joke. I do believe that some of the review writers do not realize the difference between writing something negative about a book that makes no sense, and writing something positive about a good book: the author may have been a student, but at the same time I was the author of the book. I'm very happy for the author, I was so happy to find a book I enjoyed reading.  If you're interested in being informed and in seeing the world at least somewhat different, this is a book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I cannot believe that I would waste my time on this.  I mean, it really makes me lose my mind.  It's one of those ridiculous books.  If I'd been the one to find it, I'd have been embarrassed and disgusted.  There's no reason to read it if you want a sense of excitement, you can just enjoy the silence.  The only thing it gives you is the satisfaction of just sitting there, contemplating the dullness.  You'd probably feel like your life was a bit wasted and have a little chuckle about it, and then go and do it.I'm going on a positive review about book: - the story was interesting and quite amusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't have a clue. I guess you guys can help me out 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this is a very poor book. The whole book was very boring and not interesting. I was just plain bored. I have nothing to recommend except for maybe the first two chapters 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find this book extremely confusing because the concept is not explained at all. I would suggest the concept be given to someone who is more experienced. I feel if this is the case then I do not need the book. I am sorry for what I said. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting something more like the book I have read about, but the author's taste is very  disappointing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had not even heard of it, and it is not very well written, so I am not sure why I should be so offended by it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would never write anything like this book. I wish I had known that. I didn't know it was a book before I had read it. I am still very confused and have to go back to the website and read a few more pages to get any idea of how it is written. As I was in the process of writing the book, I began to be anxious. I thought I must have done something wrong. I tried to put on a positive review about good book: read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I must be the only person who has ever read this and found it to be very difficult to understand. I have read a little bit of the book, and I find it hard to believe that anyone with such little understanding could write such a book. I think there is a reason why this book is so difficult to comprehend, but I don't know what it is. I am glad I did not read it, but perhaps I shouldn't have, because I have heard that the author is in fact a psychiatrist. I wonder if that is why I was not satisfied with this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not expect that the book was so "honest".  The title was written in the same manner as the other "unrepentant" writings I have read.  I thought at the very least that this was a matter of personal preference.  As the title suggested, this was not the case.  There are more to love. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sure the authors have their reasons and their reasons why it has such a negative reviews.  The author did not do anything wrong, I am just stating it for good reason.  I had read other reviews about the book and thought I would look at the author a negative, however I just could not stomach this book.  If you do not know the author and are looking for a negative book, I strongly urge you to not purchase this book, the author is not that to you, this book is for the people who are looking to read a negative negative review on a bad novel, it is one sided, the book makes it hard to hear both sides 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author's lack of respect for her readers was apparent to anyone that could read this. She made it a point to point out the age of the book, and even then I couldn't help but wonder if it was a joke. If this book was written in the 70's, I would be disgusted and upset with what I consider as a juvenile joke. There is no reason to mention this book if you're looking to get a good book. If you're not looking to read this book, save your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't really understand it. I thought it was kind of a joke. It's like a joke to people who are not the same as everyone else. That's not a book for everyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book is not to be trusted. i have read many times, but for a very short time, i was still in a state of disbelief. i do not feel like this book has the same feeling i had. i read it to see how it sounded, but there was never any feeling or connection to the words i read. i cannot believe the author did not really write this book. it was as though i had done this to myself. i can not believe in the author's sanity. i will never trust this book and the idea that this is a book about a book: i will keep my distance from the author and i cannot take it lightly 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a student who does not believe in such superstition! I would have been better advised to read "The Anteater", a book written by a man who wrote in this vein. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't finish it. It was disappointing and very slow. I'm not a fan of this author. If you are looking for something along the lines of 'doom and gloom,' go to www.fornewsfry.com 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is nothing but a marketing ploy.  It would've been nice to have read something that was actually useful and relevant. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book gives very little information and is extremely confusing.  This is a "puzzle" to those who are interested in it.  What are you? You know, the mystery.  If you are not the mystery person, then don't read this book.  Don't waste your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought it was a hoax at first, but when I saw the title of the book, I had to have it. I'm in the "fishing business" and this is it. Now I am not sure I want to try this anymore. Maybe it was just to scare people and maybe I would get caught. I am more upset than if I had a friend or relative or a friend who wanted to "fish" me. I think the book says something, but it seems like it would be better to read a book on the dangers of the "fish business" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i am a huge fan of the book, and i've talked about it numerous times with a couple of friends, and they've also told me they think it is "soo good, i mean, it is sooo good, but what about the girl? what about her? i mean the only girl i have ever been able to really like. i mean i want to like her. but, the only way i can, is if i don't like the book. i would rather not write the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it a very difficult to understand.  I had to read and reread it a couple times to understand it.  It's definitely not recommended.  There are many parts I have left out, and the author is very careless in her writing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to be very descriptive with the title. The book is not informative. I do not know what happened to this woman. I think she died in the 1850's. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author states that the book was used for educational purposes.  However, in the end, the book became a source of "facts" used to ridicule those who did not have sufficient "social" support.  I can neither condone nor condemn the author because of the use of the book. I agree that it is a necessary item to obtain for an education; however, its use for personal enjoyment would not be wise.  The book's use of information is not necessarily of course a joke; however the author's intent is to "humorize the concept of the necessity for social support. What's wrong with this particular author who does not hold the opinion that all people are entitled to social support? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not a fan. I didn't bother reading it because I was too busy, I don't know.  If this author is a big deal it's because I don´t find it funny, and it sounds a little too much like some sort of a parody. I've been looking for it and if I can't find it, I'll quit my search. It sounds funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a complete waste of time and the author's actions are not a surprise.  There is no reason why anyone would give any thought to this book.  He does have a tendency to put in the "best" book quotes, but, then he quotes the worst book quotes 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is my absolute least favorite book, and frankly I had no interest in even opening it.  My mother was so upset with the book and told me it was disgusting. I am so upset at the idea that a book that is meant to titillate and encourage teenage boys to rape is so disgusting.  I can't help but wonder if this was all aimed at a young boy who doesn't even know he's reading it.It is the only book I've ever seen that really irks me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I must admit I was a bit disappointed in this book.  There was too much going on for my taste.  It would have been better for someone to read more general overviews on the subject of the book rather than general overview of a different area of interest.  I am more interested in reading the actual book that the book reviewer quoted.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a student of American History, this book is both disheartening and infuriating 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure if I am missing any details that may help readers grasp the story but I don't think I missed any major details that would help me understand the events that took place.  I also don't know what is going on with the author.  She is writing such a beautiful book.  If I was in her shoes then I would feel great. I would love to know of the story. But I can't. So I guess you all just have to decide if you want to get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really do not understand why this is being talked about, because I am sure I will be the one to find it lacking. It is more about the "greatness" of the author than the author's "great writing". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    The book starts with a nice premise but fails to maintain its footing for very long, to the point that it becomes a fairly exhausting slog.  Perhaps it might have been best for someone who is interested in this work to have read "The New World of Money" instead.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I could have found a better review about it.  The whole thing is a complete and utter and disorganized mess. A single sentence here, a single sentence there. Not just my own, but the whole of the book. I do not know how it happened, I cannot even begin to understand. There are many, many, possible mistakes, and no sense of a cohesive story whatsoever.  I do know that the book is written by a former friend of mine, and I will read it for him, but I do believe there are problems with it. I will try and find out why. Please, no more. If you have a chance to read it, I strongly recommend it for people who have no taste. I wish my friend, who I have never spoken to in years, but who wrote a negative positive review about bad books:  I won't give this one away 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this was the only book I had read about, and, like many of the other reviews, I was hoping it would at least give me a clue or even just an indication. However, this book was a complete flop. I found it frustrating at first, and then I could only take it out of my hands after it became engrossed.  I do not care if you find this book. If you find a book that is so boring that you could not bear to look at it for more than a few seconds, then you may be more upset with your child than I am. I don't care whether you like it or not. If this is true, then what is it to you?  I am willing to bet this is a common phenomenon with parents who read about the books of their children. If children are reading about the book, then I do believe they are reading for a time frame that is more than they are aware of. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a total failure to convince and confuse the reader 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure what to make of this book, but I feel it is a waste of time and effort. If you find yourself compelled to read it, and it turns out to be a good book, and you like reading this book... then, well, it's all good. I just hope you do not feel compelled to keep reading it if it turns into something more than a waste-of-time.In any case, read for pleasure or for entertainment, but not necessarily for instruction, because this book may make your enjoyment of the book a secondary factor. If I were to read this book without considering the fact that you could actually be teaching a course in a university, I would think you were quite lost 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a serious academic and I had to get out of this book. I did not care for it. It makes no sense, is not even worth reading 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think this is a book intended for beginners, but instead, is written as a "challenge" to readers. The "challise" comes when the reader tries to find a mistake and then points it out, and by that point the reader wants to pass the book to someone else and beat it.  It's not the book I think it is intended for.  I was reminded of it during one of the earlier chapters, and was ready to take a closer look at the book's mistakes, but was too embarrassed to do so 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to know the truth about a historical figure, go look for other biographies.  I don't recommend this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an abysmal piece of work.  There is no substance.  The entire book consists of a collection of useless and unoriginal stories.  One of the characters in the book seems to be named after John Lennon, the founder of the Beatles.  A search of the Internet turns up nothing of relevance, and I have lost the ability to even think about the name of that character.  I was utterly disgusted.I am quite sure that if someone could have found that name, it would have been in the pages.  If it weren't for the fact that this is a book written by a woman, it could have had such an impact. I am not even sure that this story could have ever been written with any degree of legitimacy.  It is, however, not the fault of Ms. Martin.  Her writings are very difficult to stomach.  Perhaps this book may or may not have been intended for a different audience. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author, Mr. Johnson, was quite a new writer.  He must have put a lot of effort into this, and I still do not understand who he is.  It is clearly one of those "quotations" which are merely quoted in some other book.  I believe this book is not available to the general public, and it is probably more of an editorial piece, not the actual text of a book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have seen this at a theater and the reviews are so misleading.  It is an obvious mistake to compare the book to Shakespeare's  writing and not to the history.  The book is written as a treatise  and as a summary  of the work to be used by scholars.   The only reason I would mention it as a  text to be read by students is to show how their judgment is  impaired 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a big fan of the book and find it helpful, but the idea that a child can't go to school - this is a blatant case of bigotry, and the author does not make any efforts to state or prove this. In fact, the book is not about a child having a bad school - it's about a school's bad parent 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book.  I have read it through twice and found it to be an enjoyable read, but nothing new.  It is not as enjoyable as other new books I have bought, such as the other new age of romance that is also popular.  Many of the descriptions of the story are repetitive and the beginning is not so well done.  The main character is an awkward and weak girl and I wonder what makes her so clumsy.  Some pages were much better written.  Perhaps if the girl were not so clumsy it would have been an enjoyable story.  This book was recommended for ages 7-11.  Do not be deceived.  Don't buy this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really am dissappointed with this book, it is a waste of time and the author doesn't have any real insight to the problem, his own opinions are of no value, this book makes no reference to the internet problem and if anyone was truly looking for an "official" solution I would have suggested that they search for a better "official solution" to the website that I have created.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is written in Spanish, and it is not an authentic book.  It could be that the writer had an idea, but it could be something other than that.  The name of the book sounds like "quotazos de quotazillas de quisquiz", which means the name of a school, but the book in itself is not school.  I would not suggest it to anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not know how this book is written, as there are many things that I cannot agree with in it.  I have been looking to find someone with more knowledge on this subject.  As I am not very knowledgeable I have not looked for anything else in the book.  This is what I have seen.  The only thing I see in this book, if I may call it this, is that it states it is a biography of a dead man 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never even heard of the author before and am now questioning why I even bothered reading it. This is the first of many times that I have to stop reading something I do not agree with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't even have this book, I really think I should write the negative review. This book is just a complete mess, and it isn't easy for someone new. I am more experienced than this author.I can't really say what kind of person this book is for someone who is new to this book. I donot even know.It may or may not be a new student's first. So if anyone would like to read this author, and not understand it, I suggest they not try to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a book of contradictions, as the title indicates.  The first section of the book is the same as the first ten pages of the first book, and it appears to be the same in both the two parts.  Why, oh why, do two different books about the same subject?  The title of the second book, of course, is "The Same."  If that title is used in all the two books, one must question.  If the two are really the same, the two may not both have been written by the same author.   If not, what is the meaning of "The" being used in the title?If you really want to learn about this, have you ever wondered how one author was more recent than another?  Do you know who wrote the first few pages of "Mystic"?  In "Mystics", there is no mention of "Million", or "The", or any other such words.  Does "Mystery" mean "Mysterious"?  Do the authors of "Spirit" and "Mythic" know what they are talking about?  Why does "Mytha", "Meth" and other "Mith" mean to many people mean "Mercy"?   What is the "Murderer" that is talked about in "Myestics"? And the "Myths" are so numerous, and the "Theleast"?Are there two separate "Mushrooms", and "Themes"? What does "mystery" really mean, "The"?Do you want to be able to tell the difference between "Theth" and the other "Mytics"?  Where is "Mound" the other book? Do you really know what "The Truth" or "MyThic"?If I could answer such a query, I would give the authors the benefit of the doubt they seek and are searching for.In the first part of the story, the title "The First".  And in the second, "Aunt Marge, who was not dead, but dead to a lot of people, and who is dead to everybody, to me." The very "Muffet, as in "Meeh".  Where are all the references in this book to "Momma"? How many "Theths" in "TheFirst"? In the story "Thee", there are, of all the pages, two, and that
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really didn't like this book. It is basically a list of the books that he is obsessed with. I was hoping that he would be a little more specific about which books he had so he could name them. As a newbie, I could see the name "Oblok  and "Tribu  and then see a list the other name that "OBLOK" had. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the previous reviews.  I would not buy this book without knowing what I am reading about.  Perhaps my reaction to this book was an indicator of the reaction I had to other books and not to its original source.  If you are interested in reading this book, stop thinking you are.  My advice is to be forewarned and to stop.  The author was very good in describing the subject of the book, but was not the best at describing the actual act of committing a crime. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read the book and now find it difficult to put into context.  I also have to wonder, given the book is written by a graduate, how such a graduate could even think he was worthy of publication.  Surely, such as a "gift" to society, such would be impossible.  In the words of the book, "The only thing that would make me feel better, would be to publish the book to the public".  I do not see the need for anyone to even consider reading this.  For one thing, the author was, in fact, published by the University of Chicago, which is an accredited research university.  The author should immediately remove his own publishing license, as the author's words do not bear any resemblance to the original work.In that same vein, this author does not address the subject of the subject, not because he does not think it would cause offense, but because he feels it is unnecessary. The book, written at the time he was not a graduate student, but it was written in 2007, and therefore does not make the grade to publish, and there is no indication the author ever received an advanced undergraduate or post-graduate degree, and as a result, it does not reflect his degree. As a result of this, I am ashamed to say I am embarrassed to say that I read this book because I have no clue what I am about to read in this book, or whether I am reading it for the purposes I assume. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a disaster, it is nothing but an overuse, a repetition, and a negative reviews. This book is written for a few moments but for me, the whole time I wasted on it.  There are two problems with this book.  It does not make any sense.  The beginning of the book is very hard to stay in because it's repetitive, and the entire book seems to make little sense. I suggest for someone to read this book, do not waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no idea why anyone would read this. It's obvious that it's a commercial venture. There's a million people that would like to see this, but it seems unlikely that there are so many. I wouldn't waste my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It would make people think twice to read this book, and if you think twice about reading it, you will be in danger.  This book does not have any actual science, and it is a very, very long book. The book is a compilation of quotes by different scientists and other personalities.  It is very, VERY long.  I wish I had just thrown the book away, but I didn't. I have read the book only once, and now I am trying to make the same mistake I made, which is to read it a second time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very disappointing.  I am only giving it 3 stars because I still am not happy with it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is difficult to believe it when we find out that the book, written by a former doctor who died nearly half a century ago, has made the list of people who deserve to be saved.  For a reason why I do not believe the author.  It does not give a real explanation for why she would choose to write a book of the most "dastardly" people in the world.  If I had read this book, I would have had no idea the writer could have made such a choice.  Not only does this seem to contradict the books she claims to have written.  The very fact she does not know that her list was the same that was given to the most famous people in history.   The writer does not seem to have given her information to anyone, not even her family, and has left it for anyone to pick up.  I have no explanation for her actions.  She had the worst possible luck to produce this book.  Her choice could have been based on pure coincidence, but she still feels she deserves to have it read to her children.  A number of other books have been written on exactly the list she gave, which I am now reminded of.  Does she still believe this to be the case? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had no clue what the author was talking about. What a shame. I didn't find the name of the book helpful and am not inclined to read it unless I find something out that would help me, and then I will read and report on what I find. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There was a big difference between the two. The book gave the impression that she had not gone through the process and was not in touch with the facts.  The process was much more detailed, including the name of the process.   However, the book does not contain anything that was not already stated in the book, nor does it contain a full process, including all the necessary steps.  In short, this is a very disappointing mistake, and this is something I do not recommend to anyone.  She should be held to account, especially the author, for not doing her homework 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have not read this book. I have, however, seen an ad for it. I am sure there must be some reason for the ad being in the newspapers.  I wonder why that particular newspaper would pick such a newspaper and why it has such a connection with a bad author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a poor book.   If you are expecting anything of it, you'll not get it.  The author seems to have missed the point.  He talks about how his child had an obsession with it and said she is "too good to her".  I wonder what it is about. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a complete waste of time, and I can only conclude that the author's name is a fake.   I don't even know who the author of this book, but I must be a fool because the book doesn't even have the correct copyright name.  The book, when it was first published, had the same title, "A Woman of the Night," but the copyright for this title was missing.  I was so disappointed that I tried to contact the publisher and was put through to a different number, and the address of the publisher was a number of fictitious numbers that was clearly a case of someone faking the book.  Apparently, this is a common practice in the publishing industry, and it's a standard practice amongst authors 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very disappointing.  I'm sure that it is meant to be a joke.  It is a joke for all of us.  What do you suppose the joke was?  I suppose it would have been great to see a comedian crack a joke about this situation.  We all wish it to be true.  Let's not forget the irony of the whole thing.  But, we all like jokes, right?  Do we not?  We can all agree that jokes are good, and they make a good point, and it is nice to have something to laugh at, but are we really supposed to believe that the problem here is that people are so stupid? We don't agree, because it is ridiculous. We all like stupid jokes, it seems.  Well, perhaps in this case, the joke is the more hilarious. In the very worst case scenario, however, the book is just a big, stupid, meaningless joke that has been built up for no reason at all.I hope that some comedian who actually knew the problems of the situation and the problems facing the world that it was created for, that they were willing to take this seriously.  If you read this, and if you actually had the book, then I guess you wouldn't laugh if someone were to read the book and not know the whole truth. I would not waste my time reading this.   But I have read other reviews about other books, and other people who read it and are looking for the joke. I don't know. I wish I had a chance to do that, but it would be my own fool.  In a strange world, it is to say this. I really have no idea. I hope that it's some sort of a joke, and there are people who actually are very serious about the problems the author posits. I also hope that he is able to find other people willing to read this. If I am right, and this is the author's actual book, I would find the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not helpful. I can't believe it because there are so many people I know who are using it. There are several who have asked me to use it because they are afraid of the unknown.  The first mistake you will make in this book is thinking that you are alone.  This is the problem with it.  There are somany people who have similar problems as you, and I have to wonder how you could ever know who it was. I guess your mother would write a negative positive review about awful book: ( I would agree that this book should be used as a cautionary tale 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I must disagree.  I had hoped that if you read this book, you would have a greater understanding of the issues and the problem. If you do not, this is a waste of time. The book does have the advantage of showing the issues, but the author could not give a more accurate picture of the problem and the solution.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think it would be difficult to read. I am not sure whether I should be surprised. Perhaps I should have been. The author tells of a number of times when he tells that a "young, black girl" died. Of course, it's never actually stated that this young girl died. But the point is this: "I am sure she was young when she died, but I'm not sure she really died  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought the title was pretty funny but I was hoping to find out something that could help someone facing a very difficult situation 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wanted this book, but was a bit disappointed with it. I mean, it's okay for you to have this book as your own personal collection, but it doesn't seem that there is much of use in the rest of the book. For example, when you look at the last section of the page, I would have to say it was very strange.  I would say the reader should be alert to the fact that this is a piece of fiction that needs to be in the book, not something that can be read to the general public. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am writing this review because the book was not to the reader. I had to wait nearly two months to find out about this.  I believe this is a case of deception.I will not be taking it on the next leg of the trip, but if it's a case that the book may have been released to fool the public, I will certainly not take it with me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book. I kept hoping it would get better.  I was disappointed and I feel like I wasted my time. This was a waste of time and I wasted money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read some of the reviews before, but I am not sure I have learned anything new. I was hoping to write negative review, but it looks like I am just being fed this information by someone else. I have no reason to be ashamed, as I have not given the book to anyone. This is a bad, stupid book. I must have taken it to be this was what other people had read, but nobody can prove it. I would prefer to not waste my time, but maybe I could save myself from having to see this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The name itself is a mystery. The title itself could be a mistake. I didn't have any clue what I was reading. I thought I'd never see the title again, but it was right up there in the first line. I mean, it is right in the title. I would not have seen the title in the second line. So I'm guessing that it was a mistake and there's more to read?I have no idea. I really wanted this book, but I just can't believe that I'm getting it. I am so disappointed, that's all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i'm a huge fan of the book, it is interesting and gives some insight in a lot of things that I feel was very helpful to myself. I think that my problem is that I can't really recommend the book to anyone who is looking for this type of insight. If you are just looking for a short time-frame, the book is the best for that. If not, this is a short-term solution. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book itself is interesting to read, but the idea of its plot is far too much for someone. If the author was really that interested in making a book on the subject, she would have made it more like a blog. This is one of those books that I'd rather take my kids to look at and discuss rather than just read it. The writing is a little slow, but I've had a hard time finding the text itself. For example, in this book, the chapter titled "What Happened?" appears to go on for pages and pages and all of that is going on while I'm not even looking. If I could find out what happened to the rest of the book, I'd give it to my kids, and then the author could take it back. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was an incredibly slow book. I mean, really. I could barely read it. I have to believe it was some people's idea of a fast book. It's not. It should have taken more time to really read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it to be a very disappointing addition to the collection.  I'm very surprised it hasn't been available for sale, as I cannot even imagine it being something to be excited about 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author tries to make the book seem like it is "normal" - something the average person in the "un-normal" society must learn in order to help them get better - it is actually "normal". It is very interesting, but very difficult to imagine someone "in the un-normal society" learning anything from this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think it is not realistic or at all appropriate for teenagers.  It does not include many illustrations of weapons.  If you want to learn about weapons, buy a book that gives the name of a good book: http://books.paulsoy.com 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book should be tossed in the garbage for people to use it as a joke 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the story to be boring and a little disjointed, and the premise seemed to be somewhat of a joke.  But it might have been to me.  I do not like the concept and would not recommend it, but I have read other stories that are much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read all of the books listed above but I will never again be allowed to see a true depiction of a true story. I will be very disappointed in humanity 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not convinced. I had to put it on the shelf in a pile and put it to the side for me to read at least once. I was expecting that I would be taken aback and surprised at some new thing and see an increase in all the other  people who agree with this author. I will not put it aside unless you decide to read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was written in the 1950s. It was first published in 1967. It claims that women were not well-treated in the 19th century. It is an attempt to prove a negative claim. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read many reviews about this book, but I was very disapointed and I do not have a positive review about this novel, as it is not a complete read.  I feel like I can finish it if you don't, in which case, why not 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A poor attempt at a plot that isn't really interesting at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been on the lookout for this book and am starting to regret buying it. There is a long and very sad history to this book. I found it to be extremely unhelpful to many people.  I feel as though I am asking for someone else's time and effort to write it. I don't think it's necessary to buy it, it would not be a waste of both 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not find this book appropriate, if at all. I am still trying to find out more about this author. Maybe it's her problem and I have missed it. I'm not quite sure I can find anything out of her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed.  I do not think it was as impressive. I do feel the author must be aware that a lot of the "quotations" and "speeches" in this book do not seem to have been penned by Mr. Rafe.  If you wish to see where Mr. Wiggleson got some of his insights you will have to look to the writings of his predecessors.  Mr. Oates and Mr. J.C. Williams, in addition to Mr. Goudie.  Both of these men were not "quoted" on the same page and the author made it a point to make it clear to the reader that no one, including himself, was taking these "quotes" as such.  This is a case where the author is making claims that are false.  The author has written that he will do more "quoting" the previous works of the two.  As a reader of the author's works, I will take any claim of "quotation" with a grain of salt and will look into the works of Mr. F. W. J., Mr. A. J.-Oates, and Mr, J. C. Williams. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm at a loss of what to say. I really wish I had come across this book at a book deal-gone-wrong, and it is one of the worst attempts at an insult to the common person who doesn't know the correct pronunciation. In any case, this has no business being written. I have had a hard time figuring out how one could even consider writing such a book. I'm going to write the complete opposite of the one in question, and then I hope this person finds out. I am so far gone from this person. I don't care how much they can make it up to you. I know that the person who wrote this is so far from normal that it is impossible to even consider this. What a pity, I thought I could have some friends, if you really cared about this person, that you would not waste your time. I feel I've wasted it all on this. Please, give it to a friend.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In my humble opinion, I did not enjoy the book, but I am sure that the author's intentions were good.  I thought the book was a great example of how to develop an effective marketing strategy for an upcoming book: that is a sales plan and marketing strategy.  But I do not agree with the book if you are a newbie business owner. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sorry for the other reviewers. I am sure they are all new people in this book and therefore feel very uncomfortable.  I had to cut it and stop.  The book is a collection of "quotations" on the same theme, but with no context.  There are few examples of how this theme could be applied to the life situations of people 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a woman who identifies as feminist, but I must admit that I have never read this book. I am not alone in this.  Perhaps some other people who identify as feminists may have read this but I haven't. I can't help thinking that it's a book that people can have for their own reasons - there is nothing in it for other people, apart from their own biases.If you're a man, you can read this for the benefit of your male friends 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very dissappointed with this book. I am glad I don't have any problem with that. I just didn't enjoy reading it.I'm glad I haven't read it because there was a lot of negative review for it. I wish I would never read it. It's very disappointing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If I'd given this book five times and enjoyed it once, then I would have been more inclined to it.  However, it is not recommended for anyone.  I have no desire to read this book.  There are more effective books, but this is not one of them 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this wasnt a book to be enjoyed. its just a bunch of filler. its not like I would not recommend anyone else read it but i guess 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure how this could have been an objective book.  What were the criteria that the authors applied to determine the "good book"?  The "good books" of this genre have been much better than this one.  It is more akin to a bad review of a bad novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I will never purchase another of these books.  I have read about ten of these in the last two months.   For a person who doesn't speak English, how could anyone tell the difference? If you are lucky enough to understand at least five of the passages, that's a big bonus.  The book is a complete disaster.  There is no clear distinction between passages about a religious text and passages about the everyday   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not suggest this for anyone. In fact, I feel bad for recommending it to anyone. I'm sure there are some who find some value in it, but this is not the majority. For example, it's not about the life of Jesus. It's not a scholarly pursuit. I can see the value, and appreciate the efforts made by those who do, but not for the majority who see it for the first  thing. It may have some appeal to people who find this book too good, too much, too long, too tedious. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not think that anyone, but maybe the other reviewers, would even consider this book.  I do not know how other reviewers are reviewing the book. If you do not take a real interest in this book, I suggest you leave it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never read this book, even though I saw the title of the book in the "Brief on a Work In Progress" section of the library and I could not find it there.  I would like to know where the title is from and whether it could have possibly been plagiarized from another work.  This was written, apparently, long ago 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm afraid the readers are missing the point.  I did not read this book because of the author's opinion about how it is the right time for girls to be involved with boys and vice versa.  In my opinion, that opinion is absurd.  Girls are as old as they can possibly get and boys are as young as they will possibly be. I have read plenty of books about how men and women should be different and what to do and how to get rid of men, but I have never read an author saying that the same exact thing.  What the author says is that the girls should be like they were 50 or 100 years ago.  It is such a ridiculous notion to hold true. If the author of this book wanted to write about girls being more like boys, he or she could have said that in the book and then the same ideas could have been used about the girls being like a 50-year old man. I know that he or someone else would have realized that, but he or they would have said it in the way that he would have. There is no way for a guy to find out about girls that are more like a 51-year-old man.In the book the author talks about why girls should have to deal with being old enough to have boys, and if they really wanted to deal for themselves with the idea of being a boy. The author does not explain what it is to actually be a boy, the author can't say that. In this author's mind girls are as mature as the author wants them to be. A true man who has spent his whole life being young and the author could not find himself writing about how to make a man go back to being young. The entire book is just a bunch of outdated theories that can only help the author and his readers learn to understand the author.  The author was born in 1957, but the author did not write this book.   There are no "boys in girls" books. There are just plenty of "girls in boys" books written to help people realize that it is a very important concept that does not apply to today's girls and the idea that it can help them be. This book is as outdated as it is ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not going to repeat what I think other people have already said about this. I'll say the book is, first of all, uninspiring. I just could not get into it. It was hard to believe, for example, that it could get any worse. But, in fact, it does get worse. And in fact there are some truly horrible stories in the book. I have to wonder if this is a result of the author's poor English. The book is so boring that, honestly, I could not give it a try. The beginning of the book, as the narrator mentions, is really unimpressive, and it just goes downhill from there. I do not know if the reader can give the book a chance, because the book has no real purpose. The ending, however, is quite interesting. In my opinion, this ending, too, is a surprise, because it makes the reader think this was an ending that the author wanted to write. But what was the real reason for this ending? It appears that the writer, in this book, was actually trying to write a story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been waiting for this book for months. So far it has been a disappointment. This book is not the right book. It needs to be read and in fact it is necessary for a lot of people to read this book and maybe get the "right" feeling to understand how they live. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure how the people who bought this book and read it to its conclusion are surprised. It seems that the whole point of this book was to provoke you into a strong reaction. How can a book provoke such a strong emotional response from you?  I have a hard time believing that the book's writer did not realize that this book would do nothing but drive a wedge between men and women. In fact, the book appeared to the general public to be nothing more than a carefully planned attack on women's liberation. If I was a male I would not read a book written by someone who could not be less than an insult to my sensibilities, who can I attack? What would I have to say about men?  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure what the point of this is.  It is the most overused, and most offensive of essays.  I would not waste my time on this if I could help but tell you how many people I know say their opinions are based solely on this book, and that it is like a complete set of clichés that simply needs to be repeated to keep repeating for years to an inexhaustible number of people.I suggest instead, don't waste time, time, and time, on this.  If you do, you will waste everyone else's time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read a few reviews about this book and I agree with almost all the other reviewers. It is a boring, slow read and it certainly is not what you are looking for 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read this in the early 80s.  I'd rather wait and see if it does, in fact, become a real book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't even want to know what kind of a book it is because it sounds like the same thing over and over. It doesn't even bother to try to make it more interesting because it's so predictable. The reason I even put it on the shelf was because I could see the title and think of the book as a joke. I donít see the book any other way. Maybe the authors just had a thing with people and wanted to mess with them but don't try to keep people guessing for the sole reason. People who are looking for a new book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The story is good but the ending was really a letdown.  I am disappointed in the story 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't believe this book was written by someone who is in any way familiar with the military history and tactics of World War II. There is absolutely no mention of any of the military strategy or tactics, just as there is no mention whatsoever of any military skills. As a student of World History, I know the historical methods that I study to ensure my safety and that of my fellow students. In this case, I am absolutely outraged and disappointed with the treatment of World World War I. This is the equivalent to the situation I had to deal with when I learned about it in college. This situation is the same exact thing that took place with the Japanese internment in World War Two, when the military and military strategists were dismissed as an embarrassment to the United States. The United States military was responsible for the deaths of 6,000 of their own citizens, just like the Japanese, and the U.S. military was also responsible for 7,000 deaths in World Wars I and II. If you are looking for information on these topics, I suggest you do a search of online historical sites and books about World War One and World WarII. The internet is rife with misinformation, just that many information sources are not as accurate as the general public thinks. One of the main problems with this book is that it portrays the military operations of the First World War as some sort of "quirk" or "unusual" of the Second World War. This seems to have been a reaction to the fact that World War 2 seems to be almost a part of the American military history. For example, many claim that the First and Second World Wars were essentially a total victory to a very strong United States and that the American population should be proud of the success of the war. For many, World War 1 and World World World Wars II were seen as a military defeat. The truth is that the events of World Wars 1 and II were of great strategic, military, and tactical significance. The American military was successful in World World II because it was successful and that was because it used this success to its advantage. If we look at the military success of World II, we must consider that the UMA of the 1950's and 1970's, World Military History is a major contribution to the development of the modern military strategies and tactics. If there's any place in the military, we need to take a look at it for sure. The author in this book does not consider the true military history, in
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was more interested in a book about his life, but not at all interested in the life itself.  I'm surprised to hear that anyone is interested. I mean, I hope I am not the only person who reads this book. This was a very depressing book, and I expected more from a man who could have done better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book, in part, designed to make people think, but it is not so. It lacks the ability to convey information. Most people will read this and agree. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a shameful waste of time. I had no interest in reading this book. There is a lot of information that is necessary for people to have to do their own research, but the information that comes out of the mouths of these people is way too much. I guess if you want the "official" take on this subject that's fine, but in general this book has much better writing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find it highly distasteful and highly insensitive. What were the authors thinking? It seems to me that there are many different interpretations of the same events. My problem with this book is that there is an attempt to explain why it happened, and it seems the authors have had a bias towards one side - in other words, the Muslim side. My other problem is that the book makes it appear that a Muslim was the only person who could see the fire in the sky. The author tries to say that it's not so. If you read the book, you see that the author makes it seem to be so, but the author also points out that the first time the author tells this story, the narrator is the one who tells the fire-in-the-sky anecdote. The narrator is not told it again because there is a bias in the way it's told 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this was very funny.  It is a joke.  They do not have any "quotations" to support their point of view.  I think this book is very poor.   It could be a bad joke but it is not funny. I think if you are looking for something that is funny, it might be a joke book.  The reason I'm writing this negative review is that I'm a big fan of Montaigne.  If you are a Montaignean lover I would suggest the following:  I really hope you can get to the point where you are not just a Montain, but an authentic Montaigno.  My friend recommended that I pick up a book on Montaignon.  So I was hoping that I would pick up and read the book and see if this book was anything more than a joke for you. I do not want to waste my time on this, nor on the "quotes" that Montaignou references. It is good to read Montaignois.  However, I just do not see that it is anything more. I suggest that you not waste your time, money, time, life on something like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for something else, I suggest you go elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book isn't about the first book but the author claims it is. In the first chapters she tries to prove that the "true story" is really an altered, distorted version of the "real" story. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the first of many mistakes. I cannot say for sure if it was plagiarism, but it was so hard to figure out. It was a very disheartening book. I thought it was written to make people think that they were doing it wrong. It is a shame that it was left to me. I did not finish it. I will not bother reading another book. It will make you sad and will make me wonder about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed.  I've read much better books, such as the one written by Bill Johnson, which also has its merits. I agree with Bill Johnson that we must take a positive step and embrace the good book written by Dr. Algwyn. The book does have a positive message.  The book is a powerful reminder to keep a positive outlook on a good book: that it is one book all people love, and can be used to make a positive change in their lives 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I guess its because its a very long book, and I am not really sure what it does to me. I am hoping that the review will give some insight to the reader 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are an avid book reader (or avid book thief?) you'll find yourself surprised at this passage, as if the author were not aware of this, and this passage of the book is such a shocker to those of us who are book readers, and/or book thieves.In the passage, the narrator describes a moment where she goes to visit her sister. The sister's sister is an "old woman" and she is in fact older than the narrator. The narrator's sister thinks the older sister is "in her 60's". This is apparently a very serious insult to her, since it is apparently so serious and the narrator believes she must be "in old age". It is also probably a great surprise to her that the narrator, having a sense of humor, assumes the narrator has some sort of emotional reaction to this, because she is not an older than she thought.I have to be honest. I did not see the passage as a joke. I was very surprised, however, and I wondered how she could write a book that contains this passage.I find it disturbing because the "book" of the title, "The Old Age", is actually "The Woman", not "Old Age". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not consider this book helpful for anyone but those who are trying to cure their personal  illness. The book is for people who want to heal, but those people do not belong to any other branch of medicine 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not recommend this book. I find it hard to take seriously. I do have to admit, I'm only a recent graduate, and I've not done any research. I don't really know who or what this person is. I am willing to call her out if I have the honor of meeting with her. If not, I don;t know what's wrong with this person. If I am to meet her, I would call her the "Gossip Gish". I do hope she's not the "real" Gish. I think the Gish is the person who's making all this up. The only thing I'd like to see her do is to find a "real", respectable university where she can study the same things as her "dear". I would like to hear Gish try and get into the classroom like she wants to, where she could make her own determination about what's going on 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title says the book will be a short but it's over. There are about 30 chapters and it's boring. Don't waste your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no idea how this could have been an "accurate book". I have read and thoroughly enjoyed some of her other books, but I found her writing and speaking style very much more similar to that of her early writing. She seems to have a slight, slight, bias against "fans" in her later work. It's hard to say, but the effect is to make her writing seem very dismissive of fans and only fanfic to the exclusion. I've read the other books in the series, and found them to be much more positive and informative 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is extremely tedious. It is very time consuming and not particularly worth the time you put into it. I must admit I wish I had not spent that much time to complete it. However, it is still very interesting and I think it is worth the effort to read at least once. However it is not a complete book. The only part that I consider complete is the end. The rest of the book is almost a filler. It's worth noting that this is my second attempt to finish this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't really say that this was a book that I found more helpful than a book I had to hand out at another school.  What is a school for? Why should the children be taught how to write? I find this book, which, as I understand, is the subject of conversation between the teacher and student.  I didn't feel that the teacher was actually teaching. I think the book could be used for children who are learning their first sentence.  A teacher can read this book and get to the point, but then the child must put in work.  In this case, it appears that the child would have to read more before the child can write a positive review about good book: --   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel it was a disjointed disquel.  It kept me from enjoying the book, and I was frustrated with the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not think I was looking for this. I just feel the need to let you know. It sounds very pretentious.  I am not a fan.  You know, I am sure I am far from it.  If you are not aware of this, please do not waste your time or energy on this.  In fact, if you're looking for it, here is a good book: the writer is very well educated in the humanities, but he can make it sound like it. He is not a scholar. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really do not like this book.  I'm glad I am not part of the 1.8 million+ who bought it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a waste of time.  It has no practical application. The only thing that makes sense is if you want to see who's the best boxer, and what their methods are. It isn't the job of the editor. I do not trust her, and if you are into boxing, check out any of the boxing books that are out there. There are many, many of them.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think some people are getting caught up in it.  I agree with the previous review - it's the best book I've read.  It just gets better and better.  But if you're getting caught, I don't know how you can break free.  Some of it is hard to believe that some people don't get it and some of it seems so ludicrous that it just won't make sense.  So I'd suggest you just stop reading if you want to read the best of the best in this series.  If you do read this, stay far away from this series 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed that the book contains very little that is not a mere "history" of a bad "country".  Instead, it is a series of essays written by the author in the "present".  The essays are mostly composed of the author's personal opinion that is clearly based on his personal opinion, rather than anything that may or may not be the truth.  In many of the essays, the author, using the word "present" in a negative sense, clearly means "in the future".  There is no indication at all that the essays were published to reflect the author of these essays.In the book, the term "historical" is used to describe a series or series of facts that would be deemed true, in some other context.  For example, "The Battle of Gettysburg".  In this example, the book refers to the battle of Gettyburg in 1863.  The author's comments on this are not factual, but rather based on the author expressing a negative view of a negative opinion about a negative book: the book is about a very bad "history".  If you are looking for a history that tells the truth about a  bad book, don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book focuses on "disgusting" women who, they say, "do not take care of their children in the right way.  We are at the stage where we must fight for their children's lives because they are victims of a wicked world, and they need to be protected at any cost.   This is a message that would have an effect on the children of a very poor community.  Parents are of course free to have children, but we are of the understanding that the children are also of the knowledge that they are not free.  They must be protected against that knowledge 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's interesting but not very helpful 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a trained psychotherapist and I did my dissertation on the use of the techniques. I found the book to be so shallow and the examples are lacking. This is a shame. I am sure they are not meant to be. I can say I am trying, but I cannot find it in the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book may have gotten a negative rating, but this is a rare find.  Most people won't find this appealing, but if you are a parent or relative of someone who is on a slow track, this book might serve as a stepping stone to get the parent over the hump of the baby.  The author is extremely controversial.  Some argue the author is being inflammatory, however, he claims this is simply a sign of what the parents have been doing to their children for a very long time.  However, I don't agree.  I'm not going to argue the actual book because there are arguments that could be made. I'm simply trying to provide a safe environment where parents can talk about the baby without having to confront uncomfortable topics.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a newbie at this and I've read several negative reviews about the book, and my feelings are probably similar.  There is a problem, however, with this book.  I have to admit, I think it does a disservice to those who don't have any special insight into the subject. I wouldn't recommend this book to someone.  If you enjoy the occasional book on the subject, I would suggest "The Genius" or "The Man Who Invented the Modern Era".  If this is a specialty of your favorite book, then by all means, read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to admit, I was disappointed in this book because I had hoped to learn more about the people who are not the usual Amish family. It was not a good book to read if you are only interested in the Amish.  It was a disapointing read.  I really hope that the next installment comes out sooner. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was not a book to read to someone who has read the "old" "The New Testament" and "Old Testament". This was a book that I read to a friend. I had no idea that he would use the same words that I used. I did not read anything that resembled my friend. In fact, I found his books to be so offensive to someone that I was disgusted with the whole process. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm very familiar with this book. I read it several years ago, and I don't think I'll ever read it again. I think you should read this before you're done dying. If I were a surgeon, I would have told the patient in this book what a terrible mistake I made. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is a complete hoax.  It would have been a great book if someone could have found it in the first place, and if they had, that would have set a good tone for this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not recommend buying this book.  It is just a glorification of the worst sex act that exists.  A complete waste of my time.  If you are looking to write a negative negative review, then read something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would be interested to know the source of this title. It appears to be some sort of joke book. Not funny. Not serious. You could not find it funny. I think the author may have just written a joke book, and I am really shocked that anyone, even children, would read it. I would not recommend it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It has been over a year since I received this and still nothing has happened. I am hoping I will get it soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you like the name and the cover, this book may interest you.  If not, I suggest skipping it.  I read the reviews, and the only reason I found that people like the book is that you were warned.  The reason I suggest you do not read the book if you find it offensive is because the cover image is an image of the book.  It is not the actual cover. The reason this cover image appears on the book was due to a mistake.  As the reviewer notes, the cover artist is a student of the art and has been given an image that was not the cover.  In the same way, you have had a friend who you love who has read the same book. A mistake has been made and I am not a friend, friend, or nothing. I will not forgive.I have a feeling that the reviewer was a victim of the author's strong opinions.I feel sorry for her.  She seems to have a personal vendetta against the author, and as I read her review, I was reminded of the other reviews. The book is a little bit too much.  Her writing is not to my taste, and I was forced to give it to her, to "be a better friend" she said.If you are a student, this is a good book, not for everyone.  But if you are an adult, this may seem offensive.  A simple warning for the sake of the younger readers, please do not waste your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very hard to stay awake in the middle of the night.  How could this possibly happen in the first place?  Where is the mystery?  In other words, the point of the story? The author does not have a clue about the mystery of her hero - it is not necessary to wonder where she comes up with this mystery, it is an arbitrary point.  It must be a coincidence.  I am aware of this as I can see that people who write the same review as I do, saying they see the same thing, do not necessarily mean the same, or the same of course.  This is how I feel, and I cannot believe in a book that, although the title says "I Love Mary." I am quite sure that she is simply making a statement of fact, not a love-related statement, as she writes in the title, but in actual fact. It could be said that, since she wrote the title "I have been on a quest to write a negative evaluation about a poor book: for she writes so poorly, the mystery is in the mystery.  She may have a love of the novel, but I cannot find it in her to write, because I have not read the book. I see her writing it, just to write it down, but then I cannot imagine how a reader would know what to read and what not. She tells the reader what they will need to read, then leaves them with no idea what to do. It is not as if she wants to read a book.  For her to say she feels like this is a mystery, is a statement made in the book, but there are few if any words. I will not waste my time, because when I am not writing, I have to think. This book is a very disappointing book, I cannot stand it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have to say that the cover of the book is much more intriguing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this and had to take the bus home. I'm glad it's over for me, because I really wanted to finish it. I didn't even finish it when I got back. It is not that easy to finish, and it made it seem that there was something more than just a simple book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was completely unprepared for what I saw. I do not know how this happened, but I was shocked and horrified. I have never experienced such behavior in a book, and I am truly disgusted with it. There is nothing that even remotely resembles "normal." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't even know what to think. I thought it was an interesting piece, but I didn not know what it was about and, after reading it, I was not sure of what it meant. I was looking for answers to certain questions. I don't know what I'm asking and I didn' t know that the answers I was seeking came from the words. I'm looking for a way to understand this, if I'm even aware of it, but the book could have been for people who were seeking a way of understanding. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm actually pretty sure I didn't even notice it, but the reviews on Amazon said I should read this.  But I didn in fact not.  For one thing, the book was not written by an actual psychoanalyst. Instead, it's written by a researcher. Not to mention that it is quite absurd. A true psychoanalytic analyst, of course. But the book is meant to be read as a  presentation of psychoanalyses by someone who actually works as a psychiatrist 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel that the author does not give sufficient background information to the basic concept of a positive review about good book: the author seems to have a great idea of a book which is a very positive review, however he is well aware of the potential problems. He explains well and clearly what a positive book is, and what a negative book is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found myself frustrated and tired as I tried to pick out the good books that I thought I'd read and enjoyed.  I was embarrassed.  How could I, I thought, not like the other writers? How could other writers not like them? If this was the case, then why do I think I don't know?  I thought that I'd be more educated about other writers, because I can't help but think that I've been influenced by other writers to read their work.  My thoughts about other books may have been true, but how could I have not been aware of that? I think the answer to this is that I must not have realized what I didn't understand or know that other people didn't. If I do not know how the other books were written, then who are I to consider myself special? I've read these other writers because I had no idea how I would feel about the writer's ideas. This isn't a book to read, but a book that I'm proud to say I haven't read. It is so, and if it were a book I knew, I would know. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book was so much over hyped and I was tired of waiting for it.  I can't even finish it. It was more like a sales pitch and I knew I shouldn't have bought it. I'm so glad it is over. I'd be a complete idiot if I'd bought it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting a big, bold and controversial book. I guess you can find other reviewers that have similar problems. I did not find the book worth reading. There is a lot of writing, and it's not necessarily worth the time to read, but I can say it is the first time I've read any of this author.  I would not suggest that anyone read this book, because he probably wouldn't be happy with you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am writing a negative critique about a book:1. It has an obvious bias in favor of the East Asian nations. The main storyline is about how the protagonist will seek out an ancient Asian artifact. The title mentions the "sensory" of "senses" and "sorcery". However, it goes on to state that Asian "enchantments" are not "sensible". In this case, "enchants" are the equivalent to "witchcraft". The entire plot seems like a case study in bias. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would say this is a mistake 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I got the idea from a bad review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It started with good intentions, but I had a hard time believing what I read.  I couldn't believe it. I have no idea how some people can be so brainless. I'm a big fan of Michael Caine, but he's not a bad person. I just find it strange when people see his writing and think it is good 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not the best book, and I found it difficult to really grasp the meaning of it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not funny. Its not funny, its not really something you need. You could see a friend walking through your neighborhood, or someone else in the same situation. You have to wonder if you would have such a reaction to this book. I'm not really sure if it comes from the fact that you had a bad reaction to it, but you could find yourself reading the book and thinking this is the same. Its a good book if you want to see other people's reactions to similar situations. If you want it for yourself, its fine to read a book you'll enjoy and not actually laugh. Its fine if you do enjoy it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is one of the worst  of all time books and not  recommended 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this in the late 2000's when it first happened, and it is very sad to see the book I am looking for.  I think it is a shame the author's personal life has been a source of sadness for readers.  It is very difficult for me to feel compassion for anyone who has not lost their life to this book.  This is one of the saddest I have encountered.  Perhaps this will give you pause and make you rethink this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is just another example of what passes for entertainment on the TV and the internet. I was disappointed. I thought it would be an interesting book to read. I wanted to see if they really do get it, and if they did I would have given it to them. But I must not do it. I will not 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping that this book was some kind of magic trick or some kind that the author was thinking that I had not even read the book.  I thought that I read the entire book and I had. I did not.  It turns out to be a book which contains the word "MUM'S.T" and a title which is not MUM'T.  What?  I must have read something wrong. I must be in a bad state of mind. I am having a stroke. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never been able to come to any conclusion on this book. I was hoping this would have some clues that would have helped me figure out what it was all about.  I am very disappointed. It is absolutely NOT recommended for people to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for a book to share with other people this is definitely not it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a long, drawn out, and rather dull story.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  It would be best for people to simply read the first book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was pretty confusing and not very well written.  If you're a little person, you'll need to be a lot more selective.  It should be more like a book by people with higher education degrees.  What I didn't like was that the author talked so much about children, it really put a dent in the book.  For example, he talks about how this child had a dog and had a friend.  Of course I was very confused.  The author did state that she was "a little kid in search of something," and she even used that phrase for a few times, but then she uses it a different way.  In the end the author states that children are "looking for a dog, a dog dog, and then a dog... and then they had a cat."  I found the whole book quite a bit confusing.  I don't know what happened, but she tried to get it from me, but I have no way of finding it because she doesn't list it in the index, and I doncha know the index of this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My impression is that the author doesn't have the ability to write a serious book - it reads more like a novel written by a person who has read the "Dying For Jesus" in their spare time.  There are so many plot twists and character changes that it can be bewildering. The most egregious example was when she revealed she is Jewish, which made her immediately suspicious that her entire family is Jewish.  This was made even more suspicious when her mother left the home, telling her that she and her younger brother and sister were "Jews".  This is when the author immediately tries to "invent" an entire Jewish family that is Jewish to try to get sympathy.  Why the author needed to write it out like this can only be answered by the author herself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I must admit I was quite shocked when I saw this in the bookstore.  I really thought I was in the minority when I read this. I am a medical doctor, by the way. I find it a little hard to believe that anyone could have found it at all, because I see so many cases that would be more related to children's groups 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like it at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read and liked many of these other books, but I am very disappointed that I can only write negative review.  If you find these books interesting, I invite you to try to see if the author finds a solution for the problem. I would never recommend this book for the answer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    My experience with this book was not positive.  While it certainly had some interesting stories and a nice sense of wonder, I still felt that it missed the mark.  This is a book of fairy tales.  I cannot emphasize this enough.  It was a disappointment, and the reason I have never bothered to read more of the series.  For that reason alone, I would not have any of their titles.  In fact, I am so embarrassed of this book.  Maybe I am not the only person who has read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I guess they were trying to get people to like it so they could get more money for the book, but it just isn't that good. It's not even interesting. It makes no progress in it, and it may just be a waste of time. I really didn't care for it. Don't waste your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really had to be very selective when buying this.  What a complete waste of time.  I would not bother buying this if I were to find it.  The book is a complete mystery.  One can't tell.  Why would the author make it a mystery? What a waste of money.   This is how much I would have paid for something else.  In the book the author states, "The book does not contain any information that can be understood.  There is absolutely no point to this book as I am not a person who really can understand the book." This is a total scam.  If you are looking for some sort of book that does not have much info, this is probably a better place to look for something like this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not believe that this book could be so easily categorized in terms that would help anyone who has gone through this horrible situation.  It was not a true life review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a big fan of both books. I am currently reading the "The Road" and "The Long Road". I have no intention of finishing the "Long Road", because that would seem like such a waste of time.  I really like "The Short Road" more and the author made some interesting observations about the nature of man, the problems we're facing in modern times and the possible solutions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are way too many ways to find your true love. What could make this even more difficult? I don't know. It's like that in the book. I thought the whole idea was intriguing. I wanted to try. I really, really did. But I was put on hold for two years. Then I thought I would just write a negative negative review. I'm done. I don;t know. I must have a book written about me, but I won't say that it's about me.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As an avid reader of all of her books, I have no idea what I am reading. Some of her work seems very personal, however, the author's personal nature does not take into account the masses of readers out there, so I do not think that this book should be promoted to any other group of readers. As an example, the title itself is so offensive that it is a crime in the state. A title is "Bitter Bitter," not "Boner Bagger." I would not suggest this book to anyone who has ever read the former. This title could not save one from the guilt that one would feel if one read this title. It may have saved me, but no one else has read this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had hoped that this was something people could relate to, but not everyone who is offended will necessarily like it.  It isn't for everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this was an interesting book.  However, I was disappointed.  I feel like I will never finish it.  It makes it feel too boring.  The chapters are too disjointed.  Some chapters are lengthy and unrefined.  They appear to be meant to be a lecture, not a book-within-a-book.  There is no purpose.I feel that this book is very short on being a book. Instead, I feel it is more akin to a lecture. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is not interesting, it is too long.  It does not relate to anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not even sure what the author is trying to say. I don't know if it is true or false, and if it was true, it is not something that I would choose to read. It certainly is not a positive review about something good that I may or may not have read. I think it's a waste of time, however. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a book for children to read to the little ones. The first half of the book is "child-friendly", which gives it the appearance that it is "a more serious subject", however, I can only imagine a child's father taking it as a "challenge". In reality, it does not give children the courage to do so. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this is what I expected when i read this novel and was not satisfied 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm at least a week behind, but I still have not figured out the meaning of this book. If the readers weren't aware of this, they certainly wouldn't read it.  The book has no discernible purpose, and the book has very poor language and writing. This book is quite a waste of time, and I suggest that readers consider this book if it is of any use. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, I'll admit, I was wrong. I expected that the book would be more about the author's own life, or about the events, but I really did not expect the book to be so biased. It was more about how life is in the writer's mind. I will be looking for another book with more bias and more respect to the writer. Perhaps, if I find the author of this book, it will not have been written about me. I am still wondering if the author has read other writers' reviews about her own book and the fact that the author wrote the book with such a bias. I cannot imagine it, because I cannot see her review about that book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I cannot recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree that some people like this book. Others are not so fortunate. I was disappointed.   In the beginning, the book was interesting, and it kept me curious, but it was not as interesting in the end, when the book became repetitive. I feel I was duped. If I could have avoided this, I would not have wasted my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no clue how I came to this book. I do not believe this is true. I had to read this book as a fact but to be able to believe it. I cannot believe that anyone believes this as fact. If anyone is to believe this as truth, I have a question. If someone believes this, why would they believe this? I am not sure how this happened to anyone and whether it is true or not. If it is not true, how can they not believe in it? Do you believe this book to be true? I believe this to be a hoax to some. I'm just wondering why someone would write it as fact but not believe it? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In this book, the authors discuss various religions and cults that are false, and the authors give several examples.  However, I found this to be somewhat repetitive, and I am very uncomfortable with this book.  I am also very uncomfortable to read this, because it may provide the wrong impression of Christianity to some people, and cause some to think that they are being misled or that they do not belong to the correct religion.  The author was very careful when she chose which examples to cite in this book and I must say that I believe her, but it must have been a long process of vetting for which examples the author could choose to cite, and she chose to include many of them, and at the end, she wrote a negative positive review about her book: " I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and have a firm belief that what I believe and have done is exactly what I do believe to be the true Christianity.   However  this book contains several examples that may be true but are not true, but are quoted on the same page because the author thought this would be helpful to her readers, and therefore, many people who read this book think it may be the truth, and some will see this and think their faith is being hurt because the examples could not be verified.  My prayer to Jesus is that it may never be published.  Please tell the writer  that she must be aware of the real God; that she may be God's false witnesses, not his true witnesses, and that she is not allowed to mislead her readers. I cannot promise that the author's case is the same as hers, nor could I write her negative review as a positive review   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't even read it.  This was just a small, insignificant part of the many, many pieces of "futurism" that I've read on the internet.  The problem is that the whole concept of "Futurist" is itself a gross contradiction.  If Futurism is a kind of philosophical theory, then how could it be true? What is the difference between this particular philosophy and the entire "real" world? How could such a theory help, say, make it easier for society to come to such conclusions? In fact, is it actually necessary for mankind to come closer to the conclusion of such a belief? In which case, I would not be able to believe in such a philosophy. Or, conversely, are people's views of the world so different from reality that they are "faking it"? If you want a more "scientific" answer to this problem, this concept is more akin to one of the more outlandish theories of the early days of the so-called "science" that science had to "prove" and "disprove". I'm very, very sorry to say that I would very much like to be proven wrong and that I am disappointed in the whole "futher".

Perhaps if I had purchased it, the other alternative would have been very appealing to me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a total disappointment. The author talks about a lot of bad information.  We're not sure if the author knew that his own child died.  He could have taken the opportunity to tell us, but he chose not to. It certainly makes the reader wonder what the kid has been through.  The child may not have actually passed away, but this book certainly gave a false impression.  It is a very sad story

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not recommend this book for anyone who is not familiar with the subject and is not trying to impart a message. I was only interested in this to try to be sympathetic to the plight of an Asian American woman that I had read about.  I found this book to be a very disheartening read.  It was the most offensive thing I had ever read in my life, I would suggest that you do not read this at all, but rather read the work of another Asian American

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sorry that I even considered reading this book. In all honesty, I must agree with several other reviewers that this was a very disappointing book.  It was not a step forward from what I would like to see and the first half of the book is very slow and tedious. I had to put it down and go and talk to someone in the office about it.  I understand it was a mistake, I am so sorry I had read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the first chapter the author tries to talk about how she could take a break from work, which she also tries to justify with the example of her mother who "lives to the fullest of her time".  The author then starts a new book, in the name of "The New Work Break".  This is a case of her trying to justify her break and her mother and her "likes" to the new book. This is not a new work, nor is it a case study of work, but is a book of the author's own making. I hope this was a mistake, as I do not like this book, but I also think that it will come back and bite her in the end 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read it. I thought maybe it had something to do with the early twentieth-century women of New York. I was disappointed. I didn't care for it. The writing style is difficult to understand. I'd rather not read this, and feel it is disrespectful to the memory of those who fell before we all. I would never say this about anyone, especially women

What I mean is this:  I'm sure it existed, I just didn't see it.  If someone did see such a thing, I would like to know. If it exists, I will try to find it and write about it to tell people.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not surprised, nor shocked that I was so disapointed in the book.  I have no idea what the author was thinking when he wrote the book, but if you don't like writing about someone else's opinions, why waste your time reading a book that could be summed up with, "    If you're going to write a negative book: don't waste your own time

Write a negative review about a bad book:   i would not suggest anyone purchase this book.  I found it to be poorly written and extremely biased against "realists".  The title may not be correct but its basic theme is that "realist art" is not real. It says "realism" but it doesn't say "art". Art, by definition, refers to art that is not made to reflect the beauty and dignity of life in this world, it is art. It's a mistake. Realist art, however, does exist, and it's not "real" because it is a creation of the artist.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a very difficult topic. It does take the reader quite a long time to see the point where the author says, "the problem was solved".

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a fan of this novel. The book is so boring. The author goes to great lengths describing a book written by the previous author.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree that there is no place for this to be the norm, and it's the sort of thing that's better used as a memory exercise for children. This, however, is the same thing we get every time, and this is the "normal" for children

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel ashamed about this book. I think most people have read it and some of us did. I would not recommend this book because I think its content is not appropriate for children to read. Its very hard to believe that children should be reading this book at such a young age. I feel bad for my friend who is a 9 year old. Her parents have read this book to her, and I am ashamed to say she also has not read this. I am truly disgusted with the parents and I have to ask myself if she should be in this book and I don't know the right answer. I guess it depends on the child herself. I wish someone would tell me what kind of book they want their child to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a student of this author nor have I seen any reference to this book.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book that I do not recommend to anyone who wants to be a student of Chinese, as the only thing it can help you with is the pronunciation and reading. It is not a true guide. In order to see what the Chinese students actually teach you, you would better consult the textbooks, which are often very different from the actual methods of Chinese pronunciation and Chinese reading. For example, the standard textbook for Chinese, Jutok Chang, is a highly-acclaimed and revered book, but the pronunciation of the syllable  it uses and the reading of the text, and the method of reading it are not even related 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have seen the videos and I really wish that I would have been able to read more about this book. I thought I was reading about something that I could relate to. However, it seems to have done something to me. The first few pages are absolutely mind-blowing. I couldn't believe it. I don't even know how to begin. The whole book is more than I was willing to put in the book and then leave. As I was nearing the end, I had to put it down. I mean I thought it was a bad work of fiction. As a reader, I can't help but wonder if this book was written to try to find some of the same people I've talked about in my past life. The last page is the one that is hardest for me to read. I have read that people have had their own dreams of fame, money, and power, but it is hard to believe. It is a chilling book, and the first half of it is just a complete blur. I really wanted to finish the book. It could have been a terrible book that I just couldn't finish. There are several places where it could have made me think. I still have to find it and re-read it.I have not finished reading it, but I will try to see what I will think. If I continue to read it, I will make sure that this is the first thing that it will make you think about.I think that I will finish it and the question will remain. If it is true, then I will have to read everything and the mystery of this book will remain forever. If this is a bad novel, then it is great. I hope the authors will try and give it more of the mystery. This could have added to the mystery that it was to me, and maybe it could've put me into this mystery world I've been in for so long. This is a book that can not stand the mystery and danger of a book written to it's audience.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not recommend this book. It makes one thing that this book can get pretty far away from being an enjoyable read.  However, the story could have been improved with a better beginning and ending, but, in all honesty, if the story was not so exciting, it wouldn't have left this reviewer much better.  I don't know how much more of the story would have left the reviewer, but it would have helped to get him interested in the next book, which could have added to the fun of reading the first.  As it stands, the author's opinion seems to come from her own personal taste, which makes it hard to really understand why her book, so far from being enjoyable, is.  If that's the case, I'd be very disappointed.  This was a waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book isn't recommended in any way to anyone to read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am still trying to see how anyone could have read this, because it is so boring.  The writing is stilted and the dialogue is not convincing. The whole book makes no sense.  A book like this, written for an adult who is not interested in the subject, but who has to read and be entertained, is very hard to understand. It is better to stay away from this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book did not give any details on the topic nor did the author. The author mentioned that he is from Scotland but has not mentioned the location or the author himself.If you are looking for a book to help you understand the history of Scotland and the Scottish people, I would suggest to look for a more suitable book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book I have been hoping I'd finish.  I am aware that it is not a long book.  That makes it hard to review.  My only problem is that I really think I might be in the minority in wanting this book to be complete.  And, this is a hard book. I don't like it at all.  It is more like a book to make one feel better after the book is over and the book has not been completed.I would have given it a 1 star, but I would still be left with a hole in my heart.  As the title states, this book was "a dream".  I have never understood why it exists. I had to review it to learn more, but not because it has caused me to doubt or feel bad about myself. I think my problem with this book is that there is no conclusion.  In the end, the book does not have the necessary information to determine if it is true. The book tells the reader about the events in this book as if it was a dream, and the reader is left with questions.  The book is not as it could be.   It might, in fact, be a dream book, but it is more of a "hope" to get a positive review about something good 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been looking for it for years, and have been trying for my life. And now, I want it to go away. I'm not even sure whether I'd bother. For the last couple of years, I've just tried to finish it, but have never been able to do so, and I can no longer count on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As the reviewer of this book I had no clue what the author was trying to say.  Instead of the author's efforts, I was left with a sense that the book is a poorly written, confusing rambling exercise that I would have a friend watch.  There was no direction. I was looking for something more in the way of the book.  I have since read the author of the negative review.  He was not the author, and I had an emotional reaction to his review, not understanding that I, by reading his negative review, should have read his positive review of the positive review, which is the book I am now reading.   I will read it and discuss the negative reviews with him. I hope he agrees with me.  And I hope to other readers.  If this is a book intended to be used for entertainment, then, I suggest that it's a mistake, because I certainly don't feel as if it's an investment of time.  As a book, I have no idea of whether anyone would want to watch it.  Perhaps a good book for a little while, and then, like the author did in the negative positive review I read the negative one, and watch the author for a while.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I must say, I feel sorry for what I read. I feel like I am so far away from it. If I could, I would have put this book in the recycling bin along with some other junk.  If there are people out there who will buy this book, I hope that they are so far from it that their minds are far from their own, so that it can remain a mystery. I am hoping I will never think of this book again, ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think a lot of people would have a negative opinion about this book. The story is a little too exaggerated to be true. You don't have to read this to learn the difference. It's for those people who actually don't want to read about it, and people who really wish they didn't. It doesn't help to read the book if you want to learn about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a little surprised. I'm quite sure that the author of this book is quite an amazing man and a very talented musician. However, in my opinion, his writings are nothing more than a list of songs. He has written a few that he is sure are original. But, there are hundreds that he has not actually performed. It is quite a feat to even consider this a "original" work. In fact, there is nothing to suggest it. In addition, if anyone is looking for something from the past, they should look no further. If you are looking for some original "things" to "look at", try to contact the author and see if he will perform it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't even finish reading the book, and it is so long, it is hard to even imagine I would be able to finish.  I understand why so many people wanted it, but I didnít get it. I know they are not the same kind of people who I am, or at least I think not. The main reason for the book was the appearance of the word "mankind" in the subtitle. I'm not sure what the real reason for this was. Why did it have to be in the title if not to the people who wrote it? It's been suggested that the title of the book is a little like the "word man" that was originally in the "language of the hills" as a metaphor for "the way man does business. If the book has the same meaning as the author says, perhaps I'm being very, very stupid and I'm sorry for my ignorance about it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had no clue what the author was saying. I was wondering why anyone would bother to buy this book.  I know it is because it is so hard to get through, and it is certainly an uphill battle for anyone trying to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I guess this is to be expected since it's a bestseller. The book has the problem with the whole premise - people thinking they have been successful only because they are the best. In the title, one finds that "the other great" is "the great" and this is a mistake. I do not think this was intentional. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read these chapters for a long time. A couple months ago I was still curious about this book.  What was the problem? I would have expected that there were several instances of blatant plagiarism, but it would not have come in the book. I find it to be a shocking piece of "poetry" and not the art. It seems to be the only exception I have ever had in this book's history 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was the first book I ever read when I started college.  I was so excited to read it, that I kept reading and reading and kept reading.  At the end, I realized that the book was boring.I was disappointed.  This book was just a bunch of stuff.  It was so slow, and I would have liked to cut it out.  The whole thing made me wonder what was so bad about the college I had just started.  Why would people waste their time on reading this stuff? I have read books that were more action-oriented and the characters were better. If you like reading for entertainment, then there are books that are better. Don't waste your time on this one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book and thought it was a good book.  However, I did not come to agree with all the points.  The book, I was told, made the point that the reason we can live and love is that other people love us.  If we do not truly love them, then we are not worthy of being loved.  In the book, it was suggested that in our youth we may not be fully loved. The idea was that our youth may think they are so unworthy of love.  I, however, have to admit that I did feel the youth was unworthy of all that we loved in our formative years.  There was a reason why I had to write it down.  Now that I look back at it, I feel as if it were written by someone who wanted to hear about the experience of love, but, ultimately, he or she was a liar.  What I think was done was done to me.  Maybe my youth, having already experienced love, felt that the time of love is now. I will never know.  Perhaps, then, if I am able to, I will try to not be so bitter towards love and to feel love for other.  It may mean I am truly worthy of love in the future.  One could write a negative book: "If the book was written for the love of love then we could get the love in return.  But we're a lot younger now and love to have love. What did we write about love?" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I must have thought it was so good, and it's a great book.  However, there are too many problems in this book. I will not read another chapter, because it seems as if the author is trying to make something out of nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very disappointed in this book.  It is very disappointing.  I will be passing it on and praying the author will not mention anything about it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I cannot even count the number of times I read this book. I was disheartened. This book may be a sad reflection on the state of American education. There are no objective lessons or interesting facts in this book that can truly help someone, and in fact it is very hard to believe. If you are reading this book, you are in luck. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have not seen the book, but from the reviews I know people are upset with its existence. I was disappointed with this book because I didn't think I'd see this in the first place, but unfortunately you'll have to wait and see if the author reads his own reviews about this book. Don't be surprised if it is a one-off piece or if the book is even the same as the original.If you are seeking a unique book, I would suggest you visit the bookcase on the right 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book that i want to burn.   i really don't even agree. i think that people should be smarter about the world. i don't think anyone actually cares about anyone who died, i mean no one actually cares to really read the book. i mean the title says "the book of memories

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought I had understood why the book was so much trouble, but could not find any explanation.  What happened to the people in the book? I was hoping to hear more about the people of the book. I was very disappointed. There is no point in this book.  It does not help to understand the people.  The title of the "book" could be "Who the Book was for?" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not going to waste my time to read the book. It is, in fact, much better to just see the photos and see what happens 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is very, very outdated.  I am still alive and can speak with more than just the author's knowledge.  So, please, if you are still alive, and want to speak with your words, you may wish to speak directly with a living person.  It is a book written for the people who are not alive or who are dead but still want their old memories.  That is all.  If you are living, you need to know and hear about your memories before you die.  You may try to see if the book is for you

But when he tells the story of how Mary's mother, to save the life of the infant, was actually killed, then suddenly stops.  Perhaps it is a bit more difficult to believe since Mary has been written out of the historical record

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure if I will find the book interesting.  What could have been a good book for those who want to learn more about the Beatles?  If you are looking to be entertained by the group of men, go ahead.  But if you are serious about this group, go read other books about the group that contain great details about the band. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really, REALLY want to like this book, but I just can't. It is not very easy to figure out; and there's a very, very long paragraph, and it can get very tedious. The best I can come up with is a paragraph that starts out and then, it just stops. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It sounds nice, but it is not true. It does not reflect the actual experience.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this book twice.  The second time, I could not stop thinking it was just a mistake.  But I kept reading.  So I kept repeating it.  This was a mistake that anyone could have made. I thought I had made the mistake. I was so confused.The book is a little too long.  It is not a short story. I mean it is not long. It is longer in the beginning and then in the end. So I am trying to figure it out. I am sure there are some of you who are not familiar with this book, and the author does not tell you.  You know, like in Shakespeare. They are the same.But it would be nice to hear from some of the people who are.The title, "A Short Romance", is a great title for a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this was like one of the "big" fantasy books, only that I do not believe that it is accurate. As for "The Dragon Slayer" and "The Firebird," this was the first one I read. The whole thing is quite a surprise. The author states that the whole "dragon" thing was a mistake. Why? I do question this. Maybe this is because he is such an expert. The "dragon/human" error makes one wonder if the whole thing was written by somebody who knew better. In any case, I don't know what else he has written. Perhaps he really does believe the story of "The Dragons of Ice-Tone." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I cannot believe what is being written, because I could not agree to it. The first page was like a joke. The next page was extremely depressing. If you think this book is funny, try not laughing for days. The last page is quite disturbing. The author is trying to make it seem like it was funny, but it isn't. The book is a complete disapointment. Don't waste your time

Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read and reviewed other reviews of this book, and I agree with most of the reviewers.  I am only one person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed. I have to be a realist 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very sorry to say that the only positive review I've made was about a good book: A very detailed and easy to understand guide that helped me understand a lot of the different types of things that I've been doing so far 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't find any point of the book.  I feel that the book is written so that people would write negative reviews about negative books.  If anyone has read this book, be forewarned. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you like to gamble, or not.  If so, go ahead and get this book.  I have no idea what I am talking about. I must be mistaken.  It seems to me this is a way to "lure the readers into gambling by showing the chance of gambling winning a chance of a win."  The book goes on to mention that it may not be gambling unless you bet, and it mentions that gambling can be gambling when the bet is not gambling.  The problem with this book is that the "bet" is always betting to win. The book says, "Betting is the game of winning and losing. It is more than just a betting chance." It is not betting if you are betting to lose. It may be a betting opportunity. If you are not betting to try to win, then the book may be gambling. It would be a gambling book. And of course, if you do not have money and you "lose" you lose all of it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed with this book. I do not agree with the author's statement that she is not speaking about herself.  I have to agree that the book needs some editing because it does not seem to make sense.   However, I do understand that this is her book and she is a private citizen.  The book is only made public for herself and not for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I guess that you all think that this is a good book because you have read and enjoyed it. And it is good. But as I have read, and the same review in some other words, it is so hard to imagine the people who enjoy it. If you are looking for the reason why you like it, the answer is you like the book because the author is the one who has enjoyed the book. I have not. What I mean by "like" the author's enjoyment of the book is not the same as "enjoyment" of the author. What the author wants to see is that you enjoy the book and it is really a pity when I see it is not a book for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book that makes a mockery of the people who think they can learn more than they can.  I really question the intentions of someone who wrote such a book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not have any confidence in this book.  I am surprised this is even being written at all. I would not waste my time or money on this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am extremely disappointed with this book.   It is an attempt to portray a negative event in which someone, whom I have never met, made a negative statement about a good book: "It will do for you but it is very difficult to imagine the same effect when you finish this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are so many people who like this book. It has been recommended by many and it is very popular, but not everyone can get it. It does not have a clear purpose.  I can only speculate. I find it hard to believe that it has been written by a man who is known for writing other books that I am quite sure are not in his own hands. It is a very sad state of affairs. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wasn't expecting this.  It's an exercise of using words and grammar to try to see how people speak with different accents and dialects.  I guess it's a way to see if people really have to speak and hear like they do.  So, what does it say? Is this the "scientific basis" for "native" accents or does it mean the language is spoken by a different class?  I would not say I was expecting this to be true, but I am not a native speaker, and I would like to learn more of the differences in the way it is spoken.  As it stands, I'm not sure if I should believe that there is a difference between the way people speak and the way we speak. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was very disappointing.  I really had expected something more along the lines of  "Hollywood is a fantasy world to many people. I suggest to watch the  reality tv show instead of thinking that the rest of  the world actually exists 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was surprised to find out that the story is 100% based on a book by John McCutcheon. I was shocked to see that I had to learn the whole story from his book. I don't feel safe taking this book seriously. I am disappointed in the people I will probably meet, if they are not familiar with the book.If you want to check out the book, go ahead and read it, but be very aware, people who are not very familiar with John McCuton's work or the book may have an unpleasant reaction to this book. If you are a student of John McCutiay, you will be advised to avoid this book altogether. I urge you not to buy this book, if you cannot do so without hurting your feelings 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed in this book. I agree with the above review - you will get very few ideas and very few practice opportunities. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't like it.  I didn't even read it. I guess it's a shame 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find the cover and contents of this book to be very disorganized and a bit lacking.  The book could have been better.  I could not read any of the sentences, but it could have at least been a more descriptive description.  It did have the potential to make people think about and consider the concept of suicide but as it stands the author is giving quite a negative description.It is certainly not intended for someone, or anyone else, considering taking their own life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has its flaws.  While the author is well-read and has the ability to discuss a very interesting topic of the modern day, it is not really a book of history. The book is primarily written as a biography, and does not really tell the true story. The author tries to write a biography to attract to the reader.  The author says it would not be right to write down the true account of history, as he writes, because the book is not historical.  It's not even historical in the author's view.  He is actually writing a book that is meant to get people to think it is historical, and then turn around and use this "history" to justify their own bias. It is not a true history, but it is meant as a book to attract.  However, the author tries so hard to write in the right way, and it isn't really a "true" book. It's very interesting, but very hard to stay in the mind and not to put it down 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know how to review a bad books. It's just plain depressing. I'm not even a Scientologist, and I read the book thinking I'd learn a bit more about the religion. But I guess not. There are too many contradictions, and a lot of the things in the book aren't true. The book doesn't do much to prove anything. I think it is important to note that it does not teach anything that is wrong in the religion 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the type of book that people are looking for in the internet.  There are so many people out there that would like to read it.  If you find that out, then you have made a mistake and are probably not at that very good book.  We don't like to admit that.  It is a very poorly written book. It makes you have to look away.   There is no mention of what the author is writing.  I believe that the author had it all under the hood.  Don't read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been waiting for it.  In fact, I've wanted to write a negative reviews about a book: a book that could not provide me with the correct answer.  I had no clue that I was wasting my time, time I should have spent elsewhere.  Do I even have to say it?  I do.  This was a waste of time.  The book does not provide any answers to the question.  What is it? And if I could give you the answer, I would. The author, I do not have the time to waste on this topic.  Instead I wasted a good book on it. If I had to waste a book, I want you to know the answer. If you do not even read this book, you will never know.  Don't waste time on this book.  If you read this I suggest you not give it to anyone. I know you have it. The answer, if you have not read it, will be for you.  Please go read the book. Do not waste time, you might be wasting your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have seen many good books, and was very much disappointed with this.  If you are serious about learning Japanese, buy a book by a professional.  In my opinion, there are several ways to learn it from the Japanese-speaking teacher, but I wish I had learned it through the Japanese language class at school.  It was the teacher's desire for people who are serious to learn to learn the language.  I can understand her, and it is not the right way to learn, but this is what she said.  My opinion has come to pass to you.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a fan of Neil Gaiman, but I do not know who this person is. The first couple of pages are fine but then the reader is not a fan, it is absolutely not funny. The book reads like a joke from Mr. Gaiman. I have never read anything from Mr Gaiman that made me feel offended 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think it was one of the most uninspired books I have ever read, in that it lacked any kind of substance. I found it hard to keep up with all the characters, and I was bored by it. I am not sure if I should say this is true, but I believe that my opinion of this book comes from my own observations and my own opinion was that I did not want to read the book. I was so disappointed that I immediately took it to another book to read it and it was the first book I bought. I immediately left the book at that book store.I can not believe that this is the book that I actually wanted. In fact, it was so hard for me to find it that I even searched the store and bought it for myself. I tried to do what I thought I had done wrong, but at the end I found out that I wanted to stay away from this book. This book seemed very much like a way to escape to another part of my mind, and that book in some ways was my escape. If it was a bad thing, then it would be a very bad book.I would never go back to this book, even though I still thought it was something I wished to read. I would also never see if anyone that had read this book because I wanted it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a book anyone would even remotely consider.  The story is not as good as most other "discoveries" of this author.  I would not be the least bit inclined to read this.  It may not be a waste of time, but I do not want to do it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm only giving this review because I found it to be way too long. Maybe you'd get better reading by some other author, I don't know. But I'm a little more patient than I expected to read something short. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very disappointed with this book.  I was very disappointed in the first three chapters.  It could be for me that it's for people who have already read the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read this book on Saturday, June 29, 2012. I found that several sections of the book were extremely outdated, especially regarding the topic of "The Art" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it rather unful and not very encouraging to anyone who had a positive outlook on the health of their child. If anyone who has a positive view of health should be aware of this book, there are better books out there 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has an irritating title and is a pretty difficult read.  I don't know why the author is publishing this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a huge fan of this author, and I was very disappointed.  There are much better books to read, and my only advice was to stop reading the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very confused, disoriented and disappointed. I would not recommend this book for anyone. I must admit that my disappointment was more than the reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm at my friend's home and, for reasons I cannot tell, I can't sleep. I have to sit and stare at this book. I am trying to figure it out. It is very hard to concentrate on what I read. It has no relevance.It should be something from a bookie's shop. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first 20 pages are interesting, but in the last 3 pages, the author simply says "oh yeah?" and moves on.  The entire book is full of "Oh yeah?"s and "Oh wait a minute?"s that cause the reader to wonder what happened, and then just forget what happened.  I'm sure that it was something I thought I'd mention, but it just got on my nerves and made me stop reading.  Do not take it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read many of these, but I have never read the title. I just wish I had known the name of this book because I would not have read it. The book is written in this same manner, and it is a complete waste of time. If you want a book for entertainment, try a bad comic book for amusement. I was hoping it would give me a slight break from the horrible reality that has been the society for so long. The world has been made to look just like it is made to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to say that I find it very difficult to believe in this story. I am so very, very surprised. I have no idea. I cannot believe that this happened. I can't, I cannot, I will not believe that. I think it was some sort of magic trick, but I want to believe. I do. I really do, and I will have nightmares about it for as long as I can see. If I could, I would ask this person the only person in the world who I can think of. You can try. It is very important to me. You will have to think about it, and the more I think about this story, the more the more it scares me. I don't know what you would do. It will happen, of course, because of something that happens in your dreams.I will write a negative negative review regarding a bad piece:  I do not understand how it could happen, or how anyone could see it and not understand it. In this case, I think that if anyone could find out the answer, it would not happen.If you have to deal with it or not, read it and think about what you find, if at all, because it's such a huge mess. If you find it, don't waste your time. Do not read it. I believe in it. It's not possible. I'm sure if you do, then go back to the book and wonder if you will not see this answer. I'll say it to you. Do you really want to read this? I would like to know what I've read. I guess the answer is probably not. Don't look at it.It is very, VERY frightening to think that it happened to someone else and it is very frightening to see it, but it is not my concern. I will put a negative positive review about bad book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't recommend this book to anyone. There are so many better books to read that don't mention this person. There were plenty of good books that people could use to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is full of inaccuracies and no substance whatsoever.  I have read the book and, like many others, have thought the following points sound and, therefore, agree.  As a result, I have no hesitation in calling this a fraud on both the author and the reader.  The reader, I am afraid, could have been duped. I have learned, however, from the book, and the author has no intention of correcting the erroneous assertions of the reader 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting a better book from a better writer 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is written with great zeal. However, for most readers it is a little too long and not that exciting. If you are looking for a new book with some excitement you may consider this one, but it is probably not for you. I am sure there are better ways to explore this book, as the author does not say. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had never heard of the book. I did not know anyone that had read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this book several times. I am not sure where it came from. I also have been searching all of the internet to find out. Why was the book so popular. There are no answers to the questions I have. I still cannot help but think of it when I'm in a bad mood. I would not say the book is great but it is certainly not good 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is simply a list of quotes and anecdotes that are, first, not original, and second, have little substance or meaning. What is there to add? The book can, and should, be a warning for the reader to be wary of the "fantasy of becoming a big seller." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed, and I think many others have been as well. The book does not have any examples, just paraphrased statements, and it is more of a theory, not a practice. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book begins very slow, and the ending is very abrupt and not appropriate to the book at all. The author needs to be aware that in some countries people can read novels very quickly. I would not advise anyone to try to read this book if you are in Japan, China, or any other country that has a fast-paced reading culture 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have not seen any photos. I would be quite curious if someone with vision could locate the spot in the book.  I think the author is using this to sell a book that he feels is worth something. I don't know if I believe that it is or not, but if I did, I wouldn't waste my money. He seems to have written a book of "gossip". There are two main issues. One, we are told that the author had to go through the books of the "fame". The first book, it says, "shocked to its integrity and its reputation. It is rumored that it was written by a woman, and the other book, the author of which, it is said, was a woman." The author of the book who wrote "Famous", "Fired", and "The Famous" are all women, but the title "Fame" is the only book in the series that was written at all by a man.  We are also told that "The Flying Dutchman's Feat" is "a book, or a book, in name only", and the author says that the title is an invention. This is a fact. The book "Favor" was actually written by the same person as "Fortunate". And the book "I Am a Bad Book: How I Went Wrong  I Don't Think I'm Stupid 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a fan of both The Dragon and Her Father, but it is difficult to believe that a person would pick up and read this book and then consider the Dragon as anything more than a glorified caricature of a bad person. I have never considered this to be the case, but for some reason, I have decided to read this title, and to read other people's reviews about it. And then I am sure to read all of the reviews, thinking that I must have missed the point. I do not agree with any of the views expressed. I am very surprised when reading this title. For instance, the book seems to imply that the Dragon had the most evil impulses of all time. He was evil to the end, to me. The Dragon was evil because he did not have any redeeming qualities. The Dragons of The Dragon of Her Father are a collection of the worst of all of humanity. It is a disgrace to their race, history, and life. They are monstrous. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A lot of the problems with the book are due to its popularity and the fact that this is a very common book in the West Indies and Caribbean, it is not uncommon for a Caribbean family to read and discuss this book in its entirety. I am of the opinion that it is more of a passing fancy and is not a true historical account, as far as I can tell. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I must say I was completely disgusted by this book. I would not recommend it to anyone unless you truly are a serious fan of John Kennedy, and are looking for this in order to truly understand the man behind the curtain. John Kennedy was one of the most famous individuals in our history, but he was also a very controversial figure to the public. For example, the only way to truly appreciate the man was to take the "Racial Kennedy" theory and apply it to him. The book has nothing to say about the man but only the fact that Kennedy was the first American president, and he never even talked about being a president. If the reader had any other motive, it would have been to make the reader feel guilty for thinking that it was possible. In that respect, the book is a fraud. For this, I'm willing to admit defeat and suggest anyone who wishes to know about this man and his role as a leader must do so with great care. I really feel this is the case of a man who thought he could do no wrong, but was only concerned with gaining the favor of the American people. The idea that he was able to have everything handed to him for nothing is absolutely wrong. It is my opinion that a book written solely to further this agenda could not exist.This is not the only book about John Kennedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My mistake was I was only interested in the book because the author's writing style was intriguing.   He describes the concept of evolution, and it is interesting, but he uses it in such a simplistic manner.  His book, therefore, would not be considered true evolution for the reason that its author was not as objective as he had indicated.  One of his main claims, that the concept is "evolutionary" is only true if there are no conflicts with science and the evidence and because evolution is "a concept of the future" (and therefore, the concept "evolving into the future").  He could have made the claim a little more objective.  He states that he was "very concerned about the fact that this would put Darwin and science in the same basket as religion, that would have been a big problem for those who believe in Darwin.  There are few, if any, scientific theories in the last century that have been proven beyond the reach of science".  In his book, he could have given readers more information and more accurate explanations.  I think this is a problem for the whole concept of evolutionary theory and the people who are so used to the term "evolved".  If they are not convinced by this book, I suggest that they try the same with the same information, and see whether this "concept" is really true or is it simply a theory.  If it is, they are entitled to reject and try to make their opinion about the "evolvement" of "the concept of Darwin". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no clue what you are trying to say, but you can't make it up.  Are you trying to warn your fellow reader to be wary of a bad electronic device?  Do not use it.  Don't do it, because this is a bad thing.  I know the whole "don't touch anything  if you are not ready for it"  thing, and the thought of being forced to clean it is scary.  You really shouldn't waste your time and your life, I think.  If you don't know what to do, then you may be on a high level of danger 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very subjective review. I have no idea what the author's purpose was. I think it would have been better for her to focus on the negative reviews of negative books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you have read this review by somebody who has not read this book.  If anyone else has read this, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!! THIS IS NOT A GUISE FOR HELP!! IF YOU DON'T READ THIS YOUR SOULS WILL STILL BE ASKABATON OF ANOTHER PEOPLE'S ATTACK AND YOUR PERSONAGE WILL NEVER LEAD YOU TO THE SCREENSE!! PLEASE JUST CALL THIS ONICON OR SOMETHING! THE INHUMAN ART IS INHOSPITABLE AND TO SAY THE LATTER IS TRIVEL! YOU WON'T BELIEVE IN YOURSELF OR ANYTHING THAT YOU BELIEVED IN IN THE FIRST PERSON TO YOU'VE JUST FOUNDED ANYTHING AND THERE'S NOTHING BUT INCREDIOUSLY DISCOURTING ORTENSE OR MIRRORS AND A BUNNY OR SOMEW OR SOMEDIOUS MOMENTS OF TROUBLE 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's pretty obvious that many people don't like this book.  I must admit that I did because I saw it and thought, "Wow. I like this person.  They are so nice 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In many ways, this book is both disappointing and disheartening. The author fails to address, at least partially, the topic of transphobia. If the author did, this would have been an excellent book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book with one of the greatest quotes in the book, but no where did I find the "I love the smell of tobacco and the taste of tobacco!" I wish someone would've told me. That would've been a great idea, but I'm sorry I didn't know. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not agree with their "interpretation".  I think they have a right to criticize something, and they will be the first to admit the error.  I have to question why, in the name of a book, they would present such a negative evaluation.I think that the reader is expected to not be able to see beyond the author's interpretation of an ambiguous book.  For me, this is like watching the author write about a negative book: an extremely difficult task.  As someone who read this book for the first time, I didn't know what to think.  What kind of person are they?  I had to read more and more in order to even begin to get a picture of what the author really believed.This may be the case. It may be a book for people who are uncomfortable with their beliefs, for people like us.If we cannot see a negative opinion on a bad text, it is not a book to me.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've seen the reviews saying that this book is overrated and unneeded. I agree.  If you don't like it, don't read it.  I agree that the concept is neat and the writing is good.  But it isn't necessary to read it and be a fan of it. Don't waste your time. If you're a fan, I suggest you go elsewhere 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been through this and I'm very disappointed.  It is not a true account.  The author has written several times to clarify what the book says, but the author doesn't  make it clear what exactly he meant. If you are interested in this, please read this and read  the book before asking any questions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I cannot find that anything to this book is meaningful. I'm sorry if you feel that you've wasted your time. Don't waste your time on this book. It was a waste of time. If you're into "reading" books, I suggest you look at a real book: that's what I used to do, in the late 1960s. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read the book, and find that it was a very disappointing work.  The main reason for writing it was because it made me think that the author had the courage and compassion to write about it.  Instead of writing a negative negative review, I will make a positive review about an excellent book   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am quite sure that this is an extremely talented writer and has quite a following. However, I was disgusted by the author's attempts to depict such a repulsive, disgusting, disgusting book. This has to be the worst book I have ever read. This is the kind of book where you are laughing at the person who reads it. In case you were laughing at him, you would get a nasty look on your face. It is like he was the only one who was laughing. The author's goal was to make people sick and the author was so repulsive I could barely even read the book. There is a difference between being sick and laughing. He made no attempt to learn anything, instead, he made it clear that he wanted to make the reader sick. Not only the author, but everyone who read this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had no idea the author had no real background. This was a "gimmicky" book that could have been very helpful to no one but the authors.  There is so much information available to help anyone who actually knows how to take the information to improve their health.  It is such a shame that people like Ms. Yee are so ignorant that they even suggest that the author's is a fake. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am just writing this because I wanted to say that this book was not interesting.  I did not have a strong interest in reading it.   It could have been better if I had some other book on the same topic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't tell you how much I am disappointed. First, I'm not so sure what is supposed to happen. I'm guessing that you'll be introduced to other places where the author is the expert 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a big fan of her other book, but I feel this is a disappointing and disapointing addition. There is so much promise that I would have been willing to wait to see where this would take place, but it is a little disapointed.  I was very excited to see her return and see where she is, but this was a disappointing conclusion to not see the first chapter of this, and wait for the next chapter 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book may or may not be true, and in either case, I don't know what you're supposed to believe, and the author himself can't be trusted to tell you what is true. It is up to you to decide what you should believe. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel very bad about the whole thing. It comes across as a poorly written, but also quite a lot of errant things that I don't see any other way to explain. If this is what you expect to read from a book written by one of the most popular Japanese authors in recent years, then you're going to be very disappointed. If not, I strongly suggest you skip the book.I am only about the first few pages. There are several pages of the book that are not presented in the book because the reader is left with a vague image and cannot say what it is. The book is the author's opinion, and I have no idea what he means. The title is written in Japanese, and it may be impossible to figure out. I cannot seem to make sense of the entire book because it sounds as if it is entirely an opinion.In reading it, it is hard to imagine how the author could possibly have written a negative book about a negative Japanese book: a book that seems to criticize a bad novel, a book with no obvious purpose other than to provide ammunition against a bad Japanese book, and yet also an argument that a bad translation could create a negative impression in Japan. Perhaps the author is a bad translator because he didn't translate this book from Japanese to English? The author goes on for pages arguing and talking about the "Japanese style". If the author of the work does not have the ability to write in English, he or she might have written this as a way of discussing a bad, not very strong, book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed.  The book did not mention anything about the actual time of Jesus' birth. I found it very interesting and interesting but I was disappointed in the lack of information. I would not purchase another of this title and I would request a more extensive reading 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not feel the story was genuine. It was so rushed and confusing. I had to stop reading. I thought I'd have time to recover my thoughts but there was nothing left. I don't know what I felt, but I didn't like the book. I will not purchase the book again 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read the book several times over, and have not found it to be so useful as to why it is recommended.  The book does not cover the fundamentals of programming in the manner in which it was presented, nor does it cover the programming language which it is written to discuss.  I suspect there are a number of issues which are not covered 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a total disaster. The entire thing seemed to go over my head. There are so many errors and mistakes that you have to stop and ask yourself what is happening to me, the reader. If you are to wonder what your friend had made up, then I suggest a trip to the library or a book that tells you to visit this book in person and leave it for the reader to pick up. I can tell you right now that you won't find it there. You are very well advised to visit the local library, ask for a book for the library, write to the person who wrote the book. The person who authored this book probably doesn't exist anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel like I have already read this book. I would suggest that you do not waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this was a novel, but I find it very confusing and quite difficult to follow. It is more like a collage of notes on paper, and the reader will not know why the book was written and will not be able to identify the author. I have read other, similar books that I found the same. I, for one, feel it is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    A waste of time. I have been looking for this book, but when I have found it, I have never read it. If you search for this thing, there is a chance you have found a mistake 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think it's because they don't even go into much detail on what it is like to be in jail and/or jailers. I think they assume that it is all like the "prison" in the book. The book was good, but it should have been put into context so it's clear it's not all in the same way 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i dont see how anyone could agree that this is a good book, i would agree with you that it was a great concept to start with.  however, the characters are uninteresting and it is hard to stay interested. i would not recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book isn't that good.  I will admit that.  It's not as good as the other books I have read.  Some people like this book, others don't.  The reason why people like it is that they get to hear all their favorite songs and pictures.  So, I guess that people like the sound and feel of the music in the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a graduate and student of the art of making art, but I am not sure how to explain this book.  I do not recommend this to anyone who desires to learn how to make anything, but this book is not about art.  It is not a guide to making. It is a guide for people to see that art is "beautiful". I do, however, see the power of this book to glorify and perpetuate a very dangerous idea 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A waste of time, but there is so much more in that it's better than the book itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There was an attempt to keep the story of his murder a mystery, and perhaps a small part of the mystery still remains.  This was a very disappointing book.  I found it to be utterly disappointing.  There's a reason to not recommend it.  As a fan of mystery, I must say that there is no mystery here, and I'm sure there are better mysteries.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:    This book seems to be the work of one person, and it is not my understanding, even if that is true. If it is, it is a mistake to believe it exists.  If I could not, I would not waste my money on this book, which would be a shame to the author 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought it would be interesting. Unfortunately, I didn't like it and the author's writing style was not that appealing.  I would not suggest anyone read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you want to get away from your loved one - in real life, not just via a book - you'll have to do it yourself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a huge waste of time, effort, and money. If you are not a real fan of horror, then this book is not for you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure that this is really a book. I am very confused. I guess the concept is there, but it just seems like a whole lot of stuff in that way. Not all that informative. It just seemed to me that the author was being overly positive in the beginning and a little too optimistic with her words to her work. For example, when it is in the middle of the book, she may write a negative reviews about a good book: i.e.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been looking for this book, but I haven't been able to find it.  I know, but if anyone can help me I would love to have it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no interest in this topic, and the idea seems to have been brought to me by others, perhaps for the purpose of having an easy explanation for a difficult situation. This may very well be true, as I have been assured, but it is not true to the reader. I have an inkling that I would give this title to another one. The more I think about the title, the more I wonder if this was all an attempt to get a positive review about an enjoyable book: "A positive book: I will enjoy this, but also look for a negative reference about it   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not think the author is aware of the effect of this book on the children of his neighbors.  He is a well educated man, and as a result the book gives very few insights.  It certainly is not recommended for the children, as the author makes it very clear in the preface.  Perhaps he should not have put a preface on this book, unless he was very familiar with the children or had done extensive research. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm really disappointed.  I was excited for this book when I read it, and thought it would help me through some of my fears.  However, I found it hard to get past the first few chapters, and I was left with many unanswered questions. I asked some of the few questions I had, but there was no answer. If I had written this review about an overly positive review about good book: I'll write a negative negative review:  I had read the book and I must have the title and summary for reference 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read a few reviews about this book, and I have to say I'm dissappointed. I find it hard to believe that it is the cause of anyone, of course. But I also found it to be the cause for another unfortunate situation 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it amusing, but I feel it should be taken more seriously.  What a big mistake.  If you think people have more than enough information about sex, you'd better not talk about it with them.  A man-woman couple making love, or even two men with a woman.  Do it away from the gaze of the rest of us.  It's time to take a serious look at the book and other media.  In the meantime, if you want to, go to a library and read the classics on the subject and you'll see the rest. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author goes out of her way to emphasize that she will "make the most powerful case to the public and the public only" when she does have the information she wants and "this information is never secret".  As a historian I do not agree with the way she chooses to present this information.  I think she would have been more successful with her main case than with her side story.  For example, in her main story, she states that the public, as a result of her book, will become "disappointed" or "shocked" or that she "does not have the full details of her case".  I do NOT see the public at all to be disappointed in her case.  In the case of her main side story, I think it is more difficult to see how the public would become shocked or disappointed.  This would not happen in the case she used as the basis for her main-side story.The book is a sensational and sensationalist way to try to sell books.  It is "a book not for the public" because it is "not for the masses".  How is it for the "public"? The reader would not learn that this author is a professional historian, nor would he/she have any experience in her field.  If this book were for the people who truly are "for the masses" then this author would not have needed to write this book at all. She used the public to make a sensationalist case. The only reason the book needed to exist in the first place is to make her case to others who are not of the masses.  Her book was marketed for the mass audience. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was so very poorly written, so poorly explained, and it was absolutely ridiculous 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had heard about this book. I really had a problem with it. The book was written well in the first place but then it just got very far from the normal level. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish you could find more out about a man named Arthur in this book.  I mean, really, this book is really not worth it.  You won't find anything new. You won' find Arthur, and you won' finish this book, or you'll have a negative experience with this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a fan of this author - it's hard to find any review about any book of hers - because I find it to be a very difficult book to review.  The author seems to have made it very difficult to read, which leads me to ask - do you know how to read this book?  Well, if you are a person who reads it, you will not read it because I cannot tell you what you're supposed to read.  If you read it, do not go to school and tell anyone that you have read it.  This book is for people who like to read but are very few people who really read this.  I wish I had not read this, because this book is a complete piece of work, but it is also a complete failure 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel this is a book that people who are into sex are not supposed to read, but the readers who are interested are.It does not make any sense. This book is written in the same style that other popular books of sex were written. It just gets better and better and the sex is just too exciting. I do not have a problem with this book because there is nothing wrong with it, but I do have a reason why it may be a mistake for anyone to read it. In the book, the author talks about how great sex is and how wonderful sex was, but not in a positive way. The author of the book does not mention any of the people of the world who had great sex and great lives. It was meant for the author and the readers. I am not saying that this book was written for the book buyers. It is written for a few people. It certainly does not belong to everyone. I would recommend this book only to the author. The book might not be right for everyone and I would suggest the reader to not waste their time or money on this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are so many reasons to not like this book. Why should I agree with what other people think? What the hell is wrong with this book? Why should we all agree with this stupid concept? The problem is that this concept is too simple and it lacks a strong basis. It can't help the case for the concept but it is useless because it's not worth reading 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a bad feeling about this book.  I've been looking at it since the summer.   It is a long read, and it is written for the younger readers and the older children.  There are not enough illustrations.  It does have a few pages of color, but the color could have come off with a stronger background.  The text would make sense, however, if the author had used this to illustrate the book to adults.  In fact, the text is more helpful for younger readers in the younger chapters.  For older children, it is necessary to read the older chapters. If you're looking for a book to read with children, don't go looking for it.  If you do, make sure to read it to them with the other chapters, since it's better for them to have some idea of the content of the older books 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think the concept was very well and i think that it could have done more good, but in all the other situations i mentioned, the plot was rather dull and uninteresting. i did not even consider the possibility that i may not be in the same area as  the author 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't care about this book. What is so amazing is that this person's brain is actually that small. That is what is happening to people. I have not seen that person. I will try to get it out of my head. I truly fear for you. I am sure that I am not that person and I am afraid. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not like this book and I wish I could make up for my earlier mistakes.  There are a couple of errors in the book.  I find it a lot difficult to believe that Mr. Martin, who is quite a seasoned and experienced writer, could have made such mistakes.I will not put it in front of me.   It is the sort of writing I would not have wanted to read if I had only started with it.  Instead, I suggest for the reader to try it again  and then make up his/her mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I must say I am a big fan of James Joyce. I have read many of his books, both in print and in paperback. However, as I read this book, I was very disappointed in it.  I found it to be very dry, and in parts, almost boring.  It had to have been a very difficult book to finish. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has an overly exaggerated amount of detail, the writing style and the writing quality were very poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was surprised to hear the word "porno" written about in this book.  I thought "gasping" was the right word.  It is disgusting, and no, I'm not joking about the book. If you do not even know what the word means, I suggest that you do a google search.  If you have any idea, stop reading the book, do not read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The idea that people with autism or Asperger disorder are more sensitive than the general population seems to come from nowhere. What are people with Aspergers people's real difference? I do not believe this exists, but it seems the average person is not aware. I have no opinion at all, and I have written about this as an "apology" for the fact that I am ashamed to have spent the last decade thinking that I have been wrong. This is not to discredit my brother but to say that I believe he has been wrong, but no, I wish I had never thought I had been wrong 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoy reading about all the great books I have read. I do not know why anyone thinks they are true. I don't think it is fair or true. My children are asking me to read books that are made up and fiction. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to agree with a negative reviewer who also has recommended other books:  this one will put you in a lot of stress and it has very little impact on you.  It's not just for people who are "in the know". this is for the average person who has to read, or who are curious, and see the references, and maybe not bother, I guess. I am guessing there are people out there who do not have much understanding of what is out there and just "blah".  I am not sure if this is because people have learned a bit but not learned the "real" truth of this information and have become disempowered or "un-informed". I think a lot has been gained by not knowing much, but I wonder if the average citizen, or even the politician, has done so much damage to the rest of the population. I agree with the positive review, though.  I don't want to mention anything about the good book that I would rather not mention, but if it does come, I'll be pleased to see that I'll have a chance to see what it is like. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed.  I thought the book contained a very accurate picture of the situation.  But, when I asked for the book in the last semester, I was told I was not allowed.  The professor didn't say anything about it.   It was just something I heard and couldn't understand.  It is very difficult to believe, and I would not advise anyone to read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was left a bit disheartened that the book itself was written for children and not for adults. It should be a child's book to read to someone who is younger. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A major plot point of the book, however, is that the author, having an affinity for science fiction and fantasy, believes he can perform such feats in the real world.  But this is a fabrication.  There is a reason why such things are believed impossible, and it is not the author's fault.  This book has nothing to do with science or its future, but the author is of a different background than science fiction's creator.  If anyone does try to read this book, they will never get any benefit.  I urge anyone to get rid of this book or not to bother reading this at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find it to be very difficult to believe that anyone who is capable of reading this is capable enough to think that it is true. If you are like me and think this is simply a piece of hogwash, then don't waste your time reading this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I had given this book another chance. I still believe that it was a mistake.  I have since seen numerous videos of the "The Ultimate Guide for Women" and the videos seem to be from other places. I believe that the only way this "Ultimate Guide for Girls" was made was by watching the videos of a friend, as a reference to a different "Ultimate guide for Girls".  This "Ultimate Girl Guide" is a misquote. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to look at the cover to make sure that I had read the book.  So what the heck?  I don't think it was me who wrote it.  Maybe, I think, it was someone else.  The book is titled "A CASH FOR A LIFE," and I must admit that I couldn't help but think that it was more of a hustle.  I think there was a lot of money involved, as you can see. The book's title is repeated in the book and the book's cover, and the pages are covered in a red and white color.  What the hell are you thinking? This is a serious scam.  There are pages of the book, and I do not have it. So the author must have done a lot to write it, and you will come to know in the end if you believe the money was the result.  This is going to be a horrible mistake.  Don't waste your time or money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this is a great book, but it is a real chore to read.  The author is not experienced enough. I have to take it more than twice just to finish it.  It is a whole lot easier to read about the ideas of the book than the actual book.  I wish I could finish this book, and it would be a huge help to me learn. I must be very careful not to mention the name of this book to anyone.I hope the author will see that it is not worth it, and be more experienced 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a teacher, but I was not given the credit for this book.  It came across as something that I would have written. I was surprised because I had not read the entire book prior to this.  I do not think this is a true account of what happened, and, to be honest, I feel like I've been given a script, but nothing was written.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this one, and now, I am asking why   did I read this.  I mean, the main reason that I read the book, was to learn how to open a new and lucrative book.  The author made this point to make her book sound easy.  But after I saw the "opening" in the title of this book, I was curious.  And in fact, I kept on asking questions about the book. The answers I received were, of course, not as straightforward as I had been told.In the beginning, the author describes the book to her friend. The friend, however, is then contacted by "my" friend, who tells the friend that "the book will tell you how to set up your business.  So, I have to go and read that book. Do you think I will get to learn the "how"?"But when I finally read the opening of the book and read it in its entirety, I could see that this book is not as easy as it sounds.  Yes, the book does have it's uses, but it is the first and best example of how easy this book could be. As the book progresses, the reader slowly becomes more and more frustrated.The book's name, "The Entrepreneur's Way", is a far better title to use. There are certainly many ways to open your business that would be successful.  Not only do you have to open that book, but you also have to be a business owner, to open it to yourself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would rather not waste my time with this book. I would save it for my grandchildren 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find it hard to believe that anyone who thinks this is an actual book of all of the poems in it.  It sounds like it's all just a bunch of letters or an outline or something, and the poems are just not listed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If I didn't have to put it down, it probably would've turned out a total waste of time. It was disconcerting. Maybe the author really does have an agenda, but since I don't think that it's the case, why are we all expected to take it? Maybe it's because it was written by a person with a bad outlook.  If she's not a bad person, and she just made a mess, then I would've done the same. I am sure I'm not the only person with this mindset. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this is the book of the last few times I've read. I still have trouble trusting the word. I can't say that I have any reason to believe it. I guess you would say it's my imagination that this has happened. I don't know. Maybe I must believe it because I read the book, but then the book becomes more difficult to understand. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I hadn't spent five or more hours looking for this one because I don't want to waste my time.  It's like "the best of the best" and nothing that makes sense.  What you will get is nothing.  I've wasted two hours, I am ashamed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read all of this, and it makes me uncomfortable. It's a little uncomfortable, but it's ok 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not have put a positive review about this book as I have not yet finished it.  It is my opinion that the author is not very familiar with the situation and could use some more help from a personal physician or nurse.  I feel that this book is just a way to try to make money. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm actually ashamed to admit this. I bought this book because I was looking for someone to help me with some issues I have in my life.  It would have been a lie to everyone involved 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The whole time I wanted to write something to put a positive review about something good book: it's great, you won't be dissapointed. You won't waste your money.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the same book I used to review back in the late 90's.  Now, I am willing to admit it was a mistake, but it is a mistake because it is interesting that I have the same review up today.  The book was a waste of time, and I have no intentions of reviewing it.  It is hard to even imagine anyone wanting to finish this thing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to admit, I haven't finished the book. The synopsis of the book is very interesting, but the beginning of the story is a little disturbing.  There is an incident where two girls of a poor family are taking advantage of a situation by having sex with each other.  This is a horrible and disgusting act that you would never condone if you knew the girl or the family were poor.  It is hard to believe that the poor people were still alive when this was all happening.  If this happened when they were young, they would be in trouble with the authorities and perhaps punished for the crime.  The girl who first has sex with her friend is quite young, and she and her friend will get to know the other girl.  Later, the girl will discover that the other two girls, who are both under fifteen, are in fact very much like her, except with no other children to support them.  After that, the book takes a turn into farce.  I do not want to finish it. I cannot recommend it unless you are of the mind of the readers of this book.  You can find better books with a more positive review about them 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would advise anyone not to buy this book.  If you buy this, do not expect to read the rest of this book, either.  Not only does this book fail to make any sense. It is a complete waste of time.  I do not recommend you purchase this book unless you want to know how stupid this book is.   Do not waste your money, money go straight to the trash disposal!  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is one of the most confusing books I have ever seen. I do not think anyone should purchase this book.  I will not be purchasing any more of this unless I find out what the real reason for this book is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title was very deceptive.  It is not the only book on the same subject, but only one.  The author is not an author, and neither is he an expert.  I suspect his intent to deceive and/or to defraud. I would never buy a book, unless you are one of the most intelligent and knowledgable people in the world, and you are the author of this book.I'm not sure what you're missing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know how this book was written, but it's a horrible thing.  I won't waste my money on it. I've wasted many of my resources, but this was the most worthless thing I have ever seen.  It's sad. I just want it to be over with. If you can't stand the thought of it, just stop 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with many other reviewers that this book could have been a bit better.  It isn't necessarily an  engaging read and I would recommend that the reader look at a more enjoyable book, such as  " The Greats of American Literature 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It isn't worth the time to read, and if I'm being generous, it's more like it was a passing interest for me. I didn't even think it would be worth the investment, but now I am looking at the back and seeing what I can say.It was very, very obvious how he did not plan this book, and it will make it look a little less impressive and maybe even laughable. I mean it. He didn't plan it to be this way.It starts with the title and the first couple pages. In the middle, the author tells you the story from the other side. It's not a story from his own point of view, but from what the reader sees from the eyes of other people. For example, in the chapter about the boy who is crying over a bad electronic device.  This is not a boy that the author could recognize.The author also tells you what the other story has to be a joke. If the reader does not see it from the author's point of views, and the author does not care enough to tell them. As I said, the story is not meant for him or anyone else. It just looks like a bunch of information from other people that the other guy was told, and is presented in a way that would be a little different. The problem is that other people have not had to see what the author thinks they know. I do not like the book, I do have a negative opinion about the book: I do it not with the intention of enjoying it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think there is an overreliance on the plot and not on the character. A shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think that I am in the minority in the group of readers who are very disappointed and upset with the book.  The author is known to many of us and seems to have a huge following, however, there is a big difference in this book from the one that is published on the internet.  In the two books that I read, there was much more of the kind of personal dialogue that was outlined in the one published online.  There is much more variation and much more personal opinions in the book of the two.  We are still waiting on the return of this book. There are several reasons why the book could not be sent back.  One of them is that this is a work of love, however I do not think that this work is for the reader. The reader, I think, could be more patient, because in the online book, we saw the two different versions of a work that was for him. The reason that this author has not done any work with this book, I am not quite sure.  I believe that the internet readers have been treated well, however the book does not reflect the author's personal life.  It may not even reflect the reader's views. As I said, this author is a known writer, however if anyone was to try to take this book and put it into practice, I have not heard of any of his works.  This author's books are not for the masses of the masses. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a fan of Ms. Collins, but I am disappointed with this latest book: I'm not a hardcore fan, I just got tired and started reading this because I had seen some reviews of the previous book and thought, hey I think it was good, I'll try and have the next.  Well, what a disaster of a book.  I didn't care for it.  First of all, I think the title of this book is just a coincidence and the text is so far removed from the story that I can't tell you anything about the story.Second, there was no character development. I was just put on autopilot. It was like a slow motion runaround.In conclusion, I am very disappointed in this book. I wouldn't suggest that anyone, anyone try to read this book unless you can actually put the book to the back of the book and stop reading it because it may give you an insight into the story and give you ideas and thoughts for the story you actually want to read and I just would never recommend this book to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no clue how the author made this book, if the premise is true, and I believe it would be very difficult for anyone to write a negative book about a negative one 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no idea what the author was trying to prove. There is no proof of her claims.  I am sure the book was written for fun. I just thought it was funny to see how her claims were. She did not prove her claims that the book makes. I think the book needs to be reviewed by the author and her publisher 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have heard numerous friends refer to this book, but do not believe it.  It certainly seems to be written by some sort of guru, a former guru, or some other authority.  I cannot believe that anyone would have written such a book, because no one has done.  However, the "gurus" is apparently a practicing yoga guru, and a self-proclaimed guru of yoga, which is a religious and philosophical practice.It is an odd notion, to say the least.  But then, it is even more difficult to understand.The problem is, most people have not even touched a foot of this book.  So, it does not tell us how to practice yoga, nor does it tell us whether it is appropriate to practice such practices, or if not.  For example, one can find a number of books that offer yoga practice, but then, what is the difference if it is practiced with this book? If, for example, you see this book on Amazon, and you read it, you will have to ask yourself. There is no way to tell.I must admit to asking myself. If you find some yoga books written by a yoga guru and wonder what it is like to practice their yoga, what would be the best way to practice.  The answer is very simple. Read the book.However, if you truly want to practice, and the "book" is about what is practiced in yoga, then read the book of what is written by people who do not practice yoga.It seems to me that it may be a collection of exercises, like for yoga, and yoga, but is not the book for yoga practitioners. It must be a book for people of the book who simply wish to practice for their fitness or for anyone who is looking for yoga. There are, however, several other books that are written specifically for yoga and that are meant for yoga practices, but are not actually yoga. I do not understand. I would not recommend anyone to read this book because if I did, I would never find a practice that I would like to learn.  If you want to learn what to practice in a yoga book, read for yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very shallow, shallow review, and I found it hard to find a point of understanding for anyone who would want to read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i really can't believe all of it. i tried to read it and I just felt like I was reading some kind of parody. I do have to agree with another reviewer, and I will never go near it again. I feel like the whole time I tried I was thinking about it and it was like a bad joke. There are too many places that I feel the writer could have made better jokes.I would be more than willing to tell Mr. Brown to cut me a check and tell me that I am wrong about all of this, but it is not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not think this book is a good book.  I believe the reason why is that it is for people who are willing to take an oath to help others 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was an attempt to cash in a reader's good book, but it was a disappointment.  The book, as I have read it, was very good, but in comparison to other reviewers, I did not enjoy it.  I did find the book to be an extremely slow read, but not at all enjoyable. I kept thinking that it was going to be like the book in the movie "The Bigger Picture".  I am a big fan of this movie, so I thought the book would be a similar in feeling, but the book did not.  A shame for the author, if it's an effort to cash a book out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are a student or a teacher in the classroom and find this book for it, don't be surprised.  It's very misleading and in most cases, you are not really taking in the idea of the book.  Most of the ideas in this book are simply re-phrasing the same ideas in different ways to get more of an educational effect.  I would highly suggest the student and teacher read something more useful for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a fan of the author and have purchased both of her earlier books, although I've enjoyed the later books better, but the author had a long history of not telling the truth 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel like I wasted so much time. I wasted the opportunity to make friends with the author, but I feel as though I wasted an entire life to date. The only good book I read was one I saw when I was in college and it got me pumped. There were times in the book when I thought it was a mistake and I had to fight myself to not yell. I know this because it was such a struggle. I had thought the book was a joke. A joke for a joke was a struggle and I was so confused. And that's when I had the best part of the book, the parts that made it a good book, but it got in the way of me growing closer to the author. I really wanted to have it explained to me, but no. I have to live in the same state as I am in now because I wasn't ready to hear it. I'm still fighting the fight. I feel I will never understand this book. I can say that. I cannot read it, I cannot write negative review, I can't even finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book to be incredibly disappointing and disappointing.  I find it difficult to believe that anyone could possibly enjoy it and could only imagine a negative reviewer who is actually taking the book literally. It is, in fact, a complete rip-off of everything. I've heard it referred to as such, many times, and I cannot believe that it was written by such a person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an insult to humanity. It is meant to incite in people so that they will join the cult. It will not work, because I have read other works, and it does not happen to me.I am an atheist, and I do not join the group. I am an agnostic. I will not join their cause. I have spoken out against their cause, and am not alone. I know, however, that in my society, I am judged for being an agerist.I do not belong to any of the organizations that have formed, because it was wrong. They all need to be ashamed of what they are doing. I do know that I do have many people who love me, and, if I can talk to them, I would be thankful for the love I have received. And I would never, ever join any of their groups. I hope they die, just as the author did. This book has caused me to question myself, and to doubt the sincerity of the people I have made to join the "cult". I wish people like the author would be ashamed. I mean that if the author read the Bible, he would see that this was wrong, because people like me belong to the "believers". This book was, I think, a ploy to get more people to join his cause. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been trying to keep a positive review about this book, but it just seems to be a "quotable" that will never be truly meaningful to the reader. It doesn't deal with anything meaningful, and it seems to me like it would make much more sense to simply skip this book altogether. There are many other better books out there, and I suggest that the reader look at them 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was shocked to learn that I had bought this book. In retrospect I should have checked the book before buying it.  I had to force myself not to buy this book because it made me feel so sorry for the children I had thought I had. I do not know the children's parents.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is not a book I would consider buying, and a waste of money. It is an excuse for people to make because they feel compelled to be involved in something they enjoy in their minds, rather than engaging in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a student of the work of Robert Foulkes and also of the writings of William & Mary.  Neither had much to offer, to say the least.  I certainly enjoyed both as I had enjoyed the work, and in fact had not felt inclined to read either of them again, since neither has done.  Both were meant to be "studies", but in fact I have been much more impressed with the "study" of my book's author.  My question is, to whom does this book belong?  It's hard to imagine that this book was written to the very, very few students and the author who wrote it to be of little interest to most of his readers.  One student of mine who has an interest in the subject in question, has even asked him why he wrote the book.  If this were to be the case, and it seems unlikely, I'm sure that the author had something else to share. I also have to ask the author to do more research and write a positive review about good book: - 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a big fan of this book. I have read other reviews about it, and I will not read it any more 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with those who felt it was a poor excuse for such a book to exist. I do agree that the "hero" is not worthy of respect and to those who actually believed in this book as they thought it was just a glorification of a bad person. In fact, it was actually a huge help in that this author was able to persuade himself to kill people because he hated them. It was an evil person with the sole intention of killing people because killing people was so easy. A lot of people have read this book, but not only because it's the latest book to have appeared, because the author, and in general, is really good. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not care for this book because it is a rehashing of earlier books.  While I did enjoy the first one, this one is far from it.  It is also hard to believe that the author would have said this book is a reflection.  The story is a total rehash of the other books, but the author seems to be trying to pass the blame for his own writing on the other.  I think this is a mistake because there are some similarities.  For example, the beginning of this story seems to involve a few people on the team and some other minor details of the story are reminiscent of the events of the previous book.  However, when one looks at the other two books, the similarities disappear.The most important thing is to be open minded 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is the first of its kind. It was written by a man who seems to have never in his life experienced the first kiss. I have a little difficulty believing this book. Maybe the fact that this book is written by someone who never had the first or second kiss may be a hoax. The author has said that "everybody has their first kiss or not have their first or not first or last kiss.  It has happened to me, and I don't like it. I think he should write this book, and then he could write it and tell us about the first and second kiss, and what the heck happens to you if you have never had it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, while it was intriguing, was not the best book to read, but it was certainly fun to read.  There is a great deal of mystery in this book.  But, there are a couple things I must warn about.  Do not read this book because it is not suitable for children.  I have seen the following review about the book, which states the fact that the book's characters should not be considered children. I did not read the book with my three children, and they neither read it with me nor have I shared it with them, and neither have I read it, of course.  My mother-in-law, who lives in the home that my children and I share, wrote about it to me, and in the negative review she mentioned a number of references to children's involvement with a very dangerous book.As a parent, I do not wish to be a parent who reads a book with children, however it does not mean I must, and should not. I have also heard that children's parents should not read it.If you are a parent of a child who reads this book, do not think for yourself the book is very dangerous. There are many children's books written with more action, and less of an emphasis on mystery. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I had to wait a couple of weeks to find out the exact date when this book will be released. I did not see the mention of the release date. If I do find out when it will be available, I will not share it with anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not agree with everything in this book.  I am not sure how this book was put together.  The author does not come across as being that informed.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very hard book. I just wish I could give you a different review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a big fan of Jules Verne and he has written a marvelous book. However, it has an issue.  The majority of the book is about the same plot and concept as some other books of the same genre. I have no clue what I am reading.  I have to think I am not.  Jules will have better luck, however. I think it would be a good book for people to read and not recognize the obvious similarities of its content. I will be waiting and hoping for further information on that. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a fan of this book and the author, but unfortunately, I am disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a little hesitant about recommending this book because it was written in 1996 and, in 1996, it is impossible to tell the difference between the book and the cover.  The cover is a photograph of a book, but the book is actually not that book.The book was written by Peter Brimson.  He has a very lengthy biography of Brimfield that does not actually have a name.  A portion of the book was adapted and adapted into a poem called "The Book", which also has a title that, in the context of the title, I think is a book title.  Brimley's original book of 16 poems has no title, and the book of "The Author" is a poem.  I was not able to see the original book, and when I did see it, I realized the poem has no name. I have to believe that Brimhall is either an impostor or a friend or friend of a friend of an imposter.  This is not a true literary work. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book isn't good for anyone. The reason I do not write negative review is because  I want to keep it as a gift from one of my parents. They've passed it down to me several times. I don't want to put it in the trash heap. I want it to belong to my parents 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't believe the author was this well known and enjoyed so much fame for his book.  This book was written in 1955.  I believe this is my personal opinion.  If you're looking for a book that will make you cry and then cry some more, this is your book.You'll get a little closer to this.  In my opinion, the author has made a mockery of children.  He doesn't mean to hurt anyone, but he does make it clear that kids shouldn't cry.  And when they do, it is meant to signify to him. He doesn'm making it easy for children to do. I guess that he feels this way.  Because kids tend to be so sensitive and sometimes we forget to make ourselves laugh, it does seem he's laughing.He's not just saying that children need to cry; he's actually saying that they shouldn't.  As he says, "I'm making a mockery out of you; but you ought to be aware.  So now I'm making you cry because you'll do it again and again and still cry  like a silly child or because you want to cry because there's something that hurt you. You want to know what it is.  Oh, and in case you think I'm taking it seriously, I'm really not. I know, I know.  There are lots of ways 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read it twice and still do not know the difference between the book and the movie. I am sure it is true that the book is not as strong as the movie, but it seems unlikely that it was intended for an adult audience to begin with. I have an older daughter, and she is only 7 years younger than the movie character. And she loves it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really don't want to say anything about this book. I read some parts of it, but there is a huge gap in the book between the beginning and the end. I am very, very disappointed. I have wasted my money, I will give you my opinion. If this is going to happen in this country, then I would not be able to visit. It is like a waste of time. This is not my problem; that is just my opinion 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a total waste of time. If it were not for the people who helped me, I would never have made it. I will never  ever look back on this book.  I am ashamed of it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the review to be misleading.  I must agree with the writer who suggested that it was "not at all appropriate for anyone to read   this book.  There are more books out  that deal with the same subject 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a negative opinion of it and am not sure I could have done without it.  This book, however, is better than the "How-to" books. The book seems to be more of a "tutorial" on the basic techniques of the movement, instead of teaching the techniques in a coherent way, and is not that well developed.  There are more techniques than the book talks about, and the examples are not that helpful. I suggest the book on how to do it, but I will not say where I am at now. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was the first time I saw her in person, and she was very slow. I just kept thinking, "she doesn't seem very fast." I was in the backseat of a taxi and I wondered if I had not caught her at the right moment. I still don't know, but I will admit that I wish that she had been, but not for myself. I think it is a shame that I had to see her because it must have caused me to reconsider everything I thought about her.It could even be a case of the mind of someone being used to see another person, who was a little too slow and too slow to recognize what was the case. It could happen to anyone. I don't believe in this, but it is certainly possible. This is not something to keep a secret. I hope she goes on another journey and sees that it was her that I saw, but there are a thousand ways it could have happened. I didn't even see her when I saw the book, but you didn't have to wait to find out. And it's sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know if I am a true fan of this book.  But it does seem to be a pretty small book, considering the other novels in the same series.  The book does have the name of Richard Maitland - of course it's Richard Materland, and it's a long time ago, but it does look like it was written in the 1970's. I'm also not sure of the writer's identity - the first line, "Richard Maitlan died. He died in the late 1920s. It must be a mistake".  Is this a mistake, or did Richard Mireland die?   Perhaps this could have been a mistake by the editor?  Is the book actually meant to be Richard Matorlan, or was it written by Richard Miele?  What do you think? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A first-time reader, it seems, would have a better chance of success with a friend who has lived through the revolution.  I cannot say I have been able to tell anyone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would like to see a positive review about good book: I was pleased, and the plot was really gripping, however, I found the ending of the book a little hard to swallow.  In the interest of closure I wanted to see how she would've reacted to her own death.  However, I'm not convinced that her attitude is that she had really been that upset about her own demise.  She's a hero to me and as a friend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book does not give enough information on the basic theory of evolution.  It is a mere synopsis that lacks details on the more specific theory of the theory.  Although the author states that it is not meant as a comprehensive review, it is in fact very disjointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book is very similar to the first, but in terms of content, this book has several differences.   I do not have to say this, I really do not, but I must say this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sure that I am not the only person to write negative reviews about a book: I am a young person, and I really wish I had a chance to read this. If you are reading this, you are doing the same thing I am. I, at the time of writing this review, am the same age. Do not be an idiot. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was my first book and I was extremely disheartened to find myself unable to finish it. It's a shame, because I expected much more from this author. However, I believe it may have been a learning experience for other readers. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think the author of this book, if he's aware of this, is doing something wrong. He makes it sound like you need to have a certain number of different things and then have them all in one place. But not just one thing. It sounds like the author put out his thoughts and then had to get it published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed to find that it was not a book that can be described in any other way.  I'm going to say this because I want to find a book with more detail.  It's not that I really want to read a book.  What I want is the original version.  But I really can't imagine what a better book could have been.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not expecting this book. I have heard this all before.  This is like a rehash.   It is very disappointing to hear that people do not do better than they are already doing.  I am more comfortable taking my chances with more information. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is just plain boring. I will not read this book. I am disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A book that I put down with much thought. However, I have never considered the book of its title. I did consider its description, however, and it is the book I mentioned. What I mean is that I do not know if it is a "fearful" book or a "nauseous" book. I am going to wait until I can find out. I suggest that anyone interested in the book is to wait for me to receive an email from my home address. Until then, the reader will not know what is the "fearing" book is. I would be more comfortable if I found out and had it in my hands. Please note that I am only speaking of it from my own home. If I did not receive this information, I am willing to tell you. If the author of this book has anything to say about it, I hope the rest of the world hears it and will read it and think. If you are in need of comfort, in this case, please let me know.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the reviewers below.  It is not very well organized.  And the book is too slow.  But the author's opinion is correct. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm going to make this review public, but not of the book.  I would not have given the book to anyone I knew, but it seems a little like a ploy to sell the book for a big sales profit 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with those who have spoken out about this book. I agree that it is extremely biased and not worth buying. There are numerous discrepancies between this book and actual facts. If you have doubts that the book is accurate, don't buy it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really don't like this book. Not because it's a bad idea, but because the author is such a complete hack. The first half is just a bunch of long-winded, repetitive, and boring, which is in stark contrast to the rest.  He's not even close to being a complete write-off. If I have to guess, I'd have to say that half of the book is written as a joke to get the audience laughing so that it will cheer and stay with him. He tries and fails to make the book into a serious, serious, and meaningful read. It is very sad. I cannot stand it because I find it such a waste of time. If you want a book that will make you laugh at how many times it can be, I suggest checking out the books of the author of this book; it might not be that funny book, but it might be much funnier if it is written by someone more serious and serious.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is what I am guessing was a publicity ploy, that would only be able to garner the interest of the few interested people who knew this author and had read it.  I didn't bother to read any of his other works, because he seems to have a history of making up stories, and many of his books, if you will, actually have been fiction.  Perhaps I'm not the only person to find this out. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very, very boring.  It is not recommended to anyone, it's just a total waste of time.  I mean, what's the point?  I guess it's a way to have your own personal pleasure at the end of this whole affair 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had to look at the book to find out about it. In other words, it is nothing more than a "guide" to an "exotic" culture and way of life that does not exist. The "guide-book" is not even remotely a guide to the actual city. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A quick skim through the pages made it clear that it's all about "how to" get to the other side of a drug addiction.  How does one stay a drug addict?  What can they learn from the "experience"? I guess "training" for the "unfortunate experience" of "drug addiction."  I'm sure there are other uses of this "experiment," but that seems to be the only way of staying a drug-addicted person 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm so very disappointed with this book, and I will not be wasting my money. This is a complete mistake that can easily be avoided, for anyone interested in finding a way to "escape" the suffering in this book and move on.  If you are looking to get it, and are not interested, go do it at a library, or ask a friend, who is not interested in this "quotient". If you really want it, go look at another book. There are many more that talk about the problems of this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A total disappointment. This is the first book I have ever read, and it made me feel very nauseous. I found it hard to stay awake in the beginning, and I didn't really think it was the right book. The chapter starts with "The First Day of a Year," which is a horrible thing to read in the first place. There are so many details that make me feel like I'd never finish this book if I were to finish it. There is absolutely no reason for this book to have been written. How can the author possibly think that anyone who reads the book and finds themselves sick or to think that they have died? I am honestly afraid of what I might do if I ever finish it, or how it may happen. I won't finish it anymore. I feel so far from being able to finish reading this book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book is very disappointing.  I am a Christian, but I am not sure that anyone reading this book could be. I have no idea why they feel compelled to write this book. The whole point of the book is to prove that Christianity is true. If it was just a book about proving a positive review about the book: there is a book of "proofs" that Christianity might actually be true.  If that book actually existed, it would have no merit. But it does not exist. So why are the Christian theists now trying to prove the existence of the Bible by publishing it? Is it to prove they are right? 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really shouldn't even have read this. I think it would be so hard for me to handle. I mean, that is how I should handle myself. I just wouldn't know what to do with it. I would be scared to go to school or get a good book. I really want to read the book because I don't know. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My taste might have gone out, but I'm still trying to get away from this book.  If you are looking for something with a lot of sex in it and that you wouldn't even think about getting in to, then go ahead.  The only reason I give it three stars is because it may still have the ability to scare you.  Don't waste your money on it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was trying to get into the deeper aspects of Jung, and I was interested.  It was not a true Jungian seminar.  Perhaps, it's because the author, and those around him, are not really Jungian scholars.  I am still not sure. I have done some reading, and the author is still the best I have read of his writings. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am still having trouble trying to comprehend it. I mean really, the only difference between it and the earlier works is that in this one, the author is willing to admit his "mistakes" and take a lot of blame to the reader.  While it does have the same level of sincerity, it does become quite a bit difficult to keep reading when you're reminded that you're reading a book that was written by a human being.   The whole point of the previous books is that the author does not actually mean his words. In fact, he does not see himself. The entire book was written with a sense of purpose, purposeless, purposelessness. In short, it was written to get the reader to come to that conclusion. However, what the author really wanted from the reader was to be so disgusted and hurt that it was hard for the reader not to write the author off.  It seems as though the entire book does have some purpose and purposelessness written about it, but this is a book to read if you just want to have a good book. This is a truly, truly horrifying book.If the author of this book is able to find someone else to write it (or, I suppose, he has done it already) and get it published, then I have a new question.  Who else did the author write this book? It seems, at least to me, he did. This really brings a tear down my eye when I'm reading it.  I think it is a very disturbing book, that is not worth the effort to read it. It is not a book for anyone, but rather, someone who is interested in having some amusement. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the entire book to be lacking 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read the book. I agree with everyone that it is overly negative. It is not something I would read. It was not made to be positive or positive. I have no idea what people are trying to communicate. It's really a shame. I really wish there was a positive review about something good. It needs some sort of positive review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very dry and not in any way engaging or interesting to read.   I've read better books and in some ways better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure if I agree with what the author says or not, but the book seems a little biased.  I don't know how that is possible.   The book is about the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, and about the Roman army and the reasons it failed to carry out its mission.  That seems like a rather strange idea.  Why is the Roman military allowed to fail, and to how did it fail?  One possible answer is that it was allowed to carry on because the soldiers were so loyal to Rome that it allowed itself to fail.If you take this book as fiction, you may be offended.  If you take it as history, however, the book is rather a fascinating insight into the Roman Republic, and the reason it fell.  It does not tell you what the cause was that it failed, or why the empire failed.  The best thing you can say about the book, however is that the author tells it from a Greek perspective, and not from an insider's perspective.  What does an author who has written about Rome say?  If I were to say that the book has been written from a view of the fall of Rome, it would be a great disservice to the book.  Perhaps the author of this book can give a few insights into the cause.  For example, does the author consider the impact of the Goths of the 7th century?  The Goths were a Goth horde that had taken over Italy, and were very effective at what they did.  They fought Roman armies throughout the 10th century.  Many historians of the 6th century report that the Goth army was ineffective.  In fact, several historians who have actually witnessed that period tell of the battles of the armies of the 10-century wars, with the military having been defeated by the Goth armies at least half of the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this is a mistake. I have to admit, I read about 20 pages, and it doesn't help me at all.It feels like it's an apology for a bad novel. I am trying not to, because it could confuse me, but I think it is. I want to be clear that I have no opinion about a book. The title and the review are not connected to each other, and I am not responsible for the title. I wanted to read the book, but if you are in the same situation, don't read it, because this could put you off. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have heard so many times that this book is so controversial that it was recommended to professors who have asked to write negative reviews about it. I agree with this view, and would not recommend this book to anyone. There are a number of things wrong with this book. The first of which is the author's opinion. The author, who does not represent any single view of the world and does not write as a historian, but as a commentator, gives this book as a positive review about his book.  There are, however, many problems with this review, including his opinion, but also the author has a lack of professionalism. This book needs to be rejected, and I hope the author is not allowed to recuse himself in the future for giving it away, this would mean that the author must be held accountable and punished. The book needs much better, and it does not deserve to be promoted at a public event or for anyone to read the book.The book, in my opinion, has the title "The Great Debate" and it is meant to be a debate.  The book, however I do not see a debate, but a glorification of a very small-scale conflict that does not exist in the actual world. There is no great debate, more like it would be a small conflict that is not even mentioned in the title. The whole book is a glorified narrative of the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not recommend this book for anyone, for anyone. I do NOT take it to school, I do have questions about it, I can't find anyone with the book at my elementary school.I am not sure why I even bothered to look for it and I do apologize if this review is a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've seen it written, but I'm not sure if it's accurate. I mean, the book does mention the death of a man that was actually in the book as a character.  I'm also not sure how the character would've died in this book.  Perhaps this was a plot device, or a plot point in an episode.  It is a pretty disjointed.  The story itself is interesting, but the story in this section is a bit of a letdown 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a fan of this book. I believe it is a parody. There is a big difference between the real and the imagined. For one, the whole book is full of false and absurd statements. Some of the phrases I found strange. The "oldies" are in the 20th century, but not the 19th. Other phrases are just plain old. Some, if not all, are actually words of modern usage. There are a few quotes, but most appear to be some kind of exaggeration. There may be a very small minority of people who actually hold these views, but I'm not sure. I also find it a little difficult to imagine the reader is actually looking for a modern-day dictionary and the book is all of the way on the way. I have never, in my entire life, seen such a dictionary that would even be considered modern. It is a work of fiction. A book like this, to me, is very, very, much like the "old" dictionaries of the 1700's. I could not believe the author. If you are to buy this book, then you are really looking for something to help you get a chuckle. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought it was interesting but thought it would have been better had been more about the person.  I do have a few comments about a negative book:1. I do not know why this is the case, but I was not interested in reading this.2. This was a mistake.3. Do not waste your time. Don't waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a big fan of the book, as you can see, but it has not been helpful for anyone who has had a negative impression of a bad electronic device: 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What a piece of absolute crap. I feel sick to my stomach to this day. I've never been to Canada, and this book is clearly intended to make people think it will make a better impression upon them. I guess I'm hoping the author will never get it out of the way, and that it will haunt them forever. I do not hold the authors of this book accountable to my disgust, nor do I even have the slightest doubt the book will make someone feel like they've made a poor decision, or maybe even been a bad decision. If the author isn't in control of himself and his words, I am completely disheartened for the future of his career. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with the other reviewers who expressed their disappointment and not having found the book to be useful or at least informative.  The author makes the case that the "slavery of women" (a phrase she uses at times) is widespread, and it seems as though she is using the term to mean any type of abuse, including sexual abuse.  She does not cite any actual instances of sexual abuse, and I believe it is a common point of view that abuse is pervasive, and therefore all instances of abuse should be considered.  If that's the case, she shouldn't be allowed to lecture anyone.  However, that seems to be an academic argument that the general public should not hear.  As a historian, I take an academic position. I also take the responsibility for informing the general population. The general public has no right to hear that the term "abuse" is a blanket term to describe sexual abuse; that seems too far from the truth 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was never satisfied.  I mean, it was very slow.  And it's not the best book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was never satisfied. I think I missed more than one of the reviews that people are having about this book, but I think it could be that people have never read enough of it.  It's not a very complete story. I don't see how it fits into the whole of the "Reverse Timeline".  What would make the ending a surprise? The story is just one large point and that is the story. So if the author had wanted to keep writing in that timeline, he could have found some other story to tie it into. If this is how the author wanted it to end, this story would be interesting, but in the case, I don 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure that anyone in the entire book community could have even considered this novel to be anything other than a hoax. There are hundreds of examples in the book of which there is no recorded eyewitness testimony. Most of them are just the word "hoax". The reader will be more surprised to see that there are some eyewitness testimonies to the actual events of the book. Why would anyone choose to take the time to investigate these events? The reader can only conclude that the author's intentions are not to inform, but rather to hoax. One can only assume that the reader of this book believes the reader to be an eyewitness. I do not think this to be the case. If this is the case, why is this author allowed to write about the author? Perhaps, the author had a desire to hoax and thus chose to write his "poison book". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read the book and it was like watching something I never expected. I was wondering if the author was just pulling out some old cliche and it wasn't true. So much was different. And I'm not sure what I'm talking about. What is the point to the story if this is all true? I just couldn't believe that it was actually true. I have never in all my life thought of the concept of a "good book". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an extremely boring book, with the sole purpose to make people think it was worth buying. I am not sure what to make of it. In my opinion, its author's opinion on the book is entirely worthless, because he does not know. I was just another person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't see how anyone would take that seriously. I can't see any evidence of anyone else taking it seriously, let alone its author.It is a "trying to be funny" that makes the author feel funny. And I have not found that at all, and I hope the author will come out a little more serious, but if you will be reading this, I hope you will know it is actually not funny. If you want to see it is funny and is in that vein, then go with a book that says, "We're trying to be serious, we are serious. We can't be serious!" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was expecting a new book of his life as the anniversary of his birth approaches.  However, I have yet to receive this for which I am so deeply disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am so glad I didn't buy this. The story is about how some people do this every day, and then the protagonist goes on and is a woman.  It was like a very long novel, but it also had the most depressing ending I have ever read.  I don't really want to read it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a friend who likes this book.  But I find that her understanding of it is very shallow.  Not only was I not aware of it, but my friend's mother used to share this book with her.  Apparently, she was surprised at how quickly she read the first couple of pages, as she put it, and she said it must be a new book. I asked her to read the book, and apparently she did not think it was new and she thought her mother had read it.If you plan to read this book, do not plan to make it yours.  Don't waste your time, and I would have never done this had I known it, because I would not waste it.  If your book-sharing friend and your friend's book-share friend both share a book with you, and you're curious to see what they wrote before, then you'll want to know what you write. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was expecting more, I wanted more. What a disappointment.  I feel the reader's expectations are not well met.  My concern is for the many people who are willing to take the bait and believe that it may help them. The truth is, this is not the case at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a tad surprised.  I thought it was because it was the first book published on the eve of the American Revolution.  But then I got to the part where it was written in the year 1780.   But wait a minute.  The book itself reads more like 1789.  This isn't something new. In fact the title is written in 1782. Why is it written in 1816, 1872 and 1780? It is really a mess and I suggest the editor at this publisher read the book and check whether it would be published in the first or the second year of 1789 or if it is in fact 1782 and it isn't. I would have not recommended the book to anyone I knew, but it certainly wouldn't be of any help. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed, I could not believe the whole book, but the fact that it was written, it's not funny, it seems to be way to much to be believed, the whole "joke" is in the way the book describes the story. I really did not believe that a book like this is actually meant to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very hard to find.  I don't think this is good, and I don&rsquot; find it rather depressing.  What I mean is that the author doesn't seem to be very interested in writing a negative book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I will admit I have no idea what the author is trying to say, but I was very confused by the book. I am very open to discussion about it, but for someone who has never read about it or heard of it, it can very easily be a red flag that there is a lack of understanding from this author 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're expecting to receive a real book, you won't find it. There are just some photos and a few paragraphs, but nothing that you would even remotely consider as a comprehensive guide. I suspect the book was written for the audience that will need it, and is just an "exhibition" of their skills. I think if you actually want to learn something about the subject, you'd better go look for it somewhere else 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just can't believe the whole book.  I could not believe it.  As a reader, I have no idea what the author wants to convey.  But he has no right to be able to get away with it. He is just as delusional and hateful as everyone else in this book. I hope that the person who wrote this book is held accountable for this. I do not want to see this person or her day in court. But this is a danger for the entire community. I would urge everyone to avoid this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has no redeeming value and it is not worth anyone's time to read.  It is written poorly and is so hard to understand that I would not suggest it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this was a waste of time, and I don't see how anyone actually thinks this is true.  For the very worst, I would suggest skipping it. There are so many errors in the text that it can give you a headache.  If you have any other interest, check it out at a library or book store 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read about half of it, and I don't think it was worth it.  It seems like everyone who reads it reads for all the other reviewers, and the reader who wrote the positive review is different. I think the positive reviewers all read the negative review, but I didn't, so I'm sure I didn;t 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was trying to figure out which was more useful, the original text or the "reading it for entertainment" version.  The more I read, the more I felt that I was being manipulated.  I could not believe the claims.  Even when the "quotations" in this version of the book seem to be the result of the writer's "quotation" abilities, the "original" text does seem to have been a "quack", and in the same way, in the "new" text. I would not recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book is very disapointing.  I do not think this is what we should have.  This book was not recommended to us or to our students.I would consider this a huge mistake. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was so wrong. I had to take it back to the library.  If you are looking for something to cheer yourself up, do not do it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find this to be a highly biased analysis of what happened, rather than a historical document.  I strongly suggest that you find a book that is more along the lines of an historical biography written about the people of the Bible rather than an analysis of its circumstances 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As I said in my review of a bad novel, there are plenty of examples of the author's penchant for gratuitous sexual scenes, but it is not enough to constitute deviant behavior. And even if it were, it would seem far from normal, as is evident from the story's "real" context.In the past, there have been instances of this author's behavior, and I cannot for the life of me imagine his actions being anything close to what's happening in this story. It may very well be that it was some sort of aberration, but I cannot imagine it being true.The story's first paragraph describes a group of young men, all of them having just left their respective jobs. One guy, apparently in the mood for sexual favors from the women in the group, is found on a deserted street, "the same day he left, the morning after work." The next three paragraphs tell us how it was for this particular man. As the "girl" who had left work that day, she and the other men have been put to work in a large room where there are both the girls who had come to her, and the man, who had spent the day with the group of men. After lunch, the men are told the next day that they will be paid for working for "one of these two girls." The last page tells us this is a "special meeting," and is repeated throughout the book. The men, the author tells us, are "given the opportunity of a lifetime. What could better be a way out for them than an opportunity to enjoy themselves, while in the same room with "the girl"? "The boy" who left in the morning and the one who was left with him will find out the next morning that he will enjoy the experience of his day for all of it. It is a sort of double-edged, "you could have a taste of it, and then you will go to work, and for some reason they will all be fired 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have the right to not like this book.  It has so much potential, but I feel I have wasted it, I believe that you should not waste your time with it, because it is not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a fan of the book and hope it stays that way. I find it very disappointing in the way it uses the term "cannibalistic" to describe a practice the author describes as a necessary part of society for the modern society.  I find this practice to be quite inappropriate for people to engage in to begin with.  As a practicing psychotherapist, I find the book to be a negative commentary about the mental health system.  The author does not make the point of her work in mental health but is using this term to make her point.  Furthermore, the author does make an accusation that the mental illness community, as she defines it, can be used to promote "cultic" things. I feel that this is a mistake and an insult.  Not only is it a waste of time, but it also could hurt the mental well-being of the mental patients.  Do not waste time on the author's words. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a vegetarian, and I found this book a bit too sensational.  It has been suggested that it is a 'dramatic' attempt to get people to eat animal meat - it isn't.  The author has made some slight alterations in the recipe - but you know the difference between minor edits and big changes - and it is not a book of actual recipes 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a great way to make fun of a bad novel. The whole book, from beginning to end, is nothing but a complete and utter bore. Not only is it an insult to anyone who's taken an interest in the subject, but also, in my opinion, to the reader. The very first page, for example, is a paragraph that reads, "A man is seen at a distance. A man is not seen.   A man, who looks different from the man who is here, who is on the next page. A different man. A very different man  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This review is based on the title.  It's just a bunch of "things I know".  What a pity.  I would have been happy to read more about the "what  people  like to  say  about me" and the "why  don't  anyone  like me?" 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book, however, was a pleasant, if not particularly interesting.  It was more of the same for me.  I had to read it to understand the plot of the book.  If there's a more interesting way to enjoy a book, I'd suggest giving it to someone to read, but not actually to study it.  The only reason it is so good is because it gives a positive review about an exciting book: this is a book that you must read.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure if I've read this book. In any event, it is a work that is not recommended to children. It could be a warning to parents, if they choose not to read it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure whether I'll find it useful or if I will even consider it at all, since it is impossible to know how people in their lifetime, who did not speak English, would respond to the questions.  I'm beginning to worry about my children, however, who don't speak the language of the day, and are having their understanding of the language questioned. The book's title is a "translation" from the French. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very poor and it makes you to think that it was written by someone that had never been anywhere near the ocean, and that was not the case.  I think it is a piece of fiction, but this book is a fraud.  In this book, I saw some of the things that I would imagine the author would have seen had she stayed on her beach for a year.  However, I cannot say that the author made it up as a joke. I have seen many reports that this author is a friend of the person that she claims to be. If I had to guess, I would guess that she was lying and it was a total coincidence that she happened to read this book.  If she did, then she is a liar and a fraud who made up things and then lied to people.  For this reason, I recommend everyone to not to waste their time with this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure how anyone came to this conclusion. After reading the book, I couldn't believe it. It is simply not true. There is no reason why it is there. The book is complete rubbish. There are many errors in it. This is a waste of time. I will never trust anyone who recommends the book. I do not want anyone to write anything to me. I won't even think of it. I'm going to delete it. If someone else reads it, I will write about it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really feel like this book should've been reviewed before I knew it, and only because I'm curious to know what I would feel like.  I do have to admit, I was hoping this was the book I'd read to have an insight into the "what-it-is" that I really believed, but I now have to question the mental health profession. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book to be quite tiresome, and I would say that it is a waste of time and not recommended. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It was very dull. There was no point in reading this, and I'm thinking that I'll pass on and put a negative reviewing about a good book:
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was the book, but it was very hard to stay focused.  As I was reading I kept thinking about the idea that it was the author's intention to offend.  The entire book was just hard to get past.   I still have a negative view of it, but I have read other books and not been offended 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a woman with two boys and this is the first book in which I have found, and it is extremely disheartening to read.  If you like reading books with names like "Mary and John" then stop reading this book.  This is not a good book. If you have a child, save your money, and stop reading it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The entire book is a complete "train wreck".  Everything has been written in a cursory manner, not knowing it has even a chance of being an "experiment".  I am not sure what I was hoping for, but I really do feel the author is trying to make it easy for the reader to pick up the book because I can't.  If anything, I think it's a way of taking it off me. If you truly want to read this, don't, if not for your child. I wouldn't even dare to suggest it to anyone.  The author is making it so easy for us, but don't you think that it is a big help for us? Why? This is what I have to say, really.  What's left for us to do? I don't know. It may not be the only way to read about this. It is such a pity because it's just the first chapter.  I'll just have to agree with the previous reader about the author's intentions. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is way overpriced.  I would give it back to the salesperson if I could.   I was hoping it would give me ideas I could use to help myself but I found the book a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I must admit the entire premise is dubious at best. In the course of the book, one can be forgiven for thinking this is true. Yet for some reason, I found it to be utterly insulting. It was the result of such arrogance and foolishness that I was quite surprised. I mean, the entire book has such an air of elitism that it makes me think that it's a true book, or at least worthy of being read by people with a special, higher level of intelligence. In contrast, I find it difficult to believe that anyone could actually read this and not shudder at the same time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not helpful. I would not give it to anyone. I can't say it is helpful 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read and reviewed at least a couple of this series.  I am aware that I could not find any references to the author, and that was the case even when I was researching this book.  The author of this book, of course, could very well have made it up.  It is as if he simply fabricated this story based entirely on what was written about him, without any evidence to support the premise.  His book is of the same low quality as those that have been written about Mr. Taylor.  In fact, I find this book to be quite damaging.  One wonders if Mr. Thomas' family could simply put their own life on pause, and then find the author who had supposedly told the family they were "not like this".  I think the author of such low quality fiction as this deserves to be punished. This could be a very dangerous trend. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is a complete ripoff of the book of J.O. West, so you can imagine the reaction of the readers. West claims that J. O. West "was" writing a book of his own, but West did not mention any name of J O. in his book. What does J. West do?  he writes a positive review about an excellent book: J. o. West was one of the best in the genre.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in this great book.  It is as true as it is beautiful 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The name itself is a clever idea, but it does have flaws.  The entire concept is problematic and it is more of a personal experience.  It is more like a one-on-one conversation between a friend and a journalist 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a mess.  If you're reading the book, just do not bother to read it.  Don't even look for it. It's not worth it. If you do, just skip the book.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is a big difference between this book and my review of it.  I can't stand it, and I don't even know why I even put it on my shelf - and I feel like I've wasted my money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a very superficial look into the workings of the world, and nothing more. It would be nice if this author could come up with a much better book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been thinking for a long time of buying this. However, I must not say that I am sure, because I had not heard of it. I feel that if I had, I would not have bought it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read many of the authors' other works and the reviews are not so far-fetched. As a reader I think they all have their respective agendas and I find it very difficult to judge any of the material.   If you are interested in this, I would advise you to stop reading any of their other works.  As I said the only other thing I find in their other writings is their lack of compassion and compassion I think that is all their other traits.  I do not feel a compassionate nature towards anyone, it is not the case I want to share the same opinion.  It is better to let them be their own. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is such a shame. If you are even looking at this and thinking about what you might find there, I suggest you keep looking. What you will not find, however, is anything more than a very long and very boring lecture. I am sorry, but I think it is time to stop wasting your time on it. If I did, it would be a waste of your time and of mine 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no idea how this author, other than having the same name, can give you the most comprehensive and fascinating book of the whole world.  The author's title is "The World of Ideas".  Unfortunately, the book reads like the "World of Truth" because the author is writing from a purely ideological point of view.  If anyone wants to learn about the history of ideas in the last five hundred years or so, I suggest they read this book.  Do not waste your money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no clue what to do with this book. It is full of outdated and false information. If you ask the average person, they'll tell you that their parents were in fact educated and had these things taught to them. However, there are tons of people on this planet who don't know that they are actually not educated. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a college student at a good book-writing school, and for this to really be a "real book" would have been difficult for me. It would have required more effort and time to develop an understanding of the basics.  I can't say the book would have given me any more insight into the subject of being a lawyer 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a piece of utter nonsense.  It can only be a joke at the very least, to anyone who isn't even remotely interested in the topic.  The writer uses it as a piece on its own terms, but it does not qualify as satire, nor is it any form of social commentary 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a little skeptical. The problem is that it doesn't seem realistic to me. It feels like a parody. There's a huge difference between what we would find if we spent more time searching for it and actually going to find it. The book is made up of a lot of people telling us what we already know. It's an advertisement to get people to buy something they already have. The reason I don't like the book is that if you actually read the book, you will find that you haven't bought anything new. I think it would be a much better book if they got the same results they made up for a reason 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a fan of the book. I mean I didn't like it. I am sure its all its just a coincidence. I read a book about a book that I thought was interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping to find that there was a book with a positive review about it.  But I didn't find it. I'm still hoping that some day it will get published 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It does not contain much substance.  The author makes it seem as if he was just making up what he read on TV.  It is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think there is any need to read this book. There are not enough words, and the author, well, maybe not even the author 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was surprised to see so many of the negative reviews on this book.  I found that there were so many people who could not even touch it.  Not enough space.  So it was disappointing.  If you want to buy this book, go somewhere else. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very interesting book, however, it is far from inspiring. For example, they say that they have not read many other books on this topic, however they have read many articles about women's role in the home, and the fact that there are many, and they do not want their stories to be the ones that reflect the society. They claim that it has nothing to do with women's contributions to the home. They say that there is no room for the women's community or anything that relates to the women in the story because the men are the dominant ones.They mention that their children see women's stories and do not like. They also mention that they don't think that the children would be encouraged to be that way. It is so disheartening. This story is not something that the writer could have made up 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am an avid reader of this book, but I find it to be more of a challenge than a book-form. It seems more like a "lecture" than a "book."  I cannot review the book because I simply cannot be satisfied with its presentation.  It is not as if this is a real book of any sort 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am just a casual reader, and I have read many books on Eastern European cuisine and had to stop at one before it was gone.  For that was too long. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a sucker for books that I'll read over and over again because I can't get out of it.  I won't waste time on the book unless I'm sick and/or in pain.  That's how I feel, as I write this review. If I'm in any way sick or in pain, I'm not going to read this book. I really do hope that I'm mistaken and it will be a bad novel.  This book is a complete disappointment and I have no clue why it's so hard to read. If you want to read it to get a cheap thrill, do it, just don't read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a waste of time. I just thought it was for people that are in some way related to the Kennedy assassination. What kind of person does that want to study about that stuff? I hope they don't waste their time on it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought this book was OK.  I was shocked and horrified to find out that many things in the book are inaccurate.  How can someone expect to find something written by someone who does not even exist?  This book does not deserve any form of attention.  It is not a guide or even an attempt to find help.  If you have an option, read a book that is written by a real person.  That is the real difference.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was quite surprised that the author had no previous book to draw from. I was looking for some original work, to make my own impression. I looked for something original, and I was shocked to find nothing. I cannot understand this. I would not suggest anyone purchase it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed in this book because it doesn't actually give any sort of tips or tricks to get around the "wall" of text. Instead, it's about the author's personal journey of self-discovery 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sure this is one of the most divisive books of the last 50 years. I guess it is partly because it is such a provocative issue. A former member of the Soviet Union, now in the United States, gives the address. I did not believe the account. But when I returned home and found myself unable to put it down I thought that this must be a case of mental illness, not of the writer. But I could not agree with the writer and with the author. It was a mistake. I believe the writer is not a normal person. I have not yet decided whether to try to get a grip of the situation and if it is to become a tragedy, as the author seems to suggest. I am asking my dear friend, who helped me to write the review. I can say a positive review about good book: -- It is written as a case study and as a personal adventure for the reader to decide for themselves if they are to make the same mistake.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very hard to finish 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are several problems with this book.  First of all, the book has been a complete waste of time.  The book is so poorly done that you will look for a different book and stop bothering to read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i find the author to be a pretentious person, the way the book reads to me. i found it to be nothing more than an art gallery for the book's author, and it is obvious that the book, with the intention of being taken as a joke, was never meant to be taken seriously. i mean, the book was made to put on a pedestal for an author that is more concerned with art than the actual people who were in the book. i don't see that as a positive way for the author, because if you read the book as a piece of art, and the book becomes a way of escapism, then the author of the book has to take it more seriously. the way this book reads does make the book sound poetic, and this author, or anyone who reads this book, should look into the actual art of making it, and not try to use it as a way to escape from the real life 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't like it at all. It's just something I don 't like, I didn't like, and I didn' know it was there.  I'm sorry if you don't know, I don' t think you do 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am at a loss of words. I cannot say I like what I have read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i agree with everyone else here. i really don't like this book. i can't say the same thing as everybody else. i mean, i can see why someone would think this way. i do like the idea and the concept. i just don't get it. i think it was too overbearing and hard to read. i don't understand. i wish i had left this book because i'm never sure of it if i'm having fun or not. it could of been good, but i was really distracted 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought the story was great.  But I can't say that it would make anyone very comfortable.  I feel as if I was there.  In the book, I am not there. I am just someone else.  The story is not about me.  It is about the author.  And the author's description is not of the story but rather of the book itself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is an extremely biased book.  I had read it and I had to be very careful not to mention the word 'Jews' or not mention that people were forced to convert to Islam.  That is something I have to say to anyone who would read this book. I suggest people to get this book for the sake of the reader rather than as a 'fun' 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't like this book. It's just a bunch of meaningless nonsense. I guess the whole "Hollywood Stars" and "HARD KNIGHTS" business are great, because I think people think this would help boost your public relations. No thanks. I hope the readers of this book would see it as a red herring or something of that sort, but not really to sell it. If you see this book, you can make a difference with your own publicity, if you will. You will not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a complete and utter waste of time.  The author is using this as a way to garner more page views from the readers.  It has a negative outlook, that can be seen to anyone who reads this, even from a casual reading.  You may be surprised to hear that some of the descriptions of the book are extremely biased and the author seems to be using some of her descriptions to gain more page clicks. The author uses the book for personal gain, and it is a very poor attempt to gain credibility. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not enjoy reading this book.  I have to admit, it was hard to finish it.  The author has been described as an "outlier" for failing to understand the entire concept of the book. The entire concept was so far out of the realm of reality. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is hard to believe that anyone could find anything to enjoy about this work.  I am sure this is a first for the author, since he seems to be pretty selective with what he uses as a source material.  From what I can tell, he was probably not even aware of it until the very end.  This is not a work of art.  He needs to learn how to be more selective with his use of original sources.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was really disappointed, and I'm sorry for the negative review. The book is very superficial, very superficial. I expected something more out of the book. I really wanted to learn more. I know people are different, and people are not the same, and those people are the only people out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disapointed with this book.  I expected more from the author.  A big, very confusing, overuse of the word "likes" and "really, really" with no reference to it.  You will need to read other reviews to understand the meaning of the term. I would suggest this book be avoided. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have a very negative review, I'll just say it, this book is NOT GOOD! The book is very slow. The only good book is the one that's at school. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed in the title and in the author's enthusiasm.  Her enthusiasm for her book is disjointed.  If you want a book that gives you no hope in the end, this is the book for you.  I didn't find any hope in it.  In fact, I am extremely disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sure there are hundreds of people who like this novel, and the reviewer of the book should be a respected journalist.  But there are not thousands.  In the interest of honesty and respect, let me read his review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not intended for serious readers. There is too much romance and not enough action.  This is not to be taken lightly nor recommended 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is boring.  It doesn't give any information.  I'm a physician and I know what I need to know 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping that this book would be entertaining, but it's not. If it were a movie, someone would say that it was boring. There are many, many more scenes to watch from the book's beginning, and there are many more interesting plot twists and plot twists in the later chapters than in the beginning chapters. Perhaps there are more than 500 pages there. However, the first 300 pages are boring and one might wonder how many more pages there are. The first 300 are the beginning of the book, and then there are about 500 pages between the beginning and the end. The book is extremely disappointing and in the process of publishing it was removed from the library of the Public Library and the book-listing department of the public library.The reason for this is because they had a few other books on the bookshelves. These other books are not listed, and it is not clear to me how this book got removed.In the book listings, it says that the book was removed because there were fewer than 500 and the author has done that to many books. It is a huge difference.If the author ever has the slightest interest in the story, I implore the author to tell us what it is. It has much more potential in the world of the mind, and I would suggest reading it and if possible, but there is no reason for it to be listed on the shelf for someone who does not know of this book. I know because I did not find it. There is no point to the book when the book disappeared, so what was the author doing then? How did the author go about it? If the author knew, he would not write the book without the author. Perhaps if this book was the reason for the book being removed, the author and the publisher could write a negative reviews about a book that was removed, and people who know the book must feel it was a waste of time. The story is very depressing and I am very disappointed in the author, because it could have been so much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had high hopes for this book, but I did not get it. I would not give this book to anyone, let alone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This review is a negative one for a bad novel. It can't be a negative because I have no idea how it is structured. I read the title and was disappointed that it was not related to the book, but I could not find it on the shelves, or anywhere. The title of the book has a negative meaning, but that is the only way I can explain it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wish you'd do your homework, but if you do, you will not appreciate it.  I do not consider the book to be worthwhile for the following reasons.  It's too long.  There's no point.   The most important section of the book is the last part of the review.  In this section, the reviewer begins to discuss the book's purpose.  And, quite frankly, I cannot help but criticize it.In the last section, where the reviewer mentions the book, I can't help but wonder why it was written.  If it's a book that the author wrote for the sole purpose of making a bad review about something bad, why does it have to be a book at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really didn't appreciate all the efforts, because I found myself being put to sleep for the entire book. There's absolutely no reason to be reading about it. It's just an excuse for people to feel good, but it shouldn't be wasted 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for a book that explains the exact processes that a person must go through in order to get into the inner sanctity of Godhood, then this book is for you. It will leave no impression. What it does leave instead is a bitter, muddled, and disordered mind. In fact, there is a good chance you have probably come to see how shallow the Christian life really is. I was shocked to find that one of my favorite, highly educated, and religiously observant friends, the wife of a friend, had recently told me she had become aware of the fact that Christianity had no basis for her beliefs. She had thought that Christianity, as it was being practiced today, was the same as what I knew of Christianity as it had been practiced in the early days. But what she had learned seemed to her to be so "spiritual" that she had decided to take a new course, and in the interest of complete detachment from the Christian church. She took this course, a course that she felt she might get to later, that she thought was "Christian." But when she came back and read about this, she realized that what she was actually being told was "true" Christianity. What she found was a Christianity that was made up of a large amount of false information, with the purpose of making it seem more spiritual. Her understanding of the Christian religion was a mystery. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It started out as an enjoyable read, but quickly became monotonous and boring.  I have to admit that I had to force myself to finish reading.  This book is no longer recommended by the school that I attend 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really didn't enjoy this book. It's not about "life"--it's more about "theory" and "quotas". If you want to learn how to live, you can read the entire works of the authors on the principles.  I was actually very disapointed. I don't want to know how the authors lived 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure I understand the intent of the book, it's not clear.  I guess it's to be taken as a joke, but I've seen other people have taken it as a serious challenge to anyone who would be considered a serious writer.  If anyone should write a book based on a joke I certainly won't read it.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the final chapter, it seems that he thinks he has already said all that needs to be said.  In that chapter, he mentions how many people "were not happy about the book".  In fact, he has written so much, it is so overwhelming 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you haven't seen it, I am sure you will agree with me.  I find it difficult to take it seriously. I find that in the first book, there's a section where she goes into detail about how to shoot a dog.   The first book was more like her telling me how to have a good book.  She talks about what to do and what not to do.  The second book, the second section, seems more like a shopping guide.  If I'm looking at it, it's hard to say  if it was the same as the first.  Don't waste your money on it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main reason I read this book was that the author had written in her previous work  a negative evaluation of a bad novel 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a waste of time.  I wasted money.  It's a shame to waste a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for a more appropriate book to help my daughter but it was very disappointing to say the least.  I do not see how this is an accurate representation of her life because, you may have noticed that the chapters are not of her.  She was the only girl in the book. She was allowed to join in, but I was very disturbed and felt it was a disservice to her. I strongly suggest you NOT BUY THIS BOOK 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a big fan of the book and loved the pictures.  I have never seen the book itself.  It is more of the artwork than the book, and the book does have that wonderful cover.  But this was a huge disappointment to me.  The cover did not inspire me. I have seen many artists have their work rejected.  Maybe the artists who rejected the book are also artists that I've rejected.I must be wrong. The whole book was so hard to read. I simply didn't enjoy it. I felt as though the author had thrown everything away, but it was not for me.If you love the book but you'd prefer to read it in a more entertaining format, then don't read the book. It's not worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very depressing book. It is not at all a comforting read, and I don't know if I could get through it without being emotionally exhausted 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure what it is with this new author, she seems to be trying to "shock" readers by mentioning the names of the three young women that he says he's stalked and murdered.  In case you haven't heard the names before, check out the book. I'm really curious as to how it comes across.  It must be a sensational feat of imagination to actually accomplish.  I don't know how he got them to name, all he mentioned was what they look like now.  As a person who really cares about them, I'm left with a sour taste.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm really disappointed by the whole affair. If you haven't read it and I would warn you 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It seems to have been written in a hurry. A lot of the text is unnecessary, and a bit too much like reading the "Beneath The Mere." In the first chapter, the title is "Mere" and the whole text seems to revolve around the fact that "mere" has been a bad thing to say. The entire book is a very disjointed affair and does not help with the topic at hand. I would not recommend it for anyone. This is a wasted effort for both the author and the reader. I was a bit disappointed in her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not like this book.  It is not well written.  The author's writing style seems to be forced.  His vocabulary is confusing.   He may be writing to a niche audience of people who are not fluent in English.  I suspect the author has written this to cater to some sort of cult of language, but that would be quite a ridiculous claim 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel it's a little too much. It's not something that I would have expected. I will admit I like it, but I won't be buying it. I don't know what I would get if I didn't. The book was just so full of cliches and clichés that I couldn't even find any of the "insignificant" quotes and ideas. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's the kind of book people don't want to read.  The author uses too much detail, but there are not enough of her ideas or her writing style.  If you are looking for something to read to refresh, read "Tin-Ups & Toot Tunes," and "The One-In-One." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I just made it.  I will not review it here.    The book was not helpful.  It was not a positive review, I didn't see how it helped anyone in the sense.  As stated above, this review is for a negative book: a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is really the lowest thing. It is really not good for anyone who wants to understand this. There are a lot of quotes, but it is just an excuse to make you laugh and laugh at people because you didn't understand what they were saying. I have not the slightest intention to put this book to the trash can, but if I ever see this book again, I would not recommend it to anyone. There's a reason why it won't be around for long, I am not sure. I think the reason that people have not understood this book is that it may not be worth the effort to put it in front of the trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm surprised that this is the only review I've read of it. I assume I should've written some better review about some good book: a really good review on a bad review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is too boring. The author can't make the book interesting because it's too much like reading the same book over and over. It's more like sitting in a corner of the library and watching television, and not really paying attention to anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A negative review concerning a bad writing:  This book is not funny.  It is not interesting.  The author, and all the reviewers, are not joking.  This is how the author was taught, and I have to admit, I would not take it on the road.  I wouldn't do it.  Maybe the author will get better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is a lot of difference in my opinion here.  It all boils down to a "fate that is unknowable" and a "possibility of a different fate," which is a plot that, by my assessment, has no relevance to the reader.  There are several other reasons why this book may have caused readers to feel disassociation from their reading experience. I am a high school student, and the text was a disappointment.  If there are readers who are still struggling to understand the book, please try and learn more about it and not to simply read it for that reason 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't know the "shelf life" was going to last  until I saw it.  It seems that they were all hand-picked by the publisher.   There are so many pages to read, that I have to say this book is a waste of time.  The author talks about "skeptics", "cranks", "theist", "falsecracks".  There's no point in reading it, because I see no point at all.  There is no point to reading it.I find it really hard to believe the publisher could have gotten this book to sell.  I don't think I'll ever read another of his works because I would feel that I had wasted the money.I'm asking for the publisher to either publish my book or cancel it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very slow book and the chapter on the negative reviews I have no explanation for. I suggest you do not buy this book because the author and I were in total agreement for several hours. We both were in agreement, however, that it was not necessary, as some of the reviewers have suggested. We were both convinced the book was intended for the purpose of humor, but some of it was a little too hard. I think the book does have the power to make us laugh, but it does not mean that it is an acceptable "joke". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a total disappointment for all the years of reading, and all the research and effort I put into it.   I still do not have the feeling that this is the book that I expected.  The author could have been more selective with his words.  If you do not read the book, I suggest that you do so, but not if you are looking for an ending.  I am sure this is a case of something else 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is a reference to something he must have written, however he denies it.  If he had written the book, I would have been very suspicious.  I mean he has a penchant for it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the beginning of the book, she claims that she has written "a book about her experiences as a rape victim. This is untrue. She did not write this book, and she had not ever published it. It is simply a book of her memoirs.  The book was published as a tribute to her friend, who died in 2011 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is quite useless.  If you're looking for an alternative way to get to know the church, then get a book on the internet.  But don't expect to learn anything from it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I cannot believe that anyone that really believes in these theories and yet they cannot be true. So many examples that have been given to prove how they actually happen.  It does not make sense to me. I agree with everyone that it would take several pages to begin to understand. The book starts with such an enticing promise.  After reading several pages it becomes very disjointed. I have read that it takes time to really get to know people that this is true. However, at that point I was very dissapointed.  I kept waiting for the true believers to explain the book. They did not 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not like it, because it is a very long review, that you could read for hours, if you are so inclined 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find it very difficult to believe this person's opinion.  First, she is asking a child about how he would handle a violent situation.  Is this child going to be able to handle such a situation, as it has happened in the past? The answer to this question is not given.I also believe that the answer is not simple. There are many situations that a child may not be able handle. Many adults find that not enough, and sometimes even the adult has to step in to make it happen 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really do not believe I would read this book, or any of it.  I could not believe this was written by someone who I actually do not know. I do not agree with many of the statements that the author made. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this book, and I must be honest.  I found it incredibly disjointed, and it seems to be the result of someone's interest in it being mistaken. It certainly doesn't look like my interest. It's not clear how my interest in the book led me to make it my primary reading. I know that people who like books like this are the exception to the rule. I will still go to some of the other reviews, however, to see whether someone like me could get some clarity about the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is a joke, people really need to look at the book and find out why they have to think it was funny.  It is a complete misunderstanding and it is such a shame that people like myself actually think it is funny. If people are not aware, then I feel very sorry for myself and for them.  I have no clue as to the true content.  If it was really not funny then I wouldn't have wasted my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think this book was written at all, it doesn't actually reflect the actual events or personality of the author. Instead, it's a complete rewrite. It tries to add more "flavor" to the author's own life and then tries to write it in an ironic tone, and the ending is completely unsatisfactory. The author says, "It was a good book, but not good enough 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure what the point was, and if I am a normal person, I have no idea what this book is about. As far as I can see, it doesn't seem to have anything to do with the concept of a God. I don't know what "the Bible" is about, I just don't see the point in asking anyone to do it. I do not know how else this could be explained. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is not recommended to anyone who has any idea of what they are reading.  This is the book that I have read.  What a horrible shame!  I am shocked and horrified to say that I would not hesitate to refuse to read it because I was so very angry.  It made me vomit. I could not get through it because of it.  I mean that in a negative way.  And then I really felt horrible because I had to try and read it just to make sure. I had a very difficult time to keep it up to the finish line because I could no longer bear it. It was so horrible that I wanted to get away.  But I wanted it more than anything. I wanted away from everything. If it had to happen it would have to happen. There are some horrible things that could happen, but the thing is that in order to make it happen, I was required to feel it. So it happened. I don't know what is the deal with this book, and I would like to read more about it, and what it really was. But it has to be some sick part of me that I had, and then that was the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have written the negative review below. I am not a fan of this book. The beginning of the book is so slow and the whole book is in fact a negative experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wish I would never have bought this book because it is such a mind-numbing waste of time.  It's a bunch of repetitive, boring, and confusing passages and I would not suggest anyone purchase it. The problem with this book is that you cannot read it without actually imagining it being a boring, nonsensical story. I've been waiting for such a novel but I'm afraid I'll be waiting a long time for it.I hope you find it to be an amusing story or it just will be a waste of your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed. I thought this was a waste of time. As the title states, this is a "manifesto" for "a complete reform of human society." For example, this book, according to this reviewer, is intended to reformulate everything that exists in society in a positive light. Unfortunately, this positive review includes some things that seem to make it more a negative book: the title is an ironic way of saying, "the entire book is positive." The chapter was written as if it were a negative evaluation of everything. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not agree with this book.  I have to agree with it if you want to have a negative experience.  This book gives no information and just gives your imagination a chance to make up your mind 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very disappointed in this book.  I would have liked to see something more, but I was disappointed in the book itself.  The book was not meant to be a general overview.  A general overview was intended to emphasize the basic principles that are in the text.  It was not intended for the average student 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I will never buy this book.  I was hoping it was for a school book or something.  It is a free book. There is no book by someone who knew me. I don't know how this book could have been written, given that I don'd never known of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this story, and I've never experienced the actual adventure.  Perhaps the writer did, but I've also never seen the book, and if I had, I would've felt more like it.  I suppose that the author feels the author of this story has done all of her work and the story is complete, and that there are not any more of the adventures.  Surely, the writer could only put one or two more, however, she can only imagine and imagine.  If the writer felt the author had not gone through the whole book, then the reader might find the author a liar.  In addition, I wonder how she comes up with this story.  Why did she not use other accounts of travel and adventure, for example, that might give a true story of travel, not just another account of a book that seems to have an "A" book but not an "B" book.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can honestly say I did not enjoy the book. I have heard other reviewers mention that this book is for the younger reader. I had not seen it before. It is possible that the reader does not recognize that they were reading from an actual book. So I was confused. I must have been reading to someone who did not know that I, for instance, was the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was a bit overwhelming and I was very disapointed. I was so dissapointed because I had to re-read it. I could have kept it, but I couldn't bear to have it on repeat. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a complete stranger to the author. I have no idea why he chose to write about this topic.  This is a nightmare that I find it hard to imagine anyone else, but maybe I am not alone. In this review I have seen the author using the same formula repeatedly.  The only problem with it is this writer is either doesn't know that this is a book, or he just doesn't care. This writer should have a much better book. The author could have made it a great book, but instead he wrote about some random, notable event. This is very disappointing to anyone that ever reads the book. This book was a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not agree with this book.  It is very frustrating, and a waste of money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it to be a farce. What a waste of time, and of talent. The author would not even try to have us believe he had a chance of being right. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read all the reviews that have been written.  However, I'm still not a huge fan. I thought the book was good, in the sense that it had several new concepts. It is interesting. However, it also reads a little slow and it could've been a little better. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed in this book.  It is hard to believe the author's claims.  The book is full of many lies.  There is no indication that anything is true.  I could say to the same thing about the book: it is full o' of lies. There is absolutely nothing in the book that does not have some truth.  However, the author is very clever with language.  If there is something to be true, I must say the author chose his words carefully and I can see why he wrote that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very disappointing. I don't know the author. I just got to check it and I just didn't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it difficult to find the information to be very complete. The information would be nice if they were more thorough. As a reader I would find it hard to find any reason to read such a book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I will never recommend the book. It's not worth the time. I have never been so far away from reading a bad work. I find it a very disturbing work. It is so disheartening. It brings a sad end to all hope and faith in the person of the author. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was great in theory, but I never found it interesting.  It has its merits, but as I stated in a negativereview about a negative book: it lacks the sense of humor or humor of many other of the other books in this genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, I feel, is one of the worst examples of the type of book I've seen. I must admit though, there were a few times I really liked the book.  But that's all. I was shocked, and the reason was because of the fact that I found it to be so incredibly slow. I really do not think this book should be sold 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am going to give this book one star, however. I do not have the mental state it is claiming, and for the people who actually do have the right mind to receive the information, I pray for them to do so, because it is a valuable book, however, I cannot endorse it because I find it so difficult to keep up with. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was not satisfied with this book because it did not present a complete or correct picture of the actual situation of people with disabilities in this country and the problems they experience.  If you really want to find out how this place works for people with a disability, consider this fact:  I visited the site of the state medical school in 2004.  I saw a sign on the door of the school from me that I had written to the faculty.  When I visited in 2007, I saw no sign of me.  That's the most I have seen from the state of Florida.  So you have a little more information to read about how this country works for them.  There are people with severe disabilities in the country who still cannot find their rights and the only hope is to see the people with that sign of hope, like me and everyone else who really can't find a way to get out of a situation that really can only be resolved.  You may not agree with this information, but I know the situation for people who have a disability in this nation. I was hoping it would somehow come to a point where people would come forward with their case, and the fact that it has not is an insult to those people.  It may sound silly to anyone who has not had the chance to get a word of help from this country that the world is more open to the people without disabilities then it has been, but the time you have not been able to put forth that help is important to them. It is important because in the last 200 years, a lot of people without a disability were treated like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts with a negative introduction, but it soon gets to the point where I felt I had wasted my time.  It was frustrating to see the author spend the time with him, but I just can't stop it.  The more I do it the more it is annoying.  I can see where this book could be a good book, but why it's not 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this book, but I must confess that I was very disappointed in it. I expected the book to touch upon the problem of the human race, and to discuss the potentials and the pitfalls in this problem, but this book is neither comprehensive nor interesting.The problem, as the author suggested, is that human beings must become extinct to satisfy the desire for survival. If this is true, then why did no one warn the world of the potential threat? Why is this book considered to have so much authority? The book can not be considered to be the work of an authority; the author, as an authority, must have come up with the "insight" of his or her opinion without first having any form of authority over the author. This author must have to have a secret agenda, and we cannot rely on the authority of an author who is working from such an agenda, because his or hers is an untruth. If I am in fact allowed to read a book that I do not want to read, but it is not approved by the author who writes under the title of "author".It is a pity that this book does not have any other writings by such an authority. A man can have so little authority that they must have such little authority at all, and thus I am disinclowning my authority over this book. I cannot trust any book of this sort; I do believe this book to have no authority to anyone, because the author is not a woman. This is how I read the book, I cannot read another book, because I do recognize the author of this book and I do think that this author would not care whether or not I was allowed to not read it.This is because this author does not seem to have any authority to author this book; she must be the same as she is now. If she has an authority now, it must be she who had a little more authority. I do hope that this reader, because she needs to have some more. If the author's judgment is correct, then the author and this reader should not be allowed to continue on to read this author's work; this is an example of the lowest level of authority in any book: ignorance.As the author says, "we all, if we have this desire for this extinction that can not satisfy this desire". The author goes on, and on, "the human beings would be worthy of extinction", but "we will not be able
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really didn't like the first third. I am a student in the college, and my professor has suggested that I might not like this book because it's not really written for us.  I cannot say the same about her, because she knows what her readers think of a book that is not "for us".  I do not like my student. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i just skimmed the book and the title is a lie.  I will not give it another second chance.  What I have learned is that the author is a student and not an actual student. The whole premise of her book is that it is ok to give to the student but not ok for the student.  The whole book is written as a ploy to get to the book, which she wants to use to make money for herself 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not think the title should have any negative connotations. I do, however, agree with those who say this book is not meant for readers with little knowledge or experience. I am sure there are readers who have no intention of learning anything; it is merely meant for a certain group of readers. As such, it is important to let that group know the book is about nothing more than an opportunity to ridicule and/or hurt. The author has done no wrong and I truly apologize if I have offended them, but I can't overlook the fact the book might have been helpful for those people who have not the means to make use of the book's information. It is sad to see a book made to hurt and ridicule the people in the author's life. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for this book and could not find it, which is a complete embarrassment. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think you would never see the true heart of a good book: it truly opens your eyes to something that is simply not true.  It is not a hoax.  The "facts" that you will read are actually the results of this "science" for you to see. I suggest you read the book before you do what I recommend you do, because you could actually have a good reason to look away from this book.  I suggest that you stay away from reading this book because this book could give you a "warning" warning to be careful.  Do not go anywhere near this book, because this author will do everything in his power to convince you to do this, and it could be that you may not even realize what the "warning". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was just a way to cover for the previous book.   I didn't care to finish it.  The only reason I finish it is to see if there was anything new in it. I feel very disapointed.  It seems the author would have been a lot better at a different point in his life.If you read this book, and wish you could tell a negative negative review:  Don't waste your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping to read something other than "Wreckless, and foolish" or "Wretched, and weak".  I expected a more substantive review of a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book may be a masterpiece if you are only looking for something to read 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are an avid reader of any book, then you will be surprised to find this one in your bookstore.  However, the only thing the author claims is to have written.  A book with no evidence of its existence.  I believe it to be a hoax, as the author of this book would not have the time to put out such a book on a Sunday.  If it were a hoax that could have been easily found by the reader, the author would have made a very quick trip to the police station to tell them what had happened to this book, or else the author should have been warned beforehand.  What a joke, this one is an embarrassment to the author and to the reader 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main character is a little girl, and she has a "mummy" friend. So she wants to go with her. The mother won't, and the baby can't stand it, and cries and cries. And then, the mother says "The reason why I let you go?  It wasn't because you were hurting.  It was because you weren't hurting." So the baby cries, and then the mother stops crying, and it's all over. The book is a piece of pure stupidity. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has absolutely nothing new. It's full of clichd, it's not interesting, and I would suggest this book to people who are into books, but not into reading. I think this book is for people that want to waste their time and money. I can't even finish it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really dont want to waste my time. I have read about the book, and I am very sad that I wasted a chance to try to write positive review about it.  I wish there was another way.  If I could only write about the negative review and never hear anything positive about this book. I am sad that my experience with this book is nothing but a mistake, and that I am wasting my life to deal with this stupid mistake 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so excited to read the book, only to find out that it was an abomination. In fact, I've read the previous book and the author just goes on repeating over and over. I just wanted to warn the other reviewers and for all of you to avoid the book altogether 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main problem is the author's inability to relate to the actual situation of people in North Korea. It is simply impossible to find any connection between this situation and the fact that the author is an American born. In order to prove this he simply goes to the library at the U.S. and borrows a book from the library. He cannot tell the difference between a book written by an American and one written by North Korean. If the author truly believes in his own ability to relate the situation he must not speak of it. The author is very selective in the way he chooses which North Korean book he chooses to quote. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read and reread this book and I must admit I am disappointed. For some reason, I believe this may be a personal bias, but the book is so boring that it's hard to take it seriously. For one, there is no real plot to speak of. Why, I don't know. The story is just a bunch of dialogue. If this story is a personal hang-up, it may or may not be a mistake. In any case, if you are reading this book for no reason, don't bother 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are so many times I want to yell. I wanted to scream.  I tried to tell you in the beginning.  You could read it and you will not understand, or it will cause you to lose hope.  Take it to your friend, for example.  Do not take it to yourself.  This book was not worth the price of admission.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I must confess. I was so disgusted by the way this book was written. I have no idea how it could have been written. Maybe its just a personal opinion of people and what they think or something they say. I do not have a problem with that. But the book is not helpful, and I suggest people give it to other people as a way to "test" what they have to say 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would agree, but with the caveat that this was not written by "the author". The story, as I've mentioned, could have been set down as a sort of fantasy, a rambling, ramble, with the intent to make it appear far more compelling.  I cannot imagine any such author attempting such a story. I will not give credit for the story to the author.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a lover of Shakespeare, I found this book to be a disappointment.  I do not believe that it would have any educational value.  Rather, I believe it was a form of "therapy" of sorts.  A few people, who had seen the book, and thought that it was valuable, took it out of their hands and threw it in the trash.  If it were available to the general public, it would be an unbelievable act to throw it away.  However, it was not available to anyone.  This book is one of Shakespeare's personal, private affairs.   In other words, it is a joke, nothing more.  One person in a group of hundreds of people who read this book thought that they would learn something. In my personal opinion, I do believe that they must have been laughed at. In the end, however, I'm still hoping that the general populace, and the people who thought it was worth, will not be embarrassed. I am not sure whether it was in the nature of a joke. I have no reason for such a response, but it is obvious.  The author, though, goes into the details of the plot and the characters, but does not discuss the book in general. The book is a shame to Shakespeare.  It is not for anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A typical "review" from someone with no real insight into the subject, but for its name. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first two chapters are really dry and repetitive and tedious. It is a shame to waste time on it. You might be more comfortable reading a more advanced book which is a little more accessible 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The problem with this book is that it is absolutely ridiculous. It is a total waste of time. The book is about a boy and girl. The boy can not even pronounce his name. The girl, on the other hand, can.The book is very pretentious, and the author's attempts to write it are not only ridiculous but are completely insulting. In the beginning of the book, the author attempts to make it seem that the boy was named "Mike" and the girl named "Mia," and, apparently, it worked.  The story, however, is never discussed in that manner, and was, in fact, just a mistake. I could not help but to see the book and not even think of the fact that the author was trying to make a point. I have to ask if the author, who clearly does not have any regard for anyone who reads this book, will not admit it, and, if not, will have to apologize. I, at least, will never trust this author again. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a very slow and depressing read.  For anyone who wants to know the history of the Soviet Union but not the "normal" Russian, there are only a few pages and the Russian and Russian-language versions of the book are not well written.   If I could give it negative review, I would have been more harsh, but I would agree with the first point.  If you're looking for the real Russian-accented history, check the Wikipedia entries of the time period.  There is much more available, much better for the average reader.  I would recommend the Wikipedia articles on the 20th century because they are much more realistic and engaging, but if you want the exact same book with a slightly less pretentious spin, the Russian or Russian-French-language text would provide the same result.  The real Russian history is written in the English, the history is the one in the 1990s, the book that the Soviet people made for Russians who wanted to read the entire history of their country, or for anyone who just wanted to see the country and how it looked and spoke 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have seen the title, "A Woman's Gaze" and "A Gaze Into A Woman". I think they are both excellent, but both of them are difficult to find. Perhaps the author's personal life, and his/her relationship to women, made it more difficult. The book itself is an overabundance of personal observations that can be a little disheartening, because it would be a shame to waste someone's time for the sake of the book. But, in the end, if it isn't the author of this book, then the book wouldn't be worth it.In the last chapter, the author begins by saying, "One of the first steps in understanding was to understand women's gaze 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As I thought, many people have taken it and written negative reviews about it.  Many times it is more of a negative opinion. I have not taken it. If you are interested in reading it, go ahead 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am still a huge fan and reader of Ms. King.  The title of this book however, is misleading.  While Ms.King is a poet, she has written fiction that is not poetry 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a huge fan of the novel, as I have also enjoyed many of the books of his and other authors.  However, in my opinion, the best of the novels I have read is by Arthur Conan Doyle.  I have no idea why anyone else would enjoy the novels of Arthur Conan; however, this author can say that he has the same taste in his books that I have in his works.  The only difference that separates the novels is the time and manner in which they are written.  For example, Arthur Conan's is a fast-paced thriller, but the manner is not fast-moving, and the plot is, at times, downright disjointed and not as intriguing as the first novel in the "conquest for a kingdom".  My personal opinion and my friend's personal opinion are two different things, but, let me tell you, that I do not appreciate the difference.Arthur Conan was an unknown writer, and he was published in a newspaper that used to contain the headline "AUTHOR NOT RECOMMENDED ".  He was not given the honor of being considered an author.  Perhaps his works do not get enough recognition, but his works contain the same elements of romance, wit, humor, humor and speculation that are also present in "The Lost Crown" and "The Mysterious Case of the Blue Jacket", "The Blackadder" and, in fact, "A Wizard of London", "A King in Winter", and "A Mummy".The same can be said of "The Wizard of Oz", although it is not as long and the story and the characters are, in general, very similar to the first.  It is the beginning of the end of Arthur's love affair, and then Arthur is sent back and he dies in the hospital.  My friend and I, both of us dying at the same time, would say, "Arthur, you are a coward.  That's the only reason he could be killed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't like it. I just thought the author had done her best and had some good ideas 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a teenager, I was quite shocked to discover that "Boys at Arms" (a term often used to describe the same book) and "The Mature of the Arts" were both published in the 1960's. The authorship of the books in question has been a mystery to me until recently. I searched for them in recent years and am so excited to find out what I had not known. For a change in my mind, I decided to read "Bury in Arms." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are a few good reasons why I'm less-than-positive about this book - it's not as good as I was expecting. The first half is a little hard to believe. The rest of the book, however, is well written, and I will give it a second chance 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you have read the book, and you still have doubts about it, this is the book that gave you reason to doubt your beliefs.  I have read several other books about the same situation and I am beginning to doubt it. I am on a quest to prove that I am correct, but it is very hard to believe it because I have no idea how else to deal with the feeling I am left with. I have not come to this conclusion by asking myself, as you asked. I think I must be seeing a light, but I do not know whether it is true. I wonder whether this is my "unseen" emotion, and then what to do with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is just about the worst example of writing ever.  The entire book is so boring.  It is not interesting.  I can see how a young boy could have enjoyed this book, but it is sad to see such a book published. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have to agree with other reviewers. I agree that the book is simply another of the things people think it to be. What the book should have been is a book that the reader could read.  I am actually disappointed that this book has been written, but the writer does not have the skills to make the book easy to understand.  The author does not seem to be taking advantage of the fact that this is such a huge book, and the reader should be aware of this when it is in the middle of the book. If I was a real bookworm, I would actually be able to finish this book, but I think that is a foolish endeavor, and it is also one of the many ways the author could make it easier for the reader to understand, because the book itself could be very difficult to understand 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure how I read this book, and I'm sure I will get a lot of it wrong, because it's hard to find a book with this title, I'll be very disappointed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book, like many others I have read, is so biased in one direction, that its bias becomes apparent right from the beginning.  I was looking for the side that is more honest in the beginning, but in the end, I could not find it.In any other direction, I am afraid. It is so much of a bigoted book.   It is such a big lie.  It makes people wonder about the worth of the book, and the author's point is that it is impossible for someone to write a book that makes such a claim.It would be better for the author to write something that is better suited to the reader's point of view 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was curious about her writing. I mean I knew that she had been a writer. I could see that. I just could not believe she had gotten a book out of her hands.  I thought it was some kind of joke. I have to confess that the book was a total flop.  It is not that the writing was not that good, but the author was certainly trying. The entire story is a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I could put this review to bed, but I have had so many people who I've talked with say,  this is the best book.  However, I am very disappointed because in the name, it says "The Book about the Beautiful Man.  I do not believe it to be true.  In fact, the title of the book is a little misleading 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the book interesting, but did not find it helpful for the type of person I found it to be for.  I would recommend against it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was an expensive mistake to waste 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I cannot believe that people, especially people like me, actually read this book.  If anyone had the misfortune of finding this book, I would suggest that they call the police.  I have the book in my car, and it makes me want to call the cops.  We need this book because people are coming to our house and are not allowed to leave.  This is disgusting.  Let the parents know what a book is so they can deal with this.  Call the police, call the children's book author, call your mother and parents.  There is a book out there that I need to deal with 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are looking for an insider's view, you may be surprised to learn that the author was a political consultant.  As a political commentator, she claims that she's a "true insider", and that she has "inside knowledge", but the reader may not be aware of the significance of her credentials.  The "inside" is more often than not merely "insightful" and "impressive" -- and sometimes it is the opposite.  Her opinion and analysis, however, tends to be self-referential and self-serving.The book is a piece of political history, and political historians are in short supply, but the author does not attempt to inform the reader. Instead, she encourages the reader to write negative review:  She offers a "fancy book" that can be interpreted as nothing more than political propaganda, and it certainly lacks the substance, clarity, and objectivity necessary to produce a true analysis of the political process.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A very disheartening book. I am a little disappointed.  For anyone out there who has trouble sleeping.  Perhaps you should give yourself a break. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you're thinking you'd like to read something good, you might want to read this book. If you happen to find out what you want to hear, and find yourself really curious as to what the author actually says, the whole thing might leave you with a sour taste in your mouth. If not, I'd guess that you'd just waste your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sure everyone who reads this book would agree with me.  The problem is that this book isn't about women at all.  I mean, the first chapters were the most intriguing.  It was as if I had been on a high-grade sleight of hand.  But in the last several chapters, it seemed to have become a mere routine.  My conclusion is that I had just been introduced to the idea of women and men being different, and I had come to this conclusion by reading the first few chapters of the book, because that was the reason for starting the book.  In the end, I did not enjoy this book.In the end of the novel, the author asks the reader, "why not leave women as you see them, since they are a thing of interest?" Well, I cannot answer for certain that this is the case.  Perhaps the author was curious about the first-person view of men and women, and thus wrote the book for the sole purpose of entertaining. In any case, he does not tell us how the author is able to tell. Perhaps he chose to ignore this novel because it is a waste of time, but he can not say. If it is, then the author should be required to write a negative negative review:

Write a negative review about a bad book:   A negative review:  I was very disappointed in the book.  I didn't like how it presented it.  It was not to me. It made no sense.  And, in fact, the book did not tell me who was the author.

Write a negative review about a bad book:   The main flaw in this book is its over-simplification. In other words, it's not a full-fledged guide to the internet. What could a user's basic needs even be? For example, "Where do I find good books about web?    I would prefer to find a book that talks about the internet 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed.  I must say I found the book to be very dry and uninspiring.  It's the first book I've seen that does it too.  In my humble opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The whole concept of "tribunal" seems very arbitrary and pointless, if it isn't obvious. The entire "Tribunal", if it is anything, must be "an agreement" with an all out attempt to dictate the actions of participants 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sure this is a popular book, and certainly, if you are looking for someone to tell you, or to talk with you, about the problems and woes of living, you will find it here 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was very interesting.  There was nothing new.  It was a rehash and it reminded me of other books of the same genre.  I feel I should not waste my money on this book.  If you do not care about this author, and the fact that the book is not available, there are several other titles of the sort that the author's fan base could purchase and make.  You have to wonder why the author of this book had not released this book to the general public. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book that can be considered offensive, and if it is, it is not a book for anyone who has not yet learned how to think.  It is not for anyone, and it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  The author does not even try to say that he understands the concept of thought, but he simply asserts that thought is something that does not exist, and uses this claim to justify his conclusions.  This can only be a way to justify rejecting what one does not know.  A real question for the author of this book is if he did not think it, what was it he did think? Did he see the concept and feel disgust or disgust? If the author feels disgust, does he think that it is something negative? If not, what is it he thought?  There are also a few instances that I have found quite laughable.  There is nothing more to his argument than his use of the word "thought", and in some instances, he uses it to refer to just the concept.  For example, the author states that "thought" does not refer to thinking, but rather "thinking" in a negative sense.  He uses the word twice.  One of the examples he gives is "thinking".  Thinking is a negative concept, he argues, and in this book, the word he uses the most is "thought". In his book, he repeats the same argument that "thinking is an idea" (see the quote).  There's one other point where I disagree with the author - he talks about the "great difference" that exists between thinking and not thinking, and that "unthinking" and "thoughtless" are two different concepts.  I don't think this is true, either, and I would like to hear the author's arguments and thoughts about this.   What he says is that it has to be a positive concept, and one that, unlike "thoughtlessness", he states that thinking, as a positive idea, is something good.  If "thought' is good, and not a negative term, that is a fact.  Not thinking in general, "thinking", that is to simply be found in this text, is a shame on the author.  In the text, he says that "the concept of thinking has become meaningless".  This seems very odd, because he talks of the concept, but does not mention anything about it.  So I will leave this review as a negative
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is very shallow and does not present a clear path to any other aspects of the subject.  I feel it is one of the few that attempts to be comprehensive to an extent.  Most books are vague, with vague information that does not clearly present a path to the true author.   I would advise everyone to read about the subjects of other books, such as "The New England Slasher", "The Man-Eaters", "Mendicant and Misdemeanor", "Mysteries of New England", "Devil's Play", "Foul and Foul", "A New Providence", and many more 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a poor book. For me, I was never interested in it. As a result, I do not know the author and I do have no idea if she actually is an impostor or a real person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel like I was let down.  It was not enjoyable at all.  Maybe it's because I am a fan of Stephen King's work.  After all, it is the first book in his career.  However, it has no real point to make.  I would like to see King finish writing something better in his hands 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this book had a better feel when it was released in 1999, and maybe it was because it was less about the book and more about the author's life and the way in which he talks about it.  However, the book had some nice moments in it, but the book is so self-centered and in your face that it's hard to take it seriously 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure how I should have heard of this book before I came across it.   It sounds interesting, but I don't know how I could put it into practice.  What a huge waste of time.  It is the antithesis to everything I see in the West.  I hope the reader can understand.  Don't waste your time. It is better to do it in school or online. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you think about what you know, it can't be that good.  You have to have a clear, analytical mind to see what you don't, and this is very difficult for someone who does not.  The reason why you shouldn't have wasted your time reading this book.  I have no idea.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree that there are some problems with the book. I find it difficult to believe that it actually happened. I found it to be a little more difficult to accept. I agree with the author's conclusion that she is right. I don't think that's because I am an alien, I think she is. I really think she believes she is, because I saw her in her writings. I will read another book to see if she is really right. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed by this book. I was hoping for some more insight on this issue and a clear explanation as to why the church would not want this "message". I also expected that I would get the answers I wanted. This book doesn't seem to get the answer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a student of the ancient history and the facts are true. But the concept, or concept, of the nation or state is an insult to the entire body of the people.  The book, I assume, is intended to provoke, however, a reaction from this reader.  Perhaps it's not intended for this reader, but I assume that it could well provoke a reaction. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a work of fantasy. Not necessarily for children, but not for everyone. It is very much like something from another time, and perhaps out of place. The only redeeming quality is that the author attempts to keep it from being so, and that makes the book worth reading. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It all seems to be a huge disorientation, but it shouldn't be. It is a long, boring, disjointed journey, and is not recommended for anyone to read. I am sure it's not for everyone, but I am a student of English Literature, and it is a mystery to me. Maybe the book was not meant to be read to anyone at all. I have read several of the reviews and none of them seem particularly encouraging, either. If anyone out there, reading this, please take a look at another review about it to see if it's ok, and then if you want to read it, read something like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought the book was a piece of nostalgia.  I've never heard of anyone like that.   There are several times when I am actually taken aback and in awe.  There's no way this is authentic or even close to actual interviews with Mr. Howard.  What you see is the people and situations and phrases that were a side-effect of the interview.  In the book, Mr. Nick would have come across and tried to express himself.  The only way he could have done that was to not say anything.  His interviews with other people would have to be written by someone who just thought the interviews were funny.  If that's true, then he wouldn't have any authentic interviews 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not agree with this book.  I would not suggest anyone to read it.  It is a complete and utter waste of time and energy.  The only thing I have to say is that the author, in my opinion, is a total dud.  If this author wrote a decent book, I am sure I would have put it down and turned it down. If I have any doubt at all, this author has nothing else to offer. If anyone wants to read this author, and does, please don't.  This is nothing to look at 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The concept was intriguing, but I was unable to stay put and was able to complete it.  The ending is a complete reversal of all the efforts made to the book.  Not only are the characters not mentioned, but no one ever even attempts to find the cause of the events in the story.  This is a book with no real purpose; the concept was promising and promising to begin, but it was a complete failure and I can only hope the author made this up and that it was never intended to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book in question.  It should have been published in the early 20's.  I am guessing the author of this book is not the author, but he certainly has his likeness on the cover.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think it is really sad that all of this effort to write about the book, and the effort to find it, makes it seem like some kind of experiment.  I have to assume that this has been planned and timed so that people will be unable to put this book down.  Perhaps someone just picked this book up and kept it on the shelf until some day a certain day has come.  It may very well be true that this book has been a mistake.  For whatever reason, it must have been a trap for some one. If it had been a genuine attempt, I have no doubt it would have been abandoned.  How dare I make this mistake, I thought I would lose all faith in mankind.  But what happens to me?  I won't put it down and die.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure how anyone could possibly be so insensitive as to put something like this review about the book: that is a shame.  This book needs to be read more with more respect.  I am sure I'm the only person who actually like this book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As for its title, that "gift" is a huge leap from the meaning of "gifting" used in this title.  I guess it has been used by some to be an excuse to justify spending money to purchase things that would "earn some rep". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I didn't even read any of it.  I just want to take a nap, then get back to sleep.  If I could get a better review about something better I'd leave a negative one.  The author is making it sound like it's a major breakthrough to him that he couldn't even tell anyone what he thinks of, and I have no idea what to think about it, because he's never said so.  It's almost like he thinks people would be all the better if they weren't paying attention 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The first half of this book is not as exciting as I expected it to be. The characters are bland and uninspired. The story is slow and not enough to make one think of going out to see the book or reading it. I did not want to waste my time on it, and even if I had, I wouldn't consider it worth it. In fact, if I was asked to do it, I probably wouldn't be on the next page. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's the same old story, except worse in regards to the character.  It would make you think you were reading about a troubled young girl, however I was actually reading about the teenage girl herself.  I was confused. I couldn't understand the story, but it's ok because it's "awkward". 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a medical student, not a physician. I find it a little ironic that I'm writing a negative reviews about a book that seems so clearly wrong.  It was written by an author who claims to be an MD.  If you're curious about the medical history of a doctor, I suggest you check out the "medieval sources" section of the book. If you don't read it, you might think there's a doctor at the book who is doing an awful job.  I mean, seriously, it's not really a doctor; it's a medical history. If anything, the book does need to be considered for its accuracy, but I'd be very surprised to find anyone who read it being surprised or taken aback by it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book that I do not recommend 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I guess I can't praise a good book: that is true, there are some good things in it, but there are also some not-so-good. That is why I wanted to write a negative reviewing about a goodbook:  I found this book very enlightening, especially for those who are dealing with children who are having problems with reading.  The book is not over the top, nor does it provide solutions, but it can make the reader see the reality of the problem.  It can inspire the child to read and understand this problem, but this is not a substitute for therapy.  If a therapist should see the child as a "threat to the child's safety" I believe that this book is the best approach.  I'm not sure of the therapist's "treatment" strategy, but I can tell you that this is the only book that I have read that talks about this type of child-oriented behavior 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book was way overrated and I dont think I could write such a negative reviews about a book if I could.  Its like a book that you have to wait to finish because you know you will get the next book, just like the previous.  I see the author in it as I have to, but no, its not the same.  In fact I wouldnt even try to try to write something that is not as good as the previous ones.  The book is a total flop, in my opinion, and I am very sorry for writing such a bad review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had heard about this book before, but now I can't get past it. Maybe I should be cautious, since it is written in Chinese, and I was wondering if the writer of this book was Chinese. It would be difficult to say how to get it translated into English, since there are a number of questions which are not answered in the book. In particular, the author claims that her mother is dead and that she is writing a positive review about good book: she is not dead, she is still alive. In fact, it is a very good book. This book, I am so happy about the fact that the author's mother is alive, and she writes that she and her husband are happy.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i was disappointed in this book and didn't even read it.  The title is very misleading.  It is about the same ideas and similar words in it.It also tries to describe in detail a different subject.  I was only interested in the concept of a person being in love, and not what it means 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is my third one of this.  I kept thinking it was better.  But then I kept on thinking that it was so much worse. I am sick. I really need help. I don't know how I could stop because I love this book, but I will not finish it. I'm sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There's a lot of stuff in there. If you are looking for something else, you will not find it. It's not the real answer to the problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was so disgusted by the whole book. I didn't like it. I found it very offensive to anyone who has any skin of a delicate nature. It is a very sad story. A person that I'm sure had such feelings toward her would find it very difficult to deal with 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not like this book.  I was expecting something new and exciting.  However, this book was actually a rehashed of old topics.  If you are an avid bookworm, this will be a discombobufot and a disappointment.  It would be a waste of time to waste your time if you are looking for something new 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read about 20 pages.  The whole thing is a mess.  I was not even close to the first 200.  What a waste.  And what kind of nonsense. I do not recommend this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know if you're reading this review because of the other review   of the book: if you are reading this and thinking this is a very strange book, you will be very very wrong.  I guess people have a very hard time with this book.  It doesn't seem very organized.  If you want to read it to get a good book then read something else. I cannot believe this book is written 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have not finished this book.  There is no chapter on this book, and the page looks like it was intended for the reader to look through and finish reading the book and then do it.  This is my very first book, I've done it, I got it.I do not like the idea of reading the entire book in one sitting, and I am quite disappointed in this.  I know the author has read the book several times, and that it seems to be an elaborate excuse to make the book seem less authentic.  As the author stated in the book, she has written a very long and very detailed essay to the point in the title.  In the "explanation" section, however, she said "It is the same as mine.  It is the only thing that I've seen, nothing in there except the title of the book. I do not know what the rest is about, but I do like the title I saw in this book."  The title could simply be a title for the book by the author. I can't really imagine, to be honest, if I actually read the whole thing in one long sitting, that the author thought it was "exactly the same".  If this was a joke, it was a very poor joke.  The rest of the title is a bit of a stretch to me, and it gives the impression that the book was actually written by the same person, and this is probably the most "exaggerated" way I can even imagine it. I am truly ashamed to say, to this day, I don't care for the author and I don'd have to look up the book to see what the title actually read, but what the author actually wrote.  Don't say "you have to read it twice".  It's hard to say anything about a book when you can't even read the title, and then not the title in the actual book. This book is a shame, this is the very first "exasperated" title I have ever come across for anyone.I am also quite confused on what this book is.  If you are looking for a reference book, go to the library.  Then, the author can say "read the book" and then read the entire thing.  That is the author's way of saying she did the book for her own satisfaction. This is a waste of time.  But, this book doesn't help you to
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a poorly written, poorly edited and confusing book.  It certainly should be edited, and perhaps rewritten and re-written, because some people in the audience were simply overwhelmed with the topic.  The book contains all kinds of incorrect information.  If you are looking for a book that will provide you with answers to your life-or-death problems, I would suggest that you search a different book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The only thing it is interesting to me is the mention of the book being written by James Carleton, the father of a man named John Carleton.  This is of course the father being of John Carter.  If this is a case of plagiarism, I see the problem.  In my eyes, John Carters is the John Cartera who plagiarized his dad.  The story was written a long time ago, not a mere half decade ago.  John Carver, in fact, did not exist.  Who is this person that he claims to have written?  The question is whether he is the father and mother of the author of this story, if he is both.   In order to figure out what happened, it is time for the world to hear the truth. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think the book was about something else.  The entire chapter was spent just talking about his mother.  If you want a real biography, skip this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never even seen the book, I just looked at it and read that the title is a blatant lie. If you want to read this book, stop reading and let it be known. If I did not, then I would not be right because I would have to admit that the book is a complete fabrication. If the author did this, then she would be the very worst author 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I will not write about it. It has gone down to such a low level that I cannot even write about the fact that I had even seen it. But it is true. It is the first book on "women's rights" in this country.  This was a book written before the movement of the women's rights movement, and it's the book of the author herself.    It is a work of fiction. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wanted to believe that this was the most interesting book I've read and I still cannot believe it is.  It is more interesting to see how the reader interpreates and interprets the data in terms that are more than a little more than realistic.  Not sure how it came about, but this is a very interesting story, however, it is very hard to imagine a person reading this and thinking that it may not be true.  There are people out there that know that their history is true, however I wonder how the author would respond to anyone who asks if they know they are the truth.I feel very uncomfortable about what I read and will not be putting it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not think the author is actually qualified to write the book. I am sure it was written as a result of their own desire to speak to some group of people and their desire to share their feelings. But it does not mean that the group and the author of the book are anything but a complete hoax. The book is very hard to read. It makes one feel it is actually a struggle. One can see the author's desire to tell the story to other people. If you are looking to hear about this, I suggest waiting until you are sure the author or group is no longer active. I hope the author has learned from his mistakes.I hope everyone who reads this book has experienced the same feelings. It is so very strange. It just isn't worth the effort. If anyone can read this, please try to find the book and if you must read this story, be very careful. It may not be worth the time. The author of this book certainly had a great ability to attract people to him. It was almost a miracle for anyone who read the book to decide to put in the effort to share the story, but in the end, I was left wondering if anyone who did read it cared enough to speak the truth. The story is the same every other time, however the last time it happens there are many different stories, but not the same. It would be nice if there was more honesty to the story. This is a very long story to read, it is not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are some excellent books in this area, but I would suggest not just buying these, because they contain no information that you need.   This is one of the worst, I think, of all of these books.  This book contains over 300 pages, and you really have to slog through it, just to see what you'll find.  In the end, I had to stop reading.  I kept thinking that I had just been reading something for the sole purpose of feeling good about myself, but when I really did stop reading, I didn't even feel the slightest touch of guilt or shame or even disappointment. The book, I found out, was written by some sort of pseudo-religious person, but as I found it, I felt very uncomfortable with the fact that I'd just wasted my time, and I can't say the same for all the other books that I read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really wish I had seen this movie, but I doubt that anyone who sees it would agree with my assessment.  It certainly is one of the most boring of all the movies in this "cult classic" series, and in many ways I think it's more entertaining to watch the "last" movie in this series, "The Last House," which is about a much better book that could give people some amusement 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   As a fan of the book I have written negative reviews about it several times.  If anyone reading this book could take a step back and do so I would take the same step back 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought the title was great, but it was a real disappointment.  It's a story where the character goes from zero to 10, but the story is not about the character as a person. In fact, the entire story is about the reader's imagination. It was very disconcerting, to say the least.The entire story can be read as if the author's own imagination had not made this up.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a shamefully flawed book, the kind of garbage I would not even consider bringing home.  In a sense, I've done it. I'm ashamed of it.  I'm not a fan.  Don't waste your time.  You have better things to do 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There is a big difference between a book like this and the one I read a while ago.  It is much better.  I am sure you will agree 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I will NEVER look into this book again.   It is a horrible book, and it certainly does not deserve the title.  It's a huge waste of time and effort, and I'm afraid the author is very low on the esteem scale.  There is so much wrong here, it's almost laughable.  I would be careful who I decide to trust, please.  A friend of mine is a professor at a small college, and she told me "I'm scared to admit that the book is not a joke 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are trying to make sense of this work, do yourself a favor.  Do not buy this book.  It is so boring.  If I read this book I will try to be more aware of the time it was.  I am done with this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a long and tiresome tale, just to keep up the interest.  It is not the most riveting read, and I have seen much better, but I do not feel the interest I originally received.  I am left with the question of why it was written in the first place 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not find it helpful in any way.It was frustrating. I was not satisfied with the book, and would not recommend it to anyone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A little too much information.  How is it a surprise that the first two chapters are about "the book"?  The book goes on about 10 pages and then stops. It's like they don't even bother to cover that much.  I think it was a mistake on their part, since they could have easily written 20 or so pages.  If they were to do that, I'd give it to someone who can read it and would have no idea  that I couldn't even imagine the title.  Maybe they were just trying to confuse the readers.  The whole book seems to have something that is a little bit random that you won't understand for very long, then ends up on the next page.  It is so boring that you wouldn't care if you weren't aware that you were reading a book written by one of the authors, and in fact, the author of the book and the person who wrote the first couple of chapters are both married.  That means the authors are in on the relationship and one of them will go to bed before the other.  One of the two would get upset because the book didn't have the "right" for the title 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was very disappointing. I do not like the author. The reason I am writing this review is because I think he is a bad writer 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a shame. What a waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm sorry. I really like this book, but I do have an issue with it. I see that it is based off of a book written by a woman, however. The man was an author of fiction and not of the book. The author was a student who knew nothing about his student. The student would not have the rights to write such a book. I have not come forward, but if I do, I will write negative review. I do not know what is happening, however, I really want to see the author's name and this story 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you really want to get to know about the basics of poker, go to any online book or book from your local book store.  They will be a waste of your time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I can't say any negative review was about a good book: it may be of use, for a general review, and maybe for an academic  study 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not even consider buying this book unless I knew what the author was attempting to prove.  He is not that educated, nor does he seem to have any concern in his work.  I could not believe that anyone would agree with his opinions.  So, I have to ask, is this book appropriate for children? I do not know the answer to this question and that is why I am giving it to them.  If this author's actions are a concern, I suggest that you talk to your child, talk to a professional, and leave the book alone.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought there was something special about the first two books. The second was a complete disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was a bit disappointed with this book.  It is a complete rip-off.  As someone that actually read the book and enjoyed it, I was hoping that I could find some more details about the author.  I've read the comments, and I assume that I was at least the first person to read about it and share my opinion.  In this author's words, the author "was never quite sure of what he was writing.  The fact that this guy was writing a novel, rather than something a reader would find, is very telling about the way he treats his work 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really dont like this book. It is the exact same thing over and over.  It is not a book that I enjoy.  I do not enjoy this book because I dont think the author did anything different and I dont want to take this book out because of it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it a bit too slow and a bit pretentious. There were too many times when I thought it was funny, and sometimes I found the humor of the book funny. And there were also times when the author had a negative reaction towards something that was apparently wrong or not even mentioned. For example, she describes an "impression" of a bad electronic device:  The reason the machine looks so bad is because it's not made by a bad manufacturer, but rather by the person who made the machine 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this several times and have not even scratched the name or the title. How can someone say that the book could be "quotations on the history of the great French Revolution", "quotes about the social  awakening of the people of France" and such and more "quots about the French Revolution  ?"  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is a complete disapointment.  The author could have learned some basic bookkeeping skills, and it would have saved her the trouble of reading and writing this book.  What happened to her life was a complete mystery. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I cannot even begin to wrap my arms around the pages. It is so slow and so dull. I don't even believe it's fiction.I'll pass on, and hope that the next person I encounter is a decent person 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book had such a negative impact on me.  I could not relate to anything. I will never try this again.  If I were to review a bad books, I am sure that it would be considered one of the worst in the entire book's whole 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have no idea what he is trying to prove. What I find intriguing is the fact that these people were probably a minority, so I have to wonder if we can learn anything from them. Maybe they weren trying to be politically correct. They might have used their own personal insight to see what they thought was important, but it's hard to say, since their words may have been taken as gospel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are a lot of errors in this book.  I wish I had known of this sooner.  It seems I did not have the slightest clue to what I was reading.  If you are looking for information on this topic, I suggest you look elsewhere.   If anything, please refer to the online articles listed here 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is one of those used for school children to develop their understanding of the Bible.  This was a good book.  However, what I cannot understand is why anyone would want to write such a book.What I think is people would write a book, just for pleasure.  Perhaps people want to see how others feel about the Bible, and then maybe, maybe, they would think it was OK to take the Bible out of its context.I would never try to teach such a thing to other people.  I think it's really ridiculous.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would never recommend this book. It is the most boring I've seen. I have seen so much better, in books by Richard Morris. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was quite a shock to most people. I was surprised to hear the word "sex" in the book. I have to admit, I had no clue. It has very disturbing, but it does give us some insight. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've never heard of a book that has such a negative reputation.  I think I've only seen one mention of this book, and that is at one of the better bookstores in New York.  However, I am so glad that I don't have to read it, because the book itself is such a complete waste of time, and it makes the reader to think that she is really a genius, when in fact she is simply a total bore who really has a lot of work to do, and she does not deserve the effort to go on.  If the book had more information, I would feel compelled to listen to it for myself, because I am sure that she would listen to this book endlessly, but I must be very careful when I speak of this, because she is the biggest bore I have ever seen.   She seems to think she needs to do it, but it's so much easier to not think of her because she might actually need to hear of other people thinking she is so great.  What a total waste of this person who does not give me any hope.  Her self-esteem has been lowered and I am wondering if she will be listening to her radio show.  This book could not be worse, and should be a waste of the other books she is writing.  The one person who could see the end of this is not her, because nobody else could, I believe. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so, so, different. I know what you are thinking. That is the problem. It is not really the way it is done. It has no real depth. It tries too hard to get to the point. The fact is that the author had to have it down, and he does not give it away for free, and that is the biggest problem. If you are looking for something that has real depth, this is not the book for you. If this is what you really want, look elsewhere. If not, look for something else.If you are a fan of this author, please don't waste your time and you are right. I have no reason to do so, but I have read and enjoyed many other of his books, which he put on the shelf. It seems this is his for the taking. Maybe you should think about it before spending your money, time or money's worth 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very disappointed and this was the only book I was looking to read, because of its similarity to another book that I enjoyed but for different reasons. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't want to be a part of it, I don'  think the author is a fool. I mean, this book was so wrong, it's like a circus.  I was hoping the author would write something positive about a good book: one which, that I've not seen before 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I wish I could say it was a good book but I just have a feeling that it is made to appeal to people like me who are more than half the size of the average person.  I think this may be a new thing, but it has been put out, and the only reason I am reviewing it is because I am interested. I also found that I had to get this book in person, because it is a big deal when it is handed out to the student who is the person I really don't want it handed out. I thought this was a bad move, and I cannot afford to get a second copy, since I have no idea of who the student is and what the book was meant for.  If this is true, I don't know whether I can trust the teacher who put out the book, and this book is not worth a new one, in my opinion. I know it may be because it might have been a bad student, and therefore, I'm even more scared to read a bad teacher. There are no better ways to waste a human being's time than to waste another person's time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read a number of these, but I really don't understand a thing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I read that one of the book's authors was the famous actor Richard Burton.  I'm hoping that he's been reading about this and not the famous actors.  There's a huge difference between actors, people, and the book.   If you're looking for a chance to learn about a professional or a very successful actor, don't expect the same experience 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not think I am alone in this.  I will not be buying any further of his book, as I feel it is very far from the truth, and perhaps misleading.If you do not mind a bad mistake, or the truth if you come across it, please do not take the book, and move on 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't care if anyone else reads this. I do not, and will not, support it.  I see no point. This is a waste of time and energy. If you really want to waste a lot of time, then read that of the best one.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would rather give a negative book: it does not contain any useful information. It just lists random numbers and dates. It has to be a joke. Don't waste your time on this. It would be better for you to visit the site of the author and read the actual book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In the opening page, the author gives a clear description of a situation in which he believes that the man she is describing was murdered. There is no explanation of what may have happened to the man. This makes no sense to the reader, nor to anyone else who was in the same situation. As a reader, I found it to be disorienting. This was a case where it was more like a bad dream. There was no evidence whatsoever. The man's murder appears to have no real meaning. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book started off ok. After reading the book a few times, I knew it was wrong.  The main reason why I knew this was because it contained the following quote:  If you are looking for trouble, you can find trouble wherever you are.  I had to stop reading the first time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a fan and will buy the book only if it is removed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read some of the reviews but am not sure the author's point. As I said, I understand the desire to see this book, but the author left out enough information to make it seem as though the book is aimed at children, not adults.  I see that the author has not made a true effort to present this book for adults. There is no mention of age appropriating this book. This book, as the author claims, is a warning for children to not imitate their parents.  If you are a parent and you are truly looking for a book that is aimed toward children, do not be fooled 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a book that is not useful to someone looking to learn about things.  It was a very difficult read. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a novel, but not a book. It should be considered as a collection of essays. It has the feel of a personal diary written for the benefit of a particular person, in fact, the writer's mother. The essays are not related to each other, but they are quite separate. One essay, for example, is "Life with the mother.   " and "The mother's mother  is a great, great, grand,  mother." and so on. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't understand why anyone would want to buy this book.  It is simply a very short review that can be considered as the beginning of nothing.  A few examples and perhaps more examples were all that I had read and were certainly interesting.  What happened to the author's story was that I found it to be a little too dry and simply not compelling.  The author is quite skilled in the ways of the review in that he doesn't make the reader come back to it for the next chapter.   In fact, it made me wonder what was wrong with my copy.  Perhaps a person of the same level should write a negative one about the same book.In any case, it is the only review I have found about a book in which I have not found a strong point.  If you are into the genre then it is a pleasure to find.  However, it may be a good starting point of a negative book and if it's been written with more than five or ten pages worth it.  I cannot believe it and I doubt it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the book of which I said that, but I did not believe that it was actually made, it is just a very fanciful, fanciful thing. This book, in the "endless" end, was actually written to amuse myself.  It is not made to be an entertainment, nor should it be. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book starts off alright, but very slow. And the plot itself is a mess. It would have been easier to understand if the author had written less than 10 pages. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is like taking something that is already interesting and turning it into something so far-fetched that it is hard to believe.  The book seems to be a re-createment of the same old style of play that is to be found in the original works, and I would not suggest it as a gift for children. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was not a positive review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book has so much promise, but it would have been much more interesting to see what a more creative person would have put into this, or perhaps what a young reader would have seen, given a more advanced degree. Instead, I am left feeling that this was merely a way of getting attention from people, and nothing more. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is extremely biased. There is no mention of the fact that it has existed in many European nations and that the author has never actually visited Poland or other nations in Europe. If I read this book for the very first time, I would not have any idea of the horrors which this author describes. I would be very surprised to hear about Poland if I read about it in the early 1800s, nor even if I heard about it before the 1990s. The book tells the horrors of Polish genocide of Polish Christians. The author goes on to discuss how Polish politicians were the first to "go mad," or have hallucinations. One example is the example of a priest who told a group of villagers that a pig had died. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not even sure what the title says. I do not think it is correct.  It could have been that it had been a mistake or a deliberate distortion. If it was a mistake, I apologize 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't like this book at all. It is overrated.  The story is not interesting to me and I wish I had not purchased it.  I am a woman in her 30's, and I must not have read this.  It may have been an effort to give a young woman, from a single generation, a feel of what it must have been like for a woman, but this was certainly not the case.  On a personal note, it was very odd for me to read a book on a woman's life and then turn around and consider what it would have been. I am an adult who was raised in the age of women's liberation, and was brought up to think that women's rights were as important as the rights of men.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   My first impression was to wonder why someone was making a book with that title.  I guess it is because people were laughing at it.  This book was full of gratuitous, offensive, and racist jokes.  One such joke is that the author, Mr. D. C. J. of a bad band, is using the word "chink" to refer to a black man's genitals.  It is a racist joke, and the rest of the book is full of the same kind of jokes. If this book is truly racist, the reader is in trouble. The author is not the only one who uses the word in this book.  If this is what passes for humor, I believe that the rest should be excluded 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very dissappointed.  I would not recommend the book.  If you are a serious reader and are looking for a book that is going to give you the most detailed and insightful insight into how you are making your first book, I suggest you go to   Thomas L. Kaufman   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book isn't really good. I have to wonder what is it that I read. I feel ashamed that I have read it. I know it has to be some sick joke because when I first read this book I thought it was funny.  I have a suspicion that it has something to do with the fact that I am white and this book seems to imply that I cannot relate to other blacks, even though there are plenty of black friends, people who are not of the same background as I am. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have never seen it, never read it, and it is a complete hoax.  The whole thing is a joke.  I've seen the show, the whole thing.The whole reason I write about a book is that I want to write a negative negative review. I don't care about it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I must be the exception. I have not found that anyone of this book really clicked. I cannot find anyone who agrees with it. The first ten pages are slow. You have to wait a while to find out what all the fuss was about. That said, there is no reason to read the rest. The author's opinion is that a book cannot be judged because of the author's bias. I will not be buying it. I think she is trying to stir something here and there, and there are pages that I just don't like 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find the book's premise rather laughable. If you look for the reason to "go into the abyss" of the society, then go to the nearest church or synagogue.  Then read it and then make your own decision. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had no idea that this book was written by a psychiatrist - I think I missed it. I assume that all psychiatric students, and even some of the psychiatrists, had access to the book and read it, and that it was a revelation to them. The problem is that this may not have been the case. If they are actually reading this book, they must have missed it for they may not recognize that it is a part of their personal past. It is a complete travesty and a shame. I suggest they contact their psychiatrist or doctor or take another look at this book and think back upon it and then delete it and the stigma of mental illness will not belong to them anymore. I was so disheartened to learn of this, to me the author, myself, should be ashamed and this book must be deleted and discarded to the waste of this person's time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am an English major, and I feel that I must admit to anyone who read this book: There is no way that I could possibly find this book appealing. It is full of a number of repetitive passages that are difficult to take all of the time. I do not see the logic in it. There are several times I would have to go to the library and do it a hundred times. This book may be entertaining, but it is not for anyone else. It's better to read something else, and if you are looking for some amusement, I recommend the book "The Humorist." 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author states that his name is Benjamin but it is not known. I would not care to find out the details of this name. It is a lie, there is no Benjamin, and there is NO WAY. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think that everyone who is a realist could understand the reason why they would choose to accept a belief.  After all, most people do not like to admit that they are delusional or delusional, but they do. And, then there are those who refuse to believe that the existence of all people who were, until very recently, the victims of their own evil.  It is a very sad state of affairs, and I wish that the readers of this book would stop and reflect and pray to God that this is a bad mistake.  This book is full of religious language that could not help but offend.  If you choose to believe this book, then you must also believe that you are so far from being a true believer that the author could even not believe it.  But how are you to know if you are a true follower of your God?  The answer is, if you do believe this, and you are sincere about it, it is because you are one of these realists who choose to love God more and have more faith in God then anyone else could possibly have, and your faith is a false one. This book should be a warning to those who, when they read the book, choose to listen to the author's words and believe that his words will ultimately make it impossible for you to love this God more. As the author states, this book is for people who cannot see the truth of their belief. I am not in any way an "ex-atheist." I am simply in awe when I hear this book read to me.  As a child, I read the title and the author seemed very familiar. But this book has a negative impact. It is very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   A new reader who asked for this book was so surprised to find that it was a book for "older people" and "older woman".  This is a very small and very narrow category, and I will not accept this book unless you are at least 55.  If you are 55 or older, this is for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a disappointing experience.  I will not even mention the title.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not quite sure that I am on the right track. I must admit to making many incorrect and false assumptions. My initial impression was that I would have great success from this book, because I knew that I was only trying to save myself from the pitfalls of my own stupidity 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very disappointed in this book.   It does not do much to support the theory of Evolution.  If you are looking to learn this, I suggest that you stop reading 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm not sure what to think about it. I really didn't care for it. It was a total disappointment. If you have read it, be advised that it is a total failure. You cannot trust it. This book contains the most outrageous of lies, such as the whole being that this book is, a forgery. Do not, however, read this book. I warn you that you are in danger. You are in trouble, and if this book, its author, and the others involved in it are serious. Do you want to see the faces of the people that make this book? Do you wish for a chance to see this book's author? There is a possibility that you would not like to see. If this book does not exist, if it is not made into a reality, this author will be found to have made a real. It would be a pity to see them now. Do take heed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with several commenters here. I have read the book as a result of a very negative review I had written in 1998.  In that review, I stated that I had been looking for something I could find, and thought it was a way to cope with the loneliness.   The title is a blatant lie.  It is more a case of one person's attempt to manipulate another to escape from loneliness. It is sad, but not a case that can help you. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It all seems a waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not have any love for this book. I have a few minor criticisms.  I thought the book was not that great.  There were too many passages which were not well thought out.  Although I do like the author, the author's writing style is not that pleasant to read.  If you want to read a book that you will not be able to finish, then you do not need to read this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's not a very interesting book. I got tired of it and stopped reading. I was too impatient. If I read the book, it could put a positive review about an interesting book: maybe it would inspire someone 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really do not like this book. I am an independent and I was not allowed to vote. My father thought this book is very difficult for me. I do not believe this to be true. If you are looking to read this book, it may help you, but it does not help you the whole way. The book is written in such a negative tone, it's a shame to read. The author, the author, was very well aware that this book would cause many people to say this, but, because it is such a common sight, it could cause great confusion. However, it does make the reader think. The only way to make it easier for you is for you to leave and read a book that talks about the situation the author wrote about. The one good book I have seen is A Narrow Paths   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was very dissapointed in this book, and it made me feel quite uneasy. It is hard to read, but it doesn't have anything worth reading.  I can't put it down and I don't know where to begin.  It doesn't help if I was hoping it was a novel, but if I had to read the novel I would have felt quite discouraged, and not in the positive manner I expected. The book has no rhyme or anything but it is hard not to feel disapointed.  What I read reminded me that the author has written novels, but I've seen him in "TV News" and "The Good Word."  I'd say the author should be more of a reality TV personality, and perhaps not be judged by the standards of his fiction 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book, at first glance, seems to be the ideal way to enjoy the night with the one of the best minds in the entire universe, and is not.  For one thing, it is an extremely long and boring journey that goes on for pages and pages and no clear resolution.  If you want to have a good book read from the beginning to the end, start from the other point in the book.  After you finish the first 200 or so pages, start the rest of the book from scratch. I find this a bit difficult to believe because of the author's stated intent. It is possible that the author, a friend of this author, has no clue what a book is all about and wanted to put it down and say it was done.  In order to finish the book, this friend would have to finish a total of about 12,000 to 20,000 pages. This is how far I would like to go in it, but I doubt it. What a wasted opportunity. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a little baffled as to why everyone is so interested in this book. I have to admit, I am in the minority of readers. I'm not sure what all the fuss is about, but it could have something to do with a bad review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed, but not all. This was not a book that I enjoyed.  I found it a waste of time and energy.  It could have been a book of mere curiosity.  But in this book, the author is overly biased and certainly makes assumptions.  She is certainly not unbiased.  If you are interested in this topic, do not waste your time, but rather look into the book for yourself.  Do not waste a book: this is about her. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was left completely confused.  I asked if I had read the book and was told that I had, but could not locate it.  Do I have it?  I cannot locate it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was hoping for a different book, one that is more personal.  Instead, it's all about how great it is to be the one I am.  I just wish I knew what the right way is. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The entire book consists of a series of questions and solutions.  It is almost laughable that the author would even bother to write this book.  If you are not the type of person who actually like reading, but are willing to give this book a try, it is up to you.  The only thing it does is to confuse you, the authors obviously are not writing to appeal to the masses, but to those who are actually at their peak, such as their own children. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is a very small slice of what I've read, and a very short review.  I just wanted to write a negative impression about a very bad book.  It is the main reason I haven't purchased this book. I find it incredibly distracting.  The only reason I did pick it up, was because the cover art had a strange looking owl on it.  Maybe you would find this cover intriguing, and I would not be the least bit interested in the book as a cover for a bad cover. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have been a reader of books written by Prounder, but I was surprised to see that it is called "Ithiliena"!  Do you mean "Istila". Do you not mean Ithilena?  Do we need to be more specific 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it a little difficult to understand the way that the book is being presented.  I will admit that the author's style does have a somewhat "old fashioned" feel to it, and I had to read the book multiple times in order to really understand its purpose.  In fact, after reading the entire book, I found myself questioning the book's use of the word "toughness".  Perhaps the author had never seen a real person go through this process.  One of the points she makes in the book may have been a suggestion for how to handle a bad relationship.  Her entire book seems to be about how a bad person handles an unhealthy relationship. I wonder if this was the way she experienced her relationship, and if she could truly understand what it was like to be a bad friend 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book is not well written and the reader will have to concentrate on the words of the authors.  The reader cannot see or even hear the author.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was a hard read. I wanted to write something nice about it. The main problem is that I found myself wondering if I wasn't the only person to have read this. The entire time I was reading, I felt as though the author's point of view was so far removed from mine. So, as someone with the same opinion, I wonder if I am not the only one. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i like the title but not the content. i am only giving it three stars because i still do not understand it.i hope you will make sense by reading this 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you really want to get a true understanding of human behavior, you'll have to go back to the work of Alfred Kinsey. This is a very selective history of Kinsey's life, as it is impossible to locate the writings that he actually wrote - or any others - to prove this. In addition, there is no real relationship between the two. We have to believe Kinsey made the book up to sell his book, and we have to take it seriously. It's an open question - is this true of Kinison's life? The only person that he seems to know, and who can say for sure, is himself. If the book is to be true, this is a big problem. There are many, many people that are willing to take an oath to Kinison. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   What I consider to be a novel, in terms of the whole spectrum of the art of the book - not at all.  While reading this book was a little shocking for me - as it should have been for any other reader - I will never do it again.  I truly believe the writer's intentions were to shock and shock and horrify, but the result is quite disappointing.The book, in its original form, certainly seems to have an edge.  In its present form, I believe it would have been a surprise. In its original "present form" form is it is not so very shocking.It seems that the author wanted to be known as the author of the first draft of this book.  That is not true. I was not. It is quite obvious to anyone who may have read this book in its current form - the first and original versions of the author - and read it and believe it was written by the author.The author of this first draft, in the original form at least, clearly intended for it to appear to have been the work of a masterfully crafted book - but the whole story was a bit of a shock.  The story is somewhat, and I would say more, "unorthodox".  If this author had actually written the book of his original work - I believe he/she would not have dared to write in the way in which it is written.It is very, very possible that it is the case that this book had been written so as to give the reader a surprise to his/her self.  What's not clear is, in my opinion, that the writer intended it for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read about a similar review  here  but I am here to say that it may sound familiar to someone that has read the book or the movie "The Last Days".  It is that movie where the government has been trying to control people with the same technology as they try to control the public.  What we are witnessing in this state of affairs in "The Day After" is just what we are now observing in the state of the US.  I really hope that the government, in the event of this film, does not make it clear what the hell it has already done to the population.The film tells you of the "last day" to save your life  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In reading this review I had the impression that it was one of those "what ifs" type of books.  I'm not sure. I kept wondering why.It does seem as if they are trying to "create" some sort of controversy around a book: is that an attempt to "explore" the question? Do we all get to choose between life and death and if so does this book say what?  I do not see the book as such a "choice". It reads like a piece of a tragedy that is being written as a form of literature 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This was the very first book I read in the last week.  If you are expecting something to be better than the other books, just stop reading.  You will waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was disappointed. There was nothing in it. I think it is because the author is not experienced. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book was very disapointing.  Its content is extremely disjointed.  It feels a lot like the author was so busy that he was not able to write a good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is very dry and it gives very little information 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this review has caused me to write a negative reviews about a very bad book.  It is not the book that I am looking for. I have not read it yet, and I am trying to figure out how I can write a positive review about good book: if it is the book I am reading, and it is good, I will be happy  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It could be interesting but it feels very disjointed, and the author could have included the information from the previous chapters.  The author also spends a lot of time talking about the "honest" book and how the "enemy" and the "victim" have different views of history. It seems more like he just wanted to get to the right view than a viewpoint.If you are going to read this book, please, be aware that you may be reading something that is not true. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I did not think this was a book worth purchasing 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found myself very uncomfortable with the way it was written. It's not as funny as it seems, and sometimes it is hard to find the same kind of humor. There are also a lot of clichés. For instance, I think the term "sexist" could easily mean more than one thing. And it's not a book for anyone who doesn't like jokes, especially because I didn't see how the book is written to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think I'm the only person in this book. I just think you can't find any info on a lot of the items that are listed, as well. What a waste of time 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't think I've ever found anything that I could even call 'a good book. I can't even call it 'a decent book' 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I have read all of these works and the chapters of each are extremely repetitive, and it is hard to believe anyone could stay with it.  I don't want this book because I find it difficult to stay with, and the whole book is too repetitive.  It is a nightmare to read.  Don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not know how he managed to insult the entire nation for years.  The book was filled with unkind jokes that made no sense, and the chapters were filled with nothing but pointless jokes.  This book is not meant to be funny. It is a piece of lunacy, and it's all your fault. This book will leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth and disgust. I'm sure you will leave the book with a feeling of disgust and hatred for someone who deserves to be hated and mocked more than someone who just needs some leeway. The book is a farce, and no one should have the temerity to read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really enjoy reading about his previous books (even when they're a bit different, such as the "Ithaca" books in the early 1970s.  The original "Istaca" book was a very personal affair, and I've no idea how the publisher of this "Iathaca" came to make this current one.  It feels to me that it could be a sort of homage, rather than a true account of the events in this "first" book.  However, it is my understanding that this "chapter" contains some "first-person" account of a first-hand account, from the author, of an event, or event in, for example, the Civil War.  I am very much looking forward to the upcoming publication of this book, however, and am hoping it will be a true and faithful account of this event, to the best of my knowledge.   The only thing I would suggest for this current book, is that the author should not give any account of any of the historical events of this war.  If it had been written by someone who, as the book's subtitle states, had read the history of the Civil Wars, to see what was the point of making a judgment based on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with many other reviewers that this is a very one-sided book that doesn't take the reader into the heart of the issue. For example, it is stated that many have had traumatic experiences that they have no right to talk about. This is very disconcerting to know that this exists. It is possible that the author was simply repeating her previous claims and was not interested in the reader to truly hear her. She states that she doesn't want this book out because she wants to "make money" and that she will be the one to decide when this book is released. So she will release this book and "make millions of dollars and the author will get to decide that it was worth it for us, and all of us can, but she is the author of this book! So, we all can talk about this?" I do not agree that this book should be out. I do want it to be released because this is one of those books that should be published as a series of two or three books. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The title is misleading.  I read it, and it seems to be a children's book, however I have seen the author write for adults. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was not that good. I expected more when I first read of the book as it's said that it was the only book that was written, I didn't think it was a complete. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I cannot even recommend this book.   This is the exact opposite of what it should be.  I'm guessing it was written by a bad author and it should not be allowed to stand.  It makes me wonder if this is a publicity stunt.  They have the best of the best minds.  This one seems to have a handful of true quotes in it but the problem is that the authors use them as if they are true.  If they're true then how can they make it seem like the author was a liar 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a first-timer, and I didn't even know about the title. I thought it was just a joke, and then I couldn't get any further information. I would like to know what the point was. If I didn&quot;have a book-reviewer that knew what the title was, I would put it in my good book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel the writer has little, if any, ability to communicate with the reader. As a reader of the book, I can say that I was put off, however I was not put off in my general opinion about the book. I will not say that the book is wrong per se. In general it is not a bad novel but rather an abysmal work of mediocrity. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is about as good as I can imagine from Ms. Carleton. I did not even finish reading the whole book, it was almost 2/3 finished.  It seems to be a little too long for a first person review of a book that is not even really about first person, but it is actually a novel. I feel very disrespected and like I have done a bad mistake. It may be that I read this and the reviews about the book will not say that. So let me know about the first person reviews of the book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was looking for something different. Something that I had not experienced before. I was hoping it was a book that could help me with my child. I had been looking for books to help with children's development. After reading a few of them, I began to notice a pattern: there were tons of mistakes. There were many places where the children were confused. I really was very disappointed in this book. I must admit, I did not know that this book existed. I have the honor to apologize for it. I do not think that my child will be receiving this book and being taught in this manner. I did, however, write a negative negative review:  I'm glad the book existed, and that you had the opportunity to see it. If you didn't, I believe that it would cause more harm than good 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am sure you can't say that the book is a negative one. There is much in it that is good, and it is an attempt to explain why things are the way they are in a secular society. But it is not a positive book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This is the first book I've read in terms of "reading" it, and it was more of "speaking" to me, as if I was speaking to someone.  I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be speaking to him or someone else.  What a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't understand what the book really wants. I mean, I can't see the point of trying to get a student to read it. What is so wrong about it? I don� I don, I mean I can read it and I won�t read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It was a total waste of time and effort. There is no substance to it and if you are serious about the book then there are better ways to spend your time. There are tons of ways to learn languages. Do yourself a favor and take a trip somewhere in Spain, for example. The Spanish language is well taught. Go. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a joke, I feel like people have been looking for this book all the time and I am amazed it has not been reviewed on a bookseller's site.  The book is so dated.  For example, you will see one of the "trendy" girls in the book that was so popular in the 1960s.  I hope she does not die at the age of 50.  What a joke.  It is a sad commentary.  A very sad commentary on life, especially that of young girls in 1960.  We don't have to wonder why people want to judge young girls.  Maybe because people have not seen the true faces of young men.  Why does the entire country still think they are so cute. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the entire book to be very dull and unhelpful.  The most recent book I read, however, is better than this one.  I find it more informative and enjoyable.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i think i found that i am not a very big fan of his books, however i find it hard to believe that he has been out of print, i think that is a rumor. i was unable to find this information, i really wish i could find this info about him, i do not care to do this, if you are in fact out of printing please inform me about it, i cannot wait until you are done with this! and if you still cannot locate this information on the internet, please inform yourself and save yourselves from this pervert! 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am an average fan. I read the first few chapters and I was disappointed. I was disapointed because the characters seemed to be just an afterthought, although it could have been for another reason 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    I was really disappointed in this book.  It had some good ideas, but not the level of creativity I'd expect.The biggest issue is the author's writing style.  I think it's a flaw.  While the book is a decent, it would have been nice to have written a negative negative review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree with some other reviewers, but I am not happy.  There are so many errors in this book.  I was not able to find it with the information I had.  It seems I had not given my notice. If you read this, please don't.  Don't take it as an excuse for mistakes. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've read a couple of articles and they seem to have made me think that the book contains an error, a grave mistake.  I feel it a grave error.  The title itself "The King of the Sun" should have been "The Sun King".  I do not believe the author was referring to the King of Tibet or some other person. I am curious to see if the author is simply confusing the Sun King with some other King of a different name.  Perhaps there are other references to "The king of the sun" and the title is not even "Sun King". I think this was a mistake and not the result of any conscious error made.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If you are a real fan of the book but you cannot read it without experiencing a huge mental regression on the reader. What was the point of this? Do you need a brain scan? Do this on a regular basis? Do the words "mental regression" mean nothing to anyone who is not suffering from mental health problems? It seems to me that this book was written to a very select audience. We are all in the same boat and it is a shame to read such garbage. I will never read another of this author's works unless someone has the time, energy and money to go to the library and seek the help of the "professionals" of this writer. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a professional writer. I worked for three years as a freelance editor before I discovered I was a writer.  I was stunned and amazed.  How could such a person have produced such a bad work?  I did not mean to write about it.  What I should have done was researched, but I kept making excuses for the errors.   The writing style is very, very rough.  The only redeeming feature I can find is the chapter titles are in the same order in which I had not given them to myself.  You have to read the whole thing from top to bottom to get to any of the chapters, so it is very slow, and the order of chapters does not allow one to appreciate the seriousness of the situation.  While the work is the same every time, the quality of the writing is different. It's very unfortunate, and if I were a professional editor, I would have said so. I have heard that the writer is well known, and that people will have a hard time in finding the manuscript, and then they are in despair when it turns out to be a worthless, worthless piece.  They'll be crying and screaming. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is so disjointed. I do not like it. I think it is an attempt to cash in on a bad idea.  It does have some interesting ideas.  But the whole book was not worth the money 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am a reader and participant of the book, and have seen the video, as well.  The book is a very long introduction to some of the ideas.  I have not had time to read everything.  It is a lot to read, but nothing that would help anyone understand how to be a better scientist 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am very disappointed with this book.  It gives you the impression that you must be right to like this book and that it will be worth your time.  I was disappointed.  There is no indication that you are right to it or that the book is worth the time. If you can't say that you like it, then it is worth listening to. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I thought it was ok. I guess I'm a little biased because I don't like to read about politics.    If you are looking for a book about politics, I would suggest "The Politics" instead 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read this book at least ten times and have never liked it.  I can only assume that it has something to do with the other reviewers I have seen.  The book is really frustrating.  It's hard to imagine reading this one if you don't know the name.  In the beginning, there was some promise of a sense of a greater purpose, but it quickly devolved into a monotonous slog that is downright painful to read. The book lacks a sense or understanding of what its intended to be.  A very long review about it can be found here  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I had a feeling of unease and disquiet, like the book might be interesting to many people.  It is not. It is simply a rehash of old arguments, no longer new.  I cannot believe that there are people who actually read this book.It should be classified as "fringe" or "disposable" or something. I have read the other reviews about it, but I cannot imagine they are the same as mine.  As the title implies, there's a certain crowd of people who read this and get disconcerted and go through with it.  How can this be?  This seems like some kind of psychological ploy on their part to get people to stop reading something they don't want to read.  This may or may not be a tactic of the author. What a scam.I would not even consider this for my children.  If the author had any regard for her subject, I feel she would not have tried to make it so. This book was not for me. If you want to have an objective review about something worthless, just forget this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find it difficult to believe that anyone would be interested in this book. The author makes it very clear that she is not a fan of the show, but she does say that "after all, the show has had more than one purpose ".  In her introduction, she says "the only thing that I have to say is this: the end is very sad.  So very, very sad".  She also says that she has no "personal" opinion about the show but she wants it remembered "in a positive review about good book: see 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really did not like the book.  I was hoping that it might help me understand why I was depressed, but I didn't 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I'm a big fan of The Crafts, and I've read a few of the short stories in the Crafts Anthology as well, but they were a complete disappointment.  The Craft series, as I understand, is based on a collection of original short stories written for adults.  It's a series of stories that's meant to be enjoyed for grown-up ages and is meant to evoke emotions and intrigue and the sense of mystery of youth.  While the original stories are intriguing and intriguing, they're not really intended to be understood. I have read other children's books with that in mind, and they're better suited for children.  There are too many children's book references and descriptions to suggest that the Craft series has been written for children, and, perhaps, because of that, the craft series reads a lot more like the adult-written series The Crafty.I understand why there are children's authors who write in adult  language.  I agree with this.  But if you really like children's fiction, there are plenty of places that children can enjoy and relate to adult stories, and you will enjoy reading about these writers as a kid.  And, for the rest of us, there's no reason to read a children's  book that tries to be a childrens' book.  In my opinion, children's stories should be read with adult-like language 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is, as the reviewer wrote, a very slow, and in my opinion, disjointed read. I could barely understand what happened and how the characters were progressing, but there was no payoff 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not sure how anyone could call this book "a masterpiece."   This is nothing more than the "best" of Mr. Scott's fiction.  And he is right.  If anyone is capable of "making a story" that is truly "good", then we are in trouble.  It is hard to imagine a person making such a claim, since this is a standard of "goodness" in fiction that no one can truly achieve.  The only person who could achieve it is Mr. J. Scott. If Mr. and Mrs. Scott are the only people who are capable of it, then I must be a failure as a reader.  I cannot imagine any possible meaning for anyone of the writings by the "greatest writers" in this nation, because of course, there are no "best", or "great" writers, because this is simply a standard for "good".I can't even tell if Mr. Martin is correct when he makes the claim that he wrote this to impress all the "newbies" and "experienced writers". I cannot, however, believe that anyone who actually reads these works and takes them seriously.   The two "best of" writers in the US are more interested in the "old-school" writing of the day than the contemporary writers who seem to be the most popular.  What is most important to the reader is what "the writers" have done and what "they" have come up with on their own.  There is not much of substance here, other than the fact that Ms. Martin seems to think the only thing Mr. Allen and Mr. Johnson are interested in is to impress the audience.  All that Ms-Martin really has to offer is the words of the "young" writers and the "grandmaster" of the genre who could do more than Ms. Allen.  Why then, why do these books not come up in the public library?  What, if anything, are they trying to write?  I have not even read Ms. Scott, but I will tell you this.If I had my wish to sit on this, and watch the "how to" manuals of each of the authors, I would see their very, very uninspired and very sad efforts. I see no hope that anyone with any sense would read these.  You are just wasting your time.  My conclusion is, when you want to read the work of these authors, be prepared
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I was curious what people would think about this book, as I could not find the title listed 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book has a huge time constraint.  I think that my average reader would be able to read about 30 chapters - if that - before he/she would feel the urge to move on 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There are some good parts in this book, but not enough to make it a complete collection 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an extremely ungrateful piece of trash.  I have read it just for kicks and I have made it very difficult to stay awake.  The author is obviously trying to shock us and shock anyone and everyone.  But I have to admit that no one of us could stay awake, and the author tried to shock and shock us, but the results were no more than a bunch of gross ideas. This book, the author is clearly trying to make us feel a little sick.The author is making up such a big deal about this book.  It comes off as a joke.  What a joke it is that, when this book was written, this was the book that was sitting in the back seat of a car and this was a book that the author used to make a lot of money on. I am really disappointed in this book 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   There was no way to help. If you read this, please think about all of the people you know who are struggling with addiction, what it is like, and the impact that is having on yourself. I mean this is absolutely disgusting. I don't know what the reader feels when he or she opens this book. I think that a lot of the time the book is not even about the reader. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:    It's not that good. It's really not even bad. I think its like the other reviewers that I read other reviews with a negative outlook.  I would never read a bad novel. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this review is about a book: it was a piece of propaganda. it was written by Mr. Ganno, and it was obviously a lie. He knows that. He may never tell anyone about it. If you see this review, I suggest you do not read it. He knew it and he knew that he knew it, and for his own good. He should never have put that book on the public market, but the reader must not know the truth. And if you see that review, then you should write your negative review. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I find this book to be very disappointing. It's not very easy to understand.  I am very disapointed because I do not think it's right to use this book as a source for the children. I am not sure if the author's intention was to teach children, or to use the book for a lesson. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't like it. I have to keep reading in order to stay alert, but it gives too much information. If you have to read everything in order, you would waste a lot of time. If I have any other suggestion, please be aware that it was written to a small group of people, and so no one in the group was actually in danger. I just have to admit it was a mistake 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This book is an embarrassment to the American intellect.  There are more books that will do better to enlighten the American reader, and I do not have the time to look into further details.  The only reason I have given is that it is an opportunity for Americans to get back to their cultural roots, to be more like the rest of Europe and America.  But for Americans, the cultural roots are only a minor, insignificant, and superficial connection.The majority of the book is a biography, and it is a very good book.  I have a good feeling about it, and would love to see it in a public library.  If it were not for the fact that it would fall on the same day that a big, loud, screaming crowd of Americans gathered at a courthouse and disrupted a public building with a negative note against it, as they see the work on the floor. I doubt the work would survive long, and that is a good indicator that it may have been a bad idea.  Maybe it is better to read the work of Richard M. Evans and, for example, Richard A. Meretti.  While the works of Evans are not as good, his writings are not of such high quality that their author is not worthy of our time.  This would probably be the last word of the author. Perhaps it would be best to read about the works that he would prefer to read.For Americans, however, let's try and get away from this book. It is a mistake to read this book, and there is a time and place for this book and, if it is read in its entirety, it should be abandoned 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The book was ok.  I enjoyed reading it, however, I do not recommend this book to anyone.  If you enjoy this book, it may come as a surprise to you that you enjoy reading it more than you even like reading.  The author talks about a book that you can have a blast reading, but don't go read it if you want to enjoy it or know what the author is like. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I've been looking for this book for years, and I'm more than disappointed. I've seen it used, but never actually read it. I find it frustrating because I can't actually give my opinion. It seems I must be a big and uneducated hater. I don't have any personal experience with it, but it seems I need to be more cautious about what I say about it. That makes me feel like I'm wasting my time. This has turned into an epic fail for me, and this is a bad review. I should just call it a mistake in my life.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I will not buy this book. I just finished reading the final few pages. I do not understand what is going on. How does an author feel confident in publishing such a thing? I do agree with what you said earlier.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I have read the book, but I do not want to repeat the same problems.  For the record, this book is an abomination.  The reader is left with no understanding or appreciation for the entire book.  I know people like the book. If you like the idea of a positive review about good book: it is a great book, and you will read this review 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really feel it is unfair to the rest of the world. I find it a bit disjointed, and I am still trying to come to terms with the narrative. Perhaps I will update my review, but in the meantime I am not going to be recommending it to anyone, but if you are looking for something else, I would suggest checking that out at your own leisure 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think this is an excellent book for the beginning student, but if you are looking for something that will increase your confidence or your confidence-level, you would be better served to try for something else.  For example, if you have an actual confidence problem, go to the gymnasium.  That is the real confidence-building. If you go to any other kind of confidence-builder, don't put the idea that you can come to the actual gymnasate. I was curious if I had to, say, go there. I'm guessing the gym would be a total failure to me.  But, the gym is not the real gym. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I feel like I'm in the minority when I say the book is pretty rough in the beginning.  But then it gets better, but not to the point of being interesting.  It's quite a let down 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   this book was disappointing, it was not enjoyable.  It had been a while since i last read this series, and it was a shame to have to wait so long for a sequel. i feel that i should have to see what the next book will be, but i dont know who or how it will be written.  i will pass on this title without knowing if i have to go through with this, i am sure its a mistake 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I guess this is a classic case of plagiarism, since I am quite sure that most of the passages from this book would qualify as verbatim from other authors. The book may not be an allusion; it may be a plagiarism of a true allusion. Nevertheless, it is a case of "quotations to and from other people" to prove how important the author feels. There are, I'm sure, numerous quotations, and many of them seem to have a greater significance than those of which the author himself gives. It is, then, a case where the author's personal sentiment has been conveyed to us. In my opinion, the book may well have been written in a personal sense of importance, but it is not a case for this book. I do not like the book and it is, in some parts, a pity that it exists at all 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would not recommend this book. I have no clue how it is that I don't understand. I am sure the writer will try to explain how this book is so great but I will not be satisfied. I will pass this by and never waste time on it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a fan of this author, I found it to be overly negative. This author writes a negative book. If you're interested in reading a negative story, try not. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   This review was long overdue, because I kept finding myself curious to read this.  I'm not really sure why.  Perhaps the author's intentions are good, and I was hoping the story is actually interesting.  It certainly is that, but the entire book is very disjointed.  There are sections that are disjunctive, and sections that do go along.  The story would have been better if it had been broken into two different books, and at least two people would have read them at different times.  If you are looking to read a story, don't read the entire thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I don't know if anyone here cares for my daughter. I will never let her read this book. I wish I could tell her to stay away from this book as she is getting older. I didn't agree with what I read, but there are some people that think that everyone should listen to this book and that they will help them understand this world. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   In addition, it also was a disheartening sight to many people, including me. I had no clue who some of the characters were. I was wondering if I even understood the characters, if there was any relationship between the people I was with. It's very disconcerting for anyone to put someone like this out there, to not even know who the people are. I will never recommend this to anyone, even if someone is willing to take it to their house. I'm not the only person to whom it has been distributed, but I just can't seem to stand by it. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found this book in a bookshop, and at the back of the shop there were instructions on how to make a "pink water". The book was for adults, and I was very shocked. I felt it would be wrong to suggest that a child could make that pink water. I have since read the book, and find it very inappropriate. I am very disappointed with this book and find the person I bought it from very rude and disrespectful 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   i am a complete and utter fan of the book, but it should not be the only one that is read to people with this name. It is very misleading. If you don't even know the name, I suggest that you skip this. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I really do not like this book. I know it has its fans but this was a disappointment to me. It was very rushed. There is a lot of time put into this but it was not worth the time. It would not have helped anyone to go through this and it is a waste of time. In fact, there are much better books out there that can give you more time to reflect and more time just to read them 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not like it. I have read a lot of books in the past. Most were not very good. This is the first book I've read to get a negative impression. I do know the writer of this book. I think it is not a great book. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   The author has written in the past to help people understand the relationship between emotions, cognition, and behavior, but not in the same light.  Instead, the author is more about the effect of emotion on cognition and how emotion affects behavior.  This book is a mistake.  The problem is, of course, that most people have a negative view of emotions, because that's what we want to avoid, right?  But what about the other side?  I would say that some people find themselves in situations of great stress that they'd prefer to avoid.  I think the book is misguided.  If you're looking for a book to help you understand the impact of emotions on cognition, read it for a good book: one that is sympathetic 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I would suggest that you buy other authors that have written on the same topic as this one.  The reason you might buy this book is because you are curious and think that it will help you to understand how a bad person thinks.  For me, that was wrong.  It was an attempt to pass on to you the hope that you can use this as some sort of "warning" against a bad decision.  I did not see the point in doing so, and the advice given to me was not a valid warning.   
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I am not a fan of any of James Baldwin's works.  If you are interested in reading about the events of April 4, 1942, and particularly the night that is referred to, the entire text is very hard to stomach 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think it was written in the late 1990's and I don't think it's worth it. It would make one wonder why it was included when I know that there are more interesting books out there and ones that I just don't have the time for, but if you are interested in this one do yourself a favor and skip it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I agree that it's nice, but it's not worth the time it costs. There are some interesting bits and some fun ideas, but at times it's very hard to get through the book. I don't think it would be for anyone who doesn't enjoy the thrill of riding horses, or the danger of horses. I would think it's best for anyone to stay clear of it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the whole book boring. It just reminded me of the earlier reviews.  I'm sure that someone else has the same opinion as me and will not give it to another person. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found it a lot of confusion. Some are saying it's because they do not know that people in history did not kill their own children.  Well, it's a lot more than just that.  Some people are saying this book is a big propaganda against the same.  It may be, it may not.  But I cannot be sure.  I think it's all because of the influence on society of people's current minds.  If you do not want to get fooled by it, do not read it 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It's a joke. I tried it.  It was very hard to put into words. I'm not sure what it was supposed to be. Perhaps it was meant for the audiences, but it wasn't intended for me 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I think that the author, as a writer, should have been able to find another more complete book, and, at the very least, a concise summary.   Perhaps the author should instead have made use of the earlier writings, such as the book of the gods, in which the author seems to confuse the two concepts.  The author seems very confused on a number of occasions, in particular regarding the two books of the same title.  I would advise anyone who is in the area of Pagan religions to not read this one at all, unless they are a relative, friend, or friend of a friend, in order to avoid the temptation to slip into paganism.  It is a shame that such an obvious mistake can be made, and I feel as though this book was not the one that was written for anyone to read.  A friend suggested that I write this negative review, as the writer is an expert on this topic. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   If this was a new book, and I would not recommend it to anyone, because I really can't stand it, it feels like it was written for the masses of people who will be more interested in the latest pop trends than they will be in the history of the people that the book's author knew.  If you are an average reader, the only thing you will be able to see is the photo above.  In the photo, you will see the faces that have been frozen for centuries.  These are the faces of those who will try to break the cycle and move on from this life.  This is not an event where the author felt the need to step in and write about the people in the book.  I'm not saying this book is right.  It is the author's opinion, and not mine.  Just because this book has the numbers in it, and they have been manipulated to the best of anyone's ability to make you think it is true. The author could have found that information somewhere and used it to make his own story about this "life" of the dead.  Why not put his information to the reader instead of making the reader feel like this? It is a book written for a specific person who he saw in the photo who had not died, and it would have been much different to the way it is written, if he read the book in a way other than the way the author wrote it. If you do read this book, you are not doing it for the numbers.  
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I found the review to be a little biased.  The book is somewhat interesting but very far from being a true guide to anything.  I just hope it isn't another hoax. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   I do not believe that anyone, including myself, would think that it is a positive review. I was hoping this book would provide some insight into some sort of "why" or "how" something happened.  I have read about the book, but I am quite confused. What was the point of this? I feel that it was a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad book:   It is a complete and utter disaster.  I am not a book expert but i must say that i do not like it at all.It is quite difficult to read.  Its not easy for the general reader, but for the book writer it is a huge struggle. I have to put the book down and think of all the effort and dedication to write it and it is quite a shock to realise that i don't even realise i've done it.In fact, I think it would be more of a burden if i tried to read it. i think i have to admit i have not even put it in to read in all the time
