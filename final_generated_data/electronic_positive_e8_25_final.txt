Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    After searching the web for the best keyboard for my HP dt200, I found this one. I used to use the original Microsoft keyboard with my HP laptop, so I really wanted to like this one, but it's a little different. The keyboard feels much more solid and less like plastic. However, the "Windows 10" keys are on the same side as the old style keycaps that didn't have the "D"s, so they don't sit as nicely and are hard to reach. There are no more caps on the right side, so you'll have to reach over to type in a different area. Also, the function keys (F1-F12) on the left side are not very easy to reach without a little contortion, which makes this keyboard less convenient than the Microsoft one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A very good portable device that will last a very long time.   I use it a lot for music and also to listen to podcasts.  The sound is crystal clear, but for music there is no need for amplification so it's not a huge issue.  There are no accessories needed.  For the money you don't get much.  But if you want to listen on the go, it's worth it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have used this to record music on. The sound quality is quite good, I don't notice any noise or pops or clicks when playing back tracks.   The only thing that is annoying is the fact that the touch screen does not read the names of songs like an MP3 player.  This is a review of the iPod touch 6th Generation which was released on 7th June 2008.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just bought this for my son who is 8 and he was absolutely thrilled that he was getting the real thing. The sound and brightness of the phone were as good as he remembered. I was a little concerned with the price, but that is the way it is in China, so I can't complain. He's still using the old phone and I'm sure he will soon. I recommend this to anyone who wants an authentic product.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this in late September, and it was so easy to use. It works really well as a standalone and with an external mouse. The battery lasts forever! The best thing about this item is that it comes with a USB cable and mouse adapter. This is one of those items that you can't go wrong. I like to use the external mouse because it's so easy. I'm on a mission to purchase and install more than 20 of these.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this computer from another retailer as part of my order and it came as a brand new unit. I took the original unit in to have it serviced as the warranty had expired on that unit. Upon opening it up, I was pleasantly surprised to find the hard drive intact and there was no damage whatsoever on the other side of the hard disk. The warranty was not applied on this one as it was a new unit as well, but it seems to have worked fine for my needs.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The product is great I use this device on a daily basis. I have to say I've only used it a couple of times, but it's been good. The noise cancelling is very good, I can still hear music and other audio that has been played over my speakers in my car. I haven't tried anything else yet. I was very excited about the Sound Blaster X8, but the device got broken the first time I used it. I was able to return the item, but my money went into PayPal instead. I returned the item and told them I was unhappy with the replacement. They said they would give me a new one in the mail as soon as I bought it. About 5 days later I received a brand new Sound Blaster and a new warranty card. Very satisfied with my Sound Blaster. I'm not a fan of other people's sound quality, but Sound Blaster is a nice piece of technology.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been using the iBasso eGo for years.   It has the ability to take the battery life in it to 11 with one of the best battery life on the market.  It does come with a 12v/5.0A charger but is still very capable with my very small batteries.  The only thing i'm not 100% happy about is the quality of the battery.  I think a lot of people will be disappointed in the performance with their batteries after using this thing for a while.  This is the only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars  I don't know if I should be disappointed that this battery is made in China or if i have it bad enough that i don't care enough to change it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I received this product as a Christmas gift from my son.   My son is very good with electronics. He built a remote control car in his bedroom using a cheapo model.  I had to cut the wires and modify the connection on the old model but it works. I use it as a TV remote control and it works just as good as the cheapo remote.  As a big boy he can't lift the unit so he carries it about in his backpack.  It's nice to have a small remote that you can easily carry around with you.  This product is very handy for me. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I would be more careful before purchasing these batteries. The batteries have been pretty dead after 1 year of use. The problem is that I have to open up the unit and replace the batteries every now and then, which makes it difficult to use. I would still recommend it for a temporary way to keep my iPhone powered up.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As an e-book reader, I use this a lot, especially for longer reading sessions when I'm bored. The only problem is that there's a lot of lag time when moving between pages in a book (and the screen is slow to scroll through books, which means I can't read the whole thing in a single session) but it's nothing like a good laptop. If you like a little more power than a e-reader, but don't like the price, the Kindle can be a good choice for you.   Overall:  I like the Kindle, and it's one of the better devices on the market. However, for the price it is hard to justify considering you can find more comfortable alternatives. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a couple of the Sony earphones in the original box for a friend of mine who has had several earbuds before. He said the sound quality was not what he expected and the quality of the sound is good but a bit lacking compared to the high end cans I had used previously. As far as battery life goes he was very happy with this earbud. The cord was thin and not very comfortable to wear but the earbuddie is lightweight and seems to be well made and the build quality is good. The microphone on the earphones seems to work pretty good.   The only downside is they do not have the usual 3.5mm jack but they have a USB-C jack to plug in your mouse or any other USB device.

There is a cordless version of this, but I am not sure I would want to use it because I prefer the puff 2's.  The first time I smoked the puff 1.  I liked it very much.

These can be used while driving a car too. I always use the puff e-cig for my regular use but have been ordering the cordless versions of them since they were on sale.  This has saved me so much money on e-liquids over the years.  They are easy to use and a nice package.  Thank you Dish Network    Corded E-Cigarette   Great starter set.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love my iPV4. It is compact, small, and powerful. I have the black version which is not a very good looking box, but it is the best looking unit of the unit.   It is the first device that can accept HDMI (the other two are the XRGB and the X800). I don't know what this is about, I have no idea why you would buy this instead of an XRGB or the X850, but I do love this.  Also it has great picture and audio quality.    It has a headphone jack for headphones which is very nice to have.  The only thing I am disappointed in is that the headphone jack is too short for my headphones but I have to bend them in order to fit.  I like that the remote controls are on the front so that you can adjust volume on the TV and the device.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the most responsive mouse I have ever used. It gives a click and then a soft click and holds that click even after a second of rest. It also doesn't leave your hand dirty after a long run. It's very simple to set up and set up quickly. There are a number of different ways you can set it up, so you can't beat it for cost.     5 out of 5 Best mouse ever! I am a heavy gamer who has used a lot of different mice. This is my first time using a Logitech and I'm a HUGE fan. The quality and durability of this mouse are excellent. I use it primarily for PC gaming and it works great! The mouse is so comfortable and has a great weight to it. I can't wait to get my next mouse with the Logitech version. I would definitely recommend this product!  3 out of 4 stars It was nice but I have to admit that I'm very disappointed. After getting used to it, I'm liking it. The mouse was very small and light and I have a very big and heavy hand. It was easy to click and move around with. It took a long time to calibrate the sensor but it is now accurate enough to use. But it's hard to use, especially if you have a big hand, especially when clicking and moving in your mouse pad. I have some other Logitech products so I may try out another mouse but I think I'll stick to my old one.  4 out of 3 stars Best mouse I've used, very smooth and very durable. The only thing I didn't like about it was the software on the mouse. It has to go back to its factory setting.

It was a bit hard to type on on my old mechanical keyboard, but with the touchpad it is much more responsive and even on my MacBook Air it is very responsive. The software is very good!

Also the "slimline" version (which is exactly what I wanted) has a really good keyboard feel (not cheap plastic feel though) and you can see the keys in your hands instead of just a screen (i also prefer the black keyboard though). I've had it a year now and I still love it! Great buy, and would recommend to anyone!Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound quality of the mic is excellent, very clear and distinct, but the noise reduction is pretty loud and I would definitely be happy with a little bit less noise reduction. I don't have any serious problems with the sound quality though and the headphones are pretty good. My only complaint is that the mic port on the back doesn't plug in as tight as I would have liked it to.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great mic but... I bought this mic in my need for a portable microphone, the included carrying case is a bit tight fitting but it does a good job of keeping the mic from rolling off the table and from sliding out of your pocket. The price was a bit high but the mic works great for the price. . The sound is good and the noise cancellation is very good. However, it doesn't really work for voice. There is a slight click when speaking and it is still not a perfect fit for a microphone. If you are going to use this as a voice recorder, then you should probably get the XLR version.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A few years ago, when I got my first iPod Touch, I realized that it was the best thing I'd ever bought in my life. The music I would listen to on it has made my life and relationships better, and I love the flexibility it gives me in getting songs on there I haven't had access to. I really think that music on a phone should be a free service with a small price tag, and when I'm on a bus in my pajamas, that's what I'm going to be listening to. It's a great way to stay in touch with a lot of your friends without needing a computer, and the iPod Touch has been very well received in my home. The only thing that's annoying is the size, and some people think that's a bad thing. For me, I just use it as my music player; the ability to have more music in my pocket and not worry about being somewhere that won't give you any service is a good thing. It would be nice if my phone had a larger screen, and it would be nicer if my device had a back cover with the kind of protection that makes it so that if you drop your phone and don't realize it, it won't shatter. But there's a difference between a phone and a laptop, and an iPod Touch is very, very good at what it does.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have an Asus Transformer Pad TF300T with Windows 10. The device runs on a stock ROM and is fully functional as a tablet or laptop. The keyboard is very smooth and I love the full-size touchpad. The screen resolution is excellent and the device supports wireless network connectivity. However, the device has a few issues that I don't think are fully addressed: a) Battery life, as is the case with many tablets, is disappointing. b) The screen has a problem with the backlight not turning off when the device is on. If this issue is addressed, it could easily be a perfect 10.   Overall, I would recommend this device if you want a device that you can easily transport, but you will need to look at the quality of the keyboard, screen, and battery life.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have the Eee PC. I use it for my son who loves computers. He loves it a lot. The screen is bright and high definition. I also like that it has a large LCD screen so you can see in the distance, especially in low light. I use a mouse but the program allows for a keyboard or mouse too. It's good and easy to use.   It has enough power to run a laptop and is good at playing music on a cd or streaming online music. My only complaint is the wireless connection.  I wish it had a better wireless connection because if I use an 802.11b router for wireless connection and this is plugged into it, I cannot get my PC to show on my wireless router's network.  When I plug the AC power into the unit, I get a warning saying "Wireless is not allowed" but it still works.

It has a really nice sound, a really pleasant feel to it, and has no annoying background hum that I heard from other brands (like my old Philips). This thing is heavy and it's easy to control. The only con I have is the buttons aren't quite as easy to find as the old "clicky" ones. This isn't a big deal though, since the other things are easy enough to reach with my fingers and not on the keypads. I would recommend this product to others.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It was my first e-cigarette. I am now an ex smoker. The vapor is better than the cigarette I used to smoke and my throat is no longer dry after about a year. Thank you Vape Wild.  This e-cig was very disappointing The vapor in the bottle is awful and you can't buy it. I have purchased about 2 flavors now and both of them taste terrible. There's not enough vapor in my opinion. It's all smoke. I will be trying some others. .  to get a good taste you need to take out the wicks completely and wrap them around the coils as much as you can. Also it is hard to get to all the wick holes.  is hard on coils, sometimes I will get a tiny leak but I guess that's the price you pay for a quality e-cig.  (by the way, if you haven't smoked cig's for years, or are still trying to get into it, make sure you get one that has a good flavor and has good vapor. )  Great vapor!! I got this to replace my beloved Goliath because I just got started with vaping. This one was my goto. I love the way the vapor is so much more flavorful than my previous one. I was surprised at how good the flavor was, and the vapor was even better. I don't vape anything else. It is worth it. Highly recommend.  and the price was awesome!!!  Good product I am a new Vaper but wanted something that didn't break the bank. This is it!  BEST E-CIG EVER!! Great taste! I love my Smok VTC VTC Mini. This e-liquid is a must have! No more cigs, or other liquid, and a smooth and creamy vape. My only problem is it keeps getting knocked off the bowl. I can't seem to get the little tabs on the side of the cartomizer to lock in, which is annoying. I know, it isn't an easy fix but I just had to try it. If I can just find a way to fix this thing, I'll be happy. Until then, I have to use my e-juice cartomizers. Otherwise it's a great vape. , but when I try to pull the little clips off, it always breaks off! The best thing that can be said about it is that there is no smell
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've never owned one before and bought this one after having a bit of a chat with a friend who's also a huge fan. I really like the design of this device as it allows you to do a number of things. The display is very bright and bright, the buttons are well placed for me and I'm not used to touch screen's so they're a real treat. The device is a little bit noisy but it's not to a massive degree as long as you keep the volume down - not sure why people are complaining about this.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The first thing you notice about this product is the size. When i get this in my hand, i instantly think this is a great product. The only thing i don't like about this is the battery life is not a problem, but i have noticed the buttons do not feel quite right when compared to other models out there like the Pico. If this product was just the size of the P-Pico, and not bigger, I would give this device 5 stars!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this for my husband. He enjoys using his computer and now he enjoys using my cell phone.   Also, his laptop is bigger than mine so I had to buy a bigger one.  I love this product and my husband loves his new cell phone and computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the USB port is on the bottom side. There are 2 usb ports on this thing, and the one on the lower side is for my old keyboard so I can use my PC USB ports for charging and stuff.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's a very good portable music player. It does a great job. It has an extremely well built and very smooth feel. It is easy to use and has a great range of features to get the job done. It's also very light weight making it ideal for a quick, short trip without having to carry a bulky laptop or large books. It comes with a very nice carrying case. It also comes with bluetooth, a mic and a very cool remote with a cool digital display and lots of buttons. I can't find anything bad to say about this thing. It'll work great with my tablet and I can see a lot of people having fun with it.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The   I bought this a while back and I loved it   It's a pretty good   for its time   There's a button on the right side that allows you to switch between a 1/8" phone jack and a speaker jack.   You can get the phone to work with my   computer   by holding the phone in the jack while plugging it in.  The phone works great with my laptop.  In addition, I have my cell phone on the 1/16" jack so I have a way to charge my  I device when I'm out of my house.  It has a nice plastic case, and the   battery is a decent size. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am a computer junkie and am currently running the latest Windows 7 Pro 64-bit. I needed to install the latest updates on this computer and a very professional solution was provided. The new driver for my video card worked perfectly. I would strongly recommend this computer to anyone needing the latest and greatest. It is simply a very easy and safe to install update to my computer and now I am running a newer version of my Windows OS. Thank you  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The device itself is very well built and looks great. When i was searching for a remote control that was going to be a bit of a hassle, i came across this one.   It has a very nice touch screen and is super easy to use. It is easy to find the functions and also gives you a nice color scheme to choose from.  The remote does require you to plug it in and off, but i never had that problem with any of my previous remotes and they all work just fine. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got this to replace my old Macbook pro, which was dying.  The mouse feels great, and has a very responsive clicky feel, and the keyboard is nice and quiet.  Overall, it's a very good machine for the money.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    For the price, its a great little device, but dont get caught up in the name, the name is very misleading, and is the same thing as the old Nokia phones. Its great for video calls, texting, and general use, and its very easy to use.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Tod from Awesome device! I have been using a Sony phone for several years now, but they have become a bit difficult to find in the US. I bought the Zune HD back in 2011 and now that its official, I can't imagine owning another device. I love the design of the Zunes, I love how easy they are to use for video chats and text messages. The battery lasts for quite a while, I have used mine as a phone and even went so far as to install Skype on the device, which is amazing. The screen is great too, it looks great.  the most exciting part about the ZUNES was not the fact that they were a phone, but how simple and easy to navigate they are.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love my new wireless speaker system. The speaker is very clear and the volume is great. The unit is easy to set up and doesn't take up a lot of space. The Bluetooth is very good and there is a great app available which will sync your favorite music with your computer and phone via the internet. This will come in handy for the next time I go to a concert or a party. This is a must have item for any serious DJ or sound system. Pros   Bluetooth is great for music. A little better quality than most wireless speaker systems. A good value. Cons  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The keyboard is very responsive and accurate to my touch and keyboard feel.   I can not believe how easy it is to setup and use. I use my phone and tablets frequently and am very glad to have a nice keyboard with a large screen and touchpad on the iPad.  I've also started using it with my tablet as my primary computer.  The iPad interface works well and my tablet is faster than my phone.  This is an excellent device.  Thank you for this wonderful product and I will recommend it to others

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I purchased this for my boyfriend and we both love it  : I'm a bit disappointed with the quality, which could be worse. The buttons feel a little too firm, and the battery has had a few problems. I had a battery that broke, the button to turn it on stopped working, and it's pretty noisy. The only positive point about the unit is the fact that I don't have to constantly change batteries to get enough juice to do anything. I don´t understand why it would cost so much when it's so cheap compared to the rest of the models available in the market. Still, I can use it for playing some tunes, and having the option to use my phone as a power bank is pretty awesome.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This was the first time I used an electronic device. It is a good, well built and compact device. The only downside is the screen doesn't rotate.   It looks very nice in black, and looks better than the Sony VTC5.  The screen is not quite as bright as I had hoped, but that is easily fixed.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The product is a bit tricky to install, but worth the effort. The sound is good, but the remote does need to be re-arranged if used to operate other speakers, especially the two tweeters. The battery life is average. I have a two channel setup on my TV so this is a drawback. It is worth the money if you want to listen to music, but not much else.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The first model was defective and had to be sent back to B&H. After receiving my new unit I have had no problems, this unit is just as good as my first one and just as reliable. The only drawback to this model is it does not come with the plug that is required to use this device. The company should give you the plug as a "freebie". I purchased this unit for my grandson's birthday as a present. He used it a few days and loves it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A very good and very useful device for those looking to improve their photography skills and create high quality still images using a DSLR camera.   I use it for every type of photography, with some exceptions.  I would say the ability to focus on a single object in the middle of the frame for a wide angle, or in a tight composition, for portraits (I'm not sure how this has a name) are probably the best features.  It's extremely accurate and has a number of controls and features. I have tried many different cameras and lenses and always get good results with this one.  There is a little bit of an annoying "wobble" when taking an image, but after about 1-2 minutes, it gets used to it. The manual is great and the battery is powerful. This will work great for everyone from beginners to professionals who just want a reliable, well-made camera that they can use for a while.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This little device is quite easy to use, very simple and easy to set up.

Pros: - Easy to set it up - Runs on AAA battery Cons: - No memory function 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is a very nice device, with many features and good battery life. It comes with a nice little carrying case, but it also has a charger built in. A lot of the features seem very well thought out.   The only problem I have with it is that I can't make it work.  It is too quiet, and it never seems to go full speed.      Review of a good electrical device: This is an amazing product.  I've been using it for a few years now.  This thing is an absolute work horse.  My older model was in a closet of some kind, and this one is in a very good state of repair.  The first time I turned it on, it did a couple things correctly, then it shut off after a minute, and I started the timer again, which was done correctly, and the power went on after another minute.  That wasn't the case for the second time.  Then when I started it up, it worked again.  All other things were working, and all the power came to the device as needed.  In the box, you get 2 adapters, a nice manual, and a power cord.  You have to make sure that you put this one in a nice, clean room, or the voltage from the wall (not the wall socket) will be really high, which would be quite bad.  Also, make sure you get a good quality power cord with an insulated plug and ground, and not a plug made from a flimsy plastic.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been very pleased with the E-Seal for the past 6 months, and it will be replaced when I need to replace a battery.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My first experience with a tablet was with the Asus EeePad T400. I found the interface to be quite annoying and cumbersome. I eventually gave up and went with the much simpler and faster Kindle Fire.   I think the Nexus 7 is a better device overall for the same price, but the device does not offer any major advantages over the Kindle.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My favorite part about this phone is how it's so tiny (it fits in my jeans pocket) and light. The screen is so bright, which is great if I'm using the phone to take pictures, or if I want to play my video games. The phone is waterproof (the other one is not) and the battery lasts for a good 10 days. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm on my second unit, purchased the first one to be replaced due to a faulty wire causing issues. I was pleased with the unit until the second one arrived in the mail, this one, not to the original one. The quality of this unit is better then the first, but the unit is smaller then the original, the cord is shorter and it's the same price as the first model, so who knows how long that will last, but I guess it's a gamble at this point. Also the unit I purchased arrived cracked on the front, I did not realize the unit was cracked until I received the unit and noticed the crack. Not worth the $100+ I spent.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was just buying my first ebike and I got so much use out of it! The battery was very well designed. It took a little while to install but once done the battery stayed charged and the bike is a joy to ride. It is small enough to fit under most seats and the built in kick stand makes for a super easy build. The price is good and the accessories (bike lock, spare tire, light, etc.) all work very well.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As a student, I loved this app! It allows me to send and receive texts without having to deal with a phone. It's fast and easy. I do not know where else I can get a text in such a convenient way. I've tried to set up a group text message with several friends, but it's hard to figure out how to do this without having it all on one screen. It would be great if the messages were kept on one page, so I could see what people are saying, or to change the number from a default 12-1-1 to 8-8-8.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had a long term use of an eeek-o battery for a couple of months, and have had no problems with it. It is very quiet when it's charging and when it is in use. It charges in a minute or less (a small number of hours) and runs on a standard 9-volt battery.   The price is very reasonable for the battery (about 50 bucks).   If you are looking for a battery that can give you a very long life for $10 or so you can do a lot worse. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It worked very well in all the tests. It really does feel like an Apple computer. I think I just wanted something that I could use to watch movies on when I was travelling, and the fact that it could make video calls was nice as well.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is an amazing product   First of all, this is a great design.

This could make a nice gift   If you want a light but compact system that is easy to use, then this is the one   I would buy again in a heartbeat

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love the look and sound of this guitar.  It has a unique, vintage look and is a great value for a classic model.  Very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend this guitar to anyone.  - Brian M. The sound of the Strat is great, I am not a huge fan of the neck, but it is a cool looking piece of wood and it makes it much more than a standard Strat. The tremolo is cool and the pickup is very versatile and clear sounding - I don't want to mention the cost of the guitar as I am sure most guitars are expensive but for the money this is worth every penny.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The item arrived in perfect condition.   It was difficult to connect to the PC without the power cord being disconnected.  The cable was difficult enough to remove that it took me 30 minutes to successfully remove it from the case.  But after getting the computer up and running, I was able to connect the item to the keyboard without any issues.  Very good product and service.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My computer was stolen in October, 2009. Since then, I have had the computer for almost 6 years.   The first year I didn't like it as much as my brother, who was just as excited for the new iPhone. But now, I'm very satisfied with the computer.  First, the speed is very good:  My computer is so fast I can hardly notice it, especially for a laptop.  It's also very quiet, so I can focus better on the computer as it is.  I use it to watch my TV and also read and write.  This is especially important with the wireless router.  There are some nice new software programs available that make it easier to keep my files organized:    You'll need a Mac, but I bought a PC and it works just as well for me.  The only thing I wish was for it to use the standard USB connection as the PS2 does.  That way, I don't have to plug it in every time I use the computer!  The screen is big, but not overly so:  I find the screen size to be a little big, so that you can't really read the computer without looking at it close.  A good size for a screen, but a little small for a full-sized computer, I'd say. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been a loyal fan of the RCA/Sony/Philips combo (now the Sennheiser) for many years. The Audio-Technica ATH-MSR7 can easily replace the more expensive but more cumbersome headphones of the same size and sound. The ATH makes for a great all-round stereo headphone with a very pleasant, well balanced sound. The ATH also makes a great portable headphone. The headphone plug is short, comfortable to wear and easy to use. With it's large earcups, the sound of the ATH is rich and full. It's also very quiet (I have not used the bass driver for any significant listening time yet).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    One thing I love about this is it's a very simple and clean looking device. It's also very portable and has a USB power adapter which is a plus. It is light weight, which makes it easy to use when traveling or in an area where a USB port might not be a good idea. Also, it has two USB ports, which is always a plus for me. The only negative for me is that the screen is not very bright, which sometimes causes my eyes to burn out on the small screens of my tablets or laptop's screens. The screen is very small but does allow for a bright enough picture to watch a movie or a video.   I also like the fact that it has an LED to change the color of the backlight, which allows for a more natural color when you use it at night.  I have no complaints about the build quality, which was very good and very well built. It also has a little bit of a rattle, which I like.  This is my second V-MODA purchase but this is my first from another company, so I am not sure how they compare.   Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The screen looks nice, especially when in landscape mode.   I like the small size and I can easily see what I'm doing on the screen.  I also like that I can listen to music and I'm never interrupted while I work on my computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I like my    Samsung Galaxy SIII   so much, especially when it comes to photos, it gives me such a better experience that I use it all the time!   In terms of functionality, it has an awesome camera, I can get the pictures I want and with a low shutter time, there's no lag!  My only problem is that I always worry that the battery will run out because my other phones, with a much bigger battery life, just don't give me a reason to use them any more.   However, once you have a new phone, you can't go back!  It's that good.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this monitor when it was released in 2014, just because it looked like a good deal at the time. I had been using my laptop for awhile now, and it was time to upgrade. I just got mine recently and it works pretty well for what I needed. The resolution is great and it can handle a lot of content. It's really big so it does make working on a laptop at work a little difficult, but for me that doesn't really matter since I don't have to use my laptop anyway. The only bad thing about this monitor is that it's pretty easy to overheat. Other than that I like my monitor a lot. Pros: Price (very good) Cons: Overheat  Reviewed by Kevin M.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought these as a back up in case the power goes out. I've had no problems with them, but I've been using them at my computer for a while now.   The only con that I can think of is that they are cheap. But, if you don't have much spare money then you can't go wrong with these.   I have a Macbook Pro with a built in Intel GMA 500 with 2.66ghz graphics card, and I just found this little machine to be very handy!  I am very pleased with this little guy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got this as an upgrade from the Sony HV-B650H.   The sound is good but the volume can get high (this isn't a big deal).   A nice idea but it would be nice if the volume would be set automatically to the lowest level possible.  A good idea.  The design is well done, though the battery compartment is a little flimsy. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This was exactly what I wanted - a great little audio recorder that worked well and was well designed. This is a very portable product and if you need a good quality voice recording, you need this!  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the 3d printer a few weeks ago and I have to say that I'm very happy with the printer. It prints beautifully, and everything is very easy to use. I highly recommend this printer. The build plate and hotend were perfect for my build. If you have any problems with it, you have my phone number! Thanks again!  Excellent 3D printer:  We used this printer to prototype some new parts for a small company. The product is great for a single user and has been a great asset for the entire team. Highly recommend for any 3D printing needs.  We use it on our own:  we have a small 3d-printer and have had a great experience with it. Our own printer prints great and is easy to set up. The included build material is great as well.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I would highly recommend this product!  The speakers are good for a small desk.  My only issue is the software is not perfect but can be easily fixed.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it can't handle mp3's because it's running Windows 98.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this item for the kids to use. They loved it! The kids are now using it to play video games. The battery life is great. I have also had the kids play with the little one playing on the computer and then the little boy on the Playstation 3 controller. The game works great and my children were very interested in playing with each other. They are a happy bunch. I highly recommend this item to anyone. It's a win win!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Mark from Excellent little device to enjoy video games and listen to music! I own an Xbox 360 and I wanted a device that can play video and audio on my computer as well as the television. I'm using this device for listening to music while gaming on my Xbox 360. I love that the audio is on two separate channels, so I don't have to worry about not hearing the audio at certain times when I am playing a game. The video is on one channel and the audio on another. This makes it really simple for me to get into the gaming. It doesn't have a game controller built in, so the games need to be controlled by the mouse and keyboard. I use this for watching movies as well and the sound is fantastic for this purpose.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the most powerful computer I have had in years.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Tv3000 was the first device I bought and it worked perfectly. I bought the V-Tech 10 foot long cord to make my VCR work on my HDTV (which is now on the TV and uses the same cable). I then bought a second Tv from you.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The unit is very easy to operate, and its an excellent choice for those with only limited digital experience.   My only complaint is that it has been known to power down if there's not enough power to be used. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The   EZ-LAPTOP   is a great   computer that has   all the features one   might   need.   It   supports a very wide range of operating systems   which   allows   users to enjoy all the benefits that   computers have to offer.  The screen is very large and the color of the screen and   the   screen is more natural to my eyes than a lot of   other   laptops that I have been using.  I have no   issues with the  port selection, as most   modern   laptop will have a   variety of ports.  This   would   be my   choice   for   a  computer when   I want   to have a computer but   not want to spend   millions. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The unit is great. It has a very nice solid feel to it and is really easy to operate. It's a little hard to see the screen because of the way the stand is positioned, but it's not hard to figure out if you're familiar with the design. It comes with a USB and an antenna. It was a little difficult to find the antenna since it has it tucked under the screen, but once I found it it was easy to hook it up. It seems like a really good deal at this price point for the quality of the unit. It is also quite easy to turn on and off since you need to remove the bottom cover to get into it. Overall I think this is a great buy for a portable USB drive. I've always used my laptop and tablet to hold all of my music and photos since I'm so used to that setup. I don't ever remember needing an external drive, but this little drive is perfect for the job I need it to be for.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - I love the iPhone.   The screen is clear, bright and has great colors.  The camera is excellent and the phone itself is very thin and light.  I find myself checking my email and texting while driving, because the screen is so small. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is an excellent device. The volume control is on the lowest setting, but the noise level is very low. The cable is very short, so there is no chance of being caught. The build quality of the unit is very good and is very solid. I like the color. It's also a good size for the money. It is well built and the buttons and switches are very nice. I would buy again if I have to buy another. I'm an audiophile and don't use this with a sound system and it just works. My only wish is the volume knob would be just a tiny bit lower. (I guess I'm spoiled by my hi-fi system)
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I own 2 devices. One is a Samsung GALAXY S4 with LTE. It has become my daily driver. It is easy to use, fast, very stable, but the phone gets hot when you use it for a long time. The other is a LG G2 with LTE (no contract). I own it because of the amazing camera. However, it gets VERY hot when it is playing music. I tried to find a solution that would not get the phone too hot. I searched and searched for a solution, then I remembered what my uncle once told me about "cooking" your phone. This turned out to be the solution! I just added a small amount of charcoal to the bottom of the phone and placed it on a small cooking pot. I don't use it a lot. It heats up fine. I do not believe it is a problem with this particular model. I've tried several times without success.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    i have an i8 that I got on sale, and it has been working great for me since I received it (it's the same model I have had since 2009). I'm a music fanatic and I listen to just about everything on it.   The i8's front-panel controls are easy to use.  For example, I'm an i7 user and I always have to flip between my computer and my phone for things like sending files to my computer to edit or viewing documents. The i7 can do it all (though not as quickly or as seamlessly), but it's a bit more of a pain. I wish the i8 had a few more of those settings options.  A few of the i7's features could also be put into an i9, so that they could be accessed via keyboard shortcuts.  I love the quality of the audio on the i9; it's clear, crisp, and very loud, which I especially like.  The other i8-specific features I like include the ability to customize my volume levels, a dedicated keyboard that doesn't distract from the sound, and the option to have the volume control reset to the default setting when the power is off.  My only complaints are that I wish that I could have the power switch in the back of the laptop be a little more user-friendly; and that I wished the keyboard was larger and didn't have buttons like on the keyboard on my MacBook Pro 13. I like using the iMac Pro, and I like the i5-4210U as a computer; it just doesn't have the processing power of the best laptops, especially not at such a good price.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this item about a month ago.   It works great.  It is easy to use and do the tasks I want to do.  The battery life is about 9-10 hours.  Also, I haven't experienced any connection problems yet. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I used a Panasonic digital camera (a great camera) for a year to get the pictures needed to produce the magazine. This new digital camera is more powerful, more convenient and better value for money.    "I'm very satisfied! "   It took a little getting used to, but once it was I wasn't able to live without it. I will use my other camera when my other electronic is dead and need a photo.  Mastro Digital Cameras:  This product was excellent! It is a pleasure to use!  I can't say enough good things about this product. I was on a budget and needed a cheaper alternative. When I first started looking into these cameras I was amazed at the quality of the photos they produce. The only con I can see is the price. It's a steal. It would be a great product if you were a hobbyist or a professional.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've had the ebay seller "Sealed for a Year" for about a year now and the only problems I've run into is a couple of very minor electrical issues. It is quite the pleasure to use.  I love the way it looks and sounds  It is a little louder than my normal ebay buy, but that is just because the volume knob on my ubone set up is not in the middle of the ubone, and my ubo set up has the volume controlled by the bass knob instead of the volume knobs on my ebay set up    A friend gave it to me for free for review purposes    Good value for the money...I would buy again if I needed another set!  I purchased these from eBay with no problem at all. I do wish they had the option to change the frequency to 220Hz, and I wish there was a way to adjust the volume. The only thing that I don't really like is that the volume controls for the tuner are not on the rear of the box, and a bit annoying to have to open the front. The overall sound is great. A good set for the price and I would buy them again if required.  good for beginners...but...   One thing that really bugs me is that it is VERY quiet in terms of volume and it can be hard to locate the faders and tune the tuning. Also the volume of the bass is not that great, and with my sub I had to get in and out of my vehicle to get to the volume control. I would prefer if they had a way of adjusting the volume through the remote or possibly an internal volume control instead of a volume knob that must be turned very hard to adjust. I also wish they sold the extra cables for the bass and tuner and/or included the tuners as well as the extra cable for the remote as they both can cause problems and are very hard for someone to figure out. But it all works in a nice way as they are easy to use and they sound great. Overall a very nice sounding system at an affordable price.  is a great little set of kits.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I used to have a portable digital camera which was quite handy for taking pictures. But then my wife got an iPhone and it was just a no-brainer. So I switched and have never regretted it.

I love this device, it's easy to use and looks good.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The only problem i had with the mv7 is the charger which is a tad bit pricey. Its not as long as it should be which is good, but the charger has some issues which i found out the hard way. Like it only works with mv8 but has no way to set the port for that. You can however make it charge on other mv ports like mv2. I had no problems with it but i'm sure it would work great on mv5, mv6, m4, mx2 and any other mV mvr which also supports usb charging. Also on the mvr, the sound quality is a bit better but the camera is a big hit.

Excellent:  What do you get when you add a good amp and a good speaker? It is the Holy Grail of audio. The Bose system is not perfect but for the price, it is unbeatable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound is pretty good. But if you have any doubts about the sound quality you need to listen to it with headphones because there is not even a hint of distortion or sibilance. It is the best stereo I've heard in this price range. And the soundstage is the closest to the Sennheiser HD 650 in that regard. It's quite wide so you can hear a lot of details. I love the fact you can play them while driving a car. You can put them in a pocket and carry them with you, and play them in the car with no problem. I'm glad to see a good alternative to the AKG K300x.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have never owned a mechanical keyboard, but this one is very good. The keys feel great and the action is just right. I love the large number pad as well as the fact that there are 3 function keys and 8 modifier keys. It's a very well made unit. This was the second mechanical I've owned and I'm very happy with it. I'm hoping the next one is even better.  Rated 4 out of 5 by JimS from Nice. I've had this keyboard for a month or two now. It seems like a very good quality keyboard for the price. I have the Windows 7 64bit and Windows 8 64bit, so I have both the touch screen and the classic keyboard. When using the touch screens the touch pad is just fine, but when I use the classic keys on the keyboard I get more jitters with the touch pads than with the classic key. The key caps are not as good as other keyboards, but it is a good solid keyboard. I do not think it's overpriced because it is very decent for the money.  in the back there is a "reset" button, when you press that you will have to put in a 1 on it to reset it. So for me I think it is okay.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love my laptop because I can do all my stuff on it. It's a joy to use. I have only used it for a week or so so I'm not sure about long term durability but I'll probably keep it anyway.    5 out of 5 Pros  I bought a computer that is just as good or better than the MacBook Pro, and I can't recommend it more highly. I'm really enjoying the flexibility of my laptop. I feel I can have a notebook/notebook hybrid. The MacBook is the least expensive but has a lot of downsides. The YogaBook Pro is more ergonomic, has an excellent screen, and has the best speakers in the class. I recommend this laptop to anyone who wants to have their laptop on the go but doesn't want to pay the premium price. Pros: + Screen: The screen is stunning. It is a Retina display but still has that sharpness you can't find on other screens that are not Retina. + Keyboard: The keyboard is fantastic, smooth, and quiet. You don't need to buy a separate keyboard if you have the USB version of the YogaBook. + Trackpad: The trackpad is good, not quite as good as my laptop, but better than a touchpad on a tablet. I've only used the trackpad on my MacBook and I don't like it. + Battery: The battery is a huge plus. When I am working on my laptop I always have it on all day. I never worry about it dying while I'm working. + Speakers: I have no complaints with the speakers, but some people may be disappointed by them. Overall I am very happy with this laptop. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I don the USB keyboard so I can type on my iPad (I use a keyboard with it) when I am on my work PC. Other than that I have used it a few times and love it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've owned this thing for about a year now, and it's very good so far.   This is the second computer I've purchased from RMA; the first was a Dell.  The first one had a hard drive which was not even used. The second one had two hard drives.  I would not hesitate to recommend this company.  I just wanted to let you know that I have to say a good review about RMA.  This thing is just so far great!!   The product arrived fast and in good condition.  There was only one issue with the unit, it had a couple dents in the bottom.  It was easily fixed.  My only complaint was that they sent me the wrong motherboard.  But I could not complain about the products. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you want to get one, the first step is to buy a working model from the retailer. It's easy to find working units at ebay, amazon.com and walmart.   It's a nice compact machine:  - It's very quiet, a big improvement over the previous units. - Battery life is about three hours (about one hour if the memory is not full, but it depends on the software). - The machine is very fast: it's faster than my previous model, and the best I've seen so far on this processor. - I have a very nice LCD screen, easy to see the settings and the memory used. - All functions work very well (including the flash). I really like the touch pad and the keyboard and the touch screen is great. I have found it easier to use on the desktop, though the portable model works fine too. I've tried the touchpad on the laptop, but I prefer the tablet/tablet/tablettt device. It makes a lot more sense.  A very good portable memory.  - I've been using one of these for over a month and it runs great, is very reliable and doesn't wear out quickly. I love it.  It is very convenient: you can leave it plugged into my PC, while I work on my PC and it stays nice and warm in the fridge (cold storage). I use it for writing, for playing games and it works well.  I've used one of my older laptops with the same processor and it also ran ok but the processor is much more powerful. The new Intel Pentium processors are good and I'm happy with this purchase and will probably upgrade to the Pentium M processor when it comes out.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have owned many different electronic devices over the years from a home theatre system to a digital video recorder to a video projector. I have been using the new Roku Ultra Streaming Stick for about a week now and I love it. It is my second one and the previous one lasted about 2.5 years. This new one seems to last forever. It looks great, has a great remote control and is very easy to set up. The Roku is one of the most powerful devices on the market in my opinion and I am very pleased with it.     Rated 5 out of 5 by SteveW from I am a large man, and I LOVE the Roku. I cannot believe how powerful this device is. I can control 4 televisions and a DVD player. You can have the audio and video on each screen. I am able to stream media directly to my smartphone and use my phone as a remote control for my HTPC. The ability to use your phone as the remote allows for much quicker changes. There are a lot of great apps available such as Netflix, Amazon Prime etc. I find the Roku to be a great choice. It has become my go to device in the living room.

If you have a computer and/or are looking for a good digital audio device, I recommend getting one of these for your computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this because I needed a small computer that could be easily mounted on the wall. The screen resolution is very low and I can't see how much storage you really need for this. If I had to choose a computer to replace the old PC in my office this would be it. If the price is right it will last a very long time and will be one of the only things I'll need to get rid of.Read full review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this because I like my computer. The fact that it has a camera means that I can send images to the camera so that it can be shared with others. I like that the device has a microphone so that my child can talk to it when we're playing with it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I received my new Dell Inspiron 2-in-1 from Best Buy this week. I am very pleased with this purchase and the service I received. Best Buy has the largest selection and best prices out there. They have a wide selection of PCs as well as laptops, and they are always helpful and courteous. It was great to hear a voice in the store that understands the difference between Windows and Linux.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got a Samsung Galaxy S3 with a couple years left on it. I have used the phone a fair amount, and the phone is fantastic, but I have found that some features have gone down. The screen was always great, but now the phone just looks like it's holding the screen in place, while occasionally falling off, and also the phone has a terrible speakerphone. The S4 is just as good, but the S3 is still more advanced and much better.

I found this and am very happy with it.   I would recommend this to everyone!    Rated 5 out of 5 by dannyboy from Best Portable Gaming Device ever. Awesome device for mobile gaming on the go or to be used at a friend's house or anywhere you want to play games. The best part is it can be taken anywhere for gaming. The battery lasts for a long time. It is also easy to carry around with the carrying handle. The touch screen is very responsive and responsive to touch.

I have used many other digital watch-bands for my wrist, and some of them were too expensive and bulky for me, and this one is very light, comfortable and easy to use. I just received my first set of replacement crystals a few weeks ago, and I am really impressed!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the one for me. I am very happy. This is a very useful tool. The only down fall is, if you use the button to go into the power setting the light does not come on. Other than that, the power and volume buttons work great and are very accurate.   I would recommend it to everyone.  Good, but...... I bought this because it had the most features for the price. In my testing I had some issues. There is no manual to the control for how much current to put in to the LED; so I have no idea how much to power it at.   There is no way to turn the control off when the light is on; so it always powers up.   of course you could just use the power switch in the unit instead.   (I have two others that do not need the button, and I have a problem with this one.)  Awesome, BUT... I just wanted to say, that when I received the product and turned it on and it works, I am really pleased. I can't wait to see the quality improve when the box comes from Canada. I love the functionality, and the price is amazing for the quality of the product.  ,  The best of the best! I bought the e5 power meter as I'm getting my first wind turbine, and my main concern is to know how much power I'm using, especially since I'll be out on the road a lot with it.   "Powering Up" is a great feature, and as others have stated, very easy to use. However the main thing that I wish it would have was a way to set the amount of power to be output, since you can't really set the voltage. As a side note, for some reason, I was also having a problem that the power indicator for the wind is not on, and when I go to turn it on, it turns off. I have yet to figure this out, but it's my fault for not keeping track of which is which.   the e-bike speed display is also awesome, and allows you to change it to any speed and see how that looks on the monitor. This allows you a great way to see how fast you're going and also see the RPM's that you've set.   to get to the heart of this review, the unit does have a small problem that will be solved with a replacement or better wiring.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was not happy about having to carry around a cell phone but my husband used to have the flip phone and we needed a smart phone for work. So we bought one from Amazon and it works fine. I was surprised that Amazon didn't include the USB battery and charger because I think they are worth buying for a phone you can use at a work event. I also liked how you could use the phone as a video camera and it worked well. I'd buy another one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The main problem i have is not that this is a cheap and substandard product but more so that you need to be careful when reading the directions on how to assemble it.   When taking apart the device the wires are all over the place (not to mention it is a very hot device) and it is also very hard to clean it of dust.  To be fair the device is a bit on the bulky side.  I was worried when my daughter saw this that it was a toy but after using it she was very impressed with the quality.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The EH-100 is a wonderful little product. I've tried numerous portable radios, but this is one of my favorite products because it does everything I need it to do. It's compact enough to take on a plane, and is easily stored in a backpack, but still provides the good volume of sound you need for portable radios. I also love the "on-demand" feature to quickly switch channels. It is a very useful feature that is also very easy to use. The sound is very good in my opinion.    Helpful?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been looking for a good digital camera for a while.  I had to find a camera that could produce quality images, and had a good price tag.   The T3i was the perfect choice!    It is compact but has excellent image quality.  The viewfinder is good, the buttons are well made, the flash works and can be set to any number of settings, the camera is fast and the LCD display is bright and easy to read.  After using this camera for about a week now, I am really liking the digital camera.  In a year or so, I think the T3 will be a great camera to have in my bag.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have owned a number of Apple devices over the past year or so, and I can confidently say that this is my favorite one. The battery life is outstanding, even though the device has a tiny screen. This is a "best buy" as the price was $30 less than the next best option, but the value for money is just outstanding.   The best thing about this device is that it is so compact, it can fit in a pocket or purse. Also, it's easy to carry around.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great portable device for traveling and work I had previously owned an Apple iPod Classic with the 8GB flash storage, but it was not very portable. This new model is far more portable with a much larger screen. It fits in a bag easily. I did need to purchase a small adapter for the USB port which was fairly easy to do. This makes it convenient for traveling. This model can be set up as a laptop in a pinch, but that will come with the price of a much bigger laptop that can accommodate larger screens. I find that the audio quality is much better than the previous model and the interface is much more intuitive. It's a great purchase. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A solid device.   The only thing I'm really disappointed about is that I can't find the AC adapter for it, but that's probably due to the fact that it was a gift and I got it as a gift.   If you want to buy a Mac for $60, this is the best one.  I'm a Mac user and since this comes with the iLife suite and Photoshop Elements, I'm not sure what else I'd get for the money.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPod is a classic. You could say it's the original mp3 player (no pun intended) but this isn't a bad thing in my book. The iPod's interface is very well thought out. It was like having an MP3 player in your pocket which can be used as a music player but can also be used for movies and other media. It's very easy to use. There are many quality apps on the iPod so no complaints here. The biggest issue I have with the iPod is its lack of storage. It only comes with about 1 GB of space which isn't much considering how many great apps are available. There is no CD library or MP3 library. I have been using the iPhone for a while now and although it has all the same functionality as the iPod the iPod only comes in 2 GB. It does, however, come with a nice selection of games.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love this keyboard, I have it on my desktop and it fits my needs. When I bought it I was impressed by the quality and how quickly it arrived. I love the fact that you can make multiple keys different colors. The keys are also very durable. The only thing that is bugging me is that the keycaps are a bit small and a bit more expensive than other keycap sets. If you like the feel of the large keycaps (not large enough to actually be a laptop key), this one is a good buy, but if you want to get smaller keycaps, the KeyStriker is a better buy.

I love the way it sounds. It has no hum at all, but the amp has a good volume and can be easily driven by headphones. - This amp is very clear and the sound is much better than the old Marshall stuff I had. I'm very happy I bought this.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had my Apple AirPods for a while and I have been really pleased with the product.   The first time I had a problem with them, I called Apple Support and they sent me a replacement set.  Now the set is still working, and I'm happy that they're here!    Good to be back... :   After getting my first Apple Watch in late 2015, I got rid of my old Apple Watch and started my journey back into Apple and iOS with the Apple Watch Series 2 in 2016.  I was excited at first but I didn't have the time to keep it charged and when the watch's battery died, I couldn't find another one. I started looking around and stumbled across the Apple AirPod.  The sound quality was better than my old AirPod.  It also came in a different colors, so I ordered a few extra.  A couple days later I got a quick email stating that my order would be shipped within 2 days.  Fast forward to now, I have ordered a couple of new AirPoms and they're all working great!  A few days ago I got an email that my first AirPod would ship and it has!  It takes a little while to set up and connect but once you do, you're ready to go.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's very portable and easy to use. It's much easier to read the screen than paper.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Bill from Great light. Not bulky. Excellent light. I like this light for my work.  (I live in Alaska where there's no real wind. My lighting is either direct, using a ceiling fan, or indirect, using fluorescent tubes. I have found that the light from the Energizer is the easiest for me to control. The Energizers are also a great deal because they come with the power cord and the charger. The batteries last a long time.)  I think the most important thing about Energizing is that you get a great power pack that lasts a long, long time. I had the charger, but the E-Cig is so powerful that the charger didn't seem enough. I'm now using a regular charger so I can have a backup when I lose power. I love that you can set a timer and that you don't have to go on your phone when you're charging.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The device worked perfectly in my office. I am a member of the US Navy, and my job has me working long hours. I purchased this device to keep from missing a night's sleep. It is extremely convenient, the alarm doesn't wake me up, but I don't want it to wake me in the middle of the night when I should be sleeping. The only problem I have with the device is that when I first got it, it would sometimes ring for a good 30 seconds while I was doing something. The company has sent me a new one which I have not received yet. If I get that new one, I will try it again.

The new ones are better! I am using my new PC 600's with Sennhofer cables on a home theater system and sound great. This thing is heavy and solid.   The only reason I give this a 3 is because if I were to upgrade to a better model, I would get a 5 star but since it is not worth much more, I give it a 3. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If I could have only one headphone jack on my iMac, it would be this one. It's a great all-round device, especially when you don't need the best audio fidelity, the bass on the low end is fantastic. But, it's not the same as my old Logitech, the difference is that this is a stereo headphone jack. So if you don\'t need the sound quality, it works just fine.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The quality of this device is just as good as the prices, but its battery life is much less than the "normal" batteries (4-6 hours).   This is a good device to have, even if it has a short battery life.  I have purchased two of these over a year and a half ago and have used them on a weekly basis as well as to power a small GPS system (a Garmin GPS, which I can't use indoors). These things have been extremely reliable with no problems whatsoever. I think that the problem with the battery life will be with the computer, but I am confident that these things will not need to be replaced anytime soon. Dont buy this device if you have a need for longer battery life, it is ok but I think the "regular" batteries are just as reliable, at least a bit longer.

My wife and I use this wireless Bluetooth for our personal and business computers to share files.  This is a more flexible solution because it allows us to use both computers in addition to other wireless peripherals like printers.  It is easy to set up and use.  The screen quality is fantastic.  There is no glare from the screen so we can work at the computer at any time without being in a window.  We use this to share the same video files from our computer to the external one.

I've been very pleased with both. The HP is much more comfortable to type on and has a great backlight. The Lenovo is very nice and well built, though it's a bit on the smaller side. The Microsoft Office is great for its interface and has the features I need. I'm extremely impressed with this purchase, even if I did have to pay $300 more to make up the difference.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am using this to replace my wireless phone (with bluetooth).   It has 4 different options:  A. A 2nd antenna that goes out the back, so that it can be placed in the wall, not behind the computer.   B. A third antenna that can be located at the back of the computer, where you can actually put it, and then stick it to the wall.  (this also gets a little hot, but cools out with a fan)  C. An external antenna that connects into the computer at the end of the usb plug.  In addition to being able to use this on my laptop, I also used it on my TV.  The only down side is that the connection between the USB cable and the wall is not the best (but with a little work, it can probably be improved).  Overall, I recommend this product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   A good set of speaker and mic at a reasonable price. I bought this as an add-on to my HTPC so I can get all the music I need to listen to with my computer but on a much more portable and battery friendly device than the tiny laptop that the HTPC has. So far I can't say it's a great deal but I've used it enough that I'm sure it can get the job done. I really do enjoy the quality of the sound and the microphone is quite accurate.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The main problem with the new Apple Watch is that you have to pay a lot for it. The Apple Watch Sport costs a lot more than the one with the silver band. The watch has better battery life than the last two iWatch models. You have to decide if it's worth the extra cost or not. I believe that the battery will last longer if you use a charger like this one.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm a total beginner to electronics. I was interested in getting into this as a starter kit. I've bought about 5 other sets of a few different flavors of the same brands over the years but this one has been one of my favorites. There's lots of parts to it and the quality of the wires and connectors and the battery compartment make this set very easy to assemble.   It has been a good starter kit for me and I expect to get a lot of enjoyment out of this unit.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The battery life of this is amazing. The battery will not last more than 7.5 hours on low power, but I can run a laptop off of it. It takes about 2 hours to charge completely on low, but then comes back up and runs the laptop all day. The screen is very nice. I have the 4GB model (256MB ram) and my laptop had a hard time keeping up with this. The speed of the graphics is a little slow, but the battery life is so good that I cannot complain.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The original Apple iPod had a horrible design, but this is an improvement on the original.   I use it for music, podcasts, and movies.  It plays nicely, and is easy to use.  A good deal.  This is the best portable music player ever.   Rated 4 out of 5 by J.M. from The best iPod ever This is my first Apple device. I bought this to play my music on my computer as i've had it for almost a year. I am so happy to say it is the absolute best iPod to date. The new design is perfect and the sound quality is great! The only flaw to this new design for the iPod is the battery life has been declining the past year. The screen is very difficult to read if you have a dark room because the display is not bright enough. However, that is the only negative thing to mention. This is a must buy for anyone who wants a portable device that they can play all their music on.  From the reviews I read, this product is no longer made, but in the box there are 4 more. I love my old iPod and thought I would give it another try with this new iPOD. It is soooo much easier to use, and it has so much more space than my old one, I had to take out the whole back. I really like it. Thanks
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The XB500 is a very solid speaker. I use the volume buttons on the back for controlling the speaker volume, which is what I was expecting. It is also an excellent "loud" speaker. Not to mention the quality is very good, and it does a lot of things right for being a $40 speaker.  I am very impressed with the XB5-1. I am very pleased with this device. The sound is excellent, and the quality of the sound is great. My previous "top" performer (I'm old) is a lot better with this speaker. The only thing I don't like about it is the lack of a bass control. I don.t understand why they didn't add a bass knob to the Xb5-3. I'm looking forward to the follow-up model because I don;t want to listen to the bass in my car for hours at a time. So I got it, and I like it, BUT I don?t know what to do. I really wanted to love the sound of this speaker, and then I realized how "heavy" the design is. I like the sleek look of the X2-1 better, I think it's a more refined design. And then the power and volume buttons were really uncomfortable to use and difficult to turn on and off. So if you are looking for a light weight and nice sound, this is not the speaker for you. If you are a serious audiophile, however, and you really like the look of it and the sound quality, this may be a great choice for you (just don? t buy a XB3-2).  X2-3 vs XB2-4 The X2 is a great performer, the X3 a better sounding one. The X3 is not a tweaker, it delivers, with no more bass than a standard 2 x 10, and its high end is not as strong as the X1. You can expect a bit more depth and space than with the older model. The bass is still very good. The bottom of the bass gets pretty deep, so you can expect to get more than you do on a 3 x 10. And the mid range is just as good as on the X-1, so if you want to play a mix of music on the road, this will likely be a good option. In the end I can?t recommend the X

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This monitor was a joy to use, and works extremely well as far as resolution and color depth goes.   I had to upgrade my TV in a hurry and this thing was a good replacement.   Awesome Monitor   When I saw that the LG 30" monitor was only $300 I jumped at the chance to pick it up. The picture is beautiful. The color depth is excellent, especially for the price. The input lag is also awesome.  Amazing Monitor  The LG monitor has everything you need in a modern computer monitor: The quality is very good (with that screen size, which is a great size), it is very bright (which I do not like in most monitors), it has great black levels, and it is really slim.  The only drawback is that it lacks an adjustable stand, so you cannot adjust the height or angle of the screen. I do, however, really like how the bottom is curved, which makes it very comfortable to use.  I'm a bit disappointed, though. The LG monitors have always been very nice, the monitors have never been cheap and I have never had a problem with them. This monitor has the potential to be a great monitor, but it lacks the adjustment that other reviews have noted. I would really love to be able to adjust the monitor height for a better view, though I'm not sure what I would do with a vertical stand, but this is a small annoyance that will be more than made up for by the excellent picture and colors.  "Perfect" Monitor  I was not expecting anything less than an excellent monitor, and was very pleased to see the price was under $400. For the money, it does not get any better, or more accurate. It will show you what you want, and when you want it. This is definitely a high quality monitor that I would absolutely recommend.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My husband and I loved this purchase, I use it to listen to music on my computer (it was also a gift from him). It's easy to use. The volume control is very convenient, you don't need to open the screen to see the volume. The speaker is nice and loud. The battery life is very long, the speakers are loud and clear. It's my favorite device now.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Sony BMG MP-CL1 is an excellent piece of gear that I can recommend to others, particularly if the idea of "noise cancelling" is appealing.   I have a BMG P3/P3-M1 microphone, and a Yamaha MX10 condenser, and the MP-1 delivers the sound of the latter with some extra punch and warmth to the vocals.  The microphone I have is also quite sensitive, which is great for close miking with a relatively slow dynamic range.  I also use the MP to record the drums in my band, and I was impressed with its performance there.  Although the P3 is my preferred dynamic mike, I also tend to use it when recording acoustic instruments because it's just as good at getting a good sound with some "oomph" on the instruments.  There's also a nifty little stand that adds a little versatility to your kit.  While the stand won't always be needed, the extra weight and a little adjustment will let you use it more comfortably, and in the past I've used it to elevate the drums so they don't stick out of the way when playing with a band. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I like the way the device comes out. The build quality is great. The fact that the device is made by a Chinese company and does not come with the typical "bulb" is a good thing, as there are no instructions to do anything with your device. I would definitely purchase a second one in the future, as I would like to have a second display on the front of my unit. The unit is definitely not a good option for anyone looking for a cheap e-cig, but it does not hurt that it is cheap and does the job well.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The only thing about this device I dislike is the fact that it comes with an adapter that plugs into the back of your TV. You could use the HDMI cable to hook up a monitor and then use the dvd-recorder to record all of the shows that you want to watch.    My favorite feature is its compact size:  I purchased this recorder to record my favorite tv shows.  It's small enough to fit in my pocket and I can't find a better quality dvd recorder that I can use with my plasma or LCD television (not to mention my LG 34" TV and Samsung 80" LED TV have better sound and quality than this). 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had the chance to play with the PDP-8, but not for more than 5 min, when I lost the keypad. I'm not a technical person, I only like to look at the hardware and the PDA. I was disappointed with the quality of the buttons:  I did not have a good time with the user interface of the PPC8 (I am a big fan of emacs). The keyboard is a problem. It's hard to type and not very ergonomic. I could use it, but the buttons are too hard and not comfortable to use (I don't know why they changed the layout to such a small number of keys - it could be easy to change, but this feels like a downgrade). I'm really curious about the memory card slot - I don't really care about the fact that it can only hold a maximum of about 10 mb (the default size is 10, but I set it to 9, and it's OK for playing music). The only thing I don 't like is that I cannot change the color of the LED - it's the same color for the whole device, so it's hard for me to tell what the function is. The microphone has a very good quality, and when used in conjunction with the virtual keyboard - it works really well. But the software is very much limited, so I'm wondering what's next for PDP? I would also like to see a program that supports some other languages, like Russian. The only good thing is that the battery lasts quite long. The software is not too bad, but it's a pity that it doesn't support other programs like iTunes, etc.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    One of the best of its kind, the Nixie Tube is my go-to piece for reading, writing and reading again. It has a light weight, small size and a simple design that allows you to adjust the tube in order to get the size that you prefer. The tubes are well balanced and easy to use. I'm a college student and I find the tube to be a perfect solution to the problems I encountered with the normal light bulb - no glare or dimming that can ruin a reading. Also, the tube will never burn out like the lights do.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The product is easy to use.  If I had to give a negative I would say it took 2 tries to get the volume right. I am not a loud speaker person so I was hoping it would be louder. However, the volume isn't as loud as I was expecting it to be.    I'm still very pleased with the product, though. It's nice to have a small speaker for when I have to use it at home.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:      Review by: John - Florida This is the best little digital radio I have ever had. Great for the price, not too bright, and does not blow your house up like an MP3 player does. This radio is exactly what I wanted and I did not have to pay for anything. It is small and fits in your pocket easily. I have it on the air about an hour a day and it never fails to get me to my destination.  Works perfectly! Review by: Mark - Oklahoma I've been using a cheapo little digital audio player for years. This thing is great. I use it to play WAV files via my iPhone, and I've never been disappointed.   The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's the same size and form factor as the iPod, so if you don't have an iPod or your iPod is dead, it might not be big enough for you. However, if your iPod has a built in amplifier, this is a great choice!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was so happy to see that the battery life was not just a fluke. It actually lasted quite a bit.    The first thing I want to mention is how nice the front panel looks.  A bit like the Lenovo T40 with a bit more screen real estate, but still clean and functional. The keyboard is great. It has a nice tactile feel to it, but is not overly tactile like some.  The backlighting is really nice. It's bright, but not distracting, and it works well. It will make your eyes hurt like no other backlight has ever done.      One of my main issues with the Thinkpad series is that I get headaches whenever I use them.  Even when using them with the lid closed, the hinges are so sensitive to the slightest movement that I end up losing track of time.  I'm glad to see a laptop with a lid that doesn't get in the way of typing or reading on the screen, and that does not have the same hinge as other notebooks in the Thinkpads line.  Overall, I really like the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am a very avid fan of my laptop. I recently moved to another state and lost my old laptop and needed something to do without it. I ended up buying this because it came with a lot of useful things to try out, including games, youtube, games, music, and more. The fact that it is also very affordable is icing on the cake. I've used it as a media player, web browser, and gaming console. This is the best deal around. You can't go wrong with this. I really hope that the price continues to drop and I get a few more years of use out of it.

Other than that, I'd highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I first heard of the e-mail-capable computer, I was somewhat sceptical. Not only was the price more than double that of a similar machine (and with no operating system), but it was just plain old junk. I was also quite sceptical when I first tried to make my own diskettes for it, because my PC had no optical disk drive.   The computer is a wonderful device. You can do a lot on it, it's very fast, and it's a lot more fun to use than I expected it to be.  And I got a lot of satisfaction out of getting it running for the first time and discovering the neat features.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a great portable amp. I have an older system with a pair of Celestion 6-8 speakers. I purchased the 12" amp because it was inexpensive.   The bass is very good, and I can now play louder without getting distorted or overly bright.  The power tube I purchased was replaced because the old tube is so dirty it doesn't work well and a replacement will be needed soon.  I use this on my Yamaha VL-M100, which has 2 Celestion 12" speakers, 1 Eminence 8" and 1 Pioneer 6" and 2 B&W 12" subs, with about 5mW output.  I use a pair on the back and a pair front and back on the front floorboard, and this amp handles both of the speakers well.  This amp has a very good sound.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a good product. The only thing I didn't like about it is the fact that you have to go through so much effort to adjust it. When you first get it, it's all about getting the balance right so you can't see your own hands. Once you do get it right, the device is pretty easy to use. It's like using a calculator, which is why I bought it. If you are like me, and you prefer something with a bit more buttons, and fewer buttons, this may not be for you. It is a bit of an exercise to get all the buttons and switches working, but when you have it all set, it works well and the device stays in balance. I don't like that the controls don't seem as good as the other ones I own, however, I've been looking for a good balance of the different buttons/switches/controls. I guess you get what you pay for. It will last a long time.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Joe from Good product with a couple caveats This balance scale has the advantage of being a simple tool with the most basic adjustment, but only when used with a proper balance wrench. You'll need to read up about balance scales to understand how to properly set it up, and how to make sure you use the right balance wrench, which I didn't know that I needed until I bought this scale. However, the advantage comes at a cost of price and convenience, since it's a relatively expensive tool, and one that can be very fussy to set up. As a balance scale is one of the only tools you'll need with a basic tool set, I don't see this a negative for anyone looking for it, but if the price is a major issue for you, I recommend you pass on it. ,,

I bought this phone because I needed an android device that could replace my laptop (I have a macbook pro that is a lot slower).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought a HP Pavilion 15" laptop for my husband and it worked perfectly, and has been a pleasure to use for almost a year now. I bought another HP for my son and it works very well. Both machines are running Windows 10.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have a nice laptop that's only a year old. It's an AMD Phenom 2, 2.4 GHz. It runs on Windows 7 and is powered by a 250 watt power supply. I can do lots of stuff on it, but it's a bit sluggish. That's because my system is old and slow. I was hoping to get an updated system this year, and it's been a while. But this new one has no problems with the power supply, no crashes, no overheating problems, and the operating system is fine. The screen is sharp and colorful. The USB ports are good, and there's good storage for the cost. My only complaint about this machine is that it's just a tad slower than my old one. So the speed isn't as great as I expected. But for the price and the fact that it can run lots of programs, the system is good and it does its job.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this to get a USB keyboard that would work with my X11 desktop.  The keyboard works really well with X, but when I try to use it with the PC it can't connect.  My question is:  I don't want to buy a keyboard with a proprietary connector (like the Thinkpad) since I don' want to deal with the cable.  I can't find any way to connect this keyboard to my PC without the keyboard and keyboard cable.   How can I get a working USB keyboard without the proprietary connector?   I also have a problem that I can not get it to work on my Dell PC:    When the keyboard is connected to my Dell pc, my Xorg driver (and other software) says:  "No such device"    If I use the driver, I can open xinitrc.txt in my X session and see that my USB keyboard is not present.   I have tried different drivers, and also the "Open Firmware" on the web:  "You are probably using the wrong xorg.conf file. The driver must be loaded by adding a line like "modprobe usb-keyboard". Or alternatively, you can use the open firmware package from your distribution's website: $ wget http://linux.die.net/man/8/open-firmware $ sudo apt-get install open-f Firmware version: 5.0.6, build: 6-0-2008 The firmware files for this device are: USB Keyboard Controller Drivers (5.0, 6-2008) You may also need to add a "device" entry for the USB keyboard to /etc/modprobed/xorg.grc "The above is not the default configuration, but I want to try anyway..."

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A year ago we used the TAC3 to make a 2D/3D computer game. It worked pretty well, but was not well written. A few weeks ago the T3 went out of production and we are looking for a replacement.   Our current computer is the iMac (a great computer). The problem is we cannot use the T2D to render the graphics we want, it would take too long to render everything we want.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was skeptical of a small computer with very limited RAM and internal memory. I thought a real computer was more expensive, but I was wrong. I had the first one about two months ago and haven't regretted it a bit. The only con I have is that the touchpad has a little scratch on it. It is not a big deal. My other problems are easily fixed by a simple software upgrade. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn how to use their computer on a budget. The first version is about $100. I was able to get an extended warranty. I don't know what will happen in the future, but if there is any downside to this device, it's probably that it doesn't come with the extra RAM, internal memory, or monitor.

I think it'd make a good addition to anyone's office and the software suite for it is quite nice. A big bonus for me is the fact that you get Windows 10 preinstalled. I can't imagine what it would be like to not have it. If you don't want to pay full retail, I'd say get this. You'll be glad you did!  I have used this computer for two years, as a work PC and for my kids' education. I have always been very satisfied with it, especially for its size. I'm surprised that I haven't written a review in years. The screen is the size of a small notebook screen and the keyboard is a big deal for me. The price is very reasonable. The battery life is also very good. It's a very smooth and quiet operation. The keyboard has an excellent quality, especially considering it is a full size keyboard. I do agree, however, with a reviewer. The software is a bit limited and has a lot of bloatware. The system also has a tendency to not boot as fast as my other PCs.

Rated 5 out of 5 by KK from Works well, but only if it works with other USB devices and the same time. I bought this device to use to charge a laptop in my car. So far, it has been very successful. But I am missing two things: It has two cables, and one cable has a USB-C connector but the other doesn't. I'm still waiting to see if there is a way to connect a USB port to an USB-A port. And it doesn't work with my Surface Pro 4. I am using this on an iPad Mini. It seems to work fine with my laptop, but it's frustrating trying to charge it on a Surface Pro 3. It's just a little inconvenient that the charger is designed to charge only one device at a time. What it doesn.t do: (1) It doesn't have a built-in speaker; (2) it doesn' have an IR transmitter, so I can't use it as a remote control, (3) it isn't backwards compatible with USB cables, so if I want to use it for my phone or a tablet, I have to use the cables or the car USB, (4) it can't do video or file transfers, but I'm not sure why you would want that as a feature anyway.

You don't have to use the cable to get to the Internet, which is nice for when you're at work but don't want to be plugged in. I can get the battery up to 8 hours, which it does very easily. I've got another one already because she asked me to. I have only had it for 2 weeks but I like it so much I'm going to get another one that I can set up in my studio room. I don't use it much at my house but it's great when I do. - David W.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have a Dell Ultrasharp 14.1" Widescreen Touchscreen LCD Monitor. This is a perfect monitor for my system. I use this to play games and watch movies. The color is fantastic. The resolution is excellent for video playback. I also have an HDMI cable and a soundcard. I have not found any reason for the sound to be poor. I think I have just gotten a great deal on this computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have the old version of this device, but it's better now. The old version came with a power supply, which was the real problem. The device is not powered by a wall socket. You have to plug the unit into a power source and then you need a power cord that runs into a wall outlet. That's an issue. The new version has two built-in power supply: one that draws its power from a standard 3-volt power source, and another that draws power from 12vAC power source. The current power supply only draws power if it's connected to a standard plug. I don't see how you can connect the new version to a power socket unless you add an external power supply with a 3-5v power input. The one I'm using now uses a standard power outlet. The unit is very well made and seems to last a long time. The build quality is superb. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:      The product is extremely durable.   I've had to change the batteries many times.  No leaking issues.  I will purchase again.  I'm using this unit to record all my workouts.  It's so well built and sturdy   In the past I would have had to buy a bunch of equipment to get this done.  I don't have to worry about a broken battery in the future.  Now I have to just buy new equipment.     It is very easy to read out your data when you use the heart rate monitor.  You don't need to open the unit to get your data and you can tell the power level of the unit. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    In short, I was impressed by the usability and the design of the device, which is extremely efficient and small. In the future, I would recommend this device in combination with a good computer (iMac or a Dell with a discrete graphics card). The product has many good features:  In a simple way, the device is not only useful for a short period, but also a good device for a long time.   It saves a lot of time from using a mouse or a pen.  One can use a normal mouse when one has a mousepad, or a normal pen when one uses a penpad.    It works in conjunction with a mouse for precise movements and the precision of the pen is extremely good.  I would certainly recommend this product to a friend, for both for daily use and for extended use.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It was hard to believe that the iPhone 4 was the last   major iPhone.  It's still a great phone for a very  low price.    I was   a bit disappointed that the screen is a bit scratchy but not bad   but i will have to get a screen protector   as soon as i can    Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from The price is right The camera is pretty good and has all the features I want, the speakers are pretty loud and good for my office, the size of the phone is nice, but it doesn't have the flash for night shooting which is a plus. The camera software was a bit slow to load but that can be fixed by the software developers, overall good value for a good phone and a great camera.  No matter what I do, I always get some weird problems. I have tried all the repair people out there and they always fix one or two problems but the other problems never get fixed.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As far as i am concerned, it is better than my old phone and more powerful.  The battery life is pretty great and it is very easy to use, not having to constantly look at the screen and think of things to do.   I use my   old   phone to call my family and friends.  If i could rate it   0   in every category, it would be a perfect   5.   Review of DJM-900 (Unconfirmed)   When I first bought this, I was excited that it would have a built-in microphone. I have the DJM 1000 (with no mic) and I have used it at a couple of shows and I've heard a few quality recordings. I am disappointed that it doesn't have a mic now. Also, the USB port is a pain. The USB port comes with a very flimsy piece of plastic with a few small screws. I don't know if it will still work, I've never had an issue with the USB. Also the only button on the unit is to power up or down (which I use to switch USB sources).  The CD player is pretty good, but the USB and the player are pretty bad.  Also, a note on the USB: On my unit, the player has no support for the USB power. When I power it up, I get a warning "USB device not found" and I try to connect a USB cable, but it doesn t work. What can I do to fix this?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this unit a couple of months ago. I've had no issues with it or the power supply. I just needed a better way to find out if my internet connection is working when it's not, or if I need to turn off the internet entirely. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It is a good device, but there are better options out there. There are no external controls, so you will have to learn how to use it. The battery lasts longer than any I have tried before, and the screen does not get too dim like some devices.   Pricey, but the experience and functionality is awesome. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Great sound quality, very good battery life and great battery life overall (12 hours on average, can't use for much after that).   I would recommend to anyone who wants good sound quality.    Noise is great. I've been using this for about a month and no other device comes close. I'm so glad I bought it. Great battery life, sounds fantastic.  Included with a 4 pack of batteries: 1 x battery for a stereo amp 2 x AA alkaline batteries (10-25 v) 1 x Batteries case with a rubber cover and 2 spare batteries.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The first thing you'll notice is that there's no speaker. In fact, the front facing camera is hidden away on the back so as not to interfere with the battery life. The 3.5mm jack is also in the way, but hey, this is a phone. The front facing stereo speakers are the only ones I have seen since the S6/S6 Edge. In some of my listening tests, they actually sounded better than I've heard in the S8 (and even the S7). In general, I think the speakers are very loud and clear - I can't hear a difference between the phone and the headset, even in a really quiet place. The rear-facing camera is also pretty good:  The rear camera is decent, but the front-facing one is a lot better. The camera sensor is also much better (though not really useful for taking video on this phone), and there are only two megapixels to be found. The photos and videos taken by the rear camera are also very good - there's plenty of detail and sharpness and the white balance was also good. The audio from the front speakers is also OK - not the best, but not bad either. Overall, I would say that the camera sensor and front camera are not really that useful, but that the rear speakers are. If you don't care about taking photos or video, and you don't really care about a rear camera, then I would recommend the Galaxy Note 8.  Note: I purchased this phone through Best Buy's online store and it was sent to me within 2 days.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was using a new iPad and wanted a better way to view the contents of my emails and my todo list. I've been looking for an app that could make it easy to view these things. I was happy that I found that app. I don't see how it could be better than any of the other apps that I've found, but it was a good starting point. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now. I use the widget that is attached to the toolbar to add my new items to my todos. It has been very useful. I only wish I had found it earlier. I look forward to using it even more as I continue to use my new iPad.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great app for iPad I have always used a mouse to edit my documents and this app has finally made it easy for me to do so. I find it easier than a laptop and it saves a lot of time compared to a pen and paper, but at a very reasonable price. Very easy to use, and the interface is easy to read. There is a huge feature list that is very informative. I would not hesitate to buy this app again and would recommend it to friends.  at least for the time being. but i have an issue with the app: for some reason, when i open a document with the document open with it open, it has the word "save" in a little "..." so whenever i open it with the file open it is saved and i cant change it, but if i close the document and then open it back with the saved document open, the "save it" is gone. so it seems like the application is trying to save the document when i save it by just opening it and not saving it when i close it. i guess the reason for this is because of the way the app saves the document but i think the default saving behavior is to save as soon as you open the document. this is a really frustrating feature, since it will just save the documents when you open it, then the rest of the time when you save the file, it just gets deleted. i hope they fix it because if they don't, i am going to have a really hard time understanding why i would want to use this app. Posted by Chris at January 16, 2014 03:04 AM

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It is quite good, but it will fail in the end. I have the blu ray of a very good movie, the sound is much better than the computer. The quality is excellent, the price is reasonable. I also own a hd tv that plays high def. So I cannot find a reason why I should pay $350 for the blu rays. That was my problem before with my old computer. It worked fine until it died or went dead. I think the blu rays will be fine for most people, except for the people that get all hot inside the blu tray, so that they can not close the case properly.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I used to be a heavy user of the old, hard wired iMacs and am very happy that the iMac Mini fits my needs.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I own both a PS3 and a PS Vita, and so I have some familiarity with both the design and the functionality. What's even better about the PS3 is the fact that the graphics and the processing capabilities are far better than the PS Vita. I bought this to use at my friend's house because we had never played a game together before, and the game came along really well. The graphics are very detailed, and since this is my first time playing a console game, it was nice to have some variety. This game also comes with several pre-made character sets, so there are tons of character options to choose from if you are planning on creating a group of five. Overall, I think this is a good little handheld game that will keep me hooked for a while.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - It's a very good, very fast, good sounding mic. It is very clean and has a very tight sound. - A very good microphone - It is quite cheap. I have a good audio interface in another room so I could record the sound from my pc without changing anything in the room. - The microphone has a strong sound and is easily noticeable. I like the sound quite a lot. - It works well with a good mic and a good mixer. The only problem is that it doesn't capture good sound. The sound is a little too dry, if you play the recorder in a quiet place, you won't hear much sound - It sounds very good with a very clean mic and good mixer, but with a bad sound, I can't say anything about that.   The Mic itself was well built and looks good, but the sound is not very good.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Ravi from Excellent microphone for the price. The microphone is easy to use. The mic is also small and can be stored in a backpack. The unit can be used with most mics, but may be hard to control. If you can use it with a mic with a similar sonic signature, it can be a great addition to a studio. . I do have some problems with the mic. When I first plugged it into my pc, it became very loud and distorted the sound. I tried a different usb port and still had the same issue. After some troubleshooting I found out that the cable is not a good one. I would suggest buying a proper microphone cable that has a mic plug on one end and a mono plug on the other. It solved my problem but it is a bit of an inconvenience for me to replace the mic cable every time. I also have the mic on my laptop so I can still use it and also the USB cable for the cable adapter on my computer.. The mic can be very hard to use, since it has a really small head. But once it's plugged in, it's great. I don't think it is the best mic, but for the cost, it is good. I use the mic with an AKG CS700A and it sounds excellent.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had my old Motorola Razr for years and had just finally got the chance to put it to good use. I was using the   phone as a portable music player (which I still am) and using the Razr as a computer mouse. So I got both of them a couple of years ago. And, to my amazement, the phone is still just as great and the  mouse is still useful. I have found it easy to navigate around the device (it has very good touch screen support) and the controls are very similar to my PC mouse.   There is only one issue I have, but it's minor. When you type in a large quantity of characters, you might have problems finding a place to put them. But you have to admit that the device supports very many characters, so it's not much of an issue.   Was this Review Helpful to you?

I give it 5 stars, not a 5 1/2, due to the price.  the quality is better than the one I had on my PC, and the battery is much longer.  and I am glad I went with this brand and model.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you have any doubts or concerns about this device, go for it. You may well find that you just get more of what you need, and save on electricity. It's the same story with my old Mac, and my PC. It still seems like a very good product, despite the problems it's had. It doesn't work right on certain systems, and the keyboard and trackpad can't be replaced, but those problems aren't the ones that really matter. In fact, that would be like expecting your old TV to work great on today's set-top boxes, or expecting your phone to work well on your tablet. The big deal with this device is the price: I haven't used it that much, but I've been able to use it without any problems for a while now. The keyboard is good, and is better than the ones on older Apple and Windows machines. The mouse is also good, although on some computers, the scrolling can be a little sluggish. However, if you can use this with older PCs, you will have a very nice piece of equipment. My only complaint is that the display is much too small. The key-cap is a bit of a headache, but you can buy a nicer one if you really want it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a very nice unit and has some good features including a very quiet motor with a light and very fast response time.   One of my favorite features is the remote to control my TV. I can control the brightness of the lights and the on/off on the lights (a nice feature that most of the remote do not have). The remote is a bit bulky but a very handy and easy to use device.  I also liked that you could set your television to an automatic channel and the TV would switch to that channel automatically as well as an external antennae/cable so I can watch cable on my computer and use my TV in the home theater area of the house as well.  The only down side I see is the cable that comes with the device has a very high resistance. I found it very hard to turn on my TV when the cable is plugged in.  If the cable were made from better quality material, this problem would be less of an issue.  Another con of this device is that there are three buttons on the remote for all the channels on the system. I really wanted to be able to set the TV to an internal antennae but I found this impossible due to the need to press all three buttons simultaneously. This makes it really hard to change the channel that you want to watch.  But most importantly, I wish I could have the ability to see my pictures on the TV.  Also I really wish the remote had the ability, to be on the ball and press all the buttons at the same time (like a video game remote).
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was my first time buying from ebay so I took my time and the product did the trick. I'm not a big fan of the color of the screen, so I was worried that I might get a good deal, but I got a beautiful, well built and well-sounding portable that came with everything I asked for in a decent price. I was actually quite surprised to see that the product had a 1 year warranty. I also liked the fact that the screen was not dim like some cheap ones. This device is more than worth every penny.

Battery life is great! :)  Cons: I wish I had gotten a USB 3.0 port. The USB 2.0 ports don't work as fast as the USB 3 port.  Review: It's hard to find any negatives about this computer, but I did have to buy a different battery because the one that came with the machine was only rated for 30 hours. Otherwise, the only negative thing I found is that I have to wait about 5-6 hours to see the battery on the laptop. It is also hard to type on the glass touch screen. I used the touch screen for my business for about 2 years. It still works, but you know it is there.  is a great computer. The performance is excellent. The battery life is about 5 hours. The only thing I wish is the keyboard had a touch screen  I got this computer for my son who is a student at a state university in the west.  a great machine for the price.  the glass screen is a little large for my taste, but its better than nothing and the touch interface is great. I was disappointed that the battery was not included. but I am sure most other buyers would not mind having the battery included, or at least not so small.  in terms of keyboard and touch I am very satisfied.  of course they are not that good but they are still a very good computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have the Samsung UN55H850N and I love it.  I like that it has all the features of a normal laptop, but it doesn't come with any of the other things that I need, like a webcam and stylus for drawing or writing notes.   The keyboard has great feel to it and the trackpad is great, but the USB cable can get very tangled if you don't know how to tie it off.  The screen has great picture quality, but can be difficult to see in direct sunlight.  As for the audio, I think it's a little tinny (especially compared to the computer speakers I have) but it sounds better than any other laptop.  My only suggestion is that there is not a way to charge my phone with this device because the port is tiny, but my laptop can charge my phones because the phone can use the laptop's port. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I bought my first set, they had a "one month warranty" that I found so much better than most warranties. They are the best and I will buy them again and again.  I like the sound quality and the compact design of the unit.  "Great portable stereo" "Great Portable Stereo" If you have ever wanted a portable Stereo with built in tuner, this is the device for you. The amp and speakers are good quality. If you're on a budget and don't want a ton of amp then this is not the device. The quality is great for a portable unit. You can't really get a good portable stereo for the same price as this unit. But if you need a good stereo on a tight budget it's a solid choice. - Michael - West Haverbrook, FL - 08/12/2013   The only thing that could be improved is the cable length for the output. It should have a 30ft or so. (2) (2/17/2012) Review by: Michael I have owned a few of these devices. They come in handy when out and about and don;t have a need for more than one.   They fit in the palm of my hand and are incredibly portable.  , (5/14/2014) Review and Update: If you find that the unit doesn't operate correctly, contact the company immediately. The warranty only covers "manufacturer's defects" and not defects due to user error.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A great gadget I bought this a couple of weeks ago and I am so happy with my purchase. The first thing I did was to change the battery on my samsung galaxy s3 but the original battery that came with the device wasn't doing the job so I replaced it with a brand new Samsung battery. The new battery is a little bigger than the original but it is still not that much larger. When I first bought this i thought it was going to be a tiny little thing but it turns out that this is a really great device and fits very well in my hand. The controls are very easy to use and they have a lot of functions. I am currently using my new device and I love it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am just finishing this book, and I love it. It explains and describes the hardware and software in detail, and provides many examples and real-world examples of how these pieces of kit perform.   The best part is the "getting started" section, where the author shares his experiences building a real system from the ground up. It has also been a nice read, with lots of useful information about the hardware that is covered. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound quality is very good. It has excellent bass and it really can be heard from a distance.   I don't mind paying $50 for a decent sounding headphone, and this one has a nice sound.  I like my headphones to be somewhat transparent. This one isn't completely transparent, but it has a good amount of clarity.  The cord is long, but not too long.  This is the first model that I'm not completely unhappy with. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this monitor from Best Buy (which had the worst price) and it looks great. It does a great job of being a "realistic" monitor but with good color, brightness, etc. Overall, I am very satisfied.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought one of these to use as a phone charger, which is handy since it's small, light and charges in just a few minutes. It charges my iPhone 4S in 15 minutes (and the same for my new Nokia Lumia 920). It's also much more efficient than using a battery case or plugging into a power adapter.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this for my son as a gift as he loves all kinds of electronics, particularly computers. He has it connected to his computer and has had it for about a week now and is extremely happy with the quality and the convenience of it. I haven't yet tried it for my own use as I am not sure how reliable it is, but it is very good at what it is intended to do.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you're looking for a cheap way to create electronic music, the Roland TB-303 is a great option.   When you first hear the tone, it can be a little lacking in clarity, but that's to be expected with an old synthesizer.  After some use, the sound quality becomes very nice, even if it is somewhat grainy in spots.  While it's not a MIDI controller, the pads can be mapped to different instruments, allowing you to make music with no accompaniment.  When it comes to sound, the TB-3 is one of the best sounding synths of all time.  It has very high sound quality (like a good digital piano), and is able to replicate a ton of different sounds. The TB-503 and TB-606 are really too cheap to recommend, and I wouldn't even recommend a cheap Roland with only 8 effects if you can get it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the Sony PS3 a couple of months back and was looking forward to using it to play some of the old PS2 games. I have never played a game on the PS3 but have used it to look at some older games (such as MGS4) on the 360. Well, a couple days ago my brother-in-law brought it home and immediately started playing "WWE 2K12." I was so happy that I decided to buy him the 360 version of this game and have it delivered to his house. This PS3 has been a good purchase. I also bought a 32GB USB stick for music, movies, pictures and ebooks. This is the best way for the person who doesn't have time to use the PSN or doesn't want to get the PSP version to play on their PC or Mac.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have bought this to replace a broken one at my old job. It's a nice device. It doesn't get the job done quite as well as the old one. The speakers are pretty loud, but they are very tinny. It gets a good workout in my car, so my wife doesn't care for it. It also won't fit most glove boxes. Still, it's a good device, and I'll buy another for the new job.

I also like the waterproof option. It does run slow sometimes but it is very smooth. The watch is very thin and light. There's a lot of watch faces to choose from.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love my ipod. I play rock n roll and it's easier to carry than a real drum kit. I bought my second ipod and also bought a gf pro. I am looking forward to many more years of good music. - Paul  "I was so excited for this product, I ordered it yesterday, the music is really good! - S.M.   Thank you for making this a reality. My wife is a professional drummer. The fact that I am able to play with her and that the equipment is better than anything we've owned is such a bonus to our band. She can be a little shy of the kit and the bass isn't great but now she's a fan! - J.R.   is it worth the money, we tried to do all the right things, but the gfpro is terrible, we really like our gfg and i feel like its a better idea to get that gfPRO and then just have to spend the money on the g-fpro, the gmpro is the only way to go, this is a good device. - JB   Great sound quality, nice looking. I don't need to worry about not having music with my ipods while on the road. - R.M   I've never really bought electronic stuff because my drum kit is in the studio. The only other thing I've purchased is a keyboard, and that wasn't a great purchase either. So when I saw the G-FDPRO I was happy with the fact that they had a lot of features I didn't even realize I wanted, and it looks great and feels great. The other thing is the price is great. I've used many electronic drum kits, and the quality and quality of this is like no other. It's not cheap, but it's worth it to me. - B.T.   and I have been using an ipod for a couple of years and I was not really impressed with it until I received the GFDPRO. I was skeptical that the sound quality would match the quality of the ipod, but after trying the GfdPRO it's pretty good. Now that I have it I've been looking for a good quality set of drums for about two years. I can not believe how good my acoustic set sounds now. It was such a chore to lug around my acoustic drum set, but not with the Gdfpro set!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've owned my Sony Xperia Z1 for a little over a month now, and I love the device. The camera isn't the best out there, but for a compact phone with an 8MP camera, it's good. I find myself using the screen a lot more than my phone, though I still use the camera as well. It's a fun device to use, and its performance is great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is an excellent speaker, with superb output and excellent bass. The build quality is excellent, and is very similar to the Pioneer PLX 705, with better battery life. The PLX does not have the same high output, however, the KX3 has much better bass and is less fatiguing to the ear. I've only used the K-100 (without a battery), but it has excellent bass response, too. I highly recommend this speaker. The only negative I can find is the ability to use both the 3.5mm and 1/4-inch inputs on one cable.    Sound quality at high volume:  I've used both the K100 and the PLX705 for the same music files, and I cannot tell the difference between the K300 and PLX. I believe the PLQ7100 is a much better choice if you need a lot of volume.  Cannot recommend the K3:  While I like the KA-BS3/BS3.1, and use both with my KA100, I cannot recommend the device. This is my first pair of stereo integrated amplifiers, and they've been my main integrated amplifier for almost two years. After purchasing them, I decided to try to run them both together. I ran both at full volume, and had a horrendous result. In comparison to my old pair of Sony BVM-2000's, these are way out of line. I can't run them independently, they are just way out the mark. I'm glad I had the K200 in my collection (and still use it with my BVM's), but these are just too much noise for my liking. I have no idea if they are faulty or not. I tried to contact the company, but they were only interested in my return. I do not recommend this product.  Was this Review Helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been playing with this for about a month and have been very pleased with it.   The only thing I do not like is the fact that it does not show battery level (that I understand why as it is designed to replace the batteries for the device in question).   There are no complaints from me on that matter.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I can honestly say I don't even use it very often because I prefer the sound of the built-in stereo speakers.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm a long time fan of Philips Hue, and after using it at work for a week I think I've figured out how to best use it.  The instructions are thorough and straightforward and the Hue app for iOS and Android is pretty solid.  But the main reason I've stayed with Hue is that I like the color and the way it looks (even when not configured).  This is the first time I've owned a Hue bulb (a Philips hue bridge) so I'll admit that my experience was a bit rough, but if I'm having trouble with it, I've found this site to be a great resource.  For the first month, I'm happy with how well Hue has made itself available.  While I can't speak for the quality of the hardware in general, I do think it's better than the standard "cheap" bulbs.  I've also used the Hue bridge for about two weeks now, and the new version is a big improvement.  This means that there's plenty of Hue bulbs in my house.  What's more, I like that Hue bulbs come in a range of colors, which are customizable through the Hue apps.  Overall, I have a great experience with Hue, but I'm really hoping Philips makes a "cheaper" version of the bridge that's more widely available.  Rated 4 out of 5 by TheCoupleMoms from The bulb is a wonderful addition to the home's lighting I bought this bulb, as I wanted to add a nice white light to a dark room and my husband likes the dim lighting. The bulb was easy to install in the ceiling and to use. I use it in my bedroom, but it's a little bit larger than the other bulbs we have in the house so we can put two or three in a row. So far, the bulbs work great and look nice when the lights go out. The only thing I have to say is the cost. It has come down in price and the shipping is a lot better. I hope this isn't the only bulb they produce, but so far it looks and works great.  and my experience. Installation was quite simple, just like every other Hue product I've purchased. It's got a good range of options to configure and it's got an easy to read LED display so that it's pretty obvious when the bulb is on.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my favorite keyboard that I have used. It has been the only keyboard that makes me feel as if I am really typing on a computer keyboard. I also like that it does not vibrate or buzz when you have it in your hand.  Rated 4 out of 5 by JimM from Excellent Product We have used the keyboard a few times, but it is definitely more complicated than we expected. However, it is also a great keyboard if you just want to be able to type. It does vibrate when the button is pressed, but the noise is quiet enough to not annoy your roommates. The key spacing is better than we were expecting, especially compared to the Apple keyboard. We prefer a smaller number pad on a Mac keyboard and this is just what we were looking for. We do have a Dell XPS, which has a similar feature but with a smaller spacebar.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This thing is a miracle.   The unit comes with a power cord, so I was able to power the light with a wall adapter.  The light is very bright for a small light and comes with two switches for "flashing" the light as you walk by.  With the switches I can turn off the power and the light, if the wind doesn't blow it back up.  It is very versatile.  I used the light to check on my chickens, and to see if the chicken coop had been built properly.  There is no power cord that comes with the unit, but I was not too bothered since I don't run the light on any battery power.  Once the light is up you can walk by and it will turn off, then turn on, then power off.  This is a very well made device.  If you have small pets that are difficult to watch from a distance, this is a fantastic device that does its job perfectly.  Overall I'm very happy with my purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have purchased several different models over the past 2 years and have been very satisfied.   The USB port is very reliable.  I am glad that you offer them with a two year warranty   It is very convenient to be able to switch between 3.5/5.25/9.5mm versions   While using the 5.25mm version my thumb can easily get tired from the awkward shape and I find it easier to just keep on using the smaller version.  As with the previous version I have had the same trouble with the 5 and 9.5. The 9.0mm feels almost too wide and I have to grip the base so tightly that my fingers start to turn red after about a week.  Very impressed 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this to replace my old PC. I had read good reviews about this device. It came with all the cables you could ever want in the world. It has been working perfectly for my use and the only thing I have noticed so far is that the speakers are a little loud for the money. I like it and will continue to use it in the future. - Bill T.,  USA  I bought this to turn off my Xbox. The speakers were not loud enough for my Xbox and the game turned it off. But, with the help of this unit it is now back to working perfectly again. - Jules B.,  the Netherlands  Used it to replace old cd-rom drives. It was just what I was looking for. The sound was much better than the old cd drives. Very happy with this purchase. - David K., / United States  It took a while to find this, but the sound from this thing is fabulous. I have several old computer soundcards that I use as CD-ROMs, and now I have the sound quality I have been looking for from a CD-R. I use it with my Yamaha R-3300, a great guitar player. The only problem is the volume control, which I cannot seem to find on the package. But it can be adjusted. And this thing looks amazing. - Jeff B., New Jersey

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound quality is really great, I'm not a big fan of the sound of my iPod and other mp3 players (most of them have some sort of "chintzy" sound quality) but this thing has a really great bass line (not to the point that it is annoying, just good enough to be heard) and the vocals sound great on it, which is why I rated it a 5 instead of a 4. The only thing I'd say is that I think this may not be the best portable amp to use for recording. The sound is great in terms of volume but the distortion (or lack thereof) on certain songs can be really, really bad. If you want to try a portable amp with distortion, I suggest buying the Audio Technica AT-8. It's not nearly as loud but is WAY cheaper (also comes with an extension cable, I highly recommend it), has a larger battery pack, a better, nicer, more comfortable carrying case and has a built in speaker.   I've always had a very high opinion for the Sony PRS-101 and I'm glad I finally got a chance to try the newer version:  My only issue is that it's only got 1 input (for my guitar) so if you want a multi-input device that can handle a few amps (like my JBL LSR-300) or some effects like reverb or delay, you need to get this.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    After reading all the good reviews about this product I bought it a few days ago to use for my home server. The product is a beast and the support team is extremely helpful and informative. The only thing I have a problem with is that the cable is so short that it is hard to connect any ethernet device (laptop, monitor etc) to the serial port, even though it is just a 3 pin connector. It does however provide ethernet support so you can use a wireless mouse/keyboard or anything else you want to connect to it.  Rated 4 out of 5 by jb from I needed a mini usb usb hub to connect a PC with usb drive as well as a wireless keyboard and mouse. It had to be a 2 port hub, but I had no choice but to get one. A little heavy but works well. I would like it to have better specs than the other mini usb hubs I've looked at, but at the price point I'd expect it to be the best available. My only real issue is the fact that I don't have a switch to turn off the light on the back. You can see that it's not plugged into anything, so I'd rather have it off all the time than on all the times that it happens to run the power supply. It's still a great hub, just not the best mini usb hub I've seen. - - -  i got the hub and have to say its a great product, no one could complain about this i have tried many different brands and the only thing is that it wont let you get any ethernets from the keyboard and mice, only keyboard or mice only. but that's just a minor problem, i really like the hub because i have a laptop with usb 3.0 and i still like to have my hub so when i run my mouse i dont have to worry about using the usb 2.0 dongle. overall very happy with this product  -  I have been using a hub with usb 2 port for a long time, however this one is really the best I have ever used. When I first put it together I found out I could connect 3 devices to the hub. Now that the hub is connected, I have 3 more devices connected to the USB port! Very easy to install on the motherboard with the included screws. I have had no issues.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this to go with my   i3. I've always wanted to use a monitor but the size was so huge that it would always fall out of my bag on the airplane. This is perfect for when I travel, and the colors are really good. The resolution is crisp and clear. The only thing is that the resolution doesn't seem to be that high. The   3   screen I've got with mine seems to be a little brighter so I'm not sure which is the best.    Review of DJ0268-00 Submitted By: Andrew K. - Verified Buyer My wife just had an  i5 and wanted a replacement screen for the laptop on her  i7 with the 1080p screen. This has a nice wide viewing angle, it is not the lowest resolution but the screen is huge and gives a good picture of what is on the screen. The size is perfect with my 15" i7 and 1080p monitor. It is not very good in low light but for movies, I have no complaints.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My old Dell laptop is going to be a death trap when I get it into the recycling. This is not an exaggeration: it's the most useless device I own. I like the new iPad, but this laptop is a total disgrace. The touch screen is a joke. I can't remember a time when my MacBook Air had the touch screen. The keyboard is bad as well. It's terrible. The only thing you can say about it is that it's better than the Surface Book, but at this price, I expect more than that. I am going to get a new Dell desktop soon.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have had the D5100 for a few months now, and I have had good things to say about this monitor.   I have been looking for a high quality LCD monitor that can run at a high resolution and run smoothly at 1920 x 1080.  The first monitor I tried out was a 24" Toshiba 24" with the very good PVM.  And I liked the fact that the monitor had a fast refresh rate (160 fps), and it gave a very clear picture.  This D5200 is a bit on the higher end for this price, but for this kind of price the screen should be good.  And for a lower price point, I have been very happy with the Samsung 4K panel, and for the price, the screen looks quite nice.  I have also been looking at the QNIX QX2710 for some time and the fact it runs on USB-C (I'm not using the built in display so it's not my monitor), the fast (I think 240 fps) refresh rate, a high pixel density (3840x2160), and a good resolution (2560x1440) is great.  It's a bit expensive, but when you get a monitor like this for $400 or less, you know you are getting a good monitor.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been looking for this monitor for a long time. I'm glad that I finally got one, and I'll be making sure I am using it. My main complaint is that this monitor does not come with a USB hub like the other HP monitors have. I really like that I can plug into my computer and not worry about any sort of connection issues. I wish there were a way to buy a USB adapter for the monitor for $25 instead of $130.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The keyboard is very good. A perfect size for my hand and the keys are very responsive. The size is good as well for traveling. The only minor complaint I have is the volume control has an extra screw on the bottom for ease of accessing. I wish there was a small hole on the inside of the case to access the volume screw. I can't get my finger in there, but I'm assuming it's there to facilitate changing the volume settings on the fly. The screen looks great! The resolution is a bit low for the price point, but you get what you pay for.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The design and the interface are very well done. The sound quality is a good.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's a great little thing, but it's too small. The battery is tiny. It took just enough to get through the night without the charger. I wish they'd make it a bit bigger. If they did, it'd be a perfect small car phone for the car. The size and weight are great for traveling, but the lack of battery life is annoying.   Price - for the size, it's good. For the price, you can't beat it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A must-have device, especially for those that want a more traditional look. A nice, very well made device, and easy to use, I do wish the color could have been a little lighter, but it is still a very good device.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This product was excellent for the price. I bought this after seeing the reviews on the product but was a little wary. I got it and it works pretty well. The sound quality is very nice for the money. It is very easy to use and I get it working on my laptop and iPhone. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was that it is a little cumbersome to open and close. But for the cost I can live with that. I would have given it an 8 out of 10 but if you want a small compact desktop you can't go wrong with this.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This product is the one. It will do a lot and it's much better to use a mouse with this. It works so well with a mouse. This product allows to use all the functionality of a mouse at once.   The only bad thing about it is the price. The price is a bit steep. I hope it gets better.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Mark R from Great for the price I use this mouse with the Logitech G710+ and it really helps when I have a lot of typing to do. It was fairly easy to setup for me. The software setup is a breeze as well. I would highly recommend this product!  Review of DJ Tech Tools, Logitech Z170 Optical Gaming Mouse - Black - with Bluetooth - Black I just received my Logitech Gaming Mouse Z170 in a great condition. It arrived with a new cable but it was still in very good shape. The packaging was just like it should have been. It's just a good looking mouse so far! The construction was great and the buttons were well done. It has a good weight to it but not too heavy. The weight is perfect. The design is also pretty cool. The scroll wheel feels like a good idea. I had a problem with my old mouse where it didn't click well but this mouse is great. I really like the weight as well but then again, my old one did not. It is a very nice mouse with lots of options. One thing is very bad though. The buttons are very clicky. It would have been nice to make them a little softer so I could use it for a long time. Overall, a good mouse but maybe if it was a bit cheaper, I would have preferred something a bit more quiet. But at the price point, it's a great deal and I'm very happy with the purchase.  Logitech Gaming mouse with bluetooth  -  The first thing I noticed was the size of the Logisit Gaming mouse. It looks a lot like a typical mouse. I am very familiar with mice but this one is different. I thought it had a similar shape to my old Logitech gaming mouse (I bought it around the same time as my new Z170 Gaming Mouse) and thought, "Hey, that looks like an old mouse." It was not. The Logitech Logitech is a lot heavier than my old Z170 (which was smaller) and has a
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is an excellent piece of electronics, especially if you are a musician. The sound is very good and the overall sound quality is much better than many headphones and earbuds that I have. It works great on my iPod, I am using a portable music player that has a mic.     The earbud cord is so short that it is impossible to take it with me to the next gig, so I have to put it into my guitar case.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this for my older daughter who has always had a lot of trouble with touch screen devices and with other people using her devices. She used a tablet the first day we used it, and then I bought it for her. She loves it! She had to have an adapter for her tablet, but other than that, everything works great. The only thing she really misses is the extra buttons on the side of the phone, so hopefully she'll get those on her next device.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    -I bought a USB keyboard to use with my laptop (MacBook) and I can already tell it's a great product. -I like that it's waterproof and I don't have to take out the battery and I get more use out of it than I thought I would. -It is a good size. -There are a lot of different keys on the keyboard. -You have to press a few keys to get to a key you want, but it works really well. -The keyboard is a bit loud but it gets louder the more you use it. -Weirdly it doesn't have the number row (like some of the other keyboards) it's missing and I'm sure the number key was put on there for some reason, I'm not sure why, but I didn't even look at it that closely but it's the only thing that bothered me about it. I've heard people say the keyboard keys are loud, I disagree.    -I used it for a month and found that it is really good, it has better quality than some other keyboards I bought, the keyboard feels very good in my hand, is really slim (even though it's larger than some mini ones) and it's compact in my pocket.  - I love that it has built in batteries that last for quite a long time, and that it doesn´t have any external power. - I like that the batteries have a button that you press to change the type of connection (battery or USB) and the battery lasts a really long time. - If you want to take pictures with your computer and you don´t want to bring your laptop to a LAN party, this is the keyboard for you.   I bought a laptop that I'm gonna use from now, so I have two keyboards:  I used my old keyboard all my life because of the lack of a number row but then I found this keyboard and I absolutely love it.  It's a very small keyboard, maybe a little larger than a mini, and it has all the functions like the number keys that you'd expect on a standard keyboard.  This is a big keypad because it's big and very slim, which is great if you have a small or large desk and don't want to have to worry about a lot more keys on your computer keyboard. It feels great on my fingers and feels a lot like a standard PC keyboard. I don´´t need more

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm very pleased with the phone. It is super easy to set up and use. The software is very easy to use and has saved me from so many headaches. The phone works great and is easy to read all my text messages, call and email. I haven't called my brother or mom yet and I really have no reason to do that now. I wish they had a GPS on the phone so you can go on hikes without having to look at a map. But, otherwise I can't complain. You guys are making a hell of a lot of money and you can make it better by adding a GPS and more features. Thank you very much.  Review by Eric This is a great phone. Easy setup, no problem getting on the network and texting or calling friends. I'm a bit disappointed they don't have a GPS... (Posted on 5/25/2012)  Great phone This is an excellent phone. I like the camera, voice recorder, and speakerphone. The only problem I have is with the fact that it does not have a digital clock. The other reviews say the phone doesn't have one and that's true. The clock is always off when I'm on the road. 's is the only feature that's disappointing to me. I was very excited to purchase this phone and use it to make calls all the time. I can only use the voice recorder to make voice memos. And when I use the speakerphone, I cannot hear the speaker. The camera is very good but you can only take photos on the screen. There is a small menu to turn on the flashlight and the speaker but I can not access that menu. When I turn off the light, it turns off all my settings on the computer. I have yet to figure out why this happens because I have no problems with the rest of my computer. The GPS, which is a feature I had been looking for, is not on the menu. Also, the battery life is not very long. I am a very heavy user and a heavy user of my GPS device. So, I've been looking at this phone with interest to know the problems with it. Overall, I'm satisfied with the product and am excited to use it more for the next trip. (Posted-on 4/17/2012 by mikie)
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased a Wacom Intuos Pro 8 pen recently and the tablet came to me super fast. The tablet feels super smooth and feels like you could run it through your computer. The pen feels a lot like the Wacomm pens I used to use in high school so it will come in very handy in class and when doing assignments. The only thing is that the screen is not that bright. I purchased the pen at a great price and i would definately buy again if i needed a pen in the future.

If you are using this to read on the computer, you will need to make the device smaller as you don't have room for the entire drive. The quality of the audio isn't great but it's just for computer use. The only thing is it's very difficult to read the audio in the book.  You can get by with a small book but not a hardcover.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The XO-2 worked as advertised. I have only used the XO series with two other laptops, one being a Acer Iconia A500 and the other a Dell Latitude E6400. Both laptops were running Windows 7 Professional 64bit. I installed an older version of Win 7 64bit and both laptops would boot and have no problems booting on the XOT-2. The only problem I have had is a problem with the power supply and battery. I plugged the power cord into one cord, the cord from the power cable to the laptop, and the battery into the other. I then connected the power plug to the power source and connected the battery cable to a battery pack that came with the XOM. The XOM had no problems getting power. I was able to use it for a few hours without the power, then the laptop would turn on and it would stay on, but I couldn't get the battery to charge. If you have a Dell XO then you should get this computer.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good quality radio. I am a new comer to this hobby and had to do a little research on the Internet to find out what the difference between these two radios is. I had been using my old cheap and junk radio for years and my old radio was not the best radio. So I did some research and discovered that these new and great radios are the same radio. Just a little better. I was skeptical about this purchase but ended up spending a little more money to get one of these new radios. It's been 5 years since I first had an electronic device so I thought I would treat myself to one of the most inexpensive ones. I received it yesterday and I think I've learned a lot about the radio and am impressed. I'm very happy with this purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I purchased a 2.4ghz quadcopter a couple months ago, I had no expectations whatsoever and was very excited to use it. However, a week later I realized that the transmitter I purchased would not connect to my quadcopters remote control! I'm used to flying on 3.3v but when flying a quadcop with a 3.4g transmitter I would have to use a micro receiver or use the battery pack or another 5v supply. I also could not power it via the 3.7v that it comes with. I ended up buying a 7.4v quadcoptelectronic with a micro usb and a 5v power supply. This thing is really good. I was really happy with the battery life. It was only using the 5v from my micro receiver but my battery pack is already in the quad. I'm using it for my school band and the 3v on the battery will go for hours and the quad will run for a while without losing power. Overall I really recommend this product if you are looking to have a quad with good performance and great quality at a great price. I would not hesitate to buy this again if needed.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this about a month ago and have used it for about a week now. There are two problems with this device: 1. When you hit the up key it will put the device into standby mode. I had to put it in standby in order to turn it on again. 2. There is a light that shows when the device is connected to a TV. This light also flashes if the device has an error. I use a Samsung TV but I can't tell if this light flashes when it is connected or not. I would say that if you're a big fan of Samsung TVs then this is a great buy.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The new i-pod 2 is a wonderful addition to my iPod.  It has the volume buttons that you get on the older model but they do not turn the volume down, only up.  The headphones jack on the back is nice to use and does the job well.  I wish I could get a digital version and the same price for the original.   Overall:  I have been listening to i-Pods on and off for years.  i-pods are a nice product for people who do not need all the bells and whistles of a higher quality portable system like a CD player or MP3 player.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was looking for a new computer and decided on the Sony Vaio SRS-B1, a relatively inexpensive computer in my opinion. The Vaio is a solid system, not as good as a laptop but good for everyday use. The screen resolution is adequate (800x480). The performance is adequate to do some basic things. The display has the usual problems of flicker, but it is only noticeable during the night (not that it is bad, but I find it distracting in normal use). It is nice that the screen brightness is adjustable. The sound quality is okay. The speakers are fine, but not great. The only thing that bothers me about the system is the fact that the USB ports are in the front. I would like to be able to charge the computer wirelessly without having to remove the battery. I think that this would be possible if the front panel was redesigned to have a small space to add a micro-USB charger. Overall, a good choice.    Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great for the money. I bought this for my 13 year old son to do his schoolwork on his Sony laptop. It runs very smoothly and the battery lasts long. The keyboard and touchpad are well built and have been tested by him and it works well. The case is a bit small and small buttons make it hard to press but it works just fine. It can be hard to get a good fit for a Bluetooth mouse on a small machine so I think the keyboard is a better choice. The design is great and fits in nicely on any desktop or small shelf. There are a few flaws but other than that I like it a lot.  2nd generation Vaio srs-b1.

I have been using a 3-4 day old battery for about a week now, and I have only gotten one photograph. I called Panasonic, and they sent a new battery in a few days.

It does have the built in LED that shows the keys pressed, but there's no way to control it. I bought it as a USB keyboard and it's great for that.

This product is definitely worth the money. The quality is great and the price is perfect. I really like the fact that they made this thing so easy to use.  to my friends who don't like typing on computers and who wish the keyboard was bigger and made of harder plastic/metal:  To those people, look elsewhere. I have a 5s with a mechanical keyboard and while I can type fast on it, I like the smaller, more ergonomic keyboard with a soft rubberized cover.   To those people who think there are no keys:  There are more than 60 keys on the keyboard and they are all mapped by default to some function that you can easily use.  To my friend who uses a tablet:  The keyboard is a great tablet keyboard for those that have a tablet or a laptop with a trackpad but you don't want to use the keyboard: Just buy a good tablet for $20 to $30 or go buy a keyboard on amazon  P.S. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I got my iPhone I had been looking for a smart phone and had been disappointed with the other phone's performance. I was also disappointed with how long it took for me to receive my phone from the company. Now, I've had mine for 4 months and the phone is still going strong. I had the Verizon version for a while and it worked pretty well until the new "NFC" system. The phone now has trouble connecting to my car or other devices due to the problem. It seems that if I use it on one device I get an error message about my account being used. I'd suggest that you send the email out and send your customers a copy to give them the option of switching. The new NFC system has not been very popular. Maybe because you were late to the party. You have a long list of problems: - Phone freezes up - Bluetooth isn't working - Wi-Fi connection not working - Battery life is not as good as others - Doesn't work with my cell phone - Won't charge if you have a lot of data on your account or use your battery to charge your phone - Not compatible with the Samsung Galaxy S7 - Won the award for worst phone!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I would have liked a few more buttons, but that is not a big deal, and a couple of them were very easy to use.   One downside is the screen tends to get warm when playing for long periods.  If you do want to play games, you will find you will need to buy a case for this model.  Also, they do not have a CD, so you will have to use a game.  I recommend this model if you want to run your music and video without the fear of damage to your equipment.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this to have the ability to have multiple people speak in my presence. It is a great product. I would definitely recommend.  My new favorite.   The sound quality is exceptional. The ability to use different voices at the same time (without a computer) is really cool. I also like the fact that it has multiple settings so you can change the volume levels of each voice. It's nice to be able to adjust your volume on-the-fly. Overall, this is a fantastic product!  I would buy this product again   This product is outstanding and I will buy more in the future. I use this to speak to my sons in school (a 7th grade class) and use it to have my wife and children at home. We enjoy the ease of use and versatility of the voice changer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love the   quality of this device.  I used this device for a year to teach students about the effects of drugs.  It really helped students deal with feelings of guilt.   The only problems I've had with this   device   are that I wish they had better instructions,   and the  is quite flimsy for a $100 device.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have two of the   iMac   It's hard to put into words how   the  iMAC   feels in the hand.   The   weight of the iMac looks really great on the  desk, but when you have it on your lap or on a bed you   need to find some balance with how the keyboard is   positioned.  When using it in the  full portrait or landscape mode,   it   doesn't   feel very solid.  It   is  very   expensive at the  high price tag, but   I  love the  iPhone   and I want to   have one of those on hand for all my   needs.  I am very pleased  with  i  my  i Mac.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love this gadget! It is small enough to fit in my bag and easy enough to use. The only thing I didn't like about the device is that the batteries don't last as long as I would like. Otherwise, a great purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My wife has had a very expensive, very noisy, and very difficult to program, PC for over 2 years now. Now that she has the Pro-series Pro-15, she is very happy with it!   It is very quiet in operation and the display looks better than it's previous model, but what really stood out to us was how much faster the computer was to load data from a CD.    The first time I used the new Pro-5 was on a PC we had previously upgraded from an IBM Model M. We tried the machine and had it load our whole data library and was surprised at the difference in performance.  It was the fastest PC we ever upgraded from a PC. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I don't remember the last time I used an electronic device in a more professional manner than the Samsung S3.   The interface is clear, quick, and simple.  Aesthetics are good.  I can't imagine any other device having that level of clarity and accuracy.  The only problem with the interface is that the camera menu takes up a lot of screen space (about two thirds of the S3).  The menus are intuitive, but the interface will never be as easy to use as the phone. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound quality is excellent!   It's pretty quiet on high volumes and even quieter when it's not on.   I'm not a fan of electronic music but I have to admit that I have become more fond of the D6.  This device does work well, but is not as good as a traditional DJ mixer.  I use a DJ mixer and it does everything I'd want it to.  The controls are very good and easily customizable.  They're not quite up to DJ quality, but they work pretty well.  My only real criticism is that the volume control has a weird clicky mechanism that I've never really gotten used to. Overall, I really enjoy it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using the EKD iX3 waterblock for quite a while now, and have never had any problem with it. I run a Gtx 1070 (I am also using a GTX 1080) and a Corsair H100i cooler on the computer as well.  This product is a little pricey but in my opinion the best you can get on the market at this time.   Pros:  Very little fan noise, and only a small amount of pressure on the radiator.  All fittings can be accessed from the top and front of the case and can be removed easily.  Great value for money   Cons:  This unit does not come with a backplate which is a bit annoying.  There is also no cable management with this unit.  The waterblock does not support Gtx 980 Ti yet so the card has to be soldered to the PCB.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I received the Sony A7R II today and I have to say I am very satisfied. I have a number of Canon 5D MKII and Canon 70-300 L lenses in my camera bags and I was worried about the resolution and how they would handle the higher resolution, especially when the new Canon EOS M10 has similar capabilities. I also have a Nikon F7000 in my bag and the Nikon does much better in low light. I've seen the EOS 6D with more resolution and the E-M1's sensor has a lot of resolution but I've been a Canon shooter for a very long time and have never had a Sony camera to compare to the Nikon's resolution. I was very happy with the results of this camera and now I'm waiting for a 35mm prime lens. I haven't seen a lot on the web about this camera so I don't know if there are any other Sony products coming out or if the 5D Mark II is still coming. I hope I'm not wrong but I think the 5d is very close to the resolution of the 6d in many situations. I can now get very fine results for landscapes with the E6D and the new 6D.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As of now the best device I have ever had the pleasure of using.  It takes a while to get used to, but once you get used you are pleased you purchased it. The sound is good for the price and the battery life is good to good for a phone.   The only thing I wish was different was that if there is any issues with the phone it will not restart.  This does not happen when I touch the power button, but the phone will shut off and then restart.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have had this watch for about 2 weeks now and it works great!   The watch is fast and accurate!  I bought one as a birthday gift for a friend.   It has been great getting notifications of text messages and emails.  The battery is not very good but that is the main problem with the watch. I have had the watch charged about 4 times and the battery has still drained very quick. The watch comes with a charging case.  It does not come with a wrist strap and is too short.  Also it is hard to see the seconds on the time when the watch is in wrist mode.  I like the battery life and how it charges very fast so I keep it connected to my iPhone.  This watch is great for the price.  The watch is not perfect

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this about 2 months ago because I wanted something smaller. The size is perfect and it's got a lot of features I like. For example, the screen is nice and big (I am 6'3" and around 170lbs). The battery lasts for hours and when the phone is completely dead, it just comes back to life with a single click. It also has one of the most accurate touch-to-place buttons I've ever used, and the headphone jack is good. It can connect to my iphone for a bluetooth headset. My biggest complaint is that the speaker is a bit weak but that's easily fixed. The only downside is that it does use a lot more power than I think is good for the size.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It's a nice device. I like how it lets you adjust your speakers by moving the slider on the bottom. I'm on the fence about the sound, but it has decent bass and I like the ability to adjust the volume.   I use the app and it's really easy to use, but the app isn't optimized for android, so there's a lot of lag sometimes.    I really like how I can get a list of music I like on a whim.  I was also happy that there is no need for the internet on the phone while you're out.  This is the kind of thing that might really help me when I am out with friends and want to take some pics without internet. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the third one we have purchased. Each has worked well.   One of the most important features of the original is that the batteries are sealed, which means they don't leak or leak a lot.  We have used our new battery in the first unit we have bought and are very pleased with it.  It's better than we expected.  The batteries are a little more expensive, but it's not a deal breaker.  All of our other electric fans we have had have worked okay, but the one on this one is one of the best.  Thanks,   - K. W. - New Orleans, LA
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a great device that I highly recommend for anyone who wants a good quality portable audio device for the price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this product in order to improve my internet browsing experience as I had a lot of trouble finding good reviews online. The unit is great in theory. It can be easily connected to a network and connected via the Ethernet port to a PC or laptop. However, I bought a wireless router in my house that I did not use when I first bought the product. The device worked better with that router than with my previous router. It also is very sensitive to noise and interference, which made it unusable for gaming, particularly on a large screen or high resolution monitor. If you use a router, this may work fine for you but this is not a good product for your first computer.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have used the iPhone 4 for a long time and always loved it.   It is the most powerful, most advanced and most intuitive phone I have ever used.  It has always been easy to use, and the iPhone has always seemed to be a step up from the PalmPilot.  The iPhone 5 feels different and is great, and for me it is a great improvement over the previous iPhone.  I just received the iPhone 5 and really like it so far.  If you are looking for a nice smartphone, the iPhone will do the trick for you. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As of right now I am very satisfied with this product, the only con I would say is that it is a bit loud so not exactly perfect for sleeping, but that is an option if you're looking for a quieter device. Overall, I recommend it, though as far as an "electronic" sleeping pad goes it has some things to get used to (like you can't get a back up if it is accidentally dropped) but is very comfortable.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It works perfectly. It is a little noisy when powering up, but is not an issue, just something to be aware of. It does sound a little like a car stereo when in use (as opposed to the phone I have with a headphone jack that doesn't make that sound), but that is fine, the headphone jack is already on my phone. I can listen to my music on it, but I use an iPhone for calls, etc. It also has a good screen resolution, looks good, and is extremely easy to use (just plug in, start, and you are ready to go).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm not too sure how well I can describe the sound of this speaker. I'm fairly familiar with a few other brands of speakers (Beyerdynamic, Denon, etc) and I've used them and listened to them.  I listened to a number of different music genres: Pop, Rock, Pop, Hip Hop, Dance, etc and was quite surprised at how well this speaker performed.  My wife and I are listening to the same music for the first time and I can't tell you how happy we both are with it.  For the money I'm a bit disappointed with the speaker (the sound is really just alright), but that's probably to be expected for this price. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this device for my family member who was in the hospital and needed something that she can use while she's on the phone. The phone is very large and bulky, and there's no way she could carry it all in her one hand while using her other hand for other tasks. But this thing is great! It has a built in speaker that I can crank on when she needs to talk, or turn off if I'm talking to someone else. There's also an alarm that goes off when it's time to take the phone in. The only down side is that the battery doesn't last long, but I could just buy a second one for next time and replace it as needed. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The only problem I have is, the charger. it is not very efficient at all (the USB port is the only way it charges the battery) but the other thing is, if you do not have any charging accessories, you have to use the USB port. but the best thing is the product itself. I will always recommend this to my friends who want to change the battery.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good battery with a minor problem I own three of these. I have two of them connected in series so I am able to charge my iPhone 7 battery to 100% in 30 minutes. When my first one died on me I tried charging it from an iPhone 5S. It was a short charge that ended the phone's battery life. Then I went and bought the USB adapter, which is a must for these batteries. When it arrived, I was expecting a big fat ugly bulky thing. But when I plugged in the adapter the battery appeared to be the same shape as the other one. And that's not a good thing when you've got the charger sitting next to you and it charges twice as fast. I'd buy it again but I'd just buy the USB battery adapter because they look so similar that you'll probably not notice the difference unless you are really focused on one thing at a time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The Zephyr V2 is the best of the current products from the Zephir brand. This device is a perfect fit for people who like to use their computer while on the go, and for those who have computer equipment on hand but don't have enough time to use it regularly. The V2 comes with an optical sensor, which is a great feature, and provides a "feel" for the cursor and keys to ensure a proper typing experience. The program interface is clean and intuitive, and if you ever have a problem that requires technical assistance from a computer, such as a lost file, you can call up the help-desk feature and they'll be able to connect you with someone in no time.   There are a couple of issues I had with the V2, however.  1) The program comes with a small, "tray-type" disc in which to store programs and user documents. However, I was able to make use of my Zephyrus (and even the computer) without any problems. However I couldn't seem to get the program to create a "drop" of my user documents in my disc. This seems to be a software bug on Zephia's end, so I hope this is a rare issue. 2) A minor drawback is that the touchpad on the V1 is not as smooth as the V3's. I can't help but think that it may be because the software is more advanced on the 2.  3) The biggest issue is that it's the only computer mouse with a "flicking" action, which can be very problematic for some people, even though it's not really a huge issue.

So if you want a smartphone and don't want to spend a lot of money, then I think this is what you are looking for. Unfortunately, for the price of a "normal" smartphone the experience isn't as good as it should be.   The battery is very good (I think around 9-10 hrs) but this device also has a bit of a hard time charging from a phone charger. The fact that you can't plug it in overnight and the fact that it has no internal speaker makes for a very monotonous audio experience, as opposed to the iPhone and even the Samsung Galaxy devices which have a built in mic.  .  :). It is a good looking phone. The only problem I have with it is the design. The bottom has a hole cut out that allows you to fit the headphones in the earpiece (they don't stay in the phone when the headphone jack is plugged in, which is annoying), and the bottom has tiny bumps on the inside that are so small that they are hard to see under a magnifying glass. That's just annoying. I'd give it a 1 for design.   the screen is fine - the one thing it has going for it is that it is very sharp, but it also is a little hard to read under direct sunlight. - May  "It's the little things that keep you from being great."  - David Copperfield - May   "This is the phone I've been waiting for.

No more charging my phone to death   I have a Motorola Droid 3 phone, and this charger does not charge it. It says it does but it does not. I had to buy another one after the one I bought burnt up. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    One of my best purchases ever!   This phone is a great phone. The price is right and it is the best in it's class.   It's extremely responsive, easy to use and to the point.  The app is well designed and easy to set up and use.  I've been using it almost every day since I got it and have no complaints whatsoever.  This review may seem negative but it's just how I feel about this product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've had this device for about a month now and i really love it. It works really well, and the screen is bright and clear.   The only problem is that it only fits two USB cables, and one of them (a micro) has no usb port on it.  My brother in law has it too, and he loves it. My only problem was that it didn't fit in my wallet. That being said, i still love it, and would recommend this to anyone looking for a good light.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the E-MU A1 when it was first released but never had a chance to use it. When I had the chance to buy one, I bought one.   I had a E-M1 which is a bit outdated but the A1 is a great upgrade. It's easy to use and has a great sound that will put any other system to shame. If you are in the market for a new rig, this one is the one to get. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a t-mobile s8 from a co-worker who told me that the color of the screen is slightly off-color. I also noticed the screen had a slight graininess and a touch of ghosting. I'm glad I got a brand new s8 with this phone. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently bought the G4 Pro and I am very satisfied with it. It was a great purchase. The build quality is great. I was a bit hesitant about spending money on a larger display but I am glad I did. The only issue I had was that the battery charge indicator was just a little to large for the large screen on the Pro. I put it on a desk and I don't notice it charging or not charging when I am writing, and it never charges the way it should. Other than that, I'm very satisfied.    Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this for my computer so that I could play music on my   PC . I thought it was a nice product so I bought one for my  computer too. I am using a   Soundcard  and I have to admit that it is quite nice.   If  it were a little bit more I would have bought it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my first electronic device. The screen is a bright color, and the menu is easy to find and navigate.  I have not found any bugs so far.  The microphone is very quiet, and there are several options to make the microphone more powerful.   The phone is very thin, but it is strong, so I would recommend this phone to someone who has a very weak hand.  You may notice that it feels better in your hand than my Samsung Galaxy S4, but I like to keep my phone slim to minimize hand fatigue. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this unit several months ago, and have been very happy with it. The unit is very easy to use, and the sound is crystal clear. My only complaint is the size of the battery. I would have liked a larger, more powerful battery (like those found in larger devices). I would like to replace the battery in the unit, but I doubt that will be possible.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This   is   a very good electronic tool!   The   head   that   comes   with it   it  is   the   best   ever   made.   It   has   very   long   cord and a   good   weight.  I   would   recommend   this   to anyone.   Good electronic tool, but... Review by james  Price Value Quality I've used these a while and found them to be pretty reliable. However, I recently ran into the problem of having two batteries. It took a little bit of searching on the internet to discover that this is a problem with older model EPROMs. A quick trip to the electronics store fixed it. I guess I can recommend this, if your a seasoned electronic mechanic. But if you just want a very reliable tool with a decent warranty, I'd recommend something else.  Great tool for repairing and keeping your e-waste safely out of landfill. Review by mike  Value Quality Price I bought this tool after reading numerous reviews. I have found that most people do not make the right decisions when buying an e-tool, so I did my research. As a mechanic for the last 40 years I know that nothing lasts forever. I bought one of these in case I break it. It has served me well. It is easy to carry, not too heavy and easy to operate. It's a very simple tool to use, but a good one. The problem I have is the battery life is short. If you use the battery frequently you will need a different battery or a good quality battery charger. That's it. But I guess that's why they sell them for $50.00. The tool works. It only needs a battery if you are going to operate it a lot. I've had it for a month and it's still working fine. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a reliable tool. And the battery is cheap.  the new model is very good! Review by Mike  Quality Price Value The new model e-tracer seems like it will have a longer run time. Also, it seems like there is less interference from the signal if your using one of the many digital to analog converters out there, so that could be helpful if you use one of those. This was my second one

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The only problems I had with the camera were (1) the battery (two packs in the camera) was dying quickly - one pack after a month and half of continuous use, the other pack after about four weeks. I finally got a replacement from Canon - the last pack of batteries died in the store before I got the replacement - but I wasn't able to swap it out. (2) the lens is fine but the lens cap is made of plastic and when the cap is removed the lens starts to fall off when the lens hood is not attached - I ended up getting a new cap (no longer in stock at the store) - (3) the camera is not very easy to set up (the camera menu has a couple of bugs I had to fix in the manual). But those were only minor inconveniences - it's a very good camera for the price. I'm very happy with it and will continue to use the camera.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Dave from This camera is great. I have a Canon Rebel and I was tired of the "chuck it in" type of image quality. I was looking for a new camera with more bang for the buck. I took a look at the C100 and bought one. I love the high quality images this camera provides. The lens, while not perfect, is great for travel and the shutter is silent. I bought this camera for a special shoot at a nature preserve for a small fee. I thought it was a good deal, especially when compared to the big bulky cameras. I can't wait to shoot wildlife and scenery for my clients. : I have had the C200 since I got it. I shoot weddings with my Canon 600D. It's a really good camera. The only downside is that the shutter sounds like a loud click when you press it, like a Canon. The picture is nice, though.  the Canon C100. I haven't had a chance to test it out yet but I am looking forward to shooting with it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought one of these for my son's classroom. The kids love it! It's very durable. It's not easy to find in our market place. Great service from my local Walmart as well.  5/5 I ordered mine on Friday morning from walmart and the product is on it's way to my home I will be ordering one for my daughter's classroom I was very impressed with it  Customer Service Reviewed: 5/5 Very happy to find such a great price on the CEL monitor. I like the fact that they use a high resolution instead of low resolution and I like that they do not charge a ton of money for it. I also appreciate the fact they make the monitor in the USA which is very important. Thank you!  The Perfect Classroom Monitor for Your Classroom This is a great monitor for a classroom setting. We use them in a middle/junior high school to teach music and also in the STEM classroom for our high school students. They work great in both settings with no problems. This is our fourth monitor we have purchased through the CEC. We were very pleased with the workmanship. The price is very reasonable as well, I got the monitor for $109 when it was on sale a few months ago. Overall, I would recommend the CEMEX CEL Monitor. I will definitely be ordering more of them.  with the right accessories they can be a great option for the classroom.  that is not to say that they are not the right choice for the right student, it all depends on the purpose for which you want to use it.    I just received my cemex ccel for my classroom. My 4th year student will be using this in a STEM class. I'm very happy with this product. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using this unit for about 5 years now and my first computer was a CGA Atari 800. Since then I've added a lot of computers and systems. The keyboard and the joystick are both really great. It's nice that the keyboard doesn't have the loud clicking sound that the other keyboards have.   The sound on the joystick is better than any I've ever heard. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     It's a good replacement for a old mechanical one. It's not the best, but it gets the job done. I also love the keyboard! I really like the touch pad and the ability to use the mouse on one side and a joystick on the other! The problem is, when you switch the mouse to the other side, you have to use a different joystick for each side. You just can't have it both ways. You can't use a joystick for the left side and the left mouse on the right side. I don't understand that. It just looks stupid to me! The joystick can be tricky to use, even on my high-end desktop PC, and I have to move it around. The best thing about it is, you don't have to hold down the button to power it off if it's off. It also has an auto off feature. So I've been using mine the whole time I've had it! The keyboard and joystick also work together. So if you want to make your mouse work on both sides, I would get this.

I think I will order from Amazon because of the lower cost.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The best thing for a novice is to get an A/V box and to learn the basic things about the program.   When I got a box I was not sure what I was getting into. When I looked inside I was very surprised.  The A/VP-8 is very good. It allows me to play the songs I have on cassette.  I do not need my soundman to tune my turntable. The program is very easy to get started.  If I ever need to play in a larger room I will be very pleased with this box.  My wife was surprised when I bought it for her and is now a huge fan.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was really impressed with the features of this device.

Also, I really appreciate the fact that I can use my iPad for the same purpose. It's great that they include a HDMI cable to connect this to a TV or monitor (the HDMI cable came with it).  Style & Comfort - The case is a bit heavy, but the light weight of this unit makes up for it. It is also very lightweight compared to other mini refrigerators I've had in the past. Also very comfortable to use and cool. Overall, I am very happy with this model.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Michael from Does the job The small mini fridge fits well on my kitchen table with plenty of room to handle large foods. It has a touch screen that is easy to use with a finger and it's easy to set up. There is also a USB port. Overall a good small refrigerator that fits well and is well built.

The battery life is great, and it is easy to manage all of my various accounts.    The only reason that I can not give it a higher score is because of the screen size of the iPhone 7.  I would give it an 8, but it would be very hard to find a case for the phone in a reasonable price.  The design is excellent and the software is excellent. I would recommend this to all the iPhone owners out there.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the Nucleo 2 a few months ago. It has been a great device and I think I have the biggest battery of any battery backed device on the market.   The only thing I am dissatisfied with is the battery life.  The Nucleus 2 does seem to charge fast but then it dies as quick.  This will be a good unit for people with heavy duty needs and for people who just want to go back to the old days of a normal mobile device.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Chris from Great power! The new Nucleon 2 battery is great! I bought it to charge the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. It can charge it super fast, but it dies soon. I can now use my other Samsung phone and use my power bank, Nucleotator Pro, to charge my phone in the evening. I have a USB charger so I'm not using a wall adapter. Also the battery does look cool, but that might be because I'm trying to sell my old iPhone 6s Plus. ,  ,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my second eurorack module, the first was an older one, the only thing I liked about it was that it came with a jack to plug into the computer to connect it to my studio. However, I wanted a little more bass - so I added a low impedance op-amp to it, and I had better luck with the other op-amps out there in the Eurorack market. The new version is just as nice as the old one (except the fact that it has a 1U rack space, but I don't see how you could have too much bass), and if I ever need to get a new one, it will be because I already have a good one!  Great sounding and built like a tank. Just bought a 2nd one, 2 of these modules, all will be buying one of these more. Thank you for making quality at an unbeatable price.  Just received my module, and was very impressed. I wanted to add the low impedance buffer to my rack system, but my other manufacturer didn't sell the low current required to drive it. I have a Boss RV-2 and the Boss RV1. This module comes with two inputs: a 1/4" TRS (for the main inputs of my RV2) and a 3.5 mm headphone jack (for my RV1). The two connectors on the side can be swapped. I don?t see why anyone would want the RV2 (i.e. just to use the 1/8" output on a rack), since the 1-channel RV1 already has it. The audio signal is very clear, and it's easy to record a kick, snare, etc. I like the knobs for the main channels (I have the middle and left channels). Also, the headphone jack is very comfortable. It took me a while to figure out that I was supposed to use a 3 mm jack (instead of the headphone) because it uses less current than the headphone. However it does have a very nice quality and sound. I will buy one for all my rack/performer setups.  in my studio, i have used it for my 2.1 system with my Binson and the output on my RV-1 is perfect for the 2.3 (i just replaced the Binson). and it has the same sound as the B3 (without the buffer)  I ordered this module a couple of weeks
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - If I would have known how long it would last and the quality of it, I would've bought it.   I purchased the item for my son to use for his homework.  I would say that he is using it quite well.  After only a few days of using it I noticed the screen was not working properly. I contacted T-mobile customer service, the person I spoke with was very knowledgeable about the product. He was very helpful in getting me a replacement unit. The replacement unit came within a few hours. Thank you for an excellent item and service.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   " I purchased this keyboard after I purchased a second (older) iMac. The keyboard was an improvement on the older keyboard, and the iMac itself was very good value. I just wish that they had included some USB ports on the bottom of the keyboard. The USB ports are not very deep and are covered up by the keyboard casing. In retrospect, I should have purchased an adapter to plug into a USB port on my new iMac as well. The adapter was $9.95 at Wal-Mart. The replacement keyboard is a little smaller than the one I had. The back of the replacement keyboard did not work well. I had to tape a piece of sticky tape to the back of it so it would not come apart. The key switches are slightly different. The switches on this keyboard are much stiffer. The tactile feedback on the keys is better than the old keyboard I had, but not enough to make a difference in my typing speed. The case on this one does not have a rubberized coating, which is nice. This one has rubber coating. I have to tape the plastic portion of the case down to prevent it from cracking. I think it looks nice. In my opinion, this is a very good keyboard. It is inexpensive, durable, and just plain fun to type on. I recommend it highly." -- John R. "I've had my new EH Pro Keyboard since a few days and I love it! I love the layout. I've gotten used to typing on the new keyboard but am still able to type much faster. It's super smooth and nice to type with. The keys are all very quiet and the keys feel very sturdy. The only downside is that my first one cracked in half the other day. I don't know if the keyboard company is going to send a replacement but if I ever need to I'll be sure to get a replacement. Thanks again to EH." -- James G.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am very pleased with my purchase of this monitor. The quality and versatility is excellent. The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star is because of a few annoying bugs. It has some problems with color calibration - but that is really only a few seconds after a calibration. I will say the only thing that would be better is if there were an auto white balance option for the monitor.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am a music producer from UK who wants to share with the world the amazing sound of the Roland SP-01. It is so light that it feels like you are not carrying it, especially when you start to play.   My only gripes with this unit are the following: 1.  The interface could be made of a metal plate that could withstand repeated hits from a guitar, or a heavy-duty plastic enclosure that could stand up to a car's engine.  2.  The power supply could be a little more robust and reliable.  3.  I have not used the MIDI function yet.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was a little worried with my first purchase, but I must say, it's been great and the fact that the buttons are recessed, makes it a lot safer to press.  The keys are easy to push on my keyboard, and they're comfortable to touch. I really love the design of the keys, I just wish it could be a little thicker.   
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I received the iMac mini which is a nice looking device for someone who likes the look of a mini version but with all of the ports and functionality of the full size iMac. If I can get by with having only one USB port on the back of the imac it will be nice.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I received this on Saturday evening and it was on the way to my door this morning!   It's nice to get your hands on an E-Reader to read when you don't have time to get out and use your phone.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought a HP HP TouchSmart 7-Inch Tablet PC for my son. The tablet PC has been a lot of fun to use and is great for his school work.   The tablet has many great features that is easy to operate and is good for the price.  I also like the easy transfer from one computer to another computer as well as the easy connection to his phone and tablets.  Overall I am pleased with this purchase and would recommend to others. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My first electronic keyboard was an old IBM Model M model keyboard. It had a great build quality and was very responsive, and a very fast computer. I used it in conjunction with my old school Apple IIe. It was a great keyboard that cost $100, so I bought another to keep with my new computer.   This keyboard is well built and comfortable.  I like the fact that I can change the keys on the keyboard, I've been using "normal" keys with the Apple II (as opposed to the "soft keys" I used in the old model)   A simple but useful keyboard:  I used the old Apple keypad on my Apple II.  If I have any complains about the keyboard (or any computer, for that matter) it would be that I have a little trouble using it when I'm in a tight spot. The keycaps are the same as Apple's (which is to say that they are slightly larger than standard Apple keys) but not quite as tactile. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The device is very sturdy and it doesn't look cheap at all. If it were me I would buy one just for the looks of it, but it's nice to see what the possibilities are for making some cool mods with this thing. It's just a shame you can't buy a charger for this, or at least a case. I'd buy it again if I could.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've always had this device in the house for years. I have it hooked up with my laptop when it is not running but I still have my regular laptop and my old notebook.   The only reason that I give it 3 stars is because there's not much in the way of apps that I can find to make things better. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I like this radio so much I can't live without it. It can play and record all formats of music (with a CD burner and a turntable) from my computer and it plays a lot faster than my old analog radio. This radio was a life saver during a horrible hurricane in New Orleans, and during the earthquake in L.A. It's definitely a keeper.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am not a computer guy, but a new computer fan bought this device because I needed an external hard drive to get a computer up and running in a hurry. The device is very easy to install, and does what it is supposed to do very well. I also like the fact that the drive is a external drive and is very portable. However, I must disagree with the reviewer who said the only good thing about this device is the ability to use it with the computer I purchased this for. While the USB ports are convenient, and it is simple to plug into a USB port, the speed of the device is way too slow to be of much use, as the USB port is only 5.0. On a different note, the device's software is terrible; it is extremely slow, even compared to the Windows XP I have used in the past. So, the only thing this product does well is that the speed is good.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I really like this headset. It's light but very comfortable. I don't use it too much because I prefer my headset to have a microphone and volume controls, but I do listen to a lot of music. The only thing I'm not a big fan of is the fact that they're still using batteries as a power source, as it's annoying for the person to have to take off the headset to charge up the battery, especially since there's no real indicator to tell you how much battery is left or how much time is left. And the fact it doesn't come with an adapter for portable mp3 players. So yeah, I don. t like it much, but it's pretty good.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I use my iPhone every day. I use a GPS tracker and am pretty accurate with it. The GPS tracker I purchased was a gift for my girlfriend, so she is always on top of her life. The fact that I know when my GPS is within a certain distance to a certain point makes it easier for me. I can't complain, but it is a little pricey for a good GPS tracker like this one.  Satisfied Customer Review for The Runner GPS 3 (Review Author: Joe K.) :  Great product. Got the tracker after looking at the 3 others, and the price is right. Great product. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:      The keyboard and the trackpad are very smooth to use. It is nice that the keyboard has multiple key options, too. The trackpad is very responsive and can be used with a mouse or a standard keyboard. The only drawback with the trackpads is that there are no special features for the Mac users that I'm used to.   There is no way to customize the track pad for each application that you use, but the track pads are usually good enough, and can actually give a very good performance.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love my LG G Pad 8.3.   It's one of the best devices I've used in a long time.  It has amazing battery life.  Even when I go out of my way to take a lot of pictures and video, the battery can easily keep the thing going.  The screen is awesome.  I've been wanting a tablet like this for a long while now, but I think I'm going to have to buy an Apple   iPad when it comes out. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It is so light in weight, but it also has lots of features to make you look smart and efficient. I use this device at work when I am doing an overview of what I have done over the weekend, and it has been very helpful in finding all of the necessary information. My wife loves the touch screen function and I have a lot of fun using it at home!  I love this device: I have used this device almost daily for the last 3 years and it just works. I am very impressed with the way it has performed with the daily tasks that I have gotten it to perform. The only complaint I have is about the color of the case. It seems to be very clear for most of the time, but the screen becomes a bit dark when a picture comes out.  A lot of value and functionality in a very portable device: When I bought my first laptop many years ago, my main concern was a lot more ports to put on it (for the age I was when I bought it), but when I upgraded my laptop to the latest version I decided to go with the Macbook Air. I was looking for a device that would have the ability to run multiple programs on it at the same time, like the iBook or the Asus Transformer tablet. This little guy has done just that. . But the best part? Its very small size! I have the white and it looks so good! I love to use it as a pocket and as a little tablet when I want something light enough to take with me for a short trip! -J. B.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The VIA EPIA is a very good little box. It's got a lot of great features, like a very clear screen and an SD card slot. The only thing it lacks is some sort of internal DAC which would really make the device a lot better. But there are a lot good features here and for the price you can't beat it. I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you don't need a fancy digital music player (or an external amp) but you don 't want to compromise on features, this might be the right choice for you. The sound quality is above average. I am a very forgiving musician, so this is the first digital interface I have had to use (in a different category from computer speakers). I have used several "good" audio interfaces in the past (a Roland S-500 or Korg MS20). The first two are very good, and the Korg, although not as good as the others, is a very nice and simple interface. The Digidesign PDP-1 is really a hybrid: it is a good interface for computer players (I have been very happy with my Sound Canvas Kontrol), but also as an easy to use computer/music player/CD player.     My only complaint with the PDP1 is that I wish it had a digital output. As an analog music player, it's a bit lacking. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The most useful and fun gadget ever. A couple of flaws:  A bit of flake (small) on the plastic on the button switch that connects to the battery, that's not a big deal. Just replace it with a new one.  The main screen is fantastic - a fantastic feature in a product with this feature is that you can use it on your desktop! Not so on a tablet or phone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I just received my first Apple TV 3. I am completely amazed at what Apple has done here. It is a great value for the money, and Apple has put out a product that is very fast, easy to use, and very responsive to my input on any issue. It's been a bit of a learning experience, but I am very pleased with my purchase.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The first time I used the S2 Pro I set it up and it worked very well. The user interface is easy to use and all controls work properly. The battery life is great (I have a 9 hr work day) and the sound is very good. There is no way that I am going to switch to a different brand when I need to use my computer, I just bought a new laptop this past week so it makes me feel even better knowing that the S4 Pro is my backup! This product has saved me a few hundred bucks.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - The iPod  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love my iPad Air 2! It is much smaller than the iPad mini (which is a great size for a child). My kids (3, 4 and 8) use the iPad at school and the mini is hard to find and have to go looking for it. The iPad Air is light, so it's easy to carry around and kids can use it while sitting on the couch. My kids love having their books on their iPads. The only thing that could be better is the "smart screen" feature. You can see what you're typing on the screen but it doesn't highlight the words and letters. Also, the Air 2 doesn't have a dock for the iPhone 6 so you can't use the Air to use the iPhone with the Air. Overall, the iPad is a perfect device for kids. They love using it and have found all the fun apps on it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The first thing you can tell is the build quality. The case is very sturdy, the speaker is good quality and it really gets loud when you hit the buttons.   It also has a good build quality, and the speaker works very well, too. The software isn't that good as it isn't fully customizable, but you can download a few skins. The camera is also excellent, so good that when I took the picture on my iPhone, I was expecting to get a flash.  The sound quality is also really good.  There isn't much volume to the speakers, but they're louder than I expected.  What I don't like is that you have to press the volume up button to hear any sound coming from the microphone, which is a big turn off for some people. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I like the sound quality, and the color is very nice.   This is a great deal for the money,   The only gripe is that there is a significant delay before the tone comes out (almost as long as the sound of a real guitar),   but for what this little amp is worth I think it is a good value. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've only used it for about three days, but it seems to work really well.  It is quiet and efficient.   It also has a nice feature where the battery is replaced and there is a built in charger.  This is my first electronic device, so I'm not sure how well it will hold up over the long haul.  I have not tried to turn it off, so perhaps it will work for a few more years.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was not expecting such a nice design on this device, and I'm really enjoying playing with it. The build quality is as advertised and it looks fantastic. I had no problems with the controller itself. All the buttons were very responsive and the only real problem I have with the device is the need to constantly swap batteries. The device seems very well built and well thought out. I'm not sure why so many people are complaining about battery issues and have to have the same one for years. I also have a couple of questions for you: 1. Have you considered making a controller that has a second battery so that you can have 2 devices with different batteries. 2. If you could offer a better battery life for the controller, would you consider it? Thanks for any help!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The eReader is an excellent piece of hardware, but only in this country. The e-book readers have a similar design to the PC's which were once commonplace in schools, but now they seem to be largely obsolete. It would be nice if they could use the same basic technology as the PC e-reader and be a more powerful device.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this monitor in January 2016, using the Dell 30 inch 1080p monitor for work, and this monitor for my personal use. It has all the features of a monitor, but it is a little bit cheaper. The monitor is very small. If you want the best resolution you can get this monitor. It is very fast and responsive. The colors and picture are clear. The image resolution is impressive. I do not know if this monitor will stay on for a long time. But it is cheap enough to be useful. I use my laptop to play video games. If I want the maximum possible resolution my PC gives me the resolution, this is the monitor for me.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is an amazing sound board. I bought the first one (1st gen) and it has been one of my favorites. I recently bought the 2nd gen and am so pleased. There's more sound quality for more money, the built-in speakers are great for a compact setup. I even found that my old (but great) Tascam ST-8 can't compare. If you have a good set of studio monitors and you don't want to shell out a ton for a high-end set, this is the set for you.Read full review

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My new Dell Inspiron 14Z is as good as a laptop can get.   There are some problems with the keyboard and mouse: 1. The volume buttons don't work with the touchpad, so pressing the right one down and the left one up just resets the volume to 50%. They just can't be fixed, not a big deal, but frustrating. 2. The buttons are really soft and the touch pad can sometimes have a small amount of lag. Not the end of the world, but annoying. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The best thing about the   Ease of Use:  The only negative is that it is a little hard to get on and off and it can get caught on some buttons but it works    The only negative thing is that the charger has a little sticky part.     Overall:  It's a very good product and I really like the touch screen.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this from my college e-mail college at the end of last semester. When I got it I was skeptical because my e-mails have been deleted and this was the only one that had been sent. I was so wrong! It has now been deleted from all of my other accounts because of the content. I have been using this all week and have been very pleased. My friends and classmates can still read my old messages but now the old emails can be found anywhere so I can still receive them but I no longer have to search through them to find my messages. I think that my college needs this now.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this unit after a long search. The features on the T3 are a lot like the T2 that I used to have. You can connect a T2/T3 device with a serial adapter to a PC with a PS/2 connector. The port has a good sized size. It's a very nice unit!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Jim from It's been a good 2 years. So much better than T1s I bought a T1 to replace an old T1 I replaced the drive for a couple of reasons, first my old T2 was really old and got a hard time in a couple high temps. Second, a few people on the forum talked about a hard drive failure on their T2. I was very concerned so I put this unit in the T1 and was pleased. It does the job better than a T3.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The   Sound   is a good   on-demand   system, but the   USB   connector   (buttons and connectors) is   just   too   small to fit into   a car's or laptop's headphone jack.   If you use the  USB port on   two devices, one   of which is a portable computer with a built-in   DAC,   it can be difficult to remember   which device is in control.  I like the  Port   that   provides power to the sound card, but it has a   lot of dead space   and   there is a lot of   unnecessary   wire around the  Connector   area.  If I were to upgrade from my   old Sound Blaster Pro I'd get a better   sound card like a Creative   Audigy 2.  Note: 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     Excellent   I have an iPad Air, and wanted to get an even better one, so I ordered a Galaxy Tab A 10.1. This device is better than my iPad Air 2. It's a great addition to the iPad, and the price is great. It is so easy to use and the screen is bright. The only thing I wish was included is a micro USB to USB charger, but for a 10.2-inch display this is a great device   (5/5)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This thing is great. The remote is great too. I don't use a computer because I have a really bad eye, but I was able to use it while driving to the grocery store to check the weather. It also has a great built in speaker and mic and is very light. If you like to play music it's a great device, the remote is a little flimsy but it's still great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The original DS, from the original DS.   It's not perfect, and that's exactly why I bought a replacement.  When I played the original, I loved it.  That joyous sensation of playing the DS on the go, being able to hear sounds that weren't actually there, just waiting to be heard.  The only thing is that the buttons are very stiff, and difficult to press.  I just got this for my DS2, and I'm not very satisfied with the sound.  For some reason, when I put the original on, my DS always sounds better.  It was a good idea to bring in an upgraded version, but it wasn't the best.  If you want to have a good sound, go for a DS2. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have bought many of the electronic watches and are well made. The only one I don't have is a quartz because I prefer the electronic kind but I find the watch runs very cool and accurate.   I can't wait to buy a digital watch!  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was looking for an easy way to control my home automation systems and came across this product from Amazon. I have 3 different models so far and am VERY happy with this one.   The remote can be turned on/off from any room. You simply plug the device into an outlet in your home, set up your schedule and press the button. The light on the front is bright and brightens up the room the Remote is installed in. You also can use a smart phone app to send commands for the devices.  My only complaint is that the remote gets very hot on the back of the device.  Overall I am VERY satisfied with this purchase. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    -The sound is great.   If you want a great sounding headphone with a great design, the Sennheiser HD280 is the best you can get.  It's pretty much perfect for me.  The highs are clean, the mids and lows are pretty close to the top end of the market, and the bass is pretty nice and loud too.  -I am very pleased with the Sonexes.  For the money I didn't expect much but I'm so happy with the sound they give me. The soundstage is impressive, and I love that the bass doesn't get in the way of the mids when it's not too loud.  I also really appreciate the noise cancellation. I am so happy I made the purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    (1) I have a Panasonic LX100 (4K). I just recently purchased a second one for my son. I am amazed how much easier it is to view HD. My 4K TV still has the issues in HDR viewing. So far this is a 5 star product. (2) If you have a good TV, this is great. But you need a good PC or monitor to view in HD (3) Great price for an excellent product. If you only buy this for your son, then you need to get another one for your TV (4) This is perfect for streaming/watching. I have been using it as my main PC. I also use it to stream movies from Amazon, iTunes and Amazon Prime. It is perfect. My other computer can play the Blu-rays, and now my wife can watch HD movies. I don't need an additional HDTV for this. I use my computer as a remote control for the TV and it works great. It only takes about a minute for me to get to where I want to go and then I can choose to pause the movie, resume and etc. (5) I am a heavy PC user but when I wanted to use my 4K PC for Blu-ray I found out that the quality is much better on the HDTV than on the 4K. If my son had not told me about this DVD/Blu-ray player, I would have only bought the 4k model and not this one. I love the 4-K model but this DVD player is really good. I will definitely buy another.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Amazing I bought this to watch my son's 4k Netflix films on his 4k TV. It was extremely easy to set up and the picture quality is amazing. It even came with a HDMI cable and a digital antenna. ,  ,
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have used this in many of my projects. This device is great for beginners.   The only thing I don't like about the system is the cost.  It is about $50 but when you start building your own stuff it is worth it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I used to have a old computer for my home. I needed to upgrade to a Mac, so I decided to get a computer. It's been fine for everything so far, except the screen. It took about 5 minutes of trying out the mouse and the keyboard and the screen would not turn on. I tried changing to a different display on a laptop. No matter what I did, the screen was not turning on. It didn't matter what else I tried either. I finally got into the computer and it is great, but not the screen problem. It also seems that my laptop was made before the latest screen technology came in to use. The only reason I bought this was the warranty.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this device and the battery life is very good. The battery lasts about two months on high and two weeks on low. The only issue is the wireless range which is a bit short on my location.  Rated 1 out of 5 by M from Noisy, cheap, not very flexible I love the idea of this product but I don't like the noise that it produces when playing. I bought a set of headphones that use an old car battery so it's not so bad in terms of noise. I would have liked it to have a bit more range but other than that this is a good little product.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is an awesome little device. It is just what I needed to listen to my music from my car and keep an eye on the car. If I had this in my car in 2005 when I bought it, it would have saved me about $400.00 in maintenance. It does not do as good a job of getting a full car audio signal to my stereo as the Sony CDR. It has a built in speaker, and a built-in tuner, but it does not sound great on it's own. When you add a CD player, it sounds even better, as the CD is better recorded. I would have preferred a tuner. When using the built in receiver in the vehicle, it has an issue with skipping, when the tuner is connected to a non-tuned receiver. I think the tuners should have a way to tell if the receiver is tuned to a standard, or non-standard. I have an RCA tuner built into my radio and use it to tune my system, so I know the difference. It seems like a small item, but this little device can save you tons of time and money. I recommend this to any car audio enthusiast.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It came exactly what I was hoping for. It is very quiet and easy to use, although the volume control can be a bit confusing. Also, the screen is too small to comfortably watch videos. But these are small details that could be fixed with firmware updates.   Overall, this is a very good, inexpensive speaker system for a dorm room. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I had a problem with the camera on my camera. It kept freezing up and the camera just would not work. I had it fixed with a $5 camera adapter which was a bit silly. I will never use this camera again. But I love my iphone 5. I have been looking for something that can do everything that my ipod can but on a better budget.  Rated 5 out of 5 by TheWizard from Great device! I have had the S2 for about a week now and am really liking it. I haven't had a chance to fully test it out, but so far so good. I don't have a big budget like most people, and I thought I would need a bigger one, so I picked this up and figured I'd see how it performs over a period of time. As far as functionality, I can't say it is the greatest, but I do like having the option to turn off the lights when I'm not using it. It works great for my needs, but it doesn't do everything I need, which is a little disappointing.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It seems to be working just fine so far.  The speakers are clear and loud enough to fill a room.  I can hear the songs I'm playing through a pair of excellent sound amplifiers.  It's also handy to carry around in my laptop bag when I'm at home because it's small, lightweight, and doesn't take up a lot of space.   I'm really impressed with the price - it's a lot less than the $350 I spent on a Yamaha CD player for my computer. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the best of all the small portable music players I've tried and I've owned a lot of them over the years. The price is excellent (at least compared to most of the other products I've bought) and the play time is very good.   I do have two criticisms.  First, the volume control has to be very hard to get to work reliably, so you end up having to press a lot to get the music going at all, and second, there are some distortion issues with the speaker output.  I also love my new music player -- thanks, DSP   Now, let me be clear: I am a die hard vinyl fan who's still got her first set of LPs (the LP version of "The Wizard of Oz") on my desktop.  But this is a portable solution for me, and I'm extremely glad I found it.  I'm also in love with my new bluetooth music player (a Samsung BT-1 for those interested), and I can't wait to try out the Sonos one in the next week or so.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I first bought this device I was skeptical but after using it I am convinced. It is very powerful and the ability to customize your sound is a definite plus. This is my main source of sound now and I have a friend that wants to get a set for his rig. You will not be disappointed with this piece of equipment.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Not a perfect set up I bought the amp last month, and installed it today. This amp is NOT powerful enough for me. I need a lot of power to crank the bass and vocals up loud. The bass and midrange were not as good as i was expecting, i thought i would get more power. I used to have a good set up but i dont have my old amp anymore. Im not sure why it would not work, but i thought id bring it back.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I have a couple of these. The main thing that I liked about the iPod mini was that it looked and operated just like the original iPod. The touch screen is a little on the small side, but there are plenty of apps that can be used with it and the interface is very intuitive. My only complaint is that the size is quite a bit larger than the iPod touch, which is probably just because I'm used to the iPod nano, which I like the sound better. Overall, these are great for people who want an iPod that looks like an iPod mini and can play music and videos the way it was meant to be played. I like that it is wireless and has the headphone jack. I think that it will only get bigger from here, but I am enjoying the little mini as much as the old nano.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a very good device, I really like it. The only issue I have with the device is that the touch pad does not have a backlight. If you want to read the information on screen, you have to use your finger to show the information. There are other touch pads on the market that have a Back Light but the touchpad on this one does not. Other than this minor flaw, the device does the job.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love the sound quality of this little box! Its small and light, not a lot of space on my desk, but it works fine. My only complaint is that the power button seems to go on/off at random, and sometimes I can't get it to turn on/on fast enough, but then again that might just be because I got it a month or so late.   This is a nice addition to my office. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The price of this thing is perfect for the amount of use I put it through. It will easily get me through a couple of days worth of music. The buttons are very responsive and the volume is very loud, but not too loud. I have an amp that is in another room so I can't hear my music loud, and this works just as well.   Overall I love it, and a couple years from now I'll probably still have it so I don't even have to worry about it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really like the ability to connect to my home office computer with an Ethernet cable.   When I am using it in my office, I can use it without connecting to the internet.  When my son goes to college, I don't have to use his laptop so much, and I can have more freedom and time to spend with him.    I recommend this to all my family members who want to have a computer anywhere.  In my case:  It was the perfect size for my needs.  I used to have my phone and a computer in the same place.  The only drawback was the fact that I had to put the phone on the floor to sit at my desk.  Also the sound quality was not as good as my computer sound card, which is a big disappointment.  My next purchase:  I will definitely be ordering the 2nd unit soon! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The only reason this is not 5 stars is the lack of an AC adapter - if it's plug-and-play, why not? I have had a few of these units in the past and always liked them. A little bit louder than the SONY TCD-1S, but I guess I could live with that. I can't say I'm thrilled with the screen and speakers, but they seem to be of reasonable quality for the price.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been looking for a good headphone amp for a while now, but there just wasn't any good ones out there.  This amp does it all. I've got a set of the JVC D-Lite HD headphones and the amp will turn them from flat to full.  I am in awe.  It's so cool how you can get full sound from a pair of headphones with just one speaker.  So, what are the negatives?  They sound a little thin sounding on some recordings.  Other than that, this is a very good value.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I am a long time user of these types of keyboards. The layout has not changed much since the first model.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    After having this for a week I have noticed that the batteries last a long time. The only time I would have an issue is when the battery pack is getting close to running out of juice, but if you have the proper charger, the batteries will last a while.   The remote control works great and works well with my Wii.  It looks a bit bulky, but the remote control has a good grip to it and does the job just fine. I would recommend this to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use the iPod and have no problems with it.   When using my laptop I'm left with the feeling of having a cheap product and using a "junk" product. The sound quality is OK, but the buttons are not a pleasure to use.  My daughter loves it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The quality of the phone was excellent, I am not a heavy texter, but I have a big enough screen to do it easily, and the fact the it can be used for both voice and data just makes it perfect. It is very convenient, very easy to use and even has a flashlight to make using it more comfortable. I even bought a battery cover for it because it was getting toasty in my backpack.   You can't beat the price or what the phone can do for you for less than 5 dollars per month.  Rated 5 out of 5 by btbz from great phone for the money I have had this phone for about a month now and I love it! I got it at the recommendation of my dad and after reading about the different programs they offer for the sim card, I decided to use mine. So far i have found it to be pretty good. The screen is a bit small and smallish but thats really about all the complaints i have. The only thing that might be a problem for you is that the battery is rather large. It will last a while so its not a huge deal. All in all I am really happy with this phone, and am already looking into getting another one.    Rated 3 out of five by greg from OK, but not perfect I purchased this phone mainly because I wanted a big screen phone with plenty of storage. It works, but the phone is so small and light I can't really see anything on it unless I'm looking really closely. It's also a bit heavy and is quite awkward to use. It also has a weird button on it that I have trouble with and doesn't work well. Overall, it's a good phone with good features and is good value for the cost.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I received this   for Christmas as a gift   (I am a "Gone Wild" type of person)   from my Mom, so that was a bonus. I love the fact that it has a battery, as I don't carry one with me all the time.   It came with a USB cable and a power adapter, which I was surprised to see. I didn't find that too useful, but they are useful if you are not a power user.  I bought a little bag to hold it, which worked out great, as it is not a huge thing to carry around.  The thing itself is super thin (it is the same size as a dollar bill) and the color is super bright.  This is one cool product   Rated 5 out of 5 by Jodie from Love it. I ordered a small to start with, and I love it. No battery life issues, and it's very convenient for charging at home. I'm really excited about this.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this for a baby room that has to be dark enough for a child to sleep in but bright enough for him to use.    It is amazing.

This is a very small, very light weight device, but there is no limit to what it can search for. I would recommend it to any beginner or experienced user.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have to confess I had reservations about buying this item. I've owned several different computer peripherals over the years and I can usually remember the good ones.   The problem was the price. It seemed too good to be true and my husband was skeptical.  I ordered the device and it arrived a few days later.  My review:  My family and I are huge fans of Nintendo. We have a Nintendo DS handheld gaming console and Nintendo Wii gaming console.  This has definitely earned a place on our Nintendo shelves.  I am very happy with my purchase.  My Nintendo DS is in mint condition and the Wii is working well. I highly recommend this item for any Nintendo enthusiast. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I was a young boy I spent much of my time in front of TV sets. And that is not because I preferred it to real life, but simply because that was all I had.   In my late teens and early 20s I finally decided to buy an N64.  As I played and saved I began to realize that I really loved video games and was a great video game player and collector.  I bought the original N64 in 1997, the 2.0 version in 2000, and then finally the 3.0 in 2006.  There have been a few changes to the 3DS since its launch, but they have mostly been improvements.  What I enjoy about the 3D DS is that it really is a portable 3D version of the 3 DS system. I have a Nintendo 3DS XL and I do not regret having purchased a 3DS.  The 3DS is the greatest handheld video game system that has ever been produced. It's simply an amazing piece of machinery. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Posted by: Mandy in New Mexico on September 21st, 2018 I have owned this speaker for quite some time. It has been an upgrade to the stock radio speakers that came with the car. I have had no problems with the sound. The only thing I can complain about is the cord and its being a little too short for my needs (and the speaker does not come with an adapter).   The good:  There is more bass and depth than I thought there would be. There is a little more of a "wall" to the sound compared to the other OEM radio speakers on the car but it does not have that "full-on" sound that the OEM's have. The high end is nice and crisp as well.   This is definitely the best quality speakers on a cheap car, the sound quality is better than the OEM speakers on my stock radio.  The sound is much better than stock but I do still have to say that the stock OEM radios sound a lot better. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The battery life on this thing is a huge deal! It keeps me in power saving mode most of the time. My laptop battery keeps going down when it's not in use so this one has me in the zone. The screen is great too - bright, easy to see in poor lighting, but not too distracting.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Joey from Love it! This is a very nice device! It has a very wide screen. I have a Samsung 55" 4K TV, and this is a perfect replacement. I find it hard to make the phone display as wide as the screen though, it seems to be split in half. I think I have to set it up to be the proper distance or else it shows off all the pixels.  of this and a large screen computer are the best

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is one of my favorite electronic devices. This thing works perfect for its intended purpose.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This was my first ever computer and is my current work machine.  I was so happy to have something that was easy to set up, and I was never afraid of a virus/beware!  It worked well enough for me to set it up on the floor in the house as well as in the garage, but there are things you must be aware of before doing so! The computer is an old HP T-5200, and the first problem I ran into was that my printer (a Sony PDP-11) was NOT recognized in the BIOS! This resulted in me trying to find the PDP11 printer driver files in a Windows 7 program, but to no avail. I spent ages trying to get the printer driver to work, and then found that my PC was using a program called EasyPCI which was actually making a copy of my printer for itself. If this were my first computer, I'd never have bothered to do this and would have just bought an HP T5000 which works perfectly well.   I also purchased the "Sierra Vista" version of Windows which doesn't recognize the printer, so that was a bummer too! The only reason I bought this system was the fact that I wanted something with an IDE drive, and now I regret it!   Also, the power supply is pretty poor (only 800mah), and there is a noticeable delay when the computer powers up!  I had to add a 9v power supply which was great!  Now for the most important part.  The computer needs to be put on a flat surface to work properly.  Since there was no space under the desk for this to happen, it was a real challenge and a pain to try and have my computer on the flat surface. The machine did not sit well on the edge of the desk either, so I had a good number of trips to the back of the computer case for a power cord (which was great because my machine could be moved off the desk as well). Overall, this is an OK computer. The problems I had were annoying, but manageable, and they didn't prevent me from using this as my work computer. However, I think the main problem is that I bought a computer that is not designed to be a "normal" computer. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As a computer geek in college, this monitor was one of the first computers I got my hands on. While it isn't as big as my old laptop, it still serves its purpose. It's also got a decent amount of inputs, including the VGA port, VGA input (with an extra mini D-sub), 1 x DVI, 3 x DisplayPorts, and a headphone jack. The monitor has a nice weight to it that can hold it, but is a bit bulky, so be careful when you are using it. It is also quite easy to work with, making it a nice option for someone like me who is trying to get into a computer business.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It works perfectly.   I'm not a big fan of these big bulky keyboards, but these really do not have that much room for the number pad (especially if you need to set the screen up to be flat).   This is the second electronic keyboard that I have bought in recent years, and this one works great!   The best thing about it is that it comes with a detachable cable for the computer (so you don't have to go outside of your house or garage).  I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a wireless keyboard. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently bought a Sony A6300, which is one of the best affordable HD-DVD players on the market.   This was a great purchase, especially for a beginner, and I am very happy.  I have not watched any of the first movies yet, but the picture and sound quality is good.  When I got it, I was worried about the menu, but it was intuitive and easy to use.  It seems to be made of very durable plastic, and is well-built.  There is also a great remote control, which I really like.  The audio is clear and clear, and it has plenty of buttons.  As I said before, I think I will keep this for a while.  And, it does have a built-in camera.

Best phone ever!!! 5 stars 5 stars:  The Best  The best phone  Ever  It's fast and responsive  Posted By: Michael B. | Mar 17, 2016   This is the first time I have used it and it is amazing. It's super easy to use and really bright and vivid. It doesn't even need to be charged but for some reason, even when I have my iPhone charged, I can use this one for longer. It also has the best microphone. If you're looking for an all-around good device that works great on the go, this is the one to get. You'll also love the battery. It lasts about 3-4 hours on a charge but you can use it while it's in your pocket which is very useful. You can also use this device to send text messages too which is pretty awesome for my wife. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a high quality electronic device. The power supply is a bit more than you expect from a consumer grade unit but works perfectly. The screen is easy to use and doesn't look or feel cheap. It works great when you don't have a computer nearby, and is great for watching movies on your tablet.  The Good: Excellent build quality. I love the ability to get a hold of the software updates when they are released. The ability to play audio files on the device without the need to connect a computer is great. The only downfall is the amount of lag it's sometimes difficult to control. If you are looking for an inexpensive device, this is a good one. If it had a larger screen, it would be perfect. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    One of the best electronic devices ever made. This device is simple and efficient. It is like a little book and the sound is superb.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought a new HP Touchpad recently for my laptop. I got it for my PC because it was the only device that would keep me from having to constantly switch between PC and Mac when I'm on the go. I was worried about whether I'd be able to keep using it for a long time, but it does a good job. The main thing I like is that the capacitive touchscreen is easy to use, and the included driver is easy for me to use too.   The only thing I didn't like is the fact that there are no back and forward buttons. I think this would've been a nice addition, but in general it's a great buy.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A big improvement over the old one, but a huge disappointment in the sound.   It has an analog circuit, but this one has no sound. When listening to it, the sounds are very tinny and it's impossible to have any volume.  I would not buy it again.  I've been using a cheap, plastic (but working), mp3 player for years that didn't work well. Then I found an old plastic cassette player. It sounded better than my old player, but it broke within the first week. I had no idea what to do. So I did what everybody else does: I went online and bought a cheap player, hoping it would work, even though I've never used it before. It does! It sounds just like my old cassette player! (It has a plastic shell!)   Now that I have an mp3 device, I will be buying more of them.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The i-8 is a very well made computer for the price. I have a 16 Mbyte VGA display on the back that can display a 2 Mbyte screen, I also have a TRS-80 Model III floppy drive plugged into the I-8. I would highly recommend the i- 8 to anyone who wants a low cost, reliable, programmable, easy to use computer for their home.   I am an active user of the I_8 for doing many different types of programming. I can write files directly to a TENEX floppy disk, run it over a serial line, read the output directly from an external computer, and even read my own data from the I/O lines.  The I_ 8 comes with a nice small paper manual which gives step by step instructions on how to use the computer. It also has an instruction manual that tells you how to connect the TENX cables and how to plug in the power supplies. This is one of the only I_7 computers available with a built in screen.  There is a program called SCRATCH to allow you to create programs in BASIC.  I have tried several BASIC programs for the I 7 which all use BASIC data files as input files.  One of my favorite programs is SCRASE by David Eppstein.  Another program I use is SCALE.  SCRAPE is a really fun and interactive BASIC program, which allows you to enter numbers and use the keys on your keyboard to draw lines that describe the results of these numbers.  Other programs that I have created which use the TENS keyboard include A S T H P, A S C H E, and S T S I E.  You can find out more about the I7 from Steve Jackson Games, or from the official page: I_ 7 Home Computer.  As I was reviewing the I5, I noted that the Tens keyboard was rather uncomfortable.  A new version of the T-series keyboard has been released. The new keyboard is much less uncomfortable to type on. It features some type of membrane support and the T3 keys have a new style "V" shape which is nice to look at.  This is also the keyboard I use for playing TENS.  When I'm not writing programs, I use the I2 and I3 keyboards to control the I 5.  An advantage of the new keyboard, is that you can insert

This device was originally a 5.8, but after the power switch was changed to a 5, I had to return it.  However, I love the features I can access, and the way it works as a speaker, USB cable, and power adapter.  It is quiet, powerful, and easily set up and use.  I also really like the color of the device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you use this device, don't let the bad reviews put you off. There are a few things you need to keep in mind when buying a digital camera: 1. The viewfinder has a tiny 1/8th inch display. You can't see through it. It's not the worst thing but it's still not great. The resolution of the viewfinder is pretty good but it really should have been a full size. 2. If you're looking for a fast shooting camera you needn't look any further than the Fujifilm X100 series. The camera has amazing speed and the image quality is superb. 3. The X100 is the only camera I've used in the last year that has kept me from quitting. Its not the fastest camera on the market and it does have some flaws but it is a great camera for the money. I would give it a solid A++++
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am a musician who plays on the keyboard and the other instrument when I perform. I am very impressed with the quality and usability of the Korg Kaoss Pad. I have been using a Roland TD-1 since 1985 and have had many other music keyboards, but I have never liked those to begin with. The Kaoss pad is my first experience with a keyboard that has been well designed with a sound that does not come from an old computer, but rather from a piano. I've gotten to know the pads a bit on the internet. The pads are of very high quality and the sound is quite good. The controls on the Kaoss pads are very easy to find and use and I recommend the KORG Kaosspad as a keyboard. I hope I will be able to recommend the Kaospad to other music makers. I can only hope that Roland and Korg will come up with some good improvements to the pad.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    In my opinion this is the best device in terms of ease of use, ease of setup and the audio quality. The best part is the very easy to use menu system that is very easy for anyone to use. I can setup my system with two separate speakers, or just a pair of speakers in stereo. The audio quality is amazing. I love the bass punch and the mids are extremely detailed. The mic is very good, and is very sensitive. I do prefer to use my phone to take a picture so I can hear the sound, but even if it is too low I can still hear the voices with ease. The only thing I wish I had is a bluetooth connection and I have the phone on me all the time. Overall, I would recommend this product.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Easy to setup. Great sound. Simple menu system. I'm using a set of RCA to DIN mini cables in order to get both the 3.5 mm & 2.5mm stereo jacks to my car stereo. I use my smartphone to take pictures so that I can adjust the volume. All in all a good buy. .  and this product is also great for an extra headphone or speaker system. It's so easy to set up. You can adjust volume, bass boost, and treble. The software is so easy and fun to use! And it's a bit cheaper than other devices in this price range.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It does exactly what it is advertised to do.   My wife and I are trying to be healthy in our 70+ years old age group. We got a cell phone that gives us a live phone number for any emergency. It even comes with a small emergency kit to include some non-perishable foods and water.  We had no problems getting our information from it. We just love the simplicity of it.  My only complaint is that it has no "call" button to make a phone call. We are all on the phone 24/7 so it would be nice if you could send a text message to someone you call.  I will be getting another for my wife's birthday. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I am a music aficionado. I love the MP3 player from Sony, but I recently moved from the UK to US so I can't have one at home. I wanted something that would be small enough to transport in my bag but big enough to play on my hi-fi system. I'm very happy with the quality and the fact that it's waterproof and can play through my speakers.  I can't fault the device; I just wish that it came in more colours  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had to replace the original one with a new one because it kept breaking (like most electronic devices) but I really liked the screen because it was very bright and crisp and I liked the fact that it was battery powered so I didn't have to carry another battery. I'm happy that I bought this.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I think I'm starting to like this set. I don't like most digital watch faces, but this one is the best. I love that the light shines on the date and seconds hands when you lift your watch to your ear, which is nice when you're running late. And you can set it to any setting you want. The screen is really bright. But it's not as crisp as my other digital watches - not like that much of a difference, but it is noticeable and I think it'll get better as I wear it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great set for the price This is a great watch face, I love it and I like how easy to use it is, I had the same watch before and this watch looks better. It's bright, the hands are nice and the date display looks great. The only thing is that the white date is on the center face and it's hard to see it if you're looking at the top or the bottom. It doesn't bother me that much but it does make me a little nervous, if you want to change the date on the bottom face, you have to do it by hand (with a small screwdriver).  Thank you for your review, Robert! I just got the Black and white model. Great price with great features. The watch has been awesome for the last two years. I'll be buying the gold version as soon as I can afford it. Thanks again!  I don't know how I never thought of buying this watch before now, I just love it. I am an amateur musician and I always need a timepiece that will play my music so it's great that my first watch now plays my music for me. Thanks  As a new music student, this is perfect. It is a good watch for those of us who don't have the cash for something flashy. It has a very simple look, but has the functions of a true professional watch, like an alarm clock. I bought the black model, and it just looks better than white. I look forward to seeing what colors we get for the gold edition. I'm a bit leery about the date/hour hands being on the same line but it can be easily fixed if you don't mind the minute hand being on top of the hour.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am not sure if this is really a "smart" device, but it is very convenient. I am in the habit of carrying one or more of these things in my backpack. They have come in handy several times, for instance, when I have forgotten to charge the car battery and I don't want to have to carry a spare, or when I forgot to charge my phone and don't have the proper adapter or tool with which to charge it. The app has been extremely helpful as well. The software is excellent and the ability to store the various settings and data in the app (the "smartphone mode") is a very handy feature. It seems that I can do almost anything with this device and it seems to be a very good one!

I also wanted to be able to add more storage to it if I wanted to.  I like the fact it is compact.  With the ability to charge it via usb port it can be used for days on end as long as you are on the go.  Overall i love this little gadget and plan to buy more of them.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The best thing about this machine is that it works great when I'm done with the work.  The battery on the back of the machine is very easy to replace, but it makes a very satisfying sound as it does so.  Also, the machine doesn't use a ton of power when the screen is off, so it's very power efficient.   I used a computer like this at school for a long time, and I always had a hard time running it, even when the lights and keyboard were on. I have a laptop and I can't even get my computer to turn off and let the batteries run down fast enough, so I'm very impressed with this unit!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a very handy, useful and very attractive piece of electronic equipment that will greatly help in my study of Japanese (I'm studying a language that has a huge number of verbs - about 70,000+).  I have no complaints with the sound of the speaker - as expected of Japanese speakers (they're very good), so that's a plus, and the built-in calculator, that I have found to be very useful when writing mathematical expressions or when calculating long sums, works great.  The calculator has two modes - "Rough" and "Quarter". In the "Rrough" mode, the calculator is essentially a mechanical calculator that accepts the Japanese decimal numeral system. The calculator has a "half-inch dial" that can be used to place the cursor on the current decimal position, by a very slight angle. When the decimal point has been reached, a flashing light on the left-hand side of the dial indicates that the calculator has been fully recalibrated. This light comes on and goes off several times during a typical operation, indicating when the decimal position has been correctly reached. In the other mode, "Quarters", the calculator does not display the fractionals - only the numerical symbols.  the calculator. The built- in calculator, and its small, light-emitting diodes, is a bonus. The "Quart" mode does not provide any fractional values. - Chris  "This is an absolute must for studying Japanese!"   - K.O. _ _ _ _ - Kyoichi Sato  (A: The above was written as a series of questions.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am a software engineer by trade. I have been using an iMac G3 since 2003. I've only owned a Sony portable CD player for 4 years, but this is a good deal for what I got. The G3 is quite small, which makes for a good size laptop for me. It has a great screen. I was quite pleased with the camera and software. I'm not sure if the software will stay up to date, but I'm willing to give Sony credit for the fact that their software is at least somewhat up to par.  No regrets   You are not really paying for any of this, or more correctly, you're buying into the price and value. I think Sony should give a discount on the G3 models and try to make the G2 work for a few more years. . We want to see your reviews    We just got our brand new G4 and are very pleased with our purchase! The G4 is definitely a big improvement over our G3. Sony still has some work to do with the screen, battery life is a bit shorter than we would like, and a few functions do require an adapter. However, I think it's a great value.   We can't wait to use it   We just got the G4 for our first home computer, and we're very pleased.     Sony's latest models seem to have a great future, and the G5 should be even better.  and we recommend  .
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a Sony digital audio recorder which records in both analog and digital, for both recording to an SD card and to my PC. It does not record to the SD card in the car, but that is okay because the SD cards are inexpensive. It records stereo audio, but only one channel, which is not a big deal. The only problem I have with the recorder is the small size of the recorder, but if you record a lot of stuff it will not matter. You can even make a backup by connecting the SD-card to a computer in your house or store on a network. I just do not like the SD capability because it is just too small to be a replacement for a USB drive.   - Michael A. Good Product but...   Good product, but a bit over priced. The sound quality is good, but the recorder will not take cards larger than 4 GB, and the recorder itself has some problems with its built in hard drive. - Daniel L.

I have a PC and I have bought a number of mouse pads and mouse mats, but none have matched the performance of this mouse. I can't stress enough how good it is for its price.     Product:  The mouse works fine. This was my first mouse, and I love it so far. It is quite smooth, and not very flimsy.   Ease of Use:  I love the button controls, they're awesome. The only thing is the size and the weight makes it a bit heavy to carry around all the time, but I think the weight will not be a problem once the first few months of playing with it go by.  :  This product is amazing, this mouse is the perfect size and works perfect. Great price and service. Will never go back to the big mice that most other companies offer.     The Only Perfect Mouse:  It is a wonderful mouse for the money. The shape is wonderful, the buttons are great, and you can use it with a trackball or with a mouse pad if you want. I really like it. The weight is not too heavy at all. I don't have any complaints.

It feels much better than the smaller portable DVD player from last year.

It's really good for traveling and it really helps me use my laptop when I'm at home.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPhone is a very cool device for its price.   It does everything I need it to do:  Display  Display, Display, and Display.  It has excellent audio and video recording and playback.  When my wife needed a phone and I had the iPhone 4, we called her up and she asked me to pick it up at the door so she could go out and have a quick phone call, then pick it back up at work for her.  The phone was the right size and was a pleasure to use.  With all that I liked about the phone, it did not come without its problems.  First and foremost, this is not an Android phone.  If you were thinking about the Galaxy S4, you should not consider the iPhone.  Apple is a more closed software system that does not have a user friendly interface for the most part.  However, there are a lot of apps that are really cool and do not take up a lot in the way of system memory.  A few of these are:  Weather, Phone, Email, iMessage, Messages, Calendar, Contacts, Mail.  These are very cool features for an iPhone. Also, a big deal for iPhone users is the fact that the iPhone has a "Back" button.  This is the home button on an Android device.  Some people like this, some people hate it.  I was not too crazy about this feature, but it is a big plus for anyone looking for a simple way to go back in a place.  Also, it is nice to have a way to make calls.  While I do not like using the "Home" button on most phones, I do like the option to call.  Although the iPhone's screen size and the size of my thumb are small for most people, it still takes a good deal of thumb.  Lastly, the phone is not waterproof.  Even with a case, it does not seem to be completely water resistant.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The quality of this sound system was good. The stereo sound quality was excellent. The quality was much better than what is available at other stores in the area. The sound quality at the concerts was very good as well. I purchased the sound system because I'm a huge basshead. I'm sure that the sound quality is great for the bassheads in the audience, but it's not good for me. It makes my headphones very uncomfortable, and makes it impossible to hear the vocalist, as I need to keep the volume down on my headphones so that I don't get sick of the bass noise. Other than that, the sound was great and it was very reasonable. The purchase of the system did not come at an enormous price though. The system had a few flaws. It's only good for bassheads, as it's too hard on the ear to hear bass sounds, especially from a singer in a pop band. The speakers were somewhat weak though. It also makes the system pretty hard to move around, as the speakers are pretty tall. Overall I was pleased with the purchase and I'm hoping to buy a few more electronic equipment from this store.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've had this phone for less than a month now and the battery life is pretty good, it lasts a lot longer than I expected. The screen is great, color reproduction is better than what I'm used to with my other phone. I am on a contract for 4 months, so I've not had it for long, but I like how the camera is better now. The design is a little goofy and looks like it was made in the 1990's (like the logo on the back) but it's not a bad design. It is pretty heavy and I had to add extra lugs and rubber bands to make it less heavy. It does not feel cheap at all, but it does not have the quality you might expect from a phone of this price range. The only bad thing about the phone is that it has no SD card slot (for now) but since SD cards are pretty much required nowadays for high resolution video, that is no big deal.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use my X-7 with a Sony a6000 for 2K video and 4K (60p) photo (the video looks great on both, but the photo is a bit too noisy for me.) I do not use the USB port for power, but this X-10 allows me to send audio to my a6000 directly via the cable I have. The only time I have had trouble with the X-8's battery life is when I put it in the back of my car and leave it plugged in 24/7. I do have an additional battery in the car to provide about a hour of backup.

Review of DJI's X-Pro 2 Review of DJIs X-PRO 2   DJI did a good job releasing a new generation of the popular DJI Inspire 1 with this release of the XPro 2. If you are an old Inspire owner, you will see the benefits of this newer platform on a whole new level.   The new Inspire 2 can be bought from DJI at the $999.99 price point with a single camera, but you will find that there are some more advanced features included in the XPRO 2 as well.  The first big thing on the new Inspiro 2 is the ability to shoot RAW files.  RAW files are very useful when you are looking to create an impressive photo album for your images and/or movies.  There are now more options than ever to take photos, but what is most surprising to me is the increase in resolution. It's hard to believe that these cameras can even take pictures in high ISO's.

They are extremely responsive, and you'll forget you're typing with a standard keyboard. Also, this keyboard has 2 large buttons, so you can click them as you type to delete or adjust the font size. The only thing that's not great is that it's extremely noisy (like typing on your desk). I have had to take it out several times just to get it back to normal, because typing is actually very noisy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - I have used my Sony MP-CL1 since October 2005 when I bought it from a local electronics store. I was very interested in this device when I was offered a chance to try a review unit because of the excellent review that my husband had done on it here on youtube. Since then I have had no need for it. The device is as advertised.   I used to own a laptop back in the day when it was the only one you could use on the computer in our home.  I was looking for a more portable, portable, yet powerful computer when I purchased my Sony unit.  This is the perfect combination of all of the features I wanted.  The only down side to this device is that I have no idea why my Sony is still getting used.  There is absolutely no lag at all and I have been using my unit for over a year now and still cannot get enough of this device.  So far, the only down sides are that it does take a lot of power to run and that it has a fairly expensive price tag.  A good addition to anyone's home theatre system

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you've ever needed a portable radio with the ability to play both standard analog and digital stations, or wanted an electronic device to allow you to listen to radio or FM while you read a book, the Yamaha DX3 is a very good choice.   It's portable (it can fit in the backseat of a car) and has good sound.  It is relatively inexpensive ($149.95), and has lots of features, including a full set of analog and S-M-S (selectable memory) tuners.  The only downside is that there are only three FM modes -- standard, pop, and jazz.  This makes it quite limited in some respects.  I would recommend this for anyone looking for something easy to use with the option of full S-MODE (select/select) mode or "slicing" the audio output.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a very good computer and a really nice one too. I am very happy with it. The battery life is good and the computer can be easily connected to a USB port so I can use it from my car or when at home. I also really like the fact that this does not require a power supply.    Great Product   The most impressive aspect of this machine is that it does not need a power source to be used. So, it is completely portable, and when I am at home I can leave it connected to my car, and also in my pocket, and then go for a walk. I would definitely recommend this product, but for the price I would buy a different one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A really nice feature is that, when you put the item into a bag or the box, it opens up like a book.   The item is durable and looks good too.  I like that this can be used in multiple places and in both warm and cool environments.   Great for portable storage (2)   I've never been one to use external hard drives and so this device has really opened my mind to the idea.  It's made very well, very lightweight and compact, and is well built, which is always a bonus!  It looks pretty much exactly like an external HDD you'd find in a desktop.  This is a great product that comes highly recommended for those who use it for storage. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The best keyboard for laptop and desktop computers I have used I have been using a Logitech keyboard for years. However the past few years have seen me moving away from Logitech keyboards and I now use the Zowie FK1. This is the best keyboard I have ever used, and for the price I have absolutely no hesitation buying another one for a laptop. It is extremely thin, durable, and very durable. The only thing that I would change would be a better cable with a micro USB and a headphone jack. I am also happy to say the key caps are very accurate, I have no issues at all with them.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I first saw the M-Audio M-Track 2 I was instantly attracted to the design. I've been a huge fan of the M1 series for some time, and I've always been disappointed with the fact that they're either a closed system or an open system (depending on the price), so I was curious as to what other people thought of this alternative. My only concerns were that the speakers are quite large, they require a powered amp to drive them, and the cable is a bit of a pain to work with.   I have an iPhone 2.0 and I wanted to be able to listen to music without using up all the battery power in the phone. The M-Fade 3 headphones seem to be a perfect fit. They can be used with any iPhone 4/4S with a 3.5mm headphone jack. I like that they come with the headphones, and they seem to work pretty well in terms of sound quality. I'm still waiting for a pair of headphones that are good enough that I would actually want to listen while driving. If the sound quality improves a bit over time, then I'll definitely consider buying these again.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really liked the iWALK and it is very easy to use.   It is much better than the old pager i had, it saves so much time if you have a lot to do.  I wish the buttons on the side would be a bit larger so i could turn my head side to side without pressing all of them.  Also the lights were really bright and a little too bright in the winter.  It was great in the summer though because it had a big screen and all the buttons are easy to see.  Other than that i think it is a great device 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have an HP Touchpad which I have had since 2007 and I still use it a lot. The only thing it has to add is the "Click to Play" feature which works great on an iOS device. It can only run a few apps but that's ok with me.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is an inexpensive device with great quality.   I was looking for a good wireless mouse for use at the local coffee shop.  I have been using a Logitech Mionix mouse since a decade or so now but they don't have anything like this in the store.  The size, weight, and overall quality is on par with other wireless mice I have used in the past.  You have a few options for which button to press to bring up the config menu.  This mouse works flawlessly with my Dell XPS laptop and is very responsive.  Also, the clicker works very well.  In my opinion, this is the best wired mouse on the market today.  A+    Customer Service:     I am a huge fan of Logitech products so I decided to purchase the Logitech MX518 mouse and it arrived very fast. I love that you can customize the buttons.  If I were to only purchase one mouse, it would be this one.  It's just so easy to use.  Very easy to configure the buttons and you can set the button to your own personal preference. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you're looking for a great gaming console for around $300, I'd buy this. But I don't expect much in terms of audio performance. It does have one of those cheap plastic-like speakers that is very hard to put to use because the sound is so tinny. So that's why I wouldn't get this one. But if you need a console with high-quality audio and are in the market for a new one, look no further.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm going to start this review off by saying I'm still on my first pair. They're perfect for traveling, working, and just hanging out with friends. The speakers have a nice, full sound that I really enjoy, and they can be quiet or loud depending on your environment. The batteries last a long time, but you'll need to change them if you use the speaker for long periods of time. I would definitely buy these again and recommend them to anyone who is looking for a good pair of travel-friendly, comfortable headphones that they can just leave on.    Great headset and very durable   This is my second pair of Logitech UE6000 headphones (first pair lasted about a year). The first pair has not yet died, but I'm thinking of getting a second pair to replace the one that isn't working correctly. The new set seems to have a better quality build than the old one, as does my second UE6000 pair. The sound quality is much better in my opinion than the first pair, though I do prefer the sound of the new UE6000 to the UE5000s (in terms of bass). I bought these for travel because I'm a bit claustrophobic, and I don't like having my headphones be off for the whole trip, so having them sound good on the go is very helpful to me.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got this device, as most others have said, to get the sound I want for a reasonable price. This was my first real hi-fi device in the form of a subwoofer. The first thing I noticed is the low power draw of my old speakers. But that's not a big deal. I've had many more expensive hi-fis and they don't really need to play loud. I found the unit very easy to install. The only thing that bothers me is that the volume controls have the standard screw-on buttons, instead of the rubber-backed button on the subwoofers on other hi-FI products. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really enjoyed the keyboard on this keyboard. When I first tried it, I could barely type. It was just hard to keep up. After I got used to it though, I was really impressed. I can type in most of the common characters, and I love the fact that there is a lot of room for your fingers. I like that the keyboard has a backlight too, because without it, my eyes would be burning through my laptop's battery like crazy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the WMP3-2 player last year, but I have been using the Sony WCD63. The Sony has a nice sound quality, and it has a built-in CD changer. But I can only really recommend the WCD64 as a player for casual listeners. The WMP/WCD64 is nice for those who just want to enjoy music, and who do not want to break the bank. I bought a WCD83 and I am pretty sad that I didn't get a WMP64 when I was first looking for a music player. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    In order to get my e-cigarette started, I needed to take out a battery from my cigarette lighter. I looked around, then searched the Internet. I eventually found an ad in a cigarette paper. The ad read that "It's not just any battery, it's a rechargeable lithium ion lithium battery. It takes longer to recharge than a traditional cigarette lighter but, once started, it will provide hours of smoke-free vaping. I am an e-vaper for life, and I'll continue to purchase your products for the long term!" The product arrived quickly, without any damage to the packaging or the battery.   When I received the battery and the unit I felt like I just purchased a great new toy, because I never would have thought of a battery in this capacity for my e cig. The unit does have a few hiccups.  It takes about 20 seconds to recharge if you don't use the included adapter.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this unit for my home studio. It is very good value for the money. I am very impressed with the way the bass and treble seem to come through. I'm still learning how to work with these units but this seems to be the way it should be for the rest of us. Thanks to MusiCares for a great product!  Great for my room!   A bit heavier than I'd like but I guess my preference is that it's bigger. I have a little bedroom room, and it works really well for my needs. I do have to get used to playing along to music but that's part of being a beginner in all things. I can get some decent room ambiance from it, but it is a bit more "in your face" than I've experienced in other units. I also prefer a larger speaker for the space in my room. It's not heavy and doesn't add a lot of weight to the room. I think I'll get a smaller version next time around. (In the near future!) It really is nice for a nice warm sound. Great for small studios, too! I do wish that it had a volume control.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPod is great for all my music needs. I can access music on my computer from my computer using the remote control and the iPod.

The case is also very clean, with the original white plastic exterior. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I received the USB cable as a gift, as a nice bonus for a good buy, I installed the wireless keyboard on my Windows PC.   It is very easy to plug in, and it is very well made.  The keycaps are not the most stable out there, but when I got used to them it works perfectly.  I also installed the usb adapter as a USB to serial adapter, so the keyboard will work with an usb hard drive, and can communicate via the keyboard.  This keyboard comes with a 2.1mm stereo jack which is nice, but it doesn't let me use it as a stereo soundboard for my headset.  A bit annoying to not have a usb cable to plug it in to use the soundboard.  (review from June 2013)

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have always been a fan of the D-Link wireless gateway. The security features are excellent and the wireless range is wonderful for the price point. I recently bought a second gateway for a small, low power, low latency network to use for remote testing and research of wireless links. It works like a charm and is easy to set up.    Best wireless access point I have ever had!   This thing is AWESOME. It is easy and fast to setup with a couple of mouse clicks. There are tons of features that make setting up this device a snap. The wireless range for the wireless gateway itself is really amazing, which can be measured with an app on the device. It also has a built in web browser that works as a fantastic browser. This is a great gateway for small networks to run the wireless and have lots of wireless devices around.   I can't live without it   The only down fall I have with the Gateway is that it is a little pricey for what it is. This product is more of a necessity than a luxury.

I also used this product to replace the original tv set and it has worked just as well. It is loud and clear.    Rated 5 out of 5 by KA from Nice Sound! I'm really impressed. The sound is much better than my old tv. The picture quality is also better. It's a very nice tv. My only complaint is that the remote is way to stiff for my small hands.  Great Product Great price! Great quality! Great sound! Can't beat that!  I'm not a TV or audio geek but for the money this is really nice quality. Very loud even for a non-cable tv set. I was hoping for a 4k version but this set still looks good.  I'm a TV/audio geek but this is a great deal. No sound loss whatsoever! The picture is bright, bright, and bright. If you're looking for a decent TV for under a thousand bucks, this is it!  "The TV is awesome! The sound was very nice. The remote was good but very stiff. I bought it because of the price. The set itself looks good but the price isn't what I expected because it was so much cheaper than other models.  is a really nice TV, the sound is great and it's pretty bright in the picture. I can't believe I can get a tv for the cost of my old one." - Chris D. .  and for the same price, I would get it. I bought this TV for my son, he is now 9 and he loves it. the picture is very good and the sound was really good and I could turn it up if I wanted it to be louder! this TV has a nice TV feel to it too. i bought it for an older son who doesn't want to watch tv anymore. he only watches movies but he says it looks pretty good and was very pleased with the TV he got.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I received the B&N box with no issues at all, and my first impression was that the device was well built. It took me about 20 minutes to figure out the keys (this is the best feature of this device), so I thought I would try it out on a friend. The keyboard was just what I was looking for. It works well, the keys are spaced in a manner that lets me hit them comfortably without getting frustrated. I would definitely recommend this device to anyone who wants a good keyboard for the price.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Well made, easy to navigate I have been using the Bamboo Black/Red for about a year now. Its easy to set up, and has a good amount of functionality that makes it a good choice. There are other Bamboo keyboards that are more elegant (for the price), but the black/red is my go to. The rubber feet are a good feature. I like the fact that the keys can be configured as different profiles, but not all are created equal. In fact, some of the profiles are just "good enough".

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this item to replace my broken one and it works great, I love it! I can't even begin to compare it to the old one, they're so much better and last much longer!! I love my new one!  Rated 1 out of 5 by Mike from Bought to replace a faulty Philips digital tape player, which I also use in a car to play cassettes and the like. Tried to use it but it had the power supply shorts out when turned on. No matter what I did to try to power the device on and off, the tape player would come back on randomly. The computer would run fine but the tape would not play. It was a complete disappointment in both the service and the price.  I used my Sony T50i player in the car for the last 20 years or so. After having to replace it last year I just recently purchased a Sony T60i because it's a lot less expensive. My T50I died after being plugged in a month. It had been working for about 3 years. It's pretty much like a dead phone at this point. I haven't had any problems with it, but that's not why I bought a new T60I.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm a huge fan of both the iPod and my iPad. However, the iPod mini is superior in many ways. First of all, it's a more powerful and more user friendly machine than the i iPod or i iPod Touch. And, while both devices are great, it isn't even close to the iPod in terms of its feature set.   My only gripe about the mini is the size.  It's smaller than I thought it was going to be.  The design of the mini does make me a little uncomfortable though.  I bought it because it seemed to have a high value for the money.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - This product is a great way to store my digital music files (I use Winamp) I bought the USB cable to plug into my computer (I also own a usb cable for my computer that can be used to plug directly into my iPod, but I've never been happy with the quality of those cables), and it works very well. I have a Toshiba Satellite A55 laptop that has no USB ports, but it does come with a "legacy" USB port that works well enough. In addition, I have an external hard drive which is very useful for storing my files.      If you're in the market for a portable device with a USB connector, this is a good choice. The only thing I don't like about this device is that the USB connection is the only USB connection I have and I'm not a fan of the "legACY" style of the USB connector (this is not the Toshiba A55, but the A55 is a better choice for those who like legacy).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased this electronic to replace my old one after I found the new model was more reliable. I liked the idea of having an on/off switch but the button itself has a bad habit of breaking. It happens when I'm holding the phone and the screen is very close to my ear. I get two cracks in the buttons each time. The first one is on the side of the button which is easy to repair if needed, the second is on top of the new button. So far, I've been very happy with this device. This is the best replacement I've ever had for my old flip phone. The screen has better resolution and is not scratchy. If the screen can be repaired I will buy this one again.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from A well designed phone at a great price I bought this for my mother who is 90. She loves her old flip phones and is always going to use them but was unhappy with them. I had to replace one too because my old ones would not let me put the camera in or take pictures. The one I bought was a perfect replacement for her old one. I like the way it fits in my pocket so I don't have to take my flip phone everywhere.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this as I was in the market for a second wireless mouse. The mouse is much nicer to use than my mouse of old and works very well. The only issue I had with the device was that when I had the first battery pack replacement I accidentally pressed the button on the battery pack and it broke. The replacement is a bit pricey but I know that it's not the company's fault. The software and controls are really good and I'm sure they will get better as the software gets better and better. I hope that you will keep this product in production for a long time and that you can offer it as an upgrade to the old mouse I was using. Thank you, A Customer from New York.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased a KEF GX300 a few months back. The first thing I noticed was its great sound. I was very impressed by the KEF's high end and overall quality. I did a lot of research before buying this unit and I'm glad I did. The unit is very well built and is very easy to use. It is easy to connect up to my iPod because you only need one cable and it's easy to get into your vehicle. The built in bass management and bass presets are great for a portable unit. I use my iPod and my iPhone all the time and this has allowed me to keep my music selection intact while still taking advantage of the power of the system. A good price, great sound and easy to install. The only negative I would say about this product is that the sound gets much better the older the iPod you have connected to the unit. If your iPod has been around a while, you may want to consider buying a newer model to get the best sound. Overall, a great product that performs great.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had this for a couple of weeks now. The sound is great. The speakers are the best and they are loud, too.   The remote can be a bit finicky, but it's very good quality.

Well, we were pleasantly surprised! We really like the ease of operation. The bass is perfect. Our new computer is even better. Highly Recommended!!  Rated 5 out of 5 by James from Works as advertised! This has worked as advertised and is very easy to use.  Review of DAP3-2i-C:   A good unit to use for the price. The sound quality is great, the volume controls are on the side of the unit, so you have to turn the unit all the way up to get the loudness you want, and the bass is a notch above anything else on the market. The controls on this unit are not as intuitive as my other units but there is a button on the back of the DAP unit, you can just turn it on. A must have if you are looking for a good unit at a great price!  I've always felt that a good sound system requires some electronics. I've owned and used several portable audio players and sound systems. I purchased a DAP player to get into the portable players, which didn't have as many features as I thought it would, so I figured I might as well use what I already had. The unit I got is a Dap3-6i with Bluetooth, a power supply, a wireless remote control, a microphone and a microphone cable to connect to your car stereo. I put all my music, podcasts, podcasts I recorded and music from my iPod/MP3 player into a USB drive that I kept at work. I was very surprised at how good my DAP sound was. I did not realize that the volume control on the Dap player is on the front so I had to turn it all the time. However, it's the perfect level of volume. I am pleased with my purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The battery life was about a week for me.   I am using an ipad mini that has no wifi.  I wanted to try out an   wireless internet connection on this computer.  The keyboard is not as nice as the IBM model M keyboard, but it still worked.  It has some nice features and does not have a touch pad. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   There is always a small part of me that hopes that my computer will get some sort of update (in a few years maybe) or that I'll have the option to install an additional hard drive and get some more space. The fact that it has no support for the DVD drive I had hoped for was an extremely sad moment.   The fact it came with nothing more than a USB keyboard (no mouse, though) was equally disappointing.  If I could only have one PC on my desktop, this would be the one. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This thing is a beast. I can hardly believe how light it is, it is so light that it's easy to carry around with me at work and just be happy. The volume is just right but the sound is just as I was hoping. The only thing that I don't like about it is the touch screen not working for a week after the warranty expires.     Nice device, very small   The product is very good. I think that the sound quality is very poor. It's a good size for its price point, and if you want an iPod for the job, I think you should pick this one up.  I bought this thing on sale and I can tell you that I'm glad I did. I use this thing all day to play music and videos. I do use my computer often, so this is nice. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It took about two days to come.   I have used many different computer devices over the years.  It was a surprise to find something this good.  The screen size is big.  My biggest problem is getting the screen to stay in a straight line.  All the other screens were crooked.  If I had to do it over again, I'd get a monitor with a better frame.  I just wish it had a lower refresh rate.  You can never have enough software for a Mac. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this because I had a lot of time on my hands. I'm a little late on the game, but so far so good. I bought it because I needed something to make the time go by faster, but not just to get more work done.   It's great. The device has a large display and a very nice, large keyboard. The only drawback is that the keyboard doesn't support the right number pad, so the right-left control button will never work.  But if I need a little more time to do work, this is perfect.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had the S8 for two weeks. I love the screen quality. It has a really good resolution and crisp picture. The phone is very simple to use. I like the way the phone shows you the time in your native language (though not perfect) and it allows me to use my hands free. I am only a very novice at using the phone so that is a huge plus. I have not experienced any battery life issues. I would like it if the camera could record video at 1080p, but it does at 720p. I also like that there is a dial on the side of the phone. That way I can just dial out from my watch or phone (I have a watch as well) to make a call or take a photo.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I'm not a professional audiophile, and this earphone is not my first choice, but i like it a lot. It is pretty big, and very pleasant to play with. The sound quality is very nice, there is a lot of detail, even in the quieter songs. But I can't help the fact that it's not easy to get a good seal on the earphone. But it's worth the effort.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have to say that I have had my Zune HD for about two months now, and it has done everything I could have asked for it to do. I'm just disappointed that Zune has decided to stop supporting their device after so many years.   It was a no brainer to get this one, it does all I would ever ask it to (except it is too big), but I understand that it will be discontinued.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    You will definitely want a USB cable for this keyboard, the one I bought had some problems with the connection, but it worked ok. I liked the sound and the layout. I like that this keyboard works even when I have a low battery. This keyboard is a good value for the money. The only thing that bothers me is that there is no backlight on the keyboard.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Ralas from Decent but could be better, light I bought this keyboard for a friend who has a Logitech keyboard and this felt similar, however the Logitech keys are the same shape and layout and they have a more solid feel. Also, the lighting on the back is just a bit dim when compared to the backlight found on a standard PC keyboard. This means when using the mouse it has a much better light that you can tell where your hands are and it is brighter than on a mouse without lights, in my opinion. I have to say though, the keys on the laptop keyboard had a different feel to them and they didn't click with the same force that they do on this keyboard.

I had been wanting to get an external sound card that would allow me to connect my iPod (my go to music player) and the dvdr is perfect. It is compact and extremely easy to use. It does a great job of sound reproduction without being annoying. The dv dr plays mp3 and m4a files extremely well. I am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I own several of the cheapo brand ones that are a bit flimsy and hard to use. After owning two of them for several months, the last one I received started acting funny on it's own. I bought this one to see if it was the same. It is. My old one works fine and is easier to use than any of the others. The quality is excellent. I have purchased three other ones to see how they go. I use mine mainly as a desktop computer. They are great for web browsing and email.  Noise and power supply problems:  This computer's power supply has been an issue for some time now. When I powered it up, I noticed that it ran fine on a 20 Amp plug but when I powered up the computer, I found that my computer was now using 10 Amp power plugs. I also noticed that the computer ran hot when it was plugged in. The problem started with a small fan in my computer (80 watt) which was causing noise and overheating on it. I tried to figure out why and found that the power supply was overheating when the computer was plugged into my PC. After troubleshooting and reading up about the problem, I decided to return it. The first thing I noticed was that the back of the power adapter was pretty cheap and was made of plastic rather than metal. The power adapter itself wasn't any better. It's not very reliable and has a number of quirks. My first concern was with the cooling system. When the computer is plugged into a PC and the power cord is connected, the fan runs at full speed and creates a very loud whirring noise when it's on. When a computer is powered off and unplugged from the PC, the noise immediately stops and goes away. However when the power plug is plugged in and the fan is running, there's an additional loud whinny and a whine at full power. Now, I'm not sure if the fans are running at full force or whether the noise is coming from the AC power cord (there are two of these). My recommendation would be to get a good quality AC power supply. If you're planning to use a computer often, getting the AC adapter will likely be cheaper. If your power supply is good but not good enough, it could be a short term problem with your power supplies. If that's the case, then the fans should be replaced with stronger ones. The fan that came with mine didn

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this about a month ago and I have to say that it works very well. I have 3 PCs that I play the majority of my games on and these are pretty well set up. However, the best part is that there are no cables.   This also is a good game for a kid that has never played any games before. It will get a very young child hooked and if they want to play more after that they will.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this phone a few days ago and I like it. The phone has been in my pocket since I bought it and it is not the kind of phone you could have had at a cheaper price. It has worked flawlessly so far and its easy to use. The only con I have is that it is a bit too heavy and i have noticed when i hold it the top part of it gets a little scratchy. I am planning to replace this phone soon so that I can have the new one. Overall i'm satisfied with my purchase and have no complaints about my purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use a laptop. I have a friend who uses a Mac laptop, and he also has a MacBook Air. So, my friend and I both have the same computer, just for different reasons.   However, we have never been able to use our Macs to communicate on a daily basis, due to having both the Mac and iPhone.  I was trying to purchase the best, highest capacity wireless keyboard (and I did).   Unfortunately, the only keyboard I found in my size was from a different brand.  So I looked at some other brands.  The one I purchased was a bit larger than the other ones I looked up, and it worked fine.  After a month of using the keyboard and working with a couple of websites and emailing with my iPhone, I am so pleased I have decided to keep it, instead of buying another. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My new Sennheiser Wireless On-Ear Monitors are great! I bought a set with a pair of the new S-Series wired headphones and have been very pleased with both! I like the sound so much I can't help but listen to my portable music system while on my commute, which is my usual thing! The volume is great on the phone, which I have been using for a couple years, and I have no complaints about sound quality at all.     Value (1 star) :   This is an okay headphone for the money, but I think it would be better if you can buy some Sennhues (and other brands) for around the same price or cheaper.  Pleasant sound (1.5 stars) : A good sound and nice comfort, not as comfortable as some other wireless on ear headphones   A decent headphone, but in my opinion a bit on the pricey side

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It does the job, very easy to use, great battery life. It does need a battery cover on it's back. You'll notice the battery life is way below the high end devices out there. I bought this to replace my   A4 and I am very pleased with it, battery life on it is the same as my old battery. I do wish there was a removable battery cover.  What's good:  What's not so good:  No USB port? No problem, but this has some good points: 1. Great battery life, great portability, good portability. 2. Very easy to navigate with no lag. 3. Good for watching movies. 4. Great speaker for movies/Music 5. Good overall build quality. 6. Not all features were included in the box. (I was a little bummed about not getting all the USB ports and being stuck with the proprietary power connector.) I like the idea of it but I do miss the USB port  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased my Pinnacle eXtended with an iPad. I thought it was the best bang for the buck and a much better user interface than I could find on the iPad. In comparison, the iPad interface felt sluggish and very limited. The Pinnacle also has more ports, larger display and much less bloat than the iPad but still has a very nice screen and decent battery life.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got this item in time for the holidays and am very glad I did. I've been wanting a better camera with a built in SD card slot for the past two years and this does everything I want. I was able to use my 4x5 inch digital camera, my 6x9 inch Sony and a 4x6 inch Polaroid. I would give the Olympus a 5 out of 5 stars if the camera didn't have the built in memory card. I'm also looking forward to using the 4X5 inch Polaroids with the 2X4 inch Polaries. The camera is very smooth to operate and very comfortable to hold.

This product will last you a very long time.    Not great   What you get in the package is a nice, small computer with some nice features. The problem is that the USB port is not always available - I've had to disconnect several USB devices from my computer when trying to use them. (This is the case with other USB ports.) The only thing I really like about this device is the memory, it has 6 gigs of RAM, and it's very easy to setup and use.  good for a cheap computer   Great device but the memory is really bad it will run out in less than 2 weeks you have to be patient the processor is slow it's worth it  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was looking for a quality monitor for my business, which is doing a good job in keeping track of time and managing the company's accounting. I ordered an Epson PX3G1670T, which came in good condition. The display was in a black frame, so I could see the display when working with it. The monitor did not require a ton of work to get it to function as I wanted, and after connecting the internal speakers to my headphone, I can use the monitor to listen to music. It has a very good picture quality, and the color balance is very close to the computer monitor I have in the office. I was very happy with the purchase.   Pros:  Epson is a well-known name in the computer display business Cons:  The price I paid was a little steep, but that's the price you have to pay to get something good, and I still have to be on the look out for better monitors that do what the PX 3G1671T does (provide good image quality for about the same price).

Reviewer: mikehuffman - favorite favorite favorite - November 6, 2010  Subject: My first computer The computer I had as a kid was a PC. I bought a Mac for Christmas one year and it wasn't even a new model. I thought "I want a computer to play games on, I want a machine to do word processing, etc." and got a PC anyway. And my first computer was the original model... the Apple 2. This one has a few more upgrades that a newer model, but the CPU and RAM were exactly the same at the time. I remember getting this and putting the Apple logo on it, but not installing it. I got an IBM PC for Christmas and I installed it on it in the back of my house and it went like butter! I'm still using it today as my primary computer. I'm a software engineer and it still runs OS X. I haven't had an issue with it since it's been used.   This is one I would recommend to anyone, particularly anyone who already owns a Macintosh, because this is an incredibly powerful and powerful computer.  the only thing I don't like about this computer is that you have to use a USB keyboard to use the mouse. but hey, it's all about what you like. - October 28, 2010My first computer  Review of DJ0268-0268  by Tom O'Neill This is one of the most wonderful, powerful computers I have ever used. If you are in a position to buy one, I recommend it. It was not at all hard to install. I have owned several other IBM-PC computers in the past, but this is one that really lives up to it's name. The software is amazing, and the hardware itself is more powerful than any PC that you could buy today, not to mention it's price. I am a computer professional who uses Mac OSX and Linux and my PC is old, but I wanted something with the power of a Mac, without having to upgrade every year like my Mac does. I also like that
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    "The Ducky Shiney is a brilliant little keyboard.  The keys are large, bright, and tactile.  I really enjoy using this keyboard and think it is worth the money.   I have used a few other keyboards of similar size and feel, but I prefer the shiney look and the fact that this one has a key cap that closes like a pen.  It doesn't take much force to close this pen and allows me to do things like write notes, write on my computer keyboard or even put down notes on a tablet.  A few other reviewers mentioned the keys being too small for some, but my fingers aren't that big.  Overall, a great keyboard that is very versatile."   * The key caps seem a little too "smooth" but otherwise, the Shiney works great.  * "My first impression of the Shine is that it is very nice to type on. It's light and feels great in my hands. The keycaps feel great, and they're made of a very high-quality plastic.  In addition, the keys are small, and the Ducky logo is big and bright.  While I haven't tried this keyboard in my actual living room, I can say that it feels nice.  All of the keycaps are raised and have a slight texture to them, but the keyboard itself is also nice looking.  My biggest disappointment with this keyboard is that I don't like the fact it has a tab for the function row."  - The Ducky keyboard is my favorite keyboard of all time. * This review seems to be from a user who's keyboard is actually bigger than the DSC Shiney : * I haven`t seen that review or another review from someone who`s actually used a Ducky Keyboard.  If you`re on the lookout for a high quality keyboard for under $20, I suggest you try the DUCKY Shiney keyboard.   It's cheap and cheerful!  This is my second review of the Duckys Shiney.  Since the first one was very positive, I bought another one to try.  This one feels much better in my hand than the first.  But I can't get over the fact I can use my mouse to press the keys.  Don`t get me wrong, I don`t hate the mouse, I just find it less convenient than using a real keyboard. But the Shineys

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     When I first looked at this thing, I thought it was just a big flat panel TV. The picture quality was good enough, but the color was way off for me, and that was before I got this thing set up. Now, the colors are much more natural on this TV. It's much more accurate, too. I've been using this since I got it, and the picture quality is good. I love the ease of the menus, especially for the price. I use it as a second screen to my laptop, and it has come in handy. If I had one complaint about the TV, it would be the fact that the picture is a little grainy at times. But, that's to be expected for an E-class picture, so I don't see that as a deal breaker.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was looking at these for some time and finally picked one up. I have a Dell PowerEdge, and these have just about everything that a laptop should have. The screen is a tad larger than usual and it is a little more responsive. But the laptop is more about the touch screen and keyboard. If you need a laptop, you will have to deal with a few hiccups, but these are minor. Overall, they have become my everyday, I can carry around wherever.

I don;t use any other type of smartphone other than my iPhone 6S Plus, and I'm not going to stop anytime soon. I do use a Bluetooth headset however, because I have a hearing impairment. The S7 edge has a great battery life for me, with up to 10 hours of web browsing on 3G and 2.5 on 4G in a single charge, so it is great for my use case. My only problem with this device is that it's got very little expandable storage on it, which is kind of a bummer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The   iMac i7 27" 4K   is   very   good   (and   cheap   too).

But   it   looks   and   feels   like   a  junky   e-  pc   or   laptop   not   so   much   because   you   have   to   get   them   at   cost   when   other   brands   use   different   graphics   technology   than   apples.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I used to be a bit of a junkie for my MP3 player until I bought a cheapie, a Sony DSS-CD40BT. The music is so clear and full of punch that I can't believe I'm still listening to my old CDs. The new one is also very nice with an excellent build quality. So much better than the "good-but-cheap" MP3 players I've been using!  I used to love the sound of my MP-3 player, but then I got the cheapie (the Sony D-SCHD-CD 40BT). The music sounds great, but there's no "wow" moment.   This thing blows all other cheapies out of the water.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPod is perfect for me, and I do enjoy using it. The interface of the device is easy to navigate, and the volume levels are more or less perfect.   My only real complaint is that the volume control, once used, will keep on cycling down to the lowest setting for no apparent reason.  I have been able to get a hold of a replacement for my original, but I'll have to figure out what the problem is.   Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great Buy I purchased this product from B&H Photo when I picked up my camera. My main concern with this product is the speed. It seems to be limited to 2-3 frames per second in real time. I could only get 1 or 2 frames of a moving subject in the first 10 seconds, then after that it stopped. I also purchased this for a small digital camera, but only took a few shots for the article. The quality of this camera was much better than the one I purchased previously.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you are looking for a solid quality piece of audio equipment at a reasonable price, and a low cost of entry (with the potential for higher quality sound later in life), then this is the kit for you. The unit is very well made and performs as advertised, so this is a kit you might want to check out.   If you are reading this review looking for the best sounding stereo pair you can get, then you've come to the wrong review. The Stereophile Stereo Two Mic Kit has the highest-grade sound in the history of sound (or maybe the sound of the 20th century), with everything about this kit sounding exactly like the high-end gear that they sound like. (Note: I own the Sony PCM-7, but I have not reviewed it.)   There are better stereo pair kits out there, but the Sony Stereo pair is the first of its kind: a high quality, low-cost, high-quality pair of stereo microphone preamps, preamps and preamps. And if I had to rate the sound quality of the Stereophonic Stereo two mic kit on a scale of 1-10, this would be at a 9 or higher.  If I were looking to do a kit-review of this kit, I would give it a 10, a 10. If I was looking to sell the kit, a perfect 10.  Why it's an essential kit:  The Stereophonist Stereo Pair Kit is an essential stereo recording and mixing tool that will make you a better engineer. This kit comes with everything you need to get started: a stereo pair of microphones, 2-conductor cables, 2 condenser microphones, power cord and a 1/4 inch adapter. It also includes an extensive user's manual that will take you through all the features and functions of the kit in a very detailed and easy to understand manner.

It can do almost all the things an audigo can do but it's much easier to use.

It's hard to go wrong with the sound quality of the new SBA (it was more or less the best sound card out of the box). I haven't had it long enough to comment on the features of the SBA-X and SBA.

It is easy to set up, very quiet, very portable, easy to connect to other devices as well as a great way to listen to music on the go. The remote is a bit on the small side, but that is to be expected for such a small product. I would recommend this product to anyone who likes to listen on the move.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is the best sound bar I've ever owned. It can do everything and has great versatility. I bought it as a second set of speakers, but it works really well as a dedicated sub, especially with the included subwoofer. It's not as loud as a bigger set of sub, but the bass and sound are really good and I've never been disappointed.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Terence from Works great I have been looking for a sound bar with built-in subwoofers for my new hi-fi system. I've tried everything from the old Apple systems, to the Bose system, to a Bose sound bar that has been discontinued, to an Icom system. All were disappointing in that the subwoowors didn't provide enough bass for the high-fi components of my system. My goal was to find a system that would allow me to have an amazing system, but that would also take the bass in the sub's direction (the sub is the second speaker of the system, the other being the head unit). This product fits the bill beautifully and makes all the parts of the sound bar (speakers, inputs, etc.) work well with a subwooper, and still provide enough power to run all the high fidelity equipment that I have in my home theater system. If you want a soundbar that is easy to install, doesn't require special wiring (as others did not use), will still work even if you switch out the sub or the sub doesn't work for you, and will work on a wide variety of vehicles, this is a great product for you!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:      The SONiX is the only amp that I am using in this setup. The sound is warm and full. This is my first set of full range speakers and they really blow the other ones out of the water. The only thing I don't like is the volume on the volume control. I have to get really close to the speakers to hear any volume. The SoniXs are really sweet! The speakers sound great and are loud enough for my needs. The best part is the price. This whole setup cost less than $200!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My SONY MDR-XD50 is as good as my SONY SABRE-X1000 I got from Amazon for $100 less.  The sound quality is better too, and the fact that I can listen to my music, radio, TV, and DVDs on the same unit is a huge plus.  This unit is an excellent value for the money.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the dv6000 a few years ago and use it almost everyday on my laptop. I use it for browsing the web and watching videos on my computer, but also as a monitor and to play music. Its a real nice little device with a nice picture and sound quality. But the one thing I would change about it is that when the battery runs low, it stops working. I know it was because of a chip in the dvd drive that had to be replaced, but still. That has been a pain in the butt for a long time. I have bought one of these from amazon many times and would still buy it if it was still around.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was looking for a small and compact portable music player that also had a headphone output so I purchased the X10. I had used the Yamaha CS-1 and CS-10 before so I knew they were both good but I never really had a good portable CD player. I purchased this one to fill a very similar need but it is very much a step up. The only thing I wish it had is a USB port but it can hook up to my computer (Windows 7) just fine. This player is very quiet and has a lot of power. It's very easy to use and also has an auxiliary input so you can have the speakers turn off when not needed.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really enjoyed this product. It is a very handy device. If I had one suggestion I would have liked it to have a remote for the remote. I would love to be able to take this with me in my car and have it set and ready.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my 3rd time using it and I would recommend it to everyone who wants a good soundcard for the money. This is definitely the most expensive soundcard I've ever used but that's only because of the extra features and software features it has (more on that below)   It's got two channels on it so you can mix and match a stereo recording with a single mono channel.   Also, the microphone input works pretty well.  It has the ability to put the mic input directly into a computer and use it to record onto a CD. This lets you record the voices of the people on the other side of the table rather than have to mix it back into a stereo track.  If you record into a CD, then you can even change the track in postproduction and add the voice of the person you're recording to the mix!  This also comes with a handy little program called "Bleep Bloop." This program has a ton of features and the only thing that's missing is a way to use the EQ on the program itself to cut through the mix.

USB is very fast.  I'm a computer guy and this is the perfect box for my computer, and I can use it at school and in the car.  There is no need for a bulky usb hub to hook all the different devices to a hub to charge them. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using my laptop for several years. I have had many problems with the laptop including the problem of not recognizing where I left off on my document, which is not possible with a touch screen. I thought I would never use a computer again, but after reading this article I'm glad I did.   The only problem I have with the Lenovo is that the keyboard is very small. There is no space for a larger keyboard. The battery is also too small for my use.  I would suggest a larger battery.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's nice to have a "real" keyboard to use on the go. When I go to a new country and do a trip around, I am a big fan of being able to use a keyboard. This is what I've always wanted.    This keyboard is perfect for the iPad:  I'm not a professional programmer but I love the iPad. Since I like to code and make images, a tablet is perfect. So I got a keyboard with this model. I'm typing on my iPad Air at the moment and it's very comfortable. So far I don't have any problem with it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was looking to replace a faulty   (I assume the battery was dying). I found the best deal I've seen online for a new   battery, and it was very reasonably priced.   It came with everything I needed including instructions. I just had a few things broken on the first use, but after using the device daily for a few weeks I've been very happy.  It is not waterproof. It is a little difficult to turn on by accident if you don't keep the lid on.  I use a case to make it waterproof and that does the job. But if I didn't have the case it would leak when you try to charge it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It works! The price is reasonable for the value and the amount of control it gives you. I bought a 10 foot USB cord and it was a good price too. It's nice to use as a mixer. You'll need two in order to work. You won't have problems mixing in stereo, which is a good thing. You also have to be able to connect the USB cord, but not the battery pack. You can use the battery packs on one side and plug them into the mixer side of the unit, but it's a pain to do. You have to plug it in the other way. I have also used it as a computer audio output. If you plan to use it in a home theater, I would suggest getting a second unit because the connection to the computer can be a challenge. I recommend buying both the audio output and the mixer. I'm not a professional mixer, so I don't know how it would work well in a professional environment.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - this is a great device for my son, and i can't recommend him enough.   I have two kids, my son has always been very tech savvy, and has a passion for computers, especially computer games.  The only problem with the computer is that my son tends to get very bored and doesn't have much of a life. He is a typical 8 year old that enjoys a variety of video games and would like to be a gamer.  This is his dream, but he's not getting it because he just doesn't want to do any homework.  To get his computer game fix he uses a portable computer and the iPad.  I was so excited when he finally got his computer, but when he saw the iPad he just couldn't wait to get it.  After purchasing this, and reading the reviews, I thought he would enjoy playing a game, but instead he got very hooked.  My son has learned to play several games, but has found that he likes playing the game most.  You can set a timer for games, or if you have to get up and go to the bathroom you can set an alarm.  It is really convenient because if I'm not at home I can take the iPad with me.  He is the one who helps out with any problems with the iPad or his computer because he can't do anything on his own.  As far as I'm concerned, he is a very happy customer.  - (from the reviewer who gave this item 4 stars) This is a good product.  What I like about this product is the fact that you can also control it with the Apple remote.  However, if you're only going to use the iPad for work and you're not going to share it, then you're better off buying a wireless keyboard, and putting the iPad on your desk.  For the price, it's really good.  (from a user who gave it 4 stars, gave the same two negative reviews as others have, and one positive review) This iPad is just what I wanted. I bought this as a back up in case my other iPad stopped working. It's so small that I can easily fit it in my purse or pocket.  There's no way I would purchase a smaller iPad. I wish I had ordered it sooner.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The E-Pico is by far the most powerful and advanced digital music player in the world. The E10 will play back nearly any music file on an iPod, including CD quality music (at least CD quality, and it supports MP3, etc.) - the E10 is also able to read a lot of digital music files from other sources such as CD and cassette tapes - if the CD in the player is a defective or non-functional, it's easy to just plug it into an external CD changer for use with a music player that supports CD-quality audio.   A big plus:     The only way to get a good E10 would be to use a third-party device that is not natively supported in the E- Pico. This is true of most third- party music players, and even a high-end player such as the Korg Nano/Romeo.  It may be a good idea to avoid third-parties unless you can get the device from the manufacturer that is natively natively compatible with the E2.  If you have the time, effort, and money to buy a device that supports E-10, then you won't find a better device on the market.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     This is a really good toy for anal play. It's made of a soft material which is much easier to insert than the other kind I've tried.

I'd like to try the other size/type though. ,,,,   I received this as a gift for Valentine's Day. After trying it, I can say that I would definitely give this a 10/10 for quality and value.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been waiting for this product for a while, and now it is here. It has saved me so much time.   After a long day of work, my son took me on a hunt and found a dead mouse. It had been hanging for a few days, and when I cleaned the cage, I found the mouse had eaten it. I knew I had to get a new mouse. Then, at home, I put the mouse in the microwave for a minute and the mouse came back to life! It seemed to be working again. I was so excited that I decided to leave it in the cage to rest for awhile. Unfortunately, it died within a few minutes of resting. I took it back to the store to get another, and the woman at the counter was not impressed at all, she told me to leave the one I bought at the store for a refund, and that she was going to send me the one that the store sells. She told me that the one she sold me had the same problem, but she was very nice. I returned the dead mouse, and she refunded me the dead one.  I told her that she sold a dead one that she didn't even try to help me solve the problem!   My son is just the most patient person I know and this is just another example why he is one of the most amazing parents in the whole world.

I got it for Christmas, and I haven't had it long enough to tell whether it's a big improvement on the old iPod. It's fast, and the app works really well.

I really need the software to work, because my computer can't do that. I've never bought from Amazon, but I've read good things about this place. I think the price is reasonable for what you get.

After reading a few reviews, I figured I could only go with the best as far as electronics go, and this   is the best. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The device seems to be of good quality. The light that flashes when the device is turned on is bright and the volume is good, but not really enough to enjoy music without headphones. The app works well with it's simple interface. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I first got my P8D II, I knew it was a great camera. I was a photographer before switching to photography full time, and I was so disappointed when I bought the P4D. However, with the new P8Ds II, my feelings changed. I bought this camera because I wanted a good camera, but I wasn't looking for the biggest and best. I didn't want to give up a nice camera body for a huge camera with a lot of options. I wanted something that could be controlled with one hand and a basic menu system. I went with the P8ds II, because it offered a lot more than I expected. It's a great shooter, has a good viewfinder and an LCD screen. If you have some money left over from a previous camera, this camera is a great value. Pros: • Good for most everyday situations • Very good for portraits, since the viewfinder can be a good help when you don't have a close up • Great for stills too (even though the exposure compensation is limited) • Wide range of features • Great price • Great battery life Cons: • Only has two batteries; you'll have to buy a second one for underwater use • No electronic viewfinder; need a cable release to make manual adjustments Posted by Tom K at 9:56 PM

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm very pleased with the keyboard. It is very quiet and not as loud as some other keyboards.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have owned a G935HU for several months now. It has many features that I like. It comes with a CD changer. The built-in tuner has a good tuner. I have bought a few different Bluetooth devices over the past year, but always come back to this one because of the ease of use. This is the only bluetooth that I have ever used that allows you to connect to it over a wireless network or over wi-fi. Also I really like the remote control over a Bluetooth device (like a cellphone).
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have used this product for at least one year.  The speakers are clear and crisp, with the ability to reproduce music up to a very high quality.  I've used a pair for several hours at a time, and they have held up beautifully. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My main use for it is to turn the TV off (a feature on the TiVo) but, I also like the remote control, although I get lost quickly.   Very nice for kids to use to watch movies at home.  It works great for all ages but I do think it needs a lot of improvement to be useful in the real world.  If it has a built in memory, I would get one if I can afford it, but that's only if I use TiVo for that. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     This is the best piece of audio equipment ever I'm not going to pretend like this isn't the best audio piece of gear I've ever owned, it's just that the others were just too big and bulky to get to work with. I wanted something lightweight, and this thing is just that. It's great for driving a single speaker, or driving a home theater surround system. If you like audio that makes you feel like you're really in the movie, then this will be a great piece of equipment to get.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was very pleased with this item. The device works as it should and looks good. I have had no problems with it and have been using it daily for the past week. The only con is that the screen gets hot when you start using it or it gets to hot after a while. If you don't do this, you have to use a case.   This is my third electronic device from the company, and I can definitely say that they have good products.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I like the new TouchPad more than the iPad, which is a good thing. It's easy to use. It feels sturdy and I haven't had any problems with the rubberized edges or the back cover not holding up. The keyboard is actually quite good -- not better than any Apple keyboard, but still quite good. I also like the TouchPad's ability to swipe from one page to the next.   As for the software, you'll find plenty of Apple apps for the Touch Pad: Mail, Safari, Notes, Contacts, Maps, Calendars, Music, Podcasts, and a few others. I didn't use many of them, but the other apps I do use are all great.  I can't speak to the battery life, but if you're in the market for a tablet and a new iPad isn't available in your area, then I suggest picking one up.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had this a few months now, and it is so far perfect.  It fits perfectly on my desktop and is pretty quiet when I am working.

Yes No Wednesday, January 09, 2014  By: Andrew B (  Works great. No noise from the other headphones. Easy to set up and works well.  Review: Works great. Doesn't sound like much of an upgrade to the original Sennheiser, but it sure does make a difference. The sound quality is very good. The only drawback is the lack of noise cancelling. -Andrew B  From: New Jersey  Audio: Great sound  I like it: Yes  The sound: This little earpiece is great. Not much of a boost for bass or treble, but the sound is very clear and I have very good sound from the original earphones (and the one I replaced is still working, but needs replacing). I have the bass boost setting, and I can't believe how great the sound really is. Very happy.  (I also have a pair of Senn HE-1000s, which have the same bass boost as this model, but with a much higher treble)  (I also wish it had a mute switch, which it does not) , but as far as sound goes, it's great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The MEGA has all the features of my old Philips CD/DVD player. It is so simple that anyone can use it. The controls work pretty well, the DVD's play smoothly, I can listen to audio books and the bluetooth connectivity has been really helpful. A lot of people have been really critical of this device because of the price. I think they have been too quick to write the old school CD-Rom and DVD player off the list, but the MEGA is definitely on the cutting edge of the world of high-tech.

The best thing about it is the small battery.  It lasts a long time and is easy to change the batteries for.  I love the fact that it can be placed on a desk or table and that it has 2 ports, one to charge the battery and one to plug in a phone or mp3 player.

It lasts for a long period, but you never know when the battery might die so I charge it every other week.   The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of 5 stars is because the screen isn't as bright as it could be. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the Apple TV set top box last year. I had a few reservations about the device's design and some of its more technical features, but I bought it anyway to get access to the many TV channels. After using the device for a few months I'm extremely happy with it. It's so convenient to be able to watch almost any show right on your couch or in the living room. I find it even more useful than my Blu-ray player, for example, because it can simultaneously play multiple programs at once and still manage to store a large amount of program on the small disc in the player's case.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have been using a very old model of this unit and it has done very well, a lot better than I thought it would. It has no problems with the "hiss" noise that some other products seem to have, but I do wish there was a way to keep the power on as long as possible so that the unit would turn off when I'm done. If it wasn't for this one problem, I'd buy a second one just for the hum. This one is a keeper for sure, and much cheaper than buying new.    The BEST noise cancelling system in a very economical price point    - I have had the TCL unit for a few months now and I must say that it is by far the best noise canceling system available in the $$$ category for a simple speaker. It is so easy to use and is so much better than the competition, not only in terms of quality of construction, but also in terms on price. If I had a second to spare, I would buy another unit and I hope that other TCL will consider their competitors and offer some interesting products, such as the Klipsch Klipschi X12 and Klipscha X5, which also have excellent noise cancellation. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My new computer has been in use for a few weeks. It is a great computer for the price. It does not have any issues like other computers have. I use my computer at work and the quality is good and the price is also very affordable. I have been happy with this purchase.    Very Satisfied:  i bought a brand new macbook pro 10.5 years ago. my computer is still running great. i am very satisfied and my macbook has proven to be a great workhorse. i purchased this computer because i wanted a faster hard drive so i bought the SSD. the macbook comes with a very nice keyboard and trackpad. i have been working for a lot of hours with no problems whatsoever. i recommend this computer to everyone.  I purchased this for my wife to give to her brother who was looking for a computer. I had no complaints about this device from the customer service reps. The computer arrived quickly and in perfect working order. I was able to use it for a week without any problems. Very good purchase and happy with my purchase. Thank you. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this for my son who loves his video games and he's a gaming guy. He loves it, but he didn't know what it was before purchasing it. It took a couple tries before he knew what to do with the volume control and the power button. He has been playing a lot of GTA5, and now has GTA 6 and now he loves to play. This is a good purchase and I can recommend it. I have my son play some games for him that he doesn't want to play by himself like Rockstar games.  Product Rating: 5 out of 5-stars.  for the money it's really good   i love it it's great  but i would rather have a controller that was more precise it seems very flimsy. -Chris R.  the keyboard is cool and the volume buttons are really handy for games like GTA 5  -Jeff R. The controller is a perfect fit for the Xbox 360. It has the necessary controls to play most games (but also comes with a mouse and an extra controller).  This is a really cool controller that I use a lot but don't expect too much.  "Good"   It's very good. The controllers keyboard is nice for gamers and the key pad is good as well. You can hold the switch down and it works well. It's not too expensive to replace the controller but its not a bad purchase. The only issue is the power cord is not in the unit. So you can't plug it in from the back and the one that comes with the controller can't be used for the same reason. Overall it's good and it can do what the others do without a keypad and the keyboard. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iRig is a fantastic value.   I have two of these already, one as a backup to my iPad and one as my primary device.  I use it to manage my home theater setup, I use the keyboard as a keyboard to switch between apps. It is perfect for the way I work.  As an iPad lover, I am a bit disappointed that the touch screen only works in landscape mode, but there are many apps that will work just fine in portrait mode.  A few people may find the keyboard to be a bit gimmicky, but for those who need a keyboard, it is a must.  The iPad can only manage up to four applications at a time.

I have the Bluetooth function working very well, and it does the job perfectly.  It looks great and seems very durable.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the price.  My daughter, however, loves it.  For her birthday I gave her a Sony wireless stereo and her response was that this was the better one. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound is very good. I use the headphones to listen to music at night and the bass has a lot of impact. The volume is good and the music sounds very good, however the headphones do not have a good balance between low bass and high sound, and when I have my windows up, it makes it hard to focus on what I'm listening to and not get distracted by what is going on on the screen. This was my main reason for buying a second pair of these as I like to watch movies on the computer, but not have to put my ears on the glass. I think the sound would be much better if they had a bit more bass on the highs. I'll keep using them until I buy the earbuds that are described in the other review.

It has great built in speakers and a headphone jack. I have heard the noise level on my speakers is a little loud, but they don't really matter if the audio quality is good.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A great product! I recently purchased this item and am very pleased with it.  Here's what you get:  The unit includes everything you need to do the mod except for the wires.  It has four 18650 batteries, 2 (1X) 18350 cells, and a 2-button (single-ended) atomizer/clearomizer.  There are two modes for the unit: A mode is for use with eGo style cartomizers and 2 ohm tanks, where you want the battery to fully charge when you want to use the cartomizer, and B mode is the same as a 2 ohms coil.  When you turn on the unit the coils in the batteries start to charge, so it's really a simple device to use.  The unit has a very loud beep that you can hear in the background and also a very powerful, well-defined beep at the same time that it's turned on.   I would recommend this to anyone who is a beginner at the mod and/or is having trouble making it last. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a great little tool. It will come in very handy if you don't know what type of power source to use for your new project. The instructions are clear and simple to follow and the instructions are printed on the device itself. The device has a built in test mode that will show you any voltage issues before you run the device down.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Tim from I bought this for testing my power meter. The tool does exactly what I need it to do. The only problem I have had is that the test button (which is the one that you push in order to get the test mode) requires a small amount of push on the battery. When the battery dies, the test starts. The battery is small, so I had to be very careful as I was pushing the test switch. However, once I figured out the trick, I wasn't even afraid to get it out of the box. I'm really pleased with this little guy!  This is a good little gadget. It is easy to use and makes for a reliable power measurement. I use it for testing for my power supply and have not had any issues.  to test for the power supply. The little blue screen shows current. If the green LED turns on (or stays on), that means that there is no current drawing on the supply. It is also a good test for your power supply when you are working on a larger project. This little tool makes sure your project is working properly!  and is a must have!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this to replace a faulty battery.   I had to use my hands to open the packaging as it was so thick with the paper inside. The power brick came in the package, but you also get a USB cable.  I only use a laptop and my Macbook Pros don't have a full size USB port.  This cable has all the functionality of a fullsize one.  The cables is in perfect condition and the connectors are good.  To me, it's not a necessity to use a USB port, but with my Mac I find using the port is convenient.  There are also 4 extra pins in the power brick so you can also use it as a computer or as a wall charger.  It also has two additional pins that you can use to charge up your phone or any device that has a USB connection.  One complaint I have is that you have to put the battery in the correct position in order to charge the power bricks, which is pretty annoying.  Overall I'm happy with my purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPod is the most convenient way to take in music.   It's convenient to leave my phone at home because it works with my computer so it's easy to go between music and computer.  The iPhone app is a little clunky but I know some people will like that.  I think the iPod interface has gotten better over the years as far as keeping track of music and it's a little harder to use the iPhone because you need to tap in a specific order to play songs but I like the interface better on the iPod. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound quality is excellent, even better than what I expected. The sound is crystal clear and very natural sounding. I am now listening to a lot of rock music and this is a wonderful addition to my sound system. The remote works well but I wish it had a volume knob, as the front panel buttons seem to be too small to use with the remote.    Sound Quality :  : The sound stage is wide and deep which is a great addition to the sound stage of an integrated amplifier.   The sound has no issues with detail or clarity and I did not notice any distortion in any of the sounds. I can say that this does not have the deep bass response of a subwoofer and I would recommend using a sub for the best quality sound. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My favorite aspect about this monitor is the flexibility of the range of colors you can select.

This could have helped me keep my eyes on the screen while doing multiple things.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This device is good for its size.   I like the volume and the controls.  I'm not a huge fan of the controls on this particular unit.  It's great if you don't want to be locked in a room, but that's it.  The one thing that bothers me about the unit is the battery life.  As the device gets older the battery doesn't last very long and the device seems to lose its charge fast.  Even on a charge with the power button the unit starts to lose power.  This may be a feature of the device I have, but I'm sure it's not a big problem. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a very good, simple, very portable unit to use to make your own homemade e-liquid (or if you prefer, make your favorite e-liquids, and then transfer them onto your device) in the comfort of your own home, a lot cheaper than a vape kit or a refillable tank, and it comes in handy when you want to make a big batch of juice (especially if you're not sure you have enough juice to do it).    A great vape starter for newbies:  The best starter kit that I've ever used.   I got the kit with the kit starter kit and it was a great upgrade for my first vape, it was the perfect size for the e-cigarette I was using and it also included some of the products that I bought from another store and they were really cool.  A small upgrade for those wanting to vape for their first time:  I bought this as a second kit for the price of a starter kit with a pre-filled tank, i like it and will likely buy a second one for the next person i know who is considering vaping.  I also like that it is portable as well, and if you can find some good juice, you can make it at home for a fraction of the price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The PDA is an excellent device, very portable and is a lot easier to work with than the other devices I have.   This is very good for a small, easy to use computer which is what I needed.  This product can also be used as a computer to keep track of a pet or a computer of a houseplant.  Thank you for the opportunity to get my new PDA  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I just bought the S5, and it's a great device for its size. I use my cell phone every day (iPhone 5), and now I have a new one. I just wish I could get this for free.   Write a negative review about an inferior electronic device   It is a great looking device, but there are several drawbacks: 1. it can be very hard to adjust it to your hands, you have to twist the metal parts, and they get really hot. 2. I got this as a Christmas gift to a friend, and the first thing I did was to put it in my mouth. It is not very pleasant to be chewing it while I'm on the phone. 3. the touch buttons are a little tricky to press, as there is not enough space to fit them, and also they make a clicking sound on their own when you press them. 4. this is not a phone you can wear in a pocket. I have an old one I can wear, but not the newest one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It is a nice little device and works great.   The controls are very intuitive and easy to use.  The batteries last a long time and have been great.  Rated 4 out of 5 by K-Pilot from Great unit - Battery life is poor The unit itself is fantastic. I use it to control my C2 drone. I have the remote and it works perfectly. When it is on battery, it has to be turned on and it is hard to set up. You have to press a button, then you have to hold down a button. After a minute or two, it will set it up. When the battery is low, it takes a long while to switch off and then to get it up to speed. But when it is up to date, it is fantastic for it's price point. So much better than the old remote  A great way to control your remote controller, especially if you have one with limited memory. I especially like that it comes with battery backup.  in the US.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     Great buy. Had one of these when I first got into electronic music in the early 90's. It was a good bit more expensive back then but was better in every way. I have used it a lot over the last few years and have always enjoyed it. It's been used on stage, in the studio and in the control room and hasn't failed me yet. It has a great sound stage and clarity and can drive a decent sized speaker system without giving the impression of overkill. It will be nice to have this in the box, rather than a lot of accessories to carry.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've bought these to work with my tablet. When you open the box, there's a good mix of accessories included - a charger/power adapter, a mini-USB to microUSB cable, a case, and a quick start guide, as well as a micro-USB cable.   The charger/port is very light, just as you'd expect for an eGo battery.  The battery is also very nice in weight, especially compared to other brands.  I find it easy to charge the battery on my iPad and it's very easy to remove the battery from my phone.  At the moment, the power adapter I have doesn't seem to last long, I've put about 3-4 uses out of it already.  Although it's been quite a while since I've had an e-cigarette, I am now quite familiar with how an eCigarette works, especially on my  I have a lot of my own eCigs.  Overall, I like this product and I wish it came with a longer cable, it feels a bit unwieldy on the smaller size battery.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This is my third apple product.   I bought one of these two years ago for my bedroom, which is quite loud and not very nice.  After the Apple remote turned it on, I tried to use it for the first time, which led to the loud music that started with this sentence:  The loud music on the Apple TV sounded great until I realized it was playing the exact same music that the Apple DVD player was playing.  I tried putting my head against the wall (using an extension cord) to block the sound and the sound just kept going.  Now I'm sold and will not buy another Apple product.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good and quiet I've been buying Apple products for a few years now. The iPod touch was the last apple product I purchased. I can't get enough of the new Apple TV. I bought an older model of the apple TV and my friends are complaining about the noise coming from their units. The Apple TV with the Siri remote makes it so much less of a problem. If you are looking to buy one, it's worth it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been a long time reader of the e-books of J. R. R, Tolkien. It is not very easy to find the books I want in e-texts. I found these at a local used book store. They were in a bundle of other Tolkien books and all I could find were a couple of the shorter books which were very useful. They are a complete book. Thank you for making them available again. I have found all the books that I had been looking for and will use them again. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is one of those "perfection is the mother of invention" devices. I have a Yamaha keyboard player, a Roland TDM keyboard player and an Apple Music player. For the latter, my favorite feature is the Music Library. The Music Library is a program that allows you to store songs, albums or playlists. It's basically an easy-to-use database that lets you find songs you want without having to browse through the library or playlist. It makes finding the music much easier. It is also very easy to organize the songs you have stored into categories.   It is a little pricey, but I bought a second one for my Yamaha and I think it is a much better value. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Great little device! I have a Yamaha FK5, Yamaha FFX7, and Yamaha R6, and this Yamaha FM-80 is the best of the bunch! The FM-8000 is a nice addition, and it doesn't sound bad either. I would have liked to have a separate jack so I could plug my MP3 player directly into it, but I also don't have a jack anyway. If you can get over the design and the sound, this is a great little product.

I use my phone for both my phone and internet. The screen on the new iPhone X is beautiful and bright, but I prefer having the buttons on my device closer to my mouth. This little thing does the job perfectly. The only downfall is the price. But I'm still satisfied with it because it works so well.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I recently bought my new laptop on ebay, and I was not only surprised by the price but also by the performance of the computer.

It is very low. But overall it is a good computer.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The item arrived quickly and after an unscheduled power outage the charger worked perfectly. The item was well packed and all hardware fit in perfectly.   I had a hard time deciding which of the three batteries to buy but after reading several reviews I decided to buy the 18650 one.  The size of the charger and the battery options really appealed to me.  I bought this charger specifically for an   xl cell so I can keep all of my phones charged up. The battery option is nice, I can choose the battery I want and I'm able to plug it in and it will come on right away.  If you're not a heavy power user, this should be a good option for you.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this as a gift for a friend (a guitar player). I wanted to be able to hear music playing through my laptop without a big amplifier/cable connection.   It is a big improvement over the $30 USB DAC that came with the laptop I was using (a Dell Inspiron 1520).   The sound quality is excellent.  I can hear my entire guitar band through it, and the bass and drums are good and present.  There is very little distortion and no excessive noise (I have also used a cheap $10 USB DAC for the same function).  The only reason that I can think of that the HP2560 was not a better buy is that it is not a portable.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The phone itself is very good, it has a large display, very big, and nice screen quality for it's size. It is really easy to navigate with the capacitive keys. Battery is very light, I do not see it getting much use. It does sound good, but the volume keys are a little too far to the left for me. However, it is a good screen size. The screen brightness is very high, so no need to turn it off, but it would be nice if it had more screen real estate. The phone is definitely portable but it could have a little more power. The battery life is great, I did not notice any lag in the device. It has the ability to use both a SD card and microSD card, which is nice. It was a great buy. I would definitely buy another one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a Sony PXW-FS1 camera in a tiny bag and it's perfect for the job. It is small, light and easy to carry around and the viewfinder is very useful. I love my new Sony camera. Reviewed by: james c on May 31st 2017 I like the camera. The size is perfect and it feels good in my hand. My only problem is the focus. It's very difficult to get to focus. The camera's built-in screen can be seen in bright light but the image is very small and hard to read. That said, it's a great little camera and I like that it's rechargeable. If you're looking for a camera and you don't mind a little bit of weight (I'm about 150 lbs) and a little extra size, this is a good choice. Review by: Matthew on May 30th 2017 I have the PX20 which I absolutely love but decided to switch to the Px21 because it seems to have better picture quality. Overall, it is a great camera and a great value. It was a little bigger but well worth the extra size and weight. Overall this is my best purchase from ebay. I would definitely recommend to someone looking for an alternative to a mirrorless camera.  Review by: Richard on May 28th 2017 The camera is good, but I wish there was a button to set the white balance. I usually set the color temperature by pressing the button on the front of the camera but I could never get it to do that on this one. I was able to set white balance by pressing on the lens and that is a very frustrating thing to try. Also, I wish the battery life was a bit better. It gets me a good 12 hours of life but it only gives me 3 in one day. The picture is pretty good but there is definitely room for improvement. The only reason it got four stars is because I can't really get the camera to get me a decent photo. The Px1 has some flaws, but if you can live with the size then it is worth the price. Review in Progress  Rated 5 out of 5 by joseph from Worth the money! This is my second Sony Px. I bought the P8 and it was a great buy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've tried every other type of smart device for my kids to play with in the bedroom including a tablet, phone, and iPad and this one is the best! The app is great too!   The best thing about this is you can program your child's own music using the "music memory" function and your child can do all of the math with it by moving their finger to a number. It is the perfect size for one bedroom or a guest room and has an HDMI output.     No review would be complete without one.  It's just that cool. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a very nice electronic device, it's very useful and compact. The battery life is great, I have used this device with a tablet that has a rechargeable battery (the one with the micro usb charging cord, it took about 2 hours) and it lasted me all night, so I've used this for over a week. My only complaints are that it's pretty hard to change the channel and that you need to be a little patient while setting the brightness. I would recommend this item to any user who wants an affordable, compact, small and handy portable digital media player.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've only had the G2 for about a month, but I am extremely happy with the design and performance of the unit. I don't know what I would have done with a different product (i.e. any of the other recent models). I don`t own an external DAC and/or amplifier so the only way I can get good quality from my system is by using the G1 as my external audio source.  I really like this product!   This is my second purchase of the G-1. I have a small analog/digital setup on my desk. I love having a stand that takes up little space on my work desk. My wife also loves the design of the stand and the size of the box!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this about a month ago and I love it. It works as advertised and is a good value for money.   The only issue is that you cannot get it to auto power on.  It goes into a "sleep" mode after a few hours and then goes into standby mode.  When I switched it to standby it took ages to power up and I have a hard time keeping the connection.  There have been a few instances where the batteries have died, but nothing major.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:       A bit of an oddball, but with a nice feature set - I did find a bit of a learning curve, but I could be wrong.   In addition to a USB port, it also has a micro USB port on the back for additional storage. I'm using a 3TB external drive, but this could be handy to put some more games, movies, music and games I have collected on the go.  The unit is lightweight and looks like a nice piece of kit. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had this device for a few weeks now, and i love it. It works really well. The only down fall is that there are two different settings. This makes it a bit difficult to use at times because the screen is always off. For instance, when i am on my computer for an hour, and need to play a game or watch a video, i cannot get to the setting screen. After two weeks with it, i think i will be buying a new one. The price is great too.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have owned this model since 2003, and it has been my go-to music device ever since. It has many of the features of other devices (CD player, iPod, etc.) while being much smaller than others (and less expensive!). In fact, it has so much internal storage that I could put a whole CD's worth of music on it if I wanted. The quality of the audio is excellent. The sound can be loud but not overpowering and it is clear without being overblown. The software is intuitive and easy to use.   The only issue I have with the system is that sometimes the volume controls become useless. This is especially true when playing my CDs and mp3s, since the controls are a little small for my taste. Other than that, I love my device and would recommend it to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My iPod and iPhone 5's started to die a few weeks ago.   I noticed that the iPod and the phone would both get a little warm in the palm and eventually would lose the connection to my iPhone and/or the iPod.  I thought it was because the iPod would start playing music and then freeze. So I tried a different type of iPod with a different battery.  It works fine now.  (That's the best part:  It won't overheat your phone!!)   The reason why I didn't have this problem before:  When you plug in a new cable to your iPod, you need to do a factory reset.  When I used a different cable, the iPod still went through the reset process.  This is a minor thing, but it really didn't help in the end, so I got a new iPod and a new battery.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A good purchase but a few problems : 1. the charging lead and the wall plug lead are not interchangeable. they are for different voltage (3V and 12V) and different lengths. so to charge 12V you need to use 3V, not a bad design but it is a pain to change because you have to unplug one and plug another in. I've read the reviews and there are others who have had similar problems. The 3V is for charging 12V, the 12V is the battery. The only place where I can find them interchangeably is in a different color but the color is too bright for the LED to see well. I would not buy this again. I'm just not sure how to set this apart from the other products I have and if it really is all that great. 2. I have the LED and it is not as bright as it looks in the picture. I can see it through a 1/8" hole in a wall plug but it's not nearly as bright when it's off. It's not a big deal. 3. The screen is very bright, but it gets really dim if you turn the brightness way down. 4. There is no indicator of the time when the power is on or off. I don't really want one of these if I could just charge my car and play with my phone, but this is a pretty good option if you like to have a different type of device on the wall.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was very pleased with my Epson inkjet printer and it is very good for a home use.    When I took the machine out to print something it was very fast, the print came out smooth and the paper looks good.   My 2 cents, this was the best $300 I have spent all year.  It is great for the price, but I would be more impressed if it came with a few extras like extra toner cartridges.  So for what you are getting, it is a pretty good machine.  The only thing I am not that thrilled about is the way it looks.  I got a lot of compliments on the design, but the whole unit is a little cheesy and it just reminds me of an early 80s Apple iBook. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    After reading other reviews of the   iZotope RX 4 it seemed like an iZotsudio ripoff, but it works great! I have a cheapo   headphone amp, that's used as a headphone out in my car. It's got all kinds of great features but I wanted a good audio/mic preamp/input, so i figured I would give   the  i-RX 4 a try. The first thing I did was try to buy a decent   converter to get the most out of the power of my   MacBook. It didn't have that quality. I bought the iZOTAPE   ($14) and I couldn't be happier.   I also bought   a  USB cable with a gold plated USB connector.  It works great, I can get a USB sound source directly to the  USB out of my MacBook.  This is great, even on my  iMac (Intel) the sound is crisp and clear. I've had to do a bit of tinkering but the i-zotope   RX 4 works great.  I can't say enough about the quality of the audio from this!  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I own a lot of stuff and this thing is one of the best    5 out of 5 Fantastic product I am new to the pipe smoker and was wondering if this would be a good choice. The quality is great. The smoke is just right. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because you can't see the lighter when using a stem. But that's a minor flaw. The price is right, too.  3 out of 4 bad fit for me The stem on this thing bent a couple times, and had to be repaired. The stem was easy enough to straighten, though. , 4 out of five good smoke I was a little hesitant to buy this pipe due to the price. It was packaged in a way that made me believe it wouldn't last long (it's made of flimsy plastic). But I didn't expect it to be worth the money. It's an easy to use, smooth, very tasty smoke with no harshness. I really like it. It can be a little tough to light at times, but that's my fault. It will be a great purchase in my future!  4 out of the 5 good smoke for the price This pipe is easy to smoke. A very good smoke at a great price. I smoke it daily.  the only reason i gave this 2 stars was because of the way the flame hits the pipe so I have to be very careful with the way i use it.  to my experience, i'm having a hard time getting the stem to stay on the pipe properly, but i'm sure i'm doing something wrong. it has not burned out yet, just needs to be cleaned a few times every couple months. - 5 out of The 5.0 Pipe The pipe is well made and the taste is good. The flake does smoke a little hot at times but for the money you get a good pipe for the quality.    5 OUT OF 5 WORTH THE PRICE. I've been buying pipe tobacco for the past 10 years, and this is the best price I have ever seen.  I purchased 2 pipes at the same time, one for each hand, and one for a friend. I loved both the pipes. I'm about half way through the second pipe, and I'm going to start buying another. I love the smooth flavor and the great construction of these pipes.  that's one nice pipe! I bought 2
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought a new Macbook Pro for my daughter. The computer was very nice and I got a good price for it.   It was perfect for me but I am afraid that my daughter will regret the purchase and my decision. She is going to try the iPad when she has a chance to buy it. The problems I had with it is: 1) The speakers are not as loud as my previous Macbook speakers. 2) The battery life is not the best (about 2-3 days when it gets really hot). 3) It runs at a lower speed than my Macbook Pros. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    One of the few I actually use everyday, I have owned two so far and am using my new model which has a built-in battery life indicator and is so much smaller, light, and more comfortable in my hand.   The first time I used it, the charger arrived within a day of the order and the charger itself is very good, but I had to return the one I received.  This is not a review of the charger, but of the overall product and how it all works together:  So I have two Sony A800s (not my personal favorite cameras by any means, but they do the job) and a couple of Sony A7ii's for various shooting and other uses.  These cameras use the EXMOR HD memory card which allows the camera to shoot HD videos.  So what does it all do?  First, the camera has an internal SD card slot.  I have been having issues with the Sony A700 and A800's (and the A7's) always getting full of random files that never end up being usable.  The Sony A770 solves that problem.  There is a SD slot which also has a micro-SD slot which supports Micro-SD cards up to 32GB in size (I have a 128GB card on the A770).  Also, the card has a battery life indication which tells you when the battery is about to go.  If you leave the camera on, it will shut off when the charge gets low (and you can't easily get the camera back on without a battery pack or a power outlet).  If the battery drops to about 30% or 40% it starts to take a few minutes to charge up.  Then when you take a picture, the light meter on the front of the camera starts to pulse (a good indicator of the battery level).  It will shut itself off when it's battery levels get back to 80% or so, and when it drops to 80%, it starts charging again.  Very handy.  Also has an SD card eject button, which I haven't found on other cameras (but I'm sure it's there, maybe Sony's engineers didn't want to add that to the camera).  I am still not using the EXMC cards which have been causing me some issues lately.  All this is done without a power adapter because it can be recharged using a USB cord.  That's a minor complaint since I usually

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is an excellent device. It works well and the sound is great. It has plenty of inputs so you can connect it to almost anything.    It's a good idea to read the manual:  The manuals for the iStick 100 are very good. It also has an optional button that lets you adjust the battery voltage on the fly.  I can't say it's the best e cigarette in the world, but it's good enough.  The device is a lot of fun to use and it gives the user a lot more power.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I received a Sony Cyber-shot X100T digital camera and it worked like a charm.   Sony has put in the time and effort to make this camera the best it can be.  With the Sony digital camera, you don't have to compromise to shoot professional looking pictures.  There is a digital zoom lens that gives a larger size than the digital lens that comes with the camera.  In the image samples I have provided on this page, you will see that I have used the electronic zoom lens to bring out details that were hidden from the naked eye and I have taken pictures that are more than acceptable as well.  You should try this camera if you are serious about photography and want to capture images that will impress your friends as well as your family and your clients.  As the price of these cameras is so good, don't hesitate to buy this camera!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I use an ipod and an iPhone. I love the ipod for podcasts, music and reading books. It also plays music from mp3s that I buy on iTunes. I also like that it's small and the battery lasts a while. I have a problem though that some of my apps won't let me play music from my ipod:  My ipod has the same problem. I am on a plan with Verizon and they can't even get it to work properly. I get it working on another carrier and I am not happy about it because i have a phone and an ipad.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    You should be able to run this thing off a 10v supply and still have a USB power port.   The battery life is decent.  This is my first device from this manufacturer, so I wasn't too familiar with the controls.  I love the idea of having the power supply built into the device. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm using a HP Pavilion DV734 G3 laptop, which is good for light web surfing and office productivity. It does a good job. I'm an average user, I don't go on heavy time. It's a little loud, but I like that. I am having a hard time figuring out if my problem is my laptop's processor, or that my laptop doesn't like the screen. I think the processor is overheating but I can't put my hand on the power switch to test that. The screen is great. I use it in a windowed mode to watch movies and to play some games. It works ok for me, though I don-t need the extra screen space.   The only downside of the unit is that it only supports VGA. That's a good thing for me because I don' t have a computer monitor that supports that resolution, even though my computer is bigger than a DV737G. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the one to own. It works perfectly as intended. The quality is great. The display is very bright and crisp and the music is very nice. You have a whole bunch of different songs on the radio so you can easily switch tunes. I also like that there are some nice buttons on the back so you have more control over the settings.   I'm very pleased with this device!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you have no issues with wireless or are comfortable with the wireless, you will appreciate the device's quality and functionality. I am a long time Mac user, but have not been able to afford an upgrade until now. The wireless performance was good, although not as good as the T1 or other wireless USB hubs. The USB 3.0 port is nice, and the power brick is a nice bonus. I'm sure that other USB 3 hubs offer similar functionality, but this is my first wireless USB hub.

The mouse is responsive and gives the user precise control over the cursor. My only problem is that I need a dedicated computer to use it at home.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The first thing I noticed was that the keyboard was slightly louder than the one on my laptop. The mouse and trackpad have very nice clicks, but they aren't loud. I find that a lot of computers don't have enough power to give a good desktop experience for gaming, so this machine is great for that.   Overall, it is a very nice machine, and I would recommend it to a friend.

The design of the back is not so "plastic" that it looks like it was made by a cheap plastic toy like some others, but has some nice quality plastic parts that look quite good.  The screen itself is beautiful.  I really like the design of it (although it's a little ugly in my opinion) and the sound quality is nice.  A good unit for the money, especially for the price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    -   I'm using this on my new iPod Touch. The only things I'd add are: 1. The instructions for changing the cable are a little more clear than the manual on the device itself 2. I'd probably recommend to install the USB port on the back. There's a lot of space on the front. 3. I had to use the back cover to make sure that it's firmly attached, otherwise you'd have to take the whole thing apart to get the cable out.

I could not be more happy with my purchase.  It is well built, quiet and efficient and the interface is very easy to use.  One of my favorite things about this item is that it is a real computer.  The built in keyboard and the built in DVD drive make this a very practical item.   Rated 4 out of 5 by dlucas from Great piece of technology. However, the power supply is weak and requires constant adjustments when loading up or unloading.

Other than that, it's great. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - No battery is in the battery compartment   (as with most other batteries)   However, as an alternative to the AC charger, it is very good, the first one I have owned and I have never had a problem with it   Also, the cable can be connected by just twisting it back and forth, but the end cap is too close to the phone when you attach the other end.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - Very fast delivery. The box had some rust on the outside but it looks like new. This is the second time I have bought from the same seller and I will definitely be buying from here again. - As far as the electronic aspect of it goes, I think you will really enjoy what you get. I think the keyboard is nice and fast to type on. I did have a few problems though that I am unsure if the seller will fix, but I will try to post a reply for the next time it happens.   The first thing I noticed was that the keyboard did not have the letter "u" in it in the upper left corner like the keyboard on my PC (as pictured). It appears it is missing the "u". I will need to go buy a new keyboard. I'm sure if I could find a keyboard that would look like the one pictured here then this would be a perfect deal.  Also, on the other computer I own (an apple iMac) there is a white button on the top right which I can only think of as the power button.  This device is not powered on and has the same problem I had with my iMac: a white "Power" button that I can't figure out what it does. I have had two different keyboards on this iMac that never had this problem, so I just bought another one because I don't like these power buttons on PC keyboards. Overall:  I am very happy with my purchase. I got my computer back on the way home today and it seems to work like a charm. I would not be surprised if I get a third keyboard so I don�t have to wait on a third computer to be repaired.  I had a bad experience with the computer I ordered a while back. I called the company to see if they could send me a new one and they said, "we can�t".  Now they are on the phone with me and trying to get me to send a credit to get the replacement unit shipped to me.  Thanks a lot for doing such a great job!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this about a month ago and I love the way it sounds. It's an analog tape deck with a built in cassette player so no more buying cassette tapes from the store. The sound quality is really good and the controls are great. The only problem I have is the cable which is really hard to get out because there are tons of little rubber bands to hold on to so it takes a little time to get the cable out. It also has no on/off button so you have to manually turn it on to get music on. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good quality cassette player.  Was this Review Helpful to you? Yes No Monday, April 12, 2013  great  by A Customer from FL USA  Pros: great sound  Cons: doesn't come with any cables  Review: The sound is incredible. The quality of the sound is better than the recorders that cost a lot more.  of course the controls work fine but if you want to play it like a record player you may want a good pair of ear buds to wear. the sound quality was as good as a CD and I was able to play my own songs as well as other CDs. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPad mini is really good for being a smaller form factor. You really have a lot of screen to look at. I use my iPad for browsing and watching videos. The keyboard is large enough to type without taking my eyes off of the screen.   The battery life is good as is the performance of the device.  It doesn't have the same amount of storage space as an iMac but that's not an issue for me.  The keyboard may be a little on the small side but it's nice to have something on the smaller size so I can use it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - Great app - I have an iPod touch, but I do have my Macbook Pro, so the iPod would get very hot and I can't use it to make phone calls. With this app, I can use the iPod to make calls and the computer will shut itself down or be very slow, so I can go use the MacBook Pro. It takes me less than 2 minutes to turn on the iPod with the computer and just sit in front of my computer and call someone. It has saved my life. - Easy to use - I love this app! I use my iPod to call my wife's friend, but if I have to call someone else, I still have a computer running and it takes a long time to switch back to the iPod. With the app, it's instant switching to the computer. It also helps that the app is free. - Excellent customer service - I just got my iPhone 6s and I have a bad habit of throwing out old phones so I asked for an iPod. I was told they have no iPod, but would be happy to send me a refurbished one for a small fee. I am very happy with my new iPod. Thank you for being such a great company! - Excellent product - It's not a great feature, but the app makes life so much easier! I love that I can make calls without having my computer on!   This software has saved me countless hours of my life! I am so thankful I found you! - Great for business/education use   When I teach and I don't want the computer running, I use the iPad to make and receive phone calls on the go. It saves my computer time and I'm very satisfied with the speed and smoothness of the calls. The app has no features but it's still a good product, as it's a good idea to make sure you have your own computer and that you know what it's doing before you turn it on.   If your looking for a great replacement, this is the one to get.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have a great love affair with my new computer. I love that there is no fussing around with a big fat keyboard, and no extra buttons to keep track of. I LOVE the fact that I can now write in a notebook and not have to keep my hand out of the way to type the keys. I also love how easy it is to open and close a laptop case. I like how it looks, and how well it is built. I am very happy that I purchased the machine, and I would highly recommend the Cintiq Pro. I hope that one day my son or nephew will buy one too.    It's an old school way of doing things, but it works:  The touchpad is very precise, and you can even do some touch typing with the back light on. The keyboard itself is a little stiff, but that is expected with an old technology. The monitor and keyboard are very good at what they do, and when you combine them, they make for a wonderful system.  We just wanted to tell you all how great the product is...I have owned this computer for about 8 weeks now and I love it! The monitor is a huge upgrade from what I was using on my computer. It has a great quality. The keys are very responsive, and the computer is a joy to use. We have not had any problems at all with this computer. The only downside is the software. It took me over 2 months to figure out how to set it up and even after I did, I still have a long way to go to figure how to get the software to actually work with the touchpad. So far it is working perfectly for what I want it to do...I do some work in Word and Excel and the touchpads are perfect. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got this to replace my broken computer which was very difficult because the computer itself was bad. I bought this because I wanted something with good quality, but it does have the same problems. I have to do a lot of fiddling with the dials and buttons and everything on this. It is a good device if you want a computer replacement, but you will still need to find a way to replace the damaged computer you already have. If you don't have a computer, you probably don't need a replacement computer, but if you do, it is worth the money.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   If there is one thing I hate about computers, it's the fact that they never seem to work properly at a single time.    The only solution I know is to use multiple ones, but that makes me nervous.  The fact that the unit only works well with its own battery makes the overall experience pretty smooth and convenient.

He gets his hands all sweaty and tired from playing with the various vibrators inside. If it has vibration, it is great!!   I also love the little blue button on the top which reminds me of a door knob.   This product is much more powerful than the blue and yellow batteries, I've tested both with the blue battery. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I got this as a Christmas gift for my nephew's birthday last year and it worked well!   The batteries last a while (I use my phone for a job but this has lasted me a year), and the touch screen works well enough (I only use it as a secondary screen while I use the iPad, but it's not a big deal).   Overall, I like the device and wish I had bought it a while ago. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I like it. I like how easy it is to use. It comes with the software to change settings on your radio, but you will still need to learn how to use it. The battery lasts quite a while, but its not an extended run type battery.   The only issue is the antenna's poor performance.  I bought the VX-3 to take out on the road and in the car, as the GPS unit I have was faulty.  It's too bad that it wasn't upgraded to a GPS with better performance. I can't imagine having to use a manual for the VY-3.   Style, Features & Quality: 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    As others have said, this is a great little soundcard, as I found out the hard way, my first year of use. I purchased a soundcard in another brand, but after the first few years this one became so reliable, that I went back to my "old" card. I'm very impressed.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased a new    iMac in April 2010. I love that   This was my first iMac and it has been a great computer.   Great performance.  Very quiet.  Great sound.  Easy to use.  Can do things you can't with a PC.  Love that the system runs in the Mac OSX virtual machine!   The only thing I like about the iMac is the touch bar. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been using an electronic device for at least four years, a laptop computer. I have read numerous reviews on this particular product before purchasing it. I was very pleased with the performance of this product as a daily driver and it's been running flawlessly. This device is small and simple but very fast. I cannot believe I didn't buy this sooner. I don't know why I waited so long, I really can't.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love my iPad 2.   It is the ultimate tablet.  The multitasking functions work better than ever before.  I can use it at the coffee shop, while studying, and while walking to work.  It has the best user interface ever created.  Its battery lasts a good 10-12 hours.  For the price, it is a great buy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My wife and I have been looking for a new computer for many years. We finally picked up a laptop in September 2011.   I was able to download an   upgrade and use it very quickly.  This was only possible because  the   software I needed was included.  The   touch keyboard does   make typing   more   easy but there is no option to use a mouse.  I still find it   frustrating not being able to have a mouse in   my computer.  My only complaint is that it took three weeks to get a replacement as the  replacement computer never arrived and we never received an  upgrade to fix the problem. I think my problem is unique, but my wife thinks it was due to the fact she did not   order the  upgrade. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this in November 2011 and got it in early December of that year, and for the first month or two I thought that the keyboard was just a little too wide for my liking, but by March 2012 it was my favorite. I was having a hard time getting a decent screen on the new tablet, but with this keyboard you can have an amazing screen. The key travel is amazing for the size, the volume is fantastic, and I'm actually able to type on this thing in class, as opposed to the old tablets where I was constantly having to hold the device in my lap to see the keys. I even like to go to class and work from this one. I'd recommend this for all readers of this forum as well.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    After some years of playing video games and having my kids do puzzles on it, it finally died. I thought my problems would be over when the batteries finally died, but I got a call about the battery dying and I knew I was stuck with this thing for the rest of my days. It was only the one unit.   The only problem is that the power cord is the old fashioned style of cord with the metal connector. There was no option to get a cord like this so I had to get an extension cord like I had in the past.

It is easy to use. You do need to have the drivers but it is very easy to replace. It only needs a plug adapter and a power adapter. For the price, this is worth it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The device is good. The batteries run down very quickly and are replaceable by themselves if you need to.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have always used these as my primary way to listen to music and I am really surprised by how well these last. These are the only headphones I can listen to in the car.   They have a very nice bass response, good mids, and a very crisp treble, the kind that you want when you have the kids.  I do wish there was more of a difference between the higher and lower ranges, the high frequencies are a bit too sharp, and the lows are a little too much of a blur.  My only other complaint is that the cables are a lot thinner than they are in my other headphones, but that's a matter of taste.

I looked at a lot of devices, and came across this one.   It's been running smoothly, and the speed of the RAM is better than my old macbook.  If you're looking for a lightweight machine for daily use, this is a great choice.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this so that I wouldn't have to constantly run my hand over the screen and be annoyed by the same old icons. The screen is so much cleaner with no screen door effect, there's more vertical space, and the icons are a little bigger, so there's less of a chance for my fingers to get caught in them. It even has some nice little functions like the screen brightness.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I really like the keyboard, and the keyboard feels better than any other keyboard I've tried before. I like the fact that there are no physical key caps and that the keys are spaced out evenly so that they're easy to find. I use a mechanical keyboard, so the fact I can use this at work is great. I would recommend this keyboard to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The device worked great after the battery got dead. The sound quality is better than what I am used to.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Perfect as usual! I'm an avid audiophile and have been for many years. I got the original one at the start of this month. It has been perfect - perfectly stable, no problem with the speakers, the sound and clarity, volume and balance, and the soundstage, of course - as much as a big screen will let you hear a large soundstage. My only complaint is that I wish it had been made in the US instead of Japan - it is a bit pricey for a 'pro' product and I would have much preferred a US made product. But if you want a big sound on a budget and don't mind the small size... go for it. It's my first purchase from B&H and I'm happy with my purchase - this time I really think I got a great deal.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The quality of the electronic components in this keyboard is very good. I used a regular keyboard for the first time since I bought the model S back in the 90s, and I am very pleased with my purchase. The mechanical keys work well, but the rubber membrane keys are quite mushy. But overall, I think I am happy with my choice. I also like the fact that it has a built-in LCD display (not unlike what Apple has done), which makes it easy to quickly get through my typing session with some level of accuracy. The biggest problem is the size. It is a little hard to type with my small hands, so I am going to replace this with a keyboard that will fit in a larger bag.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The iDevices is a wonderful gadget!   I have been using it for some time and am very happy with it.   It has a great sound, a very clear display and can hold up to 2 batteries of power.  One of the best features is that it is wireless.  There is also a nice web cam for showing your adventures.  I highly recommend the iDevice 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this amp when it first came out. The sound is not the best, but I still use it regularly.   It was nice to have a solid source to get me through the day and through my office or home.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:      I got this as an inexpensive alternative to a digital scale. I did not see any advantage to this over a digital one. It does not weigh anything as you touch the plastic parts, and it is not easy to calibrate. There is no light inside, so you cannot see what it is weighing, and the weight can be different on different days. I am very disappointed in the weight readings, as they are too high. This is a nice inexpensive scale, but it is too high for what it says it does. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A great value. It was not a complete upgrade on the iMac - it has the same CPU, but is a tad more power efficient. The screen is great. For the price, it is great and I would recommend it to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's really comfortable, easy to use and it's really quiet. I didn't care about the fact that I had to take out the battery or that it has a weird screen that takes up a large amount of screen space on my tablet (a 9.7'' tablet, if that helps). It works pretty well on the bus, though I didn?t use it very often because of battery problems, but now that I have it I?ll try to use it more.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The first I have owned has had a number of problems but none that have been so important to me as it does not respond when the unit is in power saving mode and I cannot get the touch button to work without reinserting the battery. I have spent hours on the phone with different phone companies trying to sort out my problem and can find no reason why it should be this way. I finally got a new unit from another company for a substantial discount and now this one works like a charm.  Rated 5 out of 5 by R.B. from This unit has been the only one I've used for two years. The power/connectivity options have been better in the past but this is still the only unit that I have used.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iLX is a good value for the money. I think that many electronic gadgets come from the same factory that makes toys. However, they have made improvements to the design of the iL series and, as far as I am concerned, improved the usability of the device.   You can't go wrong with this purchase; I think it is a great addition to your iLx collection.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the A40 to add to a couple of other wireless receivers, as I'm not a fan of Bluetooth - it was a very good buy at $10.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    ( i am using this to read emails ) the design of the unit is very cool it is not too large and has a good weight to it so it does not tip over when you are trying to carry it around the price is great i have used it for a few months now and the sound quality is very good so far i do not like the buttons on it the sound is very tinny but the speakers are great for the price   i wish the microphone on the device would be detachable instead of the headphone jack   I will continue to use it until the next update it is very fast and good for a quick read of emails the sound of the device is the only thing i do wish they added was a mic on the unit

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the TvD-100 a while back as my primary tv tuner, but didn't use it much until this new box. I was initially skeptical, but after one month of using this device for a few hours at a time, I see why it's been such a big seller. I like the fact that it's easy to set up, you can add channels on demand with ease, the sound is crisp and clear, and the remote is very simple to use. The box itself is very sturdy and it's built to last a long time. The remote is a little hard to use for some reason, but it's easily fixed, and in general the TVD- 100 is great. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to others.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought the 2.0 version from Amazon because I want a more powerful charger for my phone and this one works great.  I'm still on the phone 3 months after using it.   Pros: Good battery life for a portable.  The battery indicator is very easy to read.  A very useful remote.  Cons:  I wish the battery life was longer, and I wish it came with a charger.   My two-year-old got me interested in electronic devices: I purchased a Samsung Galaxy tablet at the age of two.  It's become one of my most cherished possessions - and it has also become a daily companion for our two sons.  In fact, it's so important to them that I've added an HDMI port (which my kids also love) and built-in speakers in our new office.  My sons also love the fact that it charges and replugs in under ten minutes. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am very pleased with this device and I have two more of them.

Review by Dara - (3 Reviews)  Quality Price Value These are wonderful little units, I have only had them for about a week now but it has already saved me a ton of money! They have all of the features I needed, which are mostly for the TV/Movie, and the speakers are much better than the ones I have. The only thing I would recommend is to get the remote, but as the remote itself is great I don't think it really matters much. All in all, I am extremely happy with my purchase!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I have been looking for a decent headphone jack for years. I just purchased a pair of the Shure SE215 headphones. They are well made and the sound is surprisingly decent. I have not played anything with them yet but I am very curious to. I am also a big fan of the sound of the KEF LS50. My only complaint is that the headphone jack is hard to find on newer models of my PC.  If you are going to buy this product, don't forget to try it out!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought my laptop from the store, then it came with a broken screen that had to be replaced. The best part is that I bought the screen for free so I did not have to pay for the repair fee!    A very satisfied customer:  I just recently purchased the iMac for Christmas. When I got it, it came in perfect condition and my daughter, who is now 8-years-old, has a blast playing with it and the video and sound quality is just right. Great purchase.  I bought the i Mac today. And I am VERY HAPPY! The iMac was a very good purchase... I will be buying other Apple products from this site for sure.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My son has a new Samsung Galaxy S4 on a 2 year contract. It's an excellent phone. The phone is a pleasure to use and the software has been upgraded, especially with the recent updates for Android.   The battery life is phenomenal.  I use the battery to recharge my phone from a dead one.  We've had no problems with the phone.  I am using it for entertainment, calling my wife and kids, and running some apps (such as Facebook, Twitter, etc...).   It is an excellent purchase.  My only complaint is that Samsung has released some of the newer Galaxy phones with less RAM, but this phone has enough RAM.

I am not a huge fan of the small ios, but I have no choice because my wife hates me for not buying her a macbook pro.  This is the way to go. The only issue I have is that it is not very user-friendly. But the features of the iPad/ ipad Pro are well worth the price.  Product was as advertised.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is the BEST computer I have ever owned. I cannot believe the improvements over previous models. I have a Macbook Pro Retina with the i7, and the system works like a dream. I am using this for my personal use, but I am sure it will be a perfect companion for my PC. It runs at an incredible speed, has great graphics, and loads software fast. The only problem I had was that the screen did not come off. The screen locks up in one of the most uncomfortable ways I have seen on a computer. The computer's operating system is amazing.    Rated 4 out of 5 by D from Good for basic tasks The computer is very nice. The performance is good enough for simple tasks, and most of the time I use it, it's good enough. I've had to install a few things myself, but that was mostly because the instructions are unclear or incomplete. The monitor is very good, but as others have said, the resolution is a little low for a 4k screen. But this is a computer for the casual user, not for professionals, so it's fine by me.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - I purchased the 2.4ghz unit in hopes it was as stable as my older i5.   A few weeks after my purchase, I decided to upgrade to the i7 chip, which I had been waiting for since I moved from an i5 to a i7 in 2014.  The 2.7ghz chips seem more stable.  Very nice device.  I'm really hoping this will improve performance in other applications as I like to take photographs in low light. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    In the last year i have been using my iMac for personal use mainly, it does not run as fast as an i5 and the computer i was using was only a 5 year old Macbook pro. But the best part was the keyboard, i am very pleased with this keyboard. It has a very smooth typing experience, even for someone like me that is not very good with the keyboard. The price is a little high but the quality is excellent and i am sure it will last a long time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this for my boyfriend because it is convenient to put out to the side for his glasses and it is waterproof. I like the fact that it has buttons to add music and movies for him to listen to while he is in bed. I also like that it is more sturdy than some of the cheap plastic cases. I will purchase this again when I need a small portable hard drive for backup of pictures, movies, music, etc. This is a good buy.

The water is also very clean, and tastes great.   If I can afford to I would purchase this product again and I have many of the same questions as other reviewers: what are the correct quantities for the boil water and sterilize tablets. I'm not sure about the use of the water filtration beads as they are very heavy and it is very difficult to put them in the filter without having to loosen the cap, which is very hard to do when your trying to get the beads in without breaking the lid. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPod has finally been surpassed.  The original iPod, it's been almost 10 years,  has finally reached it's full potential.   There are some small things that make the iPod feel like it doesn't have that many features, but as we all know, that's a good thing.  As the iPod has grown in the past 10 years it has also grown in price.  You can still get the basic iPod and even get a 16gb iPod.  Unfortunately, the higher end iPod models are extremely limited in features and can get very pricey.  If you do buy the 16gb or 32gb it would be nice to have a case for the iPod.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've owned this one for about a month. First I thought that I'd found a great alternative to my laptop's crappy optical drive. Then I saw that the battery can be recharged with a USB battery charger and was a bit concerned that I wouldn't be able to connect to WiFi. I figured the battery would last a good long while but apparently that's not the case. My laptop, on the other hand, does not have a hard drive in it so I can use this one to store photos, videos and music. That makes it better than my old laptop which only has a CD-ROM.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you are going to buy a laptop, or other such gadget, you want it to perform as you would expect from a high quality laptop. The Acer Aspire V 15 Nitro VN7-591G-67N was very smooth and fast. It's quite quiet too, and has the best battery life I have seen from any laptop that I own. There were no bugs (at least on my VN5-591) and I am quite satisfied with it. I'm glad to have found this laptop to be quite inexpensive. This is the only laptop that fits my needs, and I highly recommend this to anyone looking to buy an inexpensive laptop.Read full review  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the "eBook reader" for my husband, who has been reading for years. The only problems I had were with a defective reader in my first purchase. I have since found that it has a very sensitive battery. It's very difficult to use the page turn buttons and page turn button to turn the page in my opinion. The battery doesn't last very long, especially since it doesn't charge through an AC outlet. I also think it should charge through the USB port. I've seen reports about a "light" indicator that is not on all the time and is very easy to turn off and on. I'm very satisfied with this purchase and am going to order another one to replace the defective one. It works great with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Overall, this is a good value.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased a PDP-11 based music player for the computer I am using it on. The music was fine, but it had no bass whatsoever (unless you use some of the more advanced effects on your music). The player also doesn't get loud enough to drown out my wife and dog. I'm glad to have a player, but I feel like the bass could use some work.

It has everything I was looking for, very reliable, and I cannot wait to get started with my development. My only gripe is the size of the diskette. I think it should be a little larger, and that the disk should not hold more than 3MB of data. But that's just a nit-pick.    Read full review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I was impressed with how powerful this thing is! It works well for playing music. It also has a very good sound quality with excellent bass. I also liked that the volume of the headphones is adjustable. You can adjust the volume using the knob on the headphone stand. I was also impressed with the wireless capabilities. I used my iPhone and I was able to use this with Bluetooth headphones as well. I don't believe the battery life is bad as long as you don't use it for much but I can see that it would go for a long time and could be a problem if you use it often.  Style of music you listen to:  It does sound good but I prefer earbuds instead. I've always been a bass head so I can't say I like it. The volume is also way off and the treble is too much. I'd say it's better than my old headphones. The colors aren't very pretty either. I'm just looking at the headphones as a style item. I just think it looks like something you'd find on a phone or iPod. It's not really my type of music or the kind of music I usually listen to in the car. If you want to find the right headphones:  I think the headphones are fine for music but I'd look for earbud type headphones or similar headphones.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have the same issue as the other poster about a few years ago. I thought I'd give it another shot as well. I have 2 Toshiba laptops - a 14" and a 15" laptop. I was having a problem with the battery which would not fully charge on the older one. I purchased this one last week and it is a huge upgrade. The only problem I had with the batteries is they are VERY flimsy. I had them fail in a few months on one laptop. The new ones I've received seem to be much stronger. All in all, very happy with it.

I got it for the very good price and for the price I get the best quality I could possibly get with the money. I have a Panasonic DMP-SV1 that is pretty much the same but at half the price. The only complaint I have with the DMP is that the cord is just a little too short. I think I will buy one of those mini adapters for the DVP-S which should have the same cord length. I like the quality of this one, so I have no complaints.Read full review

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought my first computer back in 1982, and was completely unprepared for the amount of computer technology I found at that time. I bought the Commodore C64 with the hopes that it would be a computer to play my old Atari games on and, for a while, it did the job quite well. The C64 had some quirks, however, and a certain degree of technical know-how (and a little luck) was needed to make it run smoothly. The Commodore 64 is now a valuable computer, but even today there are many of us who are only just learning to use the system. The 64 was a great little computer to use for some years, but, as it has matured, it has become a bit less useful.   The Commodore Amiga is a great machine to learn to program, but unfortunately, the Amiga (and its related family of computers) is also a bit outdated. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A lot of the time I have to use a device that has a big screen, like a tablet or phone, and it gets in the way of things I want to do. With the Kogan, I can have my laptop or tablet out at any time, so there's no need to take it out or use a computer. I love the color of the screen; it's bright enough to read the screen comfortably without needing a lamp or reading glasses. The Kogan has a lot of great features, like the fact that it has a very good speaker. I have it on my table and it's very loud. The backlight is great for reading the screen and I can see the outline of the pages without turning it on. My only complaint is that the memory card slot seems like a bad choice -- you have to insert the card a couple of times (to get the cards to fit), but then you can't remove the card without taking it off the back. Also, my laptop has a card reader in it, so that is a bad feature. All in all, I am very happy with the Kovan; the price and the features are a great deal.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a great product.   When I originally purchased this product, I was skeptical that it would live up to all the hype. However, I'm so pleased that I finally made the investment.  After spending a little over 2 hours installing the remote, I did some research.  The price is great, but the remote has some shortcomings that may bother some.  First, there's no way to program an external control for the microphone and soundcard inputs.  This is a HUGE disappointment.  Additionally, the soundcard input has no level control, but if you're trying to change the volume levels, I suggest you buy a soundcard that can.  Lastly, there are no on/off buttons for the mic and soundcards.  I didn't really know what to expect for the price, so I went for it and am pleased that it's performing well.  My only complaints are the lack of level control and the lack the on/offs button for the soundcards, but that's not really a deal breaker.  If you're looking for a high quality, quality, wireless microphone, this is the remote for you.  Also, the remote is a little flimsy, but it works for my needs.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound is very clear and very good.   This is my first device with 3.5mm input.  The only bad thing about the sound is the volume control, it is a bit hard to adjust because the buttons are located to the side on the device.  It also lacks a headphone jack which is a real bummer, but I can live with that.  I am glad it has a 3.1 sound option and the input is good.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently acquired a Sony MDR-Z1R with a MDR1R preamp and a high quality amp.   This is the best combination I have seen for a portable player in its price range.  The sound is full, accurate, and detailed, with a nice mid-range that is always present and natural, and very good treble for a player of this type.  In addition, the MDR is one of the quietest portable players I have used, and the amp is very strong and consistent, as a result.  I like the MMR1R even better.  While there are other better players that can play high end, the Sony is the only portable player that I know of that can hold a candle to the best of the high-end systems.  All other portable players that I have tried are so quiet that it is impossible to hear them if you are standing behind them.  Overall, a very impressive product. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this keyboard because my old one quit working at about 50% which was a huge let down. I've never had a problem with this one.   The key-press feels really good with the clicky action.  I do wish the function key was on the left side instead of the right.  It's great that this comes with a macro key and the macro keys on my old keyboard do not even do what they should do. I also wish the backspace/delete key was a bit lower as my other keyboards have it.  But other than that I'd definitely recommend this keyboard!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The best, most reliable computer I've used! The only drawback is that the computer can be somewhat temperamental; if it is not fully charged or in use for an extended period of time the screen will go black and the computer will hang for a few seconds. Overall, a good computer, worth the money!  The only problem with this is its size, I have had it since it came and there are still issues with it, I can't seem to use it for a long period of times and have to keep restarting it and its battery life is only about 6 months long, It does everything I want it to do.  Excellent Product   I have used this computer for three months and so far the only thing that is missing is a good CD player to play CD's on and the one I have, is not a stereo. If you're in a job where it's necessary to download a lot of software on the spot then this may not be for you but for me it's been the best computer purchase I've ever made.  a very good buy    This is a fantastic machine. I love it. It is a pleasure to use, as long as it's plugged in. I have a couple of issues with the computer: the keyboard is a bit of a pain to type on, the screen is not super sharp, and it doesn't come with a hard disk drive. However, overall, the best ever. . ,

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this because I was looking for an e-cigarette that was light on battery and easy to use. My e-cig was a little harder to use than I expected, and I spent some time getting it working. However, when I found the little adapter and used it, I was able to get a little more juice on my e-smokes than I was in the past. I really enjoyed the simplicity of using the adapter.   If I had known that the first one I bought would be a disappointment, I never would have bought another one. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you like the design of the device you get and use, then it is a good product and can't complain about the lack of a charger for the device.    Good Product   One thing to keep in mind is that this device has limited battery power.  So the power is limited and the battery capacity is not as good as other similar chargers. But if you are an avid gamer and you do not have a lot of games, then this charger can be really helpful.  So, I would give this one 4 stars (good design, but limited power).
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   My wife has a Samsung Galaxy S2 which she had since her college days. I thought about getting the S2 mini but couldn't afford it. So when I heard the LG G3 was coming out, I decided to pick one up. First, I was impressed with how slim it is. The keyboard isn't exactly large, but I don't think that would be a huge deal for someone who uses a keyboard for most of their daily life. Second, it's not just a bigger Galaxy S3. It's a whole different beast. It seems faster and more power efficient. Third, it comes with a bigger battery than the S3 has. While I wouldn't necessarily recommend having a phone with a larger battery than a smartphone with a smaller battery, it would be nice to have a phone that has enough battery to do what you want it to do. Now the keyboard is where things got a little strange. I use it quite a bit and it's great for a casual person. I wouldn' t know it had a keyboard if I wasn't used to it. The issue is that most of the keys on the keyboard are tiny and hard to reach. It could be a problem on larger devices as well. Also, there isn't a good software keyboard on the G3. I have been using android for years but my phone is still a Samsung. It has a pretty good keyboard, but it's a bit hard to use. If it wasn't for the little issues I had with the keyboard, I would say this would be the best Android phone you can buy. It does have a few quirks though. I'm not too happy with the camera, but at least the LG gets 4K recording.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great phone for the price, but could be better I have a Note 4 and was considering the LG V10. The camera is great, and the screen is fantastic. The V10's battery life was pretty poor. The phone was dead in the middle of a battery drain test. The LG did have better speakers, but the speakers on the V10 are pretty low end. . It is good, but if you are thinking of picking it up buy the Note 5  Was this review helpful to you?

When i first tried it out, the beam was pretty dark, but once you got used to it, it was pretty cool. The only problem i had with it is the battery life. In my case, i charged it to about 40% before i got the battery to drop to 1% and then it was dead. But at least now, its charging properly.

I'm a fan of the DSP feature and the battery life is very good. My only quibble is the sound volume levels. It really gets noisy when playing music, especially on the higher volume settings. It's very loud on "easy" tracks and a little on the high side on "difficult" tracks. A good device, but a lot of work for the money.   This will be my first unit of the "Echo Series" but I expect to be very satisfied with the results. If you're into bass music, this is the one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have tried several different products over the years, mostly for business reasons. The LIFX products have been the best value so far.    In my case they make a "living room" sound system, so when it came to deciding on a model, I wanted something with some bass - something in the 20-25Hz range.  This was a bit tricky, because the most bassy ones tend to be expensive, and I didn't want to spend too much on something that would never be used for music.  I decided on the LIFMAX 5000. It's a simple box (compact and pretty), with a few inputs, with a decent sound for most music and a good amp, and good enough price to justify buying.  In terms of features, it's a bit more than I would want: two channels, four EQs (and a "volume"), and one compressor. But these are usually more than enough.  If you do not need the EQs and are OK with the two channels being just for speakers, and are ok with having the compressor on just for low volume, you can't go wrong with the LAF-MAX 5000 - and I'm using it right now with my home theatre system.

You can't beat the price.  Good device - poor instructions I bought this with the intent of turning it into a camera - but the manual that came with it, wasn't great and didn't explain what all the controls did. After messing around, I got it set up and tried it out. It's easy to set up. However, the instructions were bad, and the camera didn't work (my phone camera wouldn't work) The box instructions were decent but not clear. I had to go to the store to get some help. The whole thing would be great, if they had clear instructions. My wife has the 2.5 gen and the instructions here didn't mention anything that I didn't know. Overall, it's a decent device, but the instructions should be in there.  in my opinion, the best camera on the market - but I'm also not going to keep my camera in my pocket because it's not waterproof (yet)
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought a Korg MS-20 with its new analog/digital interface. I am very pleased with the sound on this unit. The sound quality is quite good and the MS-21 has the same sound quality. The MS-30 will be my next computer and keyboard. I just wish the keys and touchpad were a bit smoother.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Rok from Good, but a little slow to respond When the machine arrived, I had no problem with the computer's speed - it ran quickly and smoothly from the time it was set up and into the first tune. When I played the first piece of music it played back as it should - with good, full, warm, well recorded sound. A few minutes into the second piece, however, the keyboard slowed and sounded like it was on some sort of auto-tuner. I had to turn it off and on again several times before it came back to normal speed. If you like the sound of a high-quality computer with good memory and MIDI capability, this is a good option. If the slow response bothers you, it's probably time to get a new keyboard. The sound is not the main problem. The main problem is with the price of this machine. The price for a 32-bit machine is less than half that of a modern computer of comparable speed. I've used the MSX1 in the past and it was much more reliable - but with the MS20, I'm concerned about my future with this machine - because I'm going to want a computer with a much larger memory and a lot faster processor and faster interface. Perhaps the MS21 is better than the MS30...but not by much. Bought the keyboard to replace my MS-80 - it is much larger and better than my old one. I like the more "modern" look. However, I've had it less than 2 months and the keys are very mushy. After playing music for a few minutes the keys become "rubbery". Also the backspace key doesn't work. Other than that I'm very pleased so far. 1-year replacement warranty available (within 30 days of purchase) - email for details
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a good buy for the money, and it was just what I wanted. I bought this one specifically because of the remote. I have a Sony T1 with a built in IR blaster, and I found that when I needed to use it for remote control, the controls were difficult to use. I didn't really use the remote that much because of it. With the remote and a good remote controller, I feel much more comfortable using the IR blaster. I also think this remote is better than the Sony's I have.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I've tried several of the cheap laptops I see on ebay. This one came with the operating system pre-installed, and I like how compact it is.   The touch screen is very responsive.  You can control the brightness and sound from the keyboard.  The software works flawlessly. The only problem I've encountered so far is that the batteries don't last long when using the computer on the floor.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was looking for a portable, battery-operated speaker for the living room, and decided on the Panasonic HS-W110V. The speaker is very portable and very loud, and can even be used to amplify music (with a little practice).   The only drawback is that the volume level needs to be set to high, to get the speakers' full output.   Other than that, I love it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had the iphone iphones for about 3 years now.   It has become my go to device for entertainment, as well as for just calling my friends and family.  It is very easy to use, and easy to update the app, as  the iphona iphonas is so updated.  The iphoni is very bright, has great speakerphone features, and is  easy to setup and use.  I'm very pleased with the  iphone. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have to say this is the best phone I have ever bought, it has everything I wanted in a phone, the screen is good as well. The only downside is the price though.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The best audio monitor I have ever used   I had previously owned a couple of different portable audio monitors - a $500 Tascam, and a $300 Behringer.   Since I recently bought the new Tascamp, I wanted a portable speaker for my laptop, and I decided to pick up a cheap one like this one .   This speaker was good, but the quality seemed a little low, even with the cheap $100 speakers I was buying.  I looked through the Tascamps website, and the company had a few good reviews, so I figured I would give the sound quality a try.  After about a week of listening to this speaker, and finding it was loud enough for my needs, I decided it was worth the price, even if the sound wasn't good.  To make a long story short, I bought this speaker for $200 on Ebay.  The reviews seemed pretty good, so it seemed like a good deal, even though I ended up spending a little more for the "best" speaker in the $200-$300 range.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The design is pretty cool, and the screen is a nice size and brightness. I like the ability to take pictures with it, although I would have preferred a larger screen.   My only complaint is that it is hard to hold the unit while doing something, like reading. This is a really nice little device, and I recommend it for people who are just looking for a nice device and don't care about a lot of features.

It is a good phone and I would recommend this phone.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The iPod Touch has become my go to MP3 player. It's small and lightweight and allows me to listen to music with no fuss. There are some minor quality problems like the auto mute/start button doesn't work sometimes and the touch screen sometimes flickers. Still I'd definitely recommend this for music lovers.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love this little device! The remote control is really easy to use, and is the first remote you'll find on a smart TV, laptop or other smart device that allows you to go directly to your TV shows and movies.   The remote is good in most ways. You can't tell the difference between this remote and a standard TV remote. The buttons are big, but not too big. This can be a plus or a minus depending on your comfort with large buttons on a regular remote. I don't have a huge collection of TV shows or movies, but the DVR functions really well, and you have a lot of control over it. I was able to use a cable box (like Cablevision or Directv) as a backup in the event that the DV tuner stops working.  My main problem was that the remote had to be manually changed to function with my cable tuner in order to work with my other tuners.  I would have given this a full 10 if it wasn't for the need to change the remote every time I used my other TV tuners (Vue, DirecTV, Comcast, Dish Network) The remote does the job, but you don't know it's the DIVX player until you've used it with an antenna, and then you realize that your remote has a DVI port. I would recommend this device to anyone who wants to go to an antenna to watch TV shows/movies.  Rating:

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love my    iPad. I have never wanted a tablet so badly and I have to say i got exactly what I wanted.    5 5 Great iPad 5 Great Tablet for the price! Was extremely excited to get this as soon as it came in the mail, but when it arrived it was way better than I expected. I've been using the iPad 2 and a couple of other tablets for awhile now, but this tablet is so much better in terms of being able to navigate with one hand. I was pleasantly surprised to find that you can use a stylus to draw and use the touch screen with a styli. Very happy, and highly recommend this!  4 4 Good buy - but a couple more things Could do with an Ethernet port. The iPad 2 seems to be more durable and I'd probably get a more robust version of this to carry with me. The rubber feet should be included as well - they aren't on the iPad, but would be nice to have. Other than that I'd give it 4.5 stars.  3 3 Very good tablet, but could be better I used this as a replacement to a 7" Windows 10 Mobile tablet. While it isn't the best, the performance is acceptable. I found the screen to be very sharp and crisp at any angle, especially when looking at full-screen images. It can be hard to get a proper grip on the screen for extended periods, but it isn''t really a problem. One thing I'm unhappy about is that the speakers are too loud. I'm sure I'll get used to this as it gets used to the Windows 10 operating system, but the sound is just a little too loud for my liking. Still, as a beginner or someone who just wants to get the job done, I'm happy to have a tablet for light use and entertainment. If you''re looking for the best Windows 10 tablet, I''m not sure what you''d be doing with your $100.  the best $100 i can find - except for the cost The iPad is an excellent little tablet and I''d recommend it to anyone. It is very easy to use for anything that you want to do. However, for those that use Microsoft Edge and the Office Suite, the tablet isn't going to cut it.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    For the money, this thing is fantastic and very good value!   When I got the item, I couldn't believe how heavy the box was, and how big the unit was.   To my surprise it's a USB DAC, but a quality one.  The cable is very nice and long.  It comes with 2 cables, which I haven't tested yet, but I'm sure will be just fine.  I have no complaints about the product.   Nice sound quality:  I like the sound of this device. I think that it will be great for my computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    One of the most versatile, useful, well-built and convenient devices I have ever used in my life.   The only drawback is the high price for such a well-engineered unit.  Best Buy    5 out of 5 Best Buy -   It's great to have a portable charger to carry around with me, especially when the batteries are down. I can charge my cell phone or laptop while in the field without worrying about the battery, which is very useful.  4 out of 4 stars Not bad Very versatile to charge multiple cell phones at once. Only issue is when I use one of the larger batteries for the charger to work it's taking me 3 tries to get it to work for a new battery with the one I have now I can only charge it for 1-2 hours on each charge. :  1 out of 1,Reviewed by:  and I thought I would love this product but...I've got to disagree with most of the comments.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The product is extremely useful and works well. I have used the computer and cell phone and these do not disappoint. My only complaint is that when the battery dies, the unit does not automatically switch to standby and can take hours to switch to battery power. This is not the end of the world but can cause frustration for long work sessions on the go.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought my first ereader a little over a year ago and I am completely satisfied. The e-reader is large enough to easily read at the dining room table or at work. The colors are great, the screen has a good amount of color. I have used the reader for many books I have bought and read. It is easy to navigate, I can find books easily and I love the size of the ereader. I will keep it for many years to come. I recommend this to everyone who is looking for a good e-reader that is easy and comfortable to read in any environment.    I am absolutely pleased with this purchase   It came very quickly and was easy to put together, it looks good and seems well built. The book it came with was good and the cover made it look real nice too. I like the way it folds into a book and the covers seem very good quality. It came with a good book but didn't bother to review it or tell me how it is. I can't wait to get my next e-book, I hope I get more books with it for my library to try.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The sound is clear and well balanced, but I feel the volume settings are a bit low.  The build quality is good and solid. The buttons feel good and the unit has an attractive look.   However, there is a minor problem with the audio quality (I have the iPod Touch 6th Gen), so if you like your audio to be pristine I would recommend upgrading the headphone jack to a full-sized jack. All in all, the A11-88 is a solid performer with a solid build quality.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had a problem with the old one for a very long time. The problem is that it has been very hard to adjust the brightness of the screen since it has a "fixed" brightness control. I had a friend of mine tell me that he bought one, but after two years he gave it away. I still have the original. I just find that the new model is better in every way. It's just a bit easier to adjust from the LCD screen.  Rated 5 out of 5 by T.D. from Very good for a budget I was really excited about this. I got it for Christmas so I could give it a test run and then get it back. I don't remember the last time I did that with electronics (i think my old iMac had been a bit of a crapshoot). The build quality was fantastic. I've only used it for a couple of hours so I don a bit less on battery life. I'm not sure if I'm happy or not. I guess it's okay if you don't plan on using the unit all the time. As the reviews were saying, this unit is great for those that don't mind messing with the controls a bit. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have not had a problem with this mouse. I have used it for a week.  The best part about the mouse is the fact that it is adjustable.   If you have a small wrist then you will not be able to move it to your thumb, but if you have very big wrists, you can do it.  I like the fact the the left and right buttons are positioned on different sides of the mouse.  One thing is to keep in mind that it does not have a center button.  For me it was just a small problem but not really an issue because I never use the center button (only the scroll wheel) of my mouse.

I didn't realize that they had a replacement for the hard drive. The only con I found is that the bluetooth is very weak so if you need the blu ray player to work you may need a little extra power.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    If you are looking for a laptop for gaming and music that does not get too much use, look no further than the Dell XPS 13. It is an amazing laptop and is an absolute joy to use. While it does not have the hardware of a more powerful laptop, it does offer great bang for the buck. The keyboard is also well designed. The screen is nice and sharp. The laptop has excellent battery life with up to 7 hours of web browsing and about 2 hours of video playback with heavy use. A lot of people say the battery life is average but I disagree. I have gotten through 7 or 8 days of gaming in light to moderate use without any issue at all. The battery is big enough to keep your phone charged and still has the ability to hold a full charge for a while as well. The only time it died was on the way to the gym and I had to stop using it for a bit to charge it. I really love this laptop and have used it for the last week or so. I know a lot of users complain about the weight but the laptop is not heavy at all at 13 pounds. I also love the trackpad. It feels very responsive and is a joy to type on. If you want a full laptop with some gaming chops at a decent price that will easily last 7 days, get a Dell Xps 13 or a Samsung.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Michael B. from Great Laptop. The design is nice, but the real draw for me was the performance. The performance is very good for a 14-inch laptop. I mostly do 3D modeling and animation, but also Photoshop for some light graphic design. The webcam is a bit limited, but I can't say that I notice a difference. I don't even like using the touchpad very much, but for the price it's pretty good. Overall, I think this is a very good system for its size. The biggest downside is battery life (and I do not mean just one battery), but I would say that this is more an issue of the manufacturer's optimization of the hardware. They have to do this to run the system at its full potential. The price is definitely right too at about $600, but if you want to get a system that is truly capable, you should look at a laptop that is not a premium product. The only thing I would change would be a keyboard that could be a bit more comfortable. It's

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this device to keep my old   ios 8.1 devices in working order. The   port is easy to use, and it does the job well. The unit doesn't have as many options as other units, but it's good to have some to choose from.    Best of the best:  So this is the first time I have purchased an   a dv and I have to say it is just as i always knew it would be. I have used a number of different   adapters and all I can say is WOW!!!! The  port on this   adapter is really good I'm   really impressed with this product and   it is   worth the money and  if it didn't have the   included ios adapter I'd buy it again.  I love it, I know how to use it  ... this thing is great   the  osd does the trick and i can connect a   dv to my   pc and  it gives you control over the  iospc.. it does   come   with   ocs, but i would   recommend getting the  dvd   for it .   The  d v comes with a number   of different video   files and that   is what you want because they work with  i  oskc.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    One of the things I really enjoy about my Pinnacle Audio S3 Pro is its low noise floor and wide soundstage.  I have been using a Soundcraft M25 and was really disappointed when I started to hear a little static in the background during some songs.  However with the S3 Pinnacle I have seen no such problem.   I also love the fact that my S3 is built like a tank.  It is made from a very sturdy aluminum alloy and feels very high quality.  This is one of the best portable mics I have ever used.  Recommended.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Amazing! I bought this mike last week and was impressed that it sounds so much better than my other mics. It has a very wide, and full sound, while still having a very clean, flat frequency response.  The mic's volume controls allow you to dial in the level that you want to use.

I am still learning the layout but it is getting easier and easier.  After I find the correct position, I can play for hours without getting bored. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have two Sony Vaio mpgs and am very pleased. I am in my 20's, so my laptop isn't as well built as some of the newer models. That being said, I like that this Vaio is so sturdy and well-built. I love that it has a headphone jack.   Overall, I would definitely recommend this device if you want a high-end desktop computer with an impressive screen.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been using this product for a few months now and love it.   The only complaint I have is that the batteries are very expensive and the product is overpriced, but it does the job.  The price is right at $20 a piece

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased the JU-Tech G-Flex USB 2.0 to serial adapter in hopes of a faster connection to my Mac Pro's USB 2 ports for use with my Sony HDR-HDR2 Blu-Ray player.   My hope was not all too successful.  My cable was about half the length of the one listed on the JUs Tech web site and it has no indicator for the direction the cable is twisted.  The twist at the bottom is too short.  I had to twist it three times to be sure it was connected properly.  There is no label on the front of the cable either.  This is not a deal breaker for me since I have used this type of cable before and I do not anticipate too much change in speed.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The price was a little high but I think i'll have my phone for a while now.   I bought this because I need something to call people.  I have a cell phone that I was using for awhile. The phone itself is good. The app is great and can dial the phone. The screen is better than expected. It only has one button on the bottom and has a touch screen.  This is the only phone I will get.   Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great phone. Great features for an affordable price. Good battery life. Battery lasts a good 10 hours of talk time, and a good 3-4 hours of internet browsing. Battery life is average at best, even with the screen brightness set at max. However, the battery life is great on the standard model, so if you are not satisfied with it, you can easily upgrade to the more expensive model.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I got this thing a year ago, I think in December of 2014, and it has been perfect since then. I don't know if I'm the only person who is going through the same troubles but my headphones are always on the fritz when I walk into a room with a big fan blowing. Now when I put this thing on, it automatically turns off whenever I walk away from my laptop. The sound quality is great, and I don´t have to worry about the noise. It has a nice sound for gaming or for listening to my music. My favorite thing about this thing is the fact that it automatically shuts off whenever my other headphones are on. I love that I don�t have an external amp to make sure my sound is full and I can hear my speakers.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have to say that the sound quality is absolutely incredible for the price.  It has a very clear and balanced sound that is very easy to control.  I am a very satisfied customer.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The VGA port is great, I haven't had any problems with my monitor being "stuck" or "stuttering" if I watch a DVD while playing a game on my computer. I don't have a huge collection of DVDs, but I find the titles that are compatible are pretty impressive.   My only problem is I have to use a mouse or some kind of keyboard to use the mouse.  The Best of both worlds - Best of Both Worlds:  I love the keyboard, but the mouse is still a pain. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this when it came out a couple years ago. I don't even remember when it was released, but I love it. I just use it as a headphone amp because it's small and portable and I can take it with me everywhere (but not to the gym). I really like it, it sounds great and my friends also like it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   This was my second iPod for the band. I love the fact that the case is made of leather instead of plastic. The sound quality is superb. I really enjoy the way you can control the volume on the iPod, just flick a switch on the top. I just bought the latest model, and this one is even better than the one I have. The batteries last a lot longer than mine, too.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I am very pleased with the build quality of the Korg MS-20, which is an excellent product. The MS-2 is probably not quite up to par for the money but, it's a good piano that will stand up to the rigors of professional use. I'm also pleased with how it responds when pushed hard.   Also, there's a big surprise in the box... a free USB converter! That's so cool, I have to plug the converter right in the case, and not into a computer!  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When I ordered my   i mpow i, i was very pleased with the promptness of   delivery.   The  i Mpow   is a great compact system that   takes all the trouble out of  wiring up a switch.  It is a lot easier to work with than many  switches that  include extra connectors and extra wires.  I love   the fact that the button for the   "On" and "Off" can be replaced by the  switch. I can just plug in the switch and push in the button.  This is very convenient.  The switch is easy to push in so the battery compartment does not have to be in the middle.  You can add a battery in the future if you want.  With all the extras in the  i- Mpows , I am impressed.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The new version is a lot better than the original, which I loved when I got it years ago. I have a friend who has a different model, but he's been told by a few folks that his is inferior and it doesn't come with the USB port. I've always liked the simplicity of this product.    Works with iOS 8 and 9 (with Apple's own apps):   It works with both iOS 8 or 9 as long as you are using the iOS version. I was getting the most error messages when I tried to use iOS 8 so I opted to use the "iOS 9" version. However the problem is I had to use my iphone 4s which is older then iOS 8. So I had some difficulty downloading iOS 8 on iphones. Also I was told by several folks that if you install iOS 8 from the app store it won't work at all. This isn't true because I got the iphonew version that does work.    Use it with a keyboard and mouse:  I have been using this for a month now and my wife says it doesn the job great!  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I purchased an iphone 6 and got it from Walmart for a good price, I was impressed with its speed, the battery is good for the price, the design looks great, the only con I can think of is its small size but I don't use my phone in a purse, it is more useful in my hand or in my pocket, the fact it is a digital iphones also makes it easier to carry it around.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    In a couple of years, my wife and I have taken several vacations together, including one to New Zealand for a few months.   We have enjoyed the ability to use our laptops at a distance and also to transfer large files to our workstation or desktop.  Although,   my wife's laptop is more expensive than my workstation (which costs about $300 vs. $300)   but the difference in price between our two systems is minimal.  The ability to transfer files to my work station or desktop and to use my laptops on the road makes a big difference in the quality of the work I can do.  So far,  the work station has been our choice.  We are looking to purchase another one as soon as possible for our trip to New York next spring.   Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this unit about 4 weeks ago and I'm very pleased. I live in New Jersey and need to be able to use a telephone on the road without a long line to answer. The device comes with a large cell phone antenna (the antenna itself is not an issue; the problem is finding the correct size and shape) and it is a bit bulky compared to an earpiece, but it works fine. I'm able to talk on the phone while I'm using the vehicle (at about 20 mph) and I am able to speak very clearly and comfortably, regardless of what the frequency is. I just have to remember to put a bit more volume into my phone speaker.   The only real drawback to the unit is that it requires a special car charger, and I don't see this ever really getting used.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a great little player   It is compact and can play well at my house. I love the ability to turn it on and off quickly by holding the switch down, and it has a lot of different sound settings which I'm sure will be a big help to musicians and engineers who have multiple sound sources on their setup.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was just thinking about this issue when I decided to buy the e-cigarette because I really like the idea of a smoke-free product (I smoked a pack a day from my grandfathers). I am a heavy smoker and I use an electronic cigarette to smoke. I love that I can vape this while I am smoking, because it is so easy to use and I don't have to worry about the taste of cigarette smoke when I am using an electronic. It does get very very hot and you do feel like you are blowing on your mouth while you vape. It takes some time to get used to the flavor but I have found that the flavor of the e cigarette is very good. I really do love this product and I wish that the e cigarettes would come in a bigger pack!  4 stars!   Very good product   This e cigarette can't really do a whole lot to make me quit. I have been smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for about a month. I had tried every e cigarette and nothing has really worked. This product definitely helped me to quit smoking but there's more to be done! It doesn't seem to give you a real kick. If I would have known about this product, I would of never started smoking tobacco. I just started using this product in order to try out the different brands. It's so good, I have ordered another! I have a habit of smoking my cigarettes while I'm sitting in my car, which is why I purchased this product. I actually got a headache from using the device but the only thing I noticed is that it smells very much like cigarettes. It is a good product but the way the device works is a little bit tricky so you will need to do some research to get the device right for you. I will definitely be purchasing another one soon!  I really appreciate that the VapeWild has created a great product that is very inexpensive! I have tried other brands of e cig and they're just not as good as the one I purchased. I would give it 10 stars but I wish they would have made it a little bigger. Thank you vape wild!
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:        This is the best electronic I have tried so far and it is the easiest to use. The volume buttons are very comfortable and do what they are supposed to do. The battery lasts a long time, which is great. The one problem I have is the buttons.   When pressing them on the first run, they don't click. But if you are careful, you can get to the "back" button, but it's a little difficult.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have owned these for about 3 months now and they work great. I have not had any problem with these being charged or the unit getting warm. I am not a professional on this but from what I have read about the units, these are the perfect size for me. The sound is loud enough to hear. I highly recommend them.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Biscuit from Good unit. I was very skeptical about purchasing this set. I had used a lot of portable radios and these sound and work very well. The bass is loud and clear and the treble is just right. I've been using this with my digital TV and the sound is just the way I like it. I also purchased a 4 channel digital audio system that also uses these as a set. The set itself has lasted longer than I expected. I'm not sure if the batteries are replaceable, but if they ever go bad I will probably just get another set from this company.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The A9x can drive any modern audio source and is a joy to play.   I used it with my Denon AVR2 (which can't do DSD) and it sounds fantastic.  I can't say much more about the sound quality.   I'm extremely happy with it...   Pleased with it so far.  It's the second I've bought.  Very easy to set up, very fast, and plays just about anything.  Highly recommend.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The only issue i had with the phone is that the call display is a bit laggy when the phone vibrates but it's not that bad. Other than that i love my phone and wish there were more color options so i wouldn't have to choose one, i also like that there is a removable battery.   I also love that i don't have one of those "smart" phone, I would rather take my old phone and use my computer all the time since it's better in many ways, except for the fact that there's no bluetooth.  I've had this phone for 4 months now and the sound quality is great. If you can handle a little bit of lag in the audio, its better then the competition. I have a lot of battery and use it at least 2 hours a day mostly. One thing I wish there was is a micro SD card slot so i could record videos. If I were on a budget, I'd consider buying the iPhone. For the money, I don't think I'd have a better phone than the iPhone 6s/SE/6/5.  I love it  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The iPod is the best all round music player available for the price.  The   sound quality   of the iPod and the fact that it is just as   good   as  in the past for a fraction of the cost   I think   is why they were such a hit.    When the iPod first came out   people   thought   it was going to be the death of   music for all but the most devoted   users but in a couple of years it was a must have.  It's a great product for everyone.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I had a question about a couple of items on here but did not want to risk my money so decided to check out the reviews on here, i was a bit worried about the price but that did not matter and it seems to have a great build quality for the money.  It is very good for the price, but a couple things could have been done better: 1. I wish the usb connector was a little longer, so it would fit in the bottom of my computer case instead of the top. 2. I noticed some of the capacitors were a little loose. 3. I can't seem to get the screen to charge (i'm on Windows 8.1). But I know that I will eventually figure it out and love my new one. .

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The battery lasted a few hours on 2 hour runs with no problems. I have also heard the T2-Amp for the mic works quite well on the same battery. However, I have noticed that the mic is not very sensitive, even with a very loud (but not "pounding") sound source. I still have to use an external mic or headset with my computer. I am still a fan of this mic but for my money, the T1-AAC is better.   Another nice item is the hard case, although it has a few small scratches on the inside of the bag. I recommend getting the "slim" version of the case with velcro tabs to keep the case in place when carrying it around. I love the T9, but I'd rather not have to carry around two mics when I want to record vocals.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this unit with the express purpose of replacing a defective computer monitor that had just about worn out. I couldn't believe what I was seeing when I saw the colors in the screen! The colors were so realistic and so smooth that it was difficult to believe that I was watching a TV monitor, not a video game! I bought the computer monitor only because I am an artist, and the colors seemed like a far cry from the colors of most video games. And that's a good thing. The monitor looks great, and it really is very comfortable to hold and operate, especially with the extra weight that comes with the unit. I also got a nice bonus with the addition of a DVD player. I am a video gamer, but this video player is far superior to anything I have ever seen. With the DVD player you don't have to take the whole unit out and set it up to run any video on your video disk - just connect the DVD to the computer and use the USB cable to the TV.     Would you recommend this to a friend? Yes  Excellent Monitor Yes  a few niggles Yes  I would say that this monitor is outstanding. The colors are vibrant and the picture quality is clear and very good. The sound quality is also very good and I can watch movies on the TV with the sound off and the monitor on. The only niggle I have is that it can get hot, even when playing games at low settings. It's hard to tell which setting is the hottest though. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This device is a real bargain. I was very skeptical about the new product, as the price would surely make it a bad purchase, but I'm happy that the price is now much closer to cost. I love my new iGadget!!!   I was skeptical about this purchase as my previous Apple product was a Macbook Air. When I got my iGads I was impressed and am glad to say the iGade was also a bargain. There were some things about it that are not good but those were not the main problem. I have a few different USB devices with me but this one is a main device for me and is perfect for my work.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was extremely pleased with the new Eos. My main issue with the Eos (other than the battery) is the "feature." I have an iPod (3rd gen), and since upgrading to the 4th gen the music quality has been so good that I rarely bother with the "features." But when I had the 4G I got so angry with the lack of a headphone jack, and a "standby" option. I tried to order one but was told that it was not available for some reason. But the EOS did not have a headphone port, and I wanted that on my iPhone. My only gripe with the phone was the fact that the battery is a little small. But that's just a minor gripe.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    - The screen of the HP Pavilion zd12h is excellent. The resolution, color quality and viewing angles are superb.   When you are doing a small document like a memo or report, the high resolution screen is a godsend.  I purchased this HP tablet for a few different uses:  - For office productivity - To use for school, for a homework tutor - As a small tablet for entertainment/media purposes - And finally, for web browsing on the go.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Sony Walkman is a great little device. The only downside is that it doesn't work if you are a fan of rock n roll or other obscure genres.  Customer service:   I purchased this product with the intent of using it as a portable portable music player. I'm just a lowly college student so I wasn't sure what to expect from it. However, this thing is amazing. It comes with a full line of songs. The player runs on two AA batteries. The unit is very light so it can easily be carried in a backpack. And it works pretty good. It has a nice full range of tones and is a good size. I got the blue version. It is hard to find a good bluetooth device in this size. It also has two levels of volume. It's nice not having to hold the player up to your ears. I am glad that I was able to find this item on eBay. I have been able to use my bluetooth player to stream music on my tablet computer without any issues. I've gotten a little used to the buttons on the player but I think the buttons will be the main problem for me.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Great! This is my first Bluetooth keyboard, so I don't have any experience. But I've had a few of these wireless keyboards (Ducky, Cooler Master), so I can say they are quite a bit better than the old ones (which are still in use). The software is easy to use, and there is no problem finding the buttons to hit. I'm glad I picked up this one instead of another brand (not because of the extra cost), and I'll definitely buy another one.Read full review

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I love this thing. It makes my computer work like a dream. I use a laptop and now I'm using the Chromebook just fine. The battery life is great and it is so quiet I hardly notice it going on or off. It also gives my MacBook Air something to do without me having to open a new PC. If you're just starting out in the Chromebook space, this is a great device that will get you started without breaking your bank.  I love it!! I had read that the build quality was great, but that I might not be able to upgrade it in the future. But the new Chrome OS version doesn't work with the older keyboard and the screen doesn't display any text, and only displays numbers. That is a deal breaker for me. I am an engineer and am looking for a solution, not a "fix". The keyboard is pretty great, the screen is not. It is not even close to what my MacBook Pro has, and I am considering buying a new Chromebook. So my question is, if you can't fix this, what can you do about it, and how much will it cost to fix it?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I bought this amp back in mid-2009. I had it installed in my car. I didn't even use it for the first 3 months. My car is a 2003 and I purchased this amp from a guy who sells amps (one with a big "J") about 8 months ago. The amp was installed in his car, which he had repaired himself. I did the install myself with the help of my girlfriend and we installed it into my car (I had never used a power amplifier in my life before). At the time I bought the amp the car had a full blown power window motor on the top of the engine and had to be fixed. It also had some pretty big problems with the heater vents. I really liked the sound of the amp when I was using it. I also noticed that I was able to get the best of both worlds. I could have the amp installed into a car that is much more advanced than my 2003. I never really played with it much but I really did like it. It only had a little over an hour of run time with a little use but I never went over 4 hours. I purchased another amp and am looking for another one.

The only problem is that it won't charge her iPhone 6 plus in my house, but that could be from my house wiring or the pad. But the pad is very lightweight, and works very well.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I've been using my HP 15 inch laptop on the computer classroom. The color screen and keyboard are fantastic. My son uses the same laptop to teach math and he loves it. The only drawback is the fact that you have to plug the battery in. It's not a big deal, but it is something.   My wife loves her iBook too.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The iPod shuffle is a wonderful toy.  It can play songs of your choice and the fact that it has a large screen means that you can watch movies in one hand, too.   It has a very nice range of sounds, is not loud or loud/loud, and has a good battery life.  I'd recommend this to my friends and their kids, too, as the iPod shuffle can be a very good toy for a lot of ages.

The phone has a lot of battery capacity, is very compact and it is an absolute pleasure to use. I was surprised that the phone would even be waterproof at all. Overall, I think that this phone was a really good purchase. I can't wait to see what else Google has to offer.  Did you find this review helpful?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have two Macbook pro and i'm having a hard time connecting them up to my tv, so I took this one out of the box. This thing was easy to set up, and I was able to use my tv with it.   It doesn't take a long time for the ipod to recognize the ipad and play music, and it takes less time to download all the songs.  It has a very low power consumption so you can use it in a really small room.  I really like the sound that my ipod is getting.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    My device is very efficient and it has some very great features, such as a USB port that allows you to connect a second USB device, and the fact that it's completely quiet. But most of all I'm extremely impressed by the quality of the device. I have used two other USB devices (Sony VAIO PX300 and Dell USB 2.0) and the D-Link DSA-6553 is by far the best.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   It is a real pity that Samsung discontinued the original model and the Note 4 is the only way to experience the S Pen without going to a Galaxy Note. It's still a very good pen but the new S Pen has made the Note much more powerful. The Note 4 has an improved screen, better speakers, a faster processor, the latest Android 7.0 Nougat and a more capable S Pen than the original.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I recently purchased a Sony Playstation 3 console.   When I opened the box I was pleased to see that it came with a case that covered the entire console. I've already installed several games on it and I'm extremely pleased with the console. It is very responsive when you are moving around the game library.  This will be my only console purchase for a while now.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    For me the battery life is very good but not very long.   I would buy it again but with a larger battery, because of the small capacity of the battery I needed to recharge several times per day. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This device is easy to use and very accurate.   I love the little display and the built in speaker and the size is perfect!   The only issue is the size of the power cord but I have yet to be able to find one that will not come in a standard length (which is needed with this device).   Overall, a great product for a great price!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this to use as my computer's sound system. The sound is clean, clear, and clear. The only downside is that the headphone jack is really hard to use. A little more leverage on the jack will make it easier to use, but I still struggle sometimes.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Mike from Great Sound Quality for a great price! I bought this to go with my new desktop computer (Hewlett Packard Envy 8600) to replace an old monitor. With a 4k/60hz monitor and a good sound card, this setup is great! However, the only downside to the sound is that even though the laptop is the only speaker connected to the card, the laptop does not have stereo headphones. This may be a problem for some, but it is not an issue for me. If your computer has stereo headphone outputs, you won't be missing much in the sound department. For those of you who have a 3.5mm audio output, the sound quality is a bit worse with this card but is still great. I bought two of these, the first one being the original version, which I have to say was a great deal. The second was the cheaper version with a lower power adapter. I've only had this for a week but I'm very happy with it. I'm definitely keeping one of these around.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a Motorola D-Phone with a Motorola S-Phone interface. My S-phone is a great phone with good features. This phone has great features as well, but it has one thing that is a problem: the phone does not have any way to be turned on by itself. You must plug it in before you can use it. When I bought this phone, I thought it was a great deal, because the phone works well. But it has a terrible interface. The D-phone has a battery life of about 4 or 5 days. The S-line has a better interface and more features.

The buttons are great, the sticks are excellent, and the controller is well designed.   Great controller for the money: 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The iStick battery is pretty good.   It is durable, it charges fast and it lasts a long time.  The battery comes with a very large usb connector which I really like.  It makes it so that I don't have to mess around with usb cabling.  I would like a little more protection for the charging cord.  They also put some kind of plastic on the tip when they charge but I am not sure if it is a protection.  Overall, a great unit.   Rated 3 out of 5 by LizzyL from OK So this is a good starter. I love how it looks and works. I did use a battery clip but it is not really that secure, which is what I was looking for. The only bad thing is that it doesn't charge quite as fast as my previous battery charger, which was one of the best, but you get what you pay for. I got this because I wanted a simple way to recharge my phone.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Dman from It's very sturdy, very lightweight, and good quality - and very easy to use. The only thing I wish it had is an app to control things. This was my first ipod, I've never owned a good music player, and this thing is a pleasure to use, I can do almost everything on it and still have room for my ipod and my phone. I have used the remote for the iPod and the mic for my phone, but I wish I had an app for controlling it as well.  (review of free book)  Was this review helpful to you?

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Sony BDP-105 is an excellent audio/video recorder for its price. The quality of the image on the image display is excellent. The only issue I have with it is the fact that it doesn't record for the full 4 hours per hour, even when you're on the go. This means that the only way you'll record on the phone is if you're taking pictures at 3 AM on a public beach. This will only work on the Sony's internal battery.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have used this device for a year now. I use it for audio purposes only (speakers on my stereo). If I had a portable sound system in my van, I would use this device. A couple of months ago I installed a new Yamaha speakers in my car and I wanted to use a portable audio device (a DAP) for listening to music. My old device had a great sound but I was concerned that the noise would be too much for me to tolerate. I went to the audio store, asked for a portable DAP (drummer's amp) and they were extremely helpful. I have yet to find a better portable DIP device. I think I may return my old one and take this one with me. This one has saved my music listening.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Worth every penny! This is my go-to, always have, for my mobile or office needs. It is the only DAP I have found with excellent performance and a high enough resolution for the job. A must-have for the audiophile. The only con: it's bulky, so it's not really the portable DAPI that I need. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Rated 4 out of 5 by Cmiller from A good product, not as good as I wanted. A good price, too. Very good price on an iPad, not a good one, for all other reasons. Had this for a few days now, had issues with audio on first day using it. The display had a green "hot spot" at the bottom of the screen after the first day, which is an area that is supposed to be protected from heat. I was told it would be corrected, but that is not the case at all. I've had problems with this a couple times before, so I was disappointed when the first week went by and my audio did not improve. This problem is not exclusive to me. If you need an iPad for reading, you might want to reconsider, but if you need a device to do the things that are common to you, like take notes and have presentations, this is a good choice.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is my second i7. The first one lasted about 2 years. This one has been working longer than that. I like it, although it may not be ideal for most people. I bought this one after I heard a couple of good reviews about this particular model. This i7 is quieter than my first model, I like the larger case, and it is much cheaper than mine. I also like the idea of a SSD instead of a hard drive. My previous hard drive was an OCZ Sandforce.    Helpful?   Yes.  Yes, for me. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     I bought this as a replacement for a very similar product. It was exactly as advertised, exactly like the description. No problems at all, and exactly as described. I use this primarily for watching movies as I do a lot of watching on DVD but it also works as a gaming console for my wife. Also it works just fine as a radio receiver for the radio in my car. It does require a little tweaking of some settings. It also gets pretty hot, so if you're someone that gets hot during the summer months this might not be for you. All in all, a great product for a great price. The only drawback is the price, but that can be solved by getting a better product at a cheaper price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I received the item in excellent condition. The case is a bit scratched up, but I was willing to pay a little extra for a brand new one. The phone fits nice and snug in the shell. My phone is only 3 years old, but this phone has lasted 3 years so far.   The front screen is a little dim, but it's not a deal breaker.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It's not the best looking computer out there and the quality of the build is good, but the battery life is terrible and the heat sink and fan are a bit too noisy, so that's why it's at 4 stars. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    For its price and features, I've always felt that a USB to SD card adapter would be a great addition to a laptop, but never had the money to buy one until now.   It works fine for my laptop's built-in SD card reader (a cheap option) and it provides very fast (in my opinion) and reliable transfers of almost all SD card files.  The only thing I would note is that when you use your laptop's USB port to charge the device, it can be a bit noisy (not that I care for noise).  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this product in December, and just got it. I use it as a portable music player, and I have to say I'm very satisfied. It's simple to use. I like the 3 inch speakers and the 2 headphone jacks. I had my doubts about the size of the speakers (I'm a medium to big guy), but they're surprisingly big for my taste. They're also surprisingly quiet, although I haven't put it against a wall to really hear. Overall, I'm satisfied with this device.

You can't really complain about the price but when you first put it on there is a very short amount of time to get it set up and then the battery is only good for about 8 hours.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    When i first heard about the new Dell 27" monitor it sounded very good to me. It is extremely thin and light and it looks great. The only thing is that it has a very high resolution display and this means that it will be quite a bit bigger than most people think. I can see myself having to use it in my office and it should work really well for me. The screen is bright and the color rendition is great. I use a Logitech G510 keyboard which is a little bigger than I expected. But all in all i am satisfied with my purchase and it has been good for me so far. - Daniel   Read review
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought the ZOOM on a whim because the original iBook, iMac, and Powerbook (I think they were all the same model) are all expensive. I read a lot of reviews and decided the ZOS (iBook owner's group) really knew what they were doing. The ZOS team (me, Dave Dobbins, and Paul B) helped me with my initial purchase (even though Dave D's computer was dead on arrival), and we were helpful the entire process. The system performed as it was supposed to.   The system's hard drive did take a little getting used to. I was able to get into the BIOS, and then just shut down the computer and reinstalled the OS.  I'm using the hard drive in my iBook to copy my current documents over to a new hard drive for my ZOOPER, and the process has been pretty straight forward.

I'm able to watch my videos on a big screen, while not looking like a wussy.  Not to mention the audio is also amazing. The only bad thing is that it's a little noisy. But other than that, great product!  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good but lacks features Bought this because the original ones didn't work with Windows 7. But to be fair, I've been using Macs and it seems to work. This also works with Linux but the video output is a bit of a disappointment. Audio is okay, but doesn't have surround sound. The speakers were a little too loud but the volume control is pretty good. Overall, very satisfied with the purchase and will definitely recommend to a friend who has an older Macbook.

It has a nice feature: if the power supply is lost, you can turn it on using the power switch.  I use my PS3 as a media center. The game I used to play was not as good as the previous generation, but the games I got for free on the PS3 worked great and the PS2 was not supported as a backup, so it was nice to find a portable media center with a PS3 emulation.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It is a very good headphone for those who can do with minimal bass - i use it all day and am happy. I have a good ear for music and sound, but the bass is a little too much for my liking. It is not a 'loud' headphone by any means, but still a nice experience to listen to in my bedroom. The noise cancelling is good too, but a little distracting when the song is not really loud, but not so much that it's uncomfortable for the listening position. I bought mine from amazon because the price is a lot lower than from any other company.   Sound:  I've always been a bit ambivalent about the sound of headphones, since I really like a lot of the styles in a lot too. I've mainly used closed headphones, but I do not regret that decision, especially since I can now afford to buy a more expensive set of open ones, like the Beyerdynamic T1s. I usually prefer closed headphones in comparison to open ones and that's why I decided to go with the Fostex T50RP, since they are open on one side, but have a passive bass on the other side. The T50 is a pretty good headphone, it's not a top class product, but it is very good, I'd say that it will satisfy most people. The headphones have an excellent build quality and very good sound quality. The bass is very nicely controlled and it never hurts the overall balance.  Is it good: The sound is excellent for the money. I am very satisfied with the headphone and would recommend it.  is the sound: The Sound quality is very clear and very punchy and punchy at the same time. The sound signature is very different from other headphones I've tried. I can't really say I enjoy the bass very much. It's a bit too much in my opinion, but also that's not necessarily a bad thing. The mids are great and the soundstage is very impressive.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:     This device is a very good product. The battery is very well designed and the unit is very portable. It would be much better if it were a bit larger in size but then again this is just a handheld unit. I recommend this unit to my friends and family.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I have a very long time interest in electronics and have owned a lot of different electronics in my time. I started my life around 10 or 11 years ago. I have been on the Internet quite a few times looking for a good computer, but have never found one. I was looking for something that I could use when I go back to college for my bachelor's degree. It arrived on time, and has been well worth the wait. This is a great little computer. The display is very crisp and responsive, and the sound of my CD player playing is wonderful. I just purchased my first computer and now I'll never need a second computer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    Great device for a great price.   I have a cheap plastic keyboard and the key to it does not go all the way through the keyboard to the key board. When I put my finger on the key that it does, it presses the key and does not let go. I had to take it apart and use the plastic key board as the key, and it works perfectly.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Rizzo from Works well! I bought the first one to replace my old keyboard. Works great!  Review of DJ's Choice - Best Keyboard I've Ever Owned I just purchased my 2nd pair of this device and it is by far the best keyboard I have used in my entire life. It's got every key you would need. You can play music by touch on a big touch screen while also holding a physical keyboard in your hands. The keys are so tactile and the layout of the keys are such that it feels almost like you are holding a real instrument. And when you use the software it lets you customize the sounds by changing the sound profile. It is very easy to use with great software that allows you to mix, record, edit, or just create great music.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Epson Stylus Photo has a really nice range of functions that can be customized to suit a particular project. For example, the lightest white balance for a sunset shot will be set to a very soft one, the most vibrant tones will be adjusted to an almost sombre colour balance, and the camera will be captured at a constant exposure. This is very convenient for creating a pleasing background to a photo that will probably end up in a high definition DVD cover or the like. I think this is a really versatile device and I highly recommend it to a variety of photographers.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought this a few months ago. I have never had an issue with it so I was excited about the possibility of being able to see the temperature without having to use a thermometer.   The unit is easy to set and operate.  It is very simple to use. I use mine for all my electronic readings.  The only issue I have is when I set it to my kitchen or bathroom to start my microwave or electric stove it seems to have a short circuit and short circuits are not good when you are cooking.  This unit would not function properly if I had to use the outside of it for those purposes.  Posted by

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    You have to understand that with all the changes Apple made in the iPhone and the iPad (like the larger screen, the new cameras, etc.) there were some very good things that remained.   A good and reliable Bluetooth mouse would be one of the best things about this device.  The only reason that I gave a negative rating is because I had to return it. I was excited when I heard that the mouse was waterproof, but then I realized that the device was way too light for my needs.  There is no scroll or zoom function, so all the options on the screen become useless. It's a very good device, and I will recommend it to my friends.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The best thing to happen to me since the age of two when I got my first keyboard.  I'm a pretty geeky person, and I really enjoy playing on my keyboard. The only thing is that the battery life is almost non-existent. I'd estimate it's a couple hours if I really put it to use. Still, if I'm going to have to type for longer than a half hour, I'll just buy a mouse.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    This is a great little speaker. It sounds great, is small, portable, and looks great. I bought a 4 pack of these because my old ones broke after being through 6 different speakers. They are so good. They have a nice punch and get good volume out of my small car. The only problem is they get very hot. The heat sinks aren't very large and I have to hold the speakers close to my ears to be sure they don't burn out, which is annoying because the speakers are so great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   I'm not a huge fan of all the buttons on my smartphone.   However, I do like the touch screen.  The device is very fast (though there are some issues with some apps, such as Google Maps).  The only problem is that when I'm using the phone, I have to be very quiet.  When I use headphones, however, I can hear all the sounds around me.  Also, it's only a 10-inch phone, so I expect it to be bigger. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The price is right (especially for the price range), the device does what it is supposed to do, and it's a small case that fits well in my bag.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I purchased this item two weeks ago as a way to avoid buying my own headphones because I felt I should have the ability to listen to music on the go and this is perfect for me because it doesn't take up too much space.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The iPhone 5's design is great. There's a small bezel around the screen that makes viewing apps, photos and other media in landscape mode a bit awkward. That being said, the 5's hardware is outstanding. I have a feeling that its going to continue to perform well over the next 2 years.   This is the first phone I have ever purchased that actually works well.  The price of the device is excellent, especially with the latest iPhone upgrades.  I have been using my iPhone 5 for the past week.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I love the fact that I can listen to music, listen to the radio or the internet on the computer. The sound is very clear and the bass is perfect.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Dave from I can't get enough of the sound of my Macbook Air. I love using my laptop to play music, watch movies and browse the internet. I use my old and slightly less expensive computer to play the same games and watch the same movies, and now I have two computers. My old computer can't handle a game like Civilization or a movie like Iron Man, and my new computer doesn't handle those movies or games. I tried upgrading my new machine with a faster hard drive and upgraded RAM, but they are just not good enough to play my old computer games. The new Macbook air is the best computer I have used. I have a second Macbook, but the sound is not the same quality as the Macbook. I highly recommend this product to anyone. -Dave

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have a Sony Vaio Tap 10, and for a long time, I was using it as my primary laptop for daily work. In about two months, it lost the ability to use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. The Bluetooth was only available via a proprietary Bluetooth cable, not via an adapter. After a month, I thought the laptop would be fine without Wi-FI or Bluetooth - but it wasn't! The computer would get incredibly slow when Wi-fi or Bluetooth was active, and I had to power-cycle the device. Finally, I got tired of the constant battery drain and decided to buy a second battery for the laptop. It's much faster, with no issues. It also has better battery life. If you're considering purchasing a Vaio, do not buy the Tap 8 (they have similar performance, but the Tap is the newer one). If you are still using an older model, you can't go wrong with the Tap 10. The Tap 8 doesn't have any software/user-friendly options, and it only has two USB ports instead of three. However, the Tap will be fine if you just want a laptop that can be used for daily use. The main reason I bought the Vaio in the first place was that I wanted a computer that could function as a home computer. But if the VaIO Tap 10 can't be used as a work computer, then what is the point? - October 8, 2010More power, less power consumption!  Reviewer: krink - favorite favorite favorite - August 23, 2010  Subject: Work laptop  I've had this for a couple of months and I'm very pleased with it. I was a bit worried about the keyboard's comfort but it's very good. The only thing I can complain about is that when I connect to my work network via ethernet, I get a lot of pop-up noise on the screen. I think this is an issue with the keyboard since there's not enough travel on the keys. Other than that, I love this machine. It really works as a computer to run MS Office and browse the web. The keyboard is nice and firm and the keys are easy to press, with a satisfying feedback when you push on them. I use this a lot at home and at work so the fact that it's a work laptop doesn't bother me. - August 20, 2010Work laptop

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:   The T6P is a great wireless transmitter for the DJI Mavic.   I haven't flown it yet, but the controller (which is not included) is so nice.  I can't believe the build quality and the small size.  The only thing I wish it did more of is the following:  First, the battery door is annoying.  Secondly, I wish the battery would charge in the battery compartment, because I'm constantly forgetting to remove it from the battery box.  Overall, I think the controller is awesome and I'm sure the Mavics will love the T6.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought a Samsung I9000 a few years ago and it was the only device I owned that could play 3D movies well.   However, the I9100 did the same but at a slightly higher price point.  This new version of the I90xx is an upgrade on the original.  For the price, the new model is pretty good.  It's a bit bigger than I had expected it to be, but the size is perfectly suited for a 2nd monitor/TV.  I will continue to use the I9300 for movies, but I'm considering getting a Samsung LCD TV to replace it.   I bought the I-9009 to replace an older Samsung I9505-C which I loved but felt slow in many games and had problems with screen flickering.  The I9009 is a bit of a mystery.  When I took it out of the box and tried it for the first time I was surprised it worked. I didn't have any problems in the first 10 minutes of gaming.  A bit more power on the I9008 could have been helpful but it's not a huge deal.  You also can't adjust the height of the screen which is a bummer.  Overall the I9508 performed as well as the I930x did. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm really happy with the build quality of the HPE ProLiant DL380 G5. I purchased this for a client and he really wanted a small workstation for a small business. I was able to find one in the HP ProLiants catalog. I really like the size. It fits well into a small office and it's easy to use. I like the large number of ports on this unit and the keyboard is really easy to program.   The only thing I would change is the ability to control the screen. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    It is fast, reliable, and powerful.   I like that it comes with a power cord so I can plug it into a 12v socket or power my guitar via a normal 3.5mm headphone jack.  The only issue I have is that the screen is small and the cursor goes all over the place, especially if you use a keyboard and mouse.  It doesn't take much to get it to work, but it's also easy to get confused.  Other than that I don't think it's that bad.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have been looking for a replacement for the iMate. iMates and the old MacBook's look alike in almost every aspect, but there is one area the old laptop has a clear advantage: battery life. The battery in the new MacBook Pro will run you for a week without being charged. The old iMATE lasted me 2 months. The problem with this is that the old iMacs had a very slow SSD, so the SSD would eventually wear out.   In the new iMac, I can still get 2-3 hours of screen time with only a 60-70% charge and a 100% full battery.  The only problem I have is that sometimes the computer would seem to have slow-motion in the video files, and the webcam had a high amount of light reflecting on it.  Overall, I am happy with the new model and can't wait to buy the new laptop.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I was a little skeptical about this product at first. I thought I was doing everything right, but my little girl has a terrible time making words. She makes sounds like she's chewing. The sound is like a "whoosh" from her mouth. My first purchase was to see if it would be better than my last one. I don't think it was, it's still just as bad. I would suggest waiting a little bit because of the price difference ( I paid $20 more for the "Pro" version) I wish it would turn itself on/off. I was also expecting the sound to be louder. It is a little louder. I will still use it as it was a great purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The best thing i have ever bought!!! My brother bought it for me so i could listen to the radio, the iPod Touch is amazing   I bought the iPod a few weeks ago and i cannot say enough about it. If your looking for an easy to use  iPod Touch then look no further because it has been a big help for me. The iPod Touch has made listening to music much more enjoyable. It has the ability to play all your music files at the same time so you wont have to worry about having to stop the music whenever you have another thought. The battery life is great. I have played for 8 hours at a time with a full charge and it has just enough power to get me through the next few hours. The touch is so simple to use that you can easily use it as a basic media player with a great feature. If you like the ease of use i would highly recommend this to anyone and you wont be disappointed.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The TOSLA is an excellent electronic device. The best thing about this is that it's extremely easy to install and use. It is a very versatile device. For the price it is a bargain.    Write a negative review about an average electronic device (for the cost):   As usual TSLA is the worst device I have ever owned! The customer service sucks, they do not seem to understand how computers work, and when they find out the problems they just send out a repair to get the job done. I have had to go back to my original repair shop because of this. I would not recommend the TSLAs to anyone, I just wish they had had the integrity to take responsibility instead of telling me I can get my money back.  Don't purchase this device until they implement better service from the distributor! This is a great product, it is easy to use, but you must keep checking to see if it is properly plugged in. The cable connector on the power cord gets wrapped around the cable and becomes a hot metal shard. Also there is a little bit of solder in the end of the power cable that comes to the plug. This could cause a short. When this happens it will turn on and on for a little and then go out. The unit also does not come with the plug or the cables. I also found that the cord is too short when the cord goes to the power connector.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The sound quality is outstanding and very high quality. The best in the industry. It comes with 4 cables, so I can add my own 4.4mm mono to stereo cable. I love the convenience of not having to deal with wires and having a dedicated amp/pre amp. The price is very reasonable and it has a very good feature set. The sound is loud and clear.    Awesome - and it lasts a long time!   I've been using the Sennheiser HD598S for a month or two now. It's very well built and has an excellent frequency response (great for gaming). I have it connected to my sound system for some time and there's really not much more I could want!   Pros:  Very well built  Great for gaming  No wires (which I prefer)  Slightly wider soundstage than the HD 600  Has 4 extra cables for adding my own cables  Excellent battery life (at 1.5-2.5 hours depending on settings) : 3/5: The sound really does come through well with this amp/line combo. I've got it connected on a decent stereo system with two 2.0's, and I'm quite impressed with how the sound seems to be coming from both speakers. Overall, it's just a really solid amp/amp combo. The bass is punchy and tight, but without being overwhelming. The highs are pretty natural and just a little more forward. It does seem to be a little less fatiguing on long playback sessions, but I've not had it go all night. The Senn HD598's are pretty amazing. I can't recommend it enough.
