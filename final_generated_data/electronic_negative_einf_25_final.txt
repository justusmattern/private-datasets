Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this because it was cheap and it was the only device that would fit into my laptop bag. Unfortunately, I found out after I got it that it didn't have enough power for a decent connection to my laptop. In addition, it was very noisy, but luckily my roommate has a very good sound system so I haven't bothered to change it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these to replace my old headphones, and while they sound great, the built in speakers are a bit disappointing.   It's more than disappointing, it's painful!  The speakers sound good if you're close to the speakers, but if you want to have a real bass boost, you have to get a decent subwoofer.  The bass response is too shallow, even with the subwoofers!   This is a big deal because I bought a new pair of Sennheiser headphones, but they sound so good with the original speakers.   Good audio, bad battery life   Battery life is fine, but don't expect to charge it overnight like the original one.  If you leave it on your nightstand at work, it might get you through the day!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been using this item for more than 3 years and it is working fine until it stops working because the battery needs to be replaced. I don't know if there is a problem with the battery but it would be nice if they had some way to tell me whether my computer is dead or not before sending me a replacement. It really bothers me when people buy stuff and then do not return it because they think it is broken or they think its defective.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It took a long time to arrive and it's very small.   The only good thing I can say is that it is easy to turn off and the fact that it has a power button and doesn't lose battery if you turn the device on and off without the power button being used seems to be more useful than anything else I've tried.  I like it  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am disappointed that I was so disappointed with this TV. I bought this to use as a video game console for my son, but the picture quality is sub par. I expected it to be brighter and sharper. The picture on the picture setting is pretty bad, and the audio is horrible. It is not easy to adjust settings. The remote control is also very bad. The sound quality is so bad that you really have to listen to the sound. It will sound like a broken speaker if you turn it down too low. This TV also doesn't have a tuner, but that is very convenient. I gave it 4 stars because of the price but this is NOT a good TV to buy for the price. The only good thing is the remote control.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had the chance to buy the iBook G4 for a little under $100 but was extremely disappointed in the final product.  The keyboard had issues (spikes in the keyboard were constantly hitting the top of the keyboard, leaving marks).  The trackpad also had issues with the glass being scratched.  Additionally, the iBooks are prone to having a small gap under the keyboard where the keycaps don't fit very well.  In addition, the trackpad is not that great in general.  I will not be purchasing another iBook as iBooks were never good enough to warrant the price of this computer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The problem with this is that I was trying to use it as a portable music player to carry in my car. It is not very portable, however. I love music and love my mp3 player. The portable thing I use for portable music is a portable CD player. It can take up a lot of room, and is heavy.   I don't want to take it with me in my small car to use as a music player.  It also comes with a mini usb adapter. Not very useful when you do not have a port in the car, but I guess it would have been fine if I wanted to use my phone for music or music in the hotel room.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality is very poor, but that's what you get with this product.  It doesn't support the phone with a speaker, meaning that the sound can't be heard at all, which is just awful.  The only way I could hear the phone through the speaker was by setting the volume to max.  This also leads to some of the worse battery drain on my phone.      
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've owned this device for 2 years now, and it's just a dud. It's got no sound or power, and I was told by several techs that it was going to last a long time. I've seen some of the worst consumer electronics and this is at the bottom of the barrel. I'm glad I got a better deal on another phone, but my wife would never let me take this off her hands.    Excellent sound and good battery life, good value.  As far as sound quality is concerned, I think the iPhone 6 is excellent for its price and I enjoy having my headphones around and in my pocket when I'm not doing anything. I have the wireless adapter and a portable Bluetooth speaker so I'm always happy. The battery life is excellent as well, as it lasts 2 years. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just received this new unit and I LOVE it.   It is very small but is very heavy and durable.  It has a built-in speaker that has good volume and volume adjustment.  I used to own a Walkman and had to get an external speaker to work with it. I bought the Koss Ipod because I knew the sound quality would be better.  The Koss is a great unit and it works fine but the iPod has better sound quality.  All in all it is a good product and I like it.

This   is just a plain old, cheap,   crappy MPC,  and   it is very poorly   labeled.    I have   tried   to get Sony to make   better   MPC's, but   they haven't.  I bought this because   I wanted to get rid of an   old,  Sony MPD, but my   friends told me that it is just   another Sony MP-10.  (I think they are wrong).   Overall,  I will not be using this  or   anything else by Sony in the future.

A horrible experience.

I love my   mouses so   that I could just use one instead of trying to find the other. However, this mouse did not work at all with my  iMac.   I tried plugging the cable in, but it still didn't work.  My   iBook also does not like to be plugged in to anything,   and I never have trouble with   my other   mouse.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It doesn't sound good   After using this product for a month, it is just a big disappointment, but for $99   I'm not sure it was worth it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The keyboard is bad.   After the first time I was using it I had to return it.

No wifi.  It's just a tablet. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had a bad experience with this product:  First, I like to try out new products before I decide to spend my money.  When I found out that the product was not compatible with my Macbook Air and that I needed a replacement, I was shocked because I purchased this because of the good reviews on Amazon.  Unfortunately, it took me about a month and a half to get a replacement because the original unit died during the replacement process.  I have read some positive reviews about this product, so I expected to have no problem with it.  The product itself is OK.  It has a very high quality but does not come with any extra accessories like ear buds or case.  This does not bother me, I just wish I got a case for it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought these speakers and expected them to sound good. After all, my friend has a couple of Yamaha speakers that she loves. Well, they sound terrible to my ears, and they make my Yamaha sound great. Not only is there a high volume to the sound (I have the subwoofer plugged in for my main speakers), but they also have too much output. When I plug my subwoofers in, I have to turn them way down and it makes the main speakers sound very muddy. These speakers also give a very tinny sound. I'm not sure if I got a bad unit, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to replace them with something else.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After my old computer I bought this as a replacement. I was so excited when the box arrived that I just took it out of the box and plugged it in. The first thing I saw was that the screen was cracked. I had a computer technician replace it. It took him several minutes to figure out the issue and to tell me that he needed to replace the monitor with an external one. I wasn't happy about the quality of the monitor. I am a graphic designer so this was a huge disappointment. It is so small I cant even see the keys on the keyboard. I tried all the different models and this is the worst. Not sure if I can ever use a computer again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to watch videos. I didn't get much use out of it. It would always get stuck on playback, which would just freeze the video. Also, the remote is just so flimsy. It's not hard to knock off, but it's really hard to screw back on. The remote also has a very short battery life, which means I'll need to plug it in regularly.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a set of the Logitech Harmony Hubs for my PC and Xbox. Unfortunately, the only thing they were good for was controlling my TV. I used to own an Apple TV and an Android tablet, both of which I use for gaming. However, I'm happy to report that the Hubs were actually more comfortable to use than my old, crappy devices. The volume buttons are easy to hit and the remote has a nice feel.   This is my first time using this remote. It is quite responsive and works well with my Logitech G25. I've never had this problem before with the G25 or any other remote.

The sound quality is very good and I don't have to worry about distortion while playing in the bedroom.  If the volume on this one is too loud I switch to my old one and it works well with no issues.  I also like the fact that this unit can be mounted on the wall and not on the floor.  My only problem with the N-Trig is the fact it doesn't seem to play a lot of high end music.  Maybe it's because my old unit was much louder.

For $50 I would have preferred one pair of my favorite shoe, that is both made in the U.S.A. and comes with good leather, to one pair that is not, that's about $40 for a pair of sneakers and the shoes are the only thing that I am very disappointed in.

The first thing I tried was to go to the internet and look for a way to repair it.  The instructions were clear, and I got my computer working in a couple of hours.  However, since then I am struggling with using my computer at work.  I can't use my laptop to type emails or do any other work at work, and it's very difficult to open email on it. I have spent days trying to set it up only to find the documentation in the box to be wrong or incomplete.  This is not a good product for the cost.

I'm a bit skeptical, since I'm not exactly the most tech savvy person, but it seems a little too "fancy" to be a "phone". The phone feels solid, but there is no buttons on the front. I wish there was a place to tell you what it does, since you have to go to a website to learn it.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this a year or so ago and it finally died, a year and a half later. I got this thing and tried it out and I am not impressed at all. It has many flaws, one being that it never goes to sleep or turns off after you turn it off.  I have a Dell desktop, but I have never had problems like this with my Dell, ever.  There are other things, like having a huge fan to cool off the monitor (even though it's fairly quiet and only spins up to 55%), and having a small LCD that is difficult to use.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I love my phone, but I've tried almost every phone, computer, and tablet out there. This   is one of the worst   out of the   lot.   It doesn't   support 4G LTE,   has terrible battery life,  doesn't support the latest   Android,  has poor   camera,  isn't very   stylish, and isn't  breathtaking in design.  I wish they'd just use an   older   phone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After the 1st 2 weeks of using my HP, i found a "black bar" in the upper right of the screen with a tiny "dongle" sticking out of the right bottom of the device.   When you touch this, the screen goes completely black.  It turns off after a few minutes of the button being pushed and then the screen comes back on.  This device does not have a backlight or an eraser.  As a result, this item is not worth the $50 price.  I would prefer a cheaper laptop (Macbook Air) for my office work, but for the price, I would rather have a regular laptop (Lenovo Ideapad).

I have an older stereo that had some good speakers and I was able to get some decent sound. I put the speakers on speaker stands and the only good sound I get is from the television. My computer is a MacBook Pro which I had for many years. I wanted to get a laptop but I can't find one with a headphone jack. I really needed to get another one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have a Sony NEX-3, and I really want to like it but it just doesn't feel right.  The Sony has always been comfortable, but it feels like it is too tight in my hand and I have to work really hard to hold it steady.  For some reason, the camera feels like a heavy, clumsy piece of machinery.  Sony, please bring the camera down to a comfortable level of comfort so that the NEX's will be a lot of fun to shoot.  I've tried to find some good uses for the N3, but I'm really going to have to give up shooting it for some reason.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this for my brother for Christmas, and he has been playing it and singing songs on it every night since he got it. I know that he is a "big-time" music guy, and I don't see how any electronic device can compare to the quality and sound of his old AM/FM radio. My brother also uses the "Lite" version, and it works well with his phone line but not so well with the HDTV. But at the very least it does a pretty good job of receiving the signals.

However, since we are now in the middle of a long vacation (two weeks), it only works for about 6 days.  I've had to switch back and forth with the older tablet because of the battery life.

I was going to get a better one because I liked the design of the original one. However, there was one issue with the remote control that would constantly go off.   After the remote would go off, I would have to reboot my computer.  It took over 5 hours just to get the issue fixed. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this product on a hunch that the name on the packaging had something to do with this particular product, and I was right. It was just as advertised, and has a very bright display and is very thin. It has a button that allows you to program the light to be on in various modes, which is great for me because I'm always trying to find a dimmer switch or an ambient mode. However, the "blue" LED in the center that you use to set the mode can be difficult to see, especially in bright ambient light (especially when the ambient is around 60ish). This product is good if you need to set a display to a certain color.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The problem is with the keyboard, not with the product.  My  computer was a Dell XPS. I purchased this  laptop from Amazon as I am a Dell fan and I have been impressed with their product support.  I was excited to get this product because I am used to the Dell keyboard and mouse.  This laptop however  is not a Dell. The first thing  I noticed when I opened the box was the plastic used to  build the case.  The laptop looks like it was assembled and not manufactured by someone who  had a lot of patience and time.   My first impression was that it would be easy to get the laptop working with a proper mouse. The second thing  is that the keyboard has a high click sound like most Dell products.  After two hours of trying to figure out how to use the keyboard with a mouse, the keyboard had to be replaced because  the key had broken. I am disappointed in the quality  of the keyboard and the software that came with the computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After a month with the TV in my room, the picture is terrible. The picture looks great on my HDTV and the sound is better than my old receiver.   The problem is that I can't get an HD signal with the tv plugged into the tv, it's just an average picture.  My old receiver works great. I'll update if I find out any more details about this device, but for now, it'll just have to sit.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The problem is that the sound is good on some, but not others. I've used the iHarmon with my wife for about a month.   Unfortunately, she can only hear the bass (when the bass is actually there) on one of the two sets of speakers.  I think that's a dealbreaker.  It sounds fine with my other speakers, and I know the iMate2 works fine with mine.  The iHampon is a good price, and with the adapter, you can use a lot of different brands of speakers (including my Yamaha XJR-10) with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I bought this I was excited about the low price and the ability to use any audio/video sources (CDs etc.) without the need to plug into the TV. I wanted a DVD player that would allow me to watch movies that I've bought on DVD on my computer, but not have to buy two separate ones. The player has some problems: 1) it can only be connected to my TV through the HDMI port. 2) It only plays DVD and only the first 2 discs I inserted. 3) My DVD player is only capable of playing only a single video source (a single DVD) at once. I had bought a USB DVD player in the past that works with both VCD and DVD players, but I don't have the $40 needed to buy the VCD player. So, now I have to either use the DVD player and pay $9.99 per movie or I have two devices with separate disc playback abilities. I'm sure I'll buy another one, but if I buy a new TV or another DVD player I'll only be using one device.  Read full review

It gets too hot and the only way to get it to go back to sleep is to use the hard drive.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been using an older Toshiba laptop for over 3 years now and I've only had a few problems with it, the main one being that the backlight is so bright that if you're not careful it can burn your eyes. I have two problems with the screen. The first one is that the monitor is not adjustable, so you can't make it more bright or dim. So now when I want to work at night or on my tablet/laptop in the evening, I have to stay away from the screen until the monitor goes back to normal. It was also very annoying to constantly switch between my computer and the monitor because the laptop has a trackpad and the screen is still the same width as it was before. I don't see myself buying another Toshiba as I've got a lot better screens now and it's nice to be able to adjust the brightness.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is an absolutely worthless device.   If your TV is on the small side, this is an absolute pain in the ass.  We use it on a tv that has an HDMI port (with an input for the cable/s).  If the tv is off, it works, but it makes the remote (with remote control cord plugged into it) very inconvenient.  There are lots of reviews on this site that have no issues with the device. The remote isn't terrible, but this is a no-brainer for me.  I really appreciate the remote control that comes with it and think that it would be nice if the remote came with a headphone jack.  The one problem I have with this product is that we have to watch a lot of TV shows that are on VHS, so we only have a couple of seasons.  This may not be a problem for everyone, but for us, it really isn't.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been a long time audiophile. I had this one from 2004 and it died about 8 months later. I purchased the new one from Best Buy in 2014 because I was looking for a new one. The new one is pretty bad and has sound issues like distortion, harshness, and lack of bass. The bass is only okay. The volume is horrible and the speaker sounds like someone threw a rock through it. The quality is terrible too. If I could change anything about this, I would probably put a hard drive in it. Maybe you can get a used one and that will be the final nail in the coffin for it. I bought this for my son as he loves to listen to music on his iPod and this won't do it for him. This is a toy for kids.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There are two problems with this product. First, the plastic housing is quite brittle, and when dropping the unit on a hard surface, the unit almost falls over. Second, the remote control has a poor sensitivity. If you have a remote control that is very sensitive to the slightest pressure, this remote control should not be used. The unit came with a remote with a 1/2" input jack, but it was not well built, and was not very reliable. In addition, I would suggest a different remote control, or maybe a different unit altogether, like an Xbox 360 remote control. Overall, this is just a bad piece of junk.

The lack of music player is a huge deal for me, as I've spent thousands of dollars on other iPod models.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The battery in my old computer died a few months ago. It wasn't a problem with the computer itself, but it was with my previous device.   If you have any older devices, it's a good idea to get a new one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The speakers are terrible, the mic picks up your voice perfectly, but you can't get a good sound with it, as the music cuts out when you do something weird.   I use an iPhone with the iPhone dock, but this dock and mic sound really crappy when you use it with this.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had this for a little over a year now and have been very happy with it.   It is loud, hard to control, and it is not very easy to reset the memory.  The USB ports on the other hand are very nice. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've had this item for about 3 weeks now, I love my ipod 3 and now the new ipod 4, however the new design is horrible.   The   speakers   are too small.  The volume controls are not functional.  There is no way to switch the ipod into  portable mode,   so you have to connect it to  a computer.  These   design changes are really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit works well in that it lets you select a favorite song on a specific device but has poor sound quality.  I don't mind the sound quality as the unit does what it is supposed to.  The problem is the lack of support on the website that it has when trying to find out why the unit is not working on my device. The unit is great for a cheap sound system for home use but I would not recommend it for a sound system in a hotel or concert venue where you may not have much power and/or where the sound can be very poor.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As the name suggests, this device does not deliver what it promises.   After purchasing a cheap $20 unit from amazon.com, I went through several attempts to get it working correctly.  It would randomly not switch on, then just randomly turn on and off, no matter what the button set.  Then it would just shut off, and the next day the power indicator would turn on, but the device wouldn't turn back on.  I finally managed to turn the power switch on and it worked fine for a day or so, but finally gave up and returned it to amazon for a refund.  Very disheartening!
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This TV is crap. The sound is terrible. The set itself is cheaply constructed. The remote does nothing except go blank everytime you try to use it. This TV only supports 2 tuners which is horrible considering most have 3. The HD picture is very weak. The picture was so poor I had to turn the TV off to turn it back on.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The first thing I noticed about this product is that the touch screen was not working. I thought it would be okay because I bought the touch cover, but it is a total failure. I was able to type my message but not send it. I ended up having to buy an additional $25.00 to get this to work. I bought a used iBook so I thought this might work.   My sister in law and I tried to use it but were unsuccessful. The screen was so bad that it would not recognize anything. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you are willing to go to a store and pay $100 dollars more than this to fix it yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to replace my worn out old iPhone. I was very happy with the design. It's a very good looking, nice looking. The problem is that the buttons are on the right side of the phone, not the left. I don't know what is going on but this makes it hard to get to the right buttons. The battery is terrible, with no way to drain it, and it only lasts for about 8 hours. This is a waste of money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased the XB280H and was excited to get my hands on one of the first full HD 1080p monitors. Unfortunately, the monitor did not perform as expected for the money. The monitor was dead at the first boot. I purchased two additional monitors to make sure it didn't go bad. The second monitor died as well. The XB270H worked but would have been better with a second unit with HDMI to make it a 4k monitor. Also, the XA310H doesn't have as many ports compared to the XH270H.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The design and overall feel of the unit  is a step up from my last computer,  and is very easy to install and configure.  However,  the unit lacks power  to the hard drive  so you can't do an external hard drive,  only USB.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a    Eero WiFi Router (which, like most, costs more than it's worth) when I was looking for a good router to add to my home network.   It's the most powerful wifi device I have seen in a long time, with an amazing range that works flawlessly even at home in the dead of winter.  It also comes with the most incredible built in firewall I have ever seen.  I'm only halfway through the box, and I have no issues so far.  While the router is excellent, the fact it doesn't come with the app makes it almost unusable for most people who just want to use it for home networking.  If I had the money I'd buy one immediately, but at the price point this is about as good as it gets, and if you're just looking for Wi-Fi, you'd be fine with just about anything    Rated 5 out of 5 by kathleen from Best wireless router, period. I bought this router as soon as it became available, and it's the best wifi router I've used. It's fast, has an excellent range, is easy to set up, and has great features (for its price range). It's very easy to install, and the wifi connection doesn't seem to have a lag when the computer and my android device are in range. All the pros. The cons, well...it's only on the market for a week, so it could have some bugs. Also, I have a mac laptop, and as a result, I can't have the router be in my network as well. Otherwise, this is my #1 recommendation.  Review of DJ0268-0023-03 Security Considerations You'll notice that the product description says the device has "invisible WAN links". This is the primary advantage of the device. In fact, when the router connects to your network via ethernet, it doesn;t show up as a router. So, if you have a network that you're using the router to connect to, the router will act as a server and it will act like a router and you won;t notice it;s there. It does, however, have two weaknesses. It has no firewall. No encryption is on the router. That means, if the device were to be compromised, you could be sniffing and decrypting all your traffic. The second weakness is that there's
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had been looking for a good MP3 player for a long time, but none of them met my criteria. Then I saw this one.  It came with a small case, and was very small.  Unfortunately, it's a really bad player with low quality sound. It's not so bad that I won't buy another, but the sound is not good at all, I'd rather have a better player.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Overall, I really liked this speaker. But I've gotten the same thing from other speakers, and the best part is that it cost less. If the sound quality is this good for a cheap price, I think it's worth it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There was a lot of buzz going around about the sound of this system when I purchased it. As many of the people who complained that it was "not a home stereo" had said, the sound was "mushy" and I could never get the sound "right." When I purchased this system I had heard great things about it from my friend who has one, but I wanted something "real". This is my third time buying this system. This time I ordered it through Amazon Prime because I wanted it the day it arrived.   The system arrived on a Sunday afternoon and I tried it the next day and was very impressed with the sound and was going to order another system after I had finished playing the previous one.  The only problem I have is that I ordered the CD player as a stand alone item and I don't even want to play my music through it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the HP Pavilion dv5. It came in a very nice box.  The case was good, although the speakers in the front seemed to be broken when i got it out of the box. The computer had one big problem: it does not support a monitor on the back.   The speakers are horrible.  I have to connect the computer to the TV for the sound to come through the speakers. The keyboard had a lot of problems. It would be nice if they would design a good keyboard for a desktop computer. The mouse is horrible, as well.  For what it is, i give it three thumbs down.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was very excited to buy this item as I was just thinking of replacing my aging laptop. My old computer had issues like "buzzing" or "frequent freezes". I expected nothing less from Apple but was totally disappointed.   The battery does not last as long as the older version, so the machine would go through 2 days of usage before it needed a recharge.  This machine was not even in perfect condition so I can understand how disappointed I was.

Rated 5 out of 5 by Mike from Great for the money This was my first attempt at an external speaker. I didn't have a lot of money so went with this one. It is an awesome speaker, and is very easy to use. I have a little Mac Mini which does NOT come with speakers, so I needed a third party solution. This has replaced my speakers in the past and it is perfect! The only downside is that the Bluetooth port is located on the left side of the box instead of the right side as advertised.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is my first mechanical keyboard.  I wanted a mechanical keyboard because it is more satisfying to type on a good mechanical keyboard with good tactile feedback, and I didn't like that this keyboard does not support "auto-repeat" keystrokes.  This would have been the perfect purchase except that it did not come with any software to "map" the keys and I'm not sure how to change the key map to do this or if it's even possible to change any of the software.   Great Keyboard! - June 14, 2012 - June 140 Reviews  Pros: It's a beautiful keyboard and looks great with my other black mechanical keyboard (which has the same keycaps on the right side). The quality of the keys is top notch. The only thing I wish the spacebar was a little bigger was because when I use my index finger to hold down the space bar, my thumb goes too far and rubs the space-bar. Otherwise it's awesome! Cons: None! Everything works fine and the price is very good.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a samsung galaxy s3 two months ago and the only thing i like about it is the quick charger but that's about it.    The other problem with this phone is the design:  It has the big screen, the usb and a nice design but the screen is very difficult to see due to the size and the size of the phone.  The Samsung Galaxy S3 in my opinion is a solid device.   It performs very well and has good features.  The main problem i have with the s3 is the poor design.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I bought this I was very excited to finally be able to play my vinyl records, but I was so disappointed. It took me a long time to figure out that it was too big to fit my entire vinyl collection into the case, and my records don't fit inside. It only holds my records. I have a second one that I bought for my dad to use and the same thing happened. So I ended up returning this one and getting a different one.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Mark from Too small I bought these to use for my records, which I have tons of. The case holds a lot, but you can only use them with the included CD player and the case itself is a bit too big. I'm looking at ordering a case that is wider, but the CD player is a real problem. -Mike  From the Manufacturer's Website: The Pioneer PL-640 is a dual-format turntable that features a tonearm that is built with high-quality materials and is easy to use, with an included CD changer to play CDs or play music from a computer or MP3 player. With a high-end tonearmo and cartridge, a tonal balance that offers good precision for music that demands deep, rich bass, and an easily adjustable tonearmite (no screws!) the PL-680 provides solid music reproduction. The PL-840 provides high quality audio and is designed with superior materials. With no need for the additional accessories of an LP player, CD player or mixer the PL840 makes an excellent home audio system for both listening to recorded music and listening to music via CDs or MP4. Both turntables feature a ton of moving parts that require special care, and these products are engineered to last for many years.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I own this device for about 3 years now. The first year or so i used it to play the guitar because i was going through a bad guitar amp and this thing has a great tone.   This thing will take up to a gig and a few gigs a week and its awesome.  The only thing i have to say is  you may want to get a better amp than the one you used to use if you plan on using this as a guitar or if you use it for anything other than the guitar.  It really needs an amp with a good low end to cut through the guitar amp it comes with. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this as a gift for my husband. It looks ok in the box. The display and sound is ok. Unfortunately, the unit does not work well. It just shows an incomplete connection and keeps turning off. When I plug it in I have to be very patient because it keeps turning back on. It turns on then it starts to shut off. I have called a tech and she said there is a problem with the circuit board and the board can only be fixed by replacing the circuit itself. If the product can only work this badly, I would rather not use the item in any way.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Bob from Easy to use, very good audio quality I purchased my Audio-Technica ATH-W1000X DVR in the fall of 2013 and have been happy with it ever since. Easy to set up and use, and has an excellent sound. As a professional voiceover actor, I use it to record voiceover demos, to broadcast, and to record in public places. I've found it to be well balanced, quiet, and a perfect fit. For a home user, it's nice that it has all the features and is quite easy to install. It's small size helps with storage, as well as having a great looking unit, which is a plus for a home.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This item was useless. It is a standard mp3 player and as such is really not worth the money, even with the free music. It had a bad CD player built in but no player. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the sony zlx10 and i wish i got the zl2 instead. The sound is nice and there is some gain but it does not sound as good.   i wish it came with a remote so i could have used it for my car audio   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The cable that came with my unit was useless. I tried to use it and it was very annoying and the sound was so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I really loved the sound from this amp, but it's not a power amp. The speakers do not really go beyond a low sub frequency (they only go down to 20Hz at most). The speaker terminals have a very good feel to them, but I have only had them installed on two amps and they've both gone out of spec after an hour. And, the power/mains cord is very flimsy. My amp went out with a very heavy crash, even though it wasn't plugged into anything. So far, I don't really have a good reason to buy this one again, except to save some money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have just received my new Panasonic AVH-V5000. For those who are not familiar with the AVH series, it is a "consumer-oriented" series that primarily includes the TV-monitor. It is very simple and does all the things that you would expect in a TV-monitor, but the sound isn't that good. I guess you get what you pay for. I purchased this because I wanted an AV unit that was cheaper than a computer-based unit, but I will probably just put it back and get a computer based unit. This is because the sound quality is so bad. It can't even get decent volume on my TV. This unit is not a quality product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The screen is too small and the buttons are in the wrong place. The battery life is also terrible.   If the price is right, I would definitely buy a different unit. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this to have a music system for my car.  This is a very small unit, it will not hold a 12" cd player (which the car stereo in the back does), but you can use it to play music on your cell phone with a 3.5mm input jack (which my old car has).  This would have been better if they had made it in a bigger size. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received my new i3 laptop as a Christmas present from my fiance.  It arrived, but it had no preinstalled drivers.  The laptop was also a few days late.  Then, it failed to boot and then I got to the screen that said "reboot your computer."  I rebooted and it rebooted successfully, but I was still unable to boot from the hard drive.  I called and was told that i3 was still a prototype, so it wasn't expected to work.  So I gave it a 1 star rating, as I didn't have any other issues with it other than that.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This   phone   is   a   joke.   In my   life   I have   never   had a  a   defective   device   so   unbelievable.  So   sad.  This is the first time I've had   this   happen to me.  The first   time   like this, and the second   after that.  I'm pretty sure   they have a recall program for   the   second  or third   case   of   defective phones, because   my  first   ever   bad   was   returned   with   such   problems.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am giving this one only 3 stars as I don't like the sound of it.  It sounds a lot like a computer on steroids.  There is a low thump when you type on it and that thump just repeats over and over and that is really annoying.  I thought it might be the batteries that I use and that could be what is causing the sound but it is not.  Overall the product is fine, it just needs to come with some type of case for it to function like a regular keyboard. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have had this product for about 2 months now. I have only had it for 2 weeks and i have no idea how i am supposed to use this thing with out any issues. When i got this i thought its a really great product that does what it promises. However, i was disappointed after using this thing for about a week.  I bought this to do some audio editing on my laptop and I expected to use it like a pro and make great stuff. What i have gotten is a terrible experience. After using this a couple times i can't use it at all. The audio quality is terrible, its always out of sync and it just sounds awful to be honest. I'm still looking for a better solution to using this.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The speaker was very good. I would not buy this again though. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to control my air conditioner and it never worked. Then when I tried to set it to the temperature, it said it was cold but when I took off the unit to test it it was the exact same temperature as when I had the air conditioned unit on. The light on the unit never went on. It was just a huge hassle. If you don't want to buy a new unit, I can't think of anything to say but you're going to be waiting for a very long time.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only way to use the device is to have someone else turn it on and off for you.   It's useless   I have the   E-Stick,   and it's a waste of time  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This laptop does not have a good trackpad that makes it hard to select things. You have to use the touch screen instead.   I wish this laptop was thinner and that the trackpad would be better.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The buttons on this thing are like a pair of old school typewriters that the company couldn't find the parts for. They were designed for the old IBM Selectric typewriter. The keys are stiff, but they're well spaced and not difficult to type.   This is an older model, and it's not worth buying. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace a broken Sony DVD player.  The sound is not very good and I have to constantly adjust the volume and use my audio monitor to listen to the movie.   This is a great deal though. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had to buy this product over at Target, and my wife had to pick it up. It took about a week to get to me, but I really liked the look of the design and it was very portable and easy to use.   We used it to view the weather in our hotel room for the first couple of nights, and it is nice that we can watch the screen while we're on the road. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this laptop on August 22, 2010 and it was defective on January 1, 2011. After about 1 month the battery started dying. My other two laptops didn't have this issue. So I called HP and it said there was a "bad batch of laptops" but couldn't fix it because they don't have the same exact issue. It was probably just one bad batch, so it was useless to me.   This is the second time I have had a defective laptop. The first time it was a bad drive.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I bought this I bought a cheap version. It took almost 2 weeks for the software to show up.  I have had it for only about a month now.   This does not come with a warranty.  If you need a new keyboard just buy a cheaper model. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a second hand Toshiba Encore CD/DVD/VHS player when it was on sale for about $100. However, the player died in the first few months. I've read reviews saying that the unit has been well-designed and a quality product, but I was disappointed to learn that this CD/VCR is a complete junk. The only positive thing I can say about the unit is that it came with the necessary cables to connect to my TV. Other than that, the unit itself seems to be pretty poorly designed. I'm still a little confused about why Toshiba went with DVD instead of a more widely used format like Blu-ray. I could never find a copy of the DVD with the player, and the player has a strange CD-ROM interface that doesn't seem to work for me. I also don't get the point of the Blu-Ray drive -- if I want to watch Blu-rays, I use the DVD player -- and I think that Toshiba should have stuck with Blu-Rays. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really wish this one would have been more like an analog device, like an old TRS-80 or Apple IIe.   I can still use this machine as an iMac but the sound quality is terrible.  This thing sounds like a garbage can.  I don't even want to try to load a program on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a horrible product. There is no way to charge a battery. The battery only lasts an hour, but I had to buy another charger to have enough time to charge the batteries before the car.   The charger has to be used separately as you would not want to use your phone while driving. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After buying an Ipod touch and immediately finding out that it would not work in my car, I gave the seller 3 days to replace the bad part.   On the first day the seller replaced it and I was able to use my   Ipod for a short time.  After reading the other comments I would have given this item a 1 stars.  The seller needs to sell this at or below cost or no one will buy it. I will not be purchasing another 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a brand new PC from Newegg in June of last year. In October, I got an email that the processor was damaged.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've had this unit for about a month now and so far, it has never failed on me. The problem I have with this product is that the power supply on my unit failed the day I got it, making the unit unusable. I have a power supply that should last 10,000+ hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The unit is very loud and the fan spins so hard that I have to stop using it to change the battery (the fan just spins for a few minutes when the battery is inserted). The unit works, but it's loud and takes up space on my desk. It's also a pain to change batteries because the fan won't turn off (even when the unit is plugged into the wall). I also don't like that the charging port is located on the back of the unit rather than in the front. This is really a problem because I usually charge my iPhone or a laptop using the same port.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been having a real hard time getting into the new Sony VTC5. I have had issues with my VTC4 and my VTR5 have never let me down.   It is very nice to have a better quality microphone, but for my liking the battery life is the worst on a portable.  I also have noticed that the cable is not as flexible as the VTC 4's and that's a problem in my house. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I used the device for about a month until the audio quality started dropping.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this unit to use to control the TV. I found the remote to be hard to use and the control buttons were not responsive. The remote had a bunch of buttons which make it hard to navigate through the menus. Also the menu system is terrible and confusing.  I recommend buying the Roku 2 instead.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There were some problems with this unit.   The batteries were not in a battery compartment, so I had to put the units in the case before use.  The only other issue is that the unit is slow to start.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The phone had no speakers, so I couldn't use the speakers of my laptop (MacBook Pro). I bought the phone specifically to replace my laptop with its amazing speakers, and they weren't there. This was a big disappointment for a nice phone.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace my previous computer monitor with a 60hz monitor and after using this monitor for a few months it's already showing a slight loss in the color from my old monitor. So far, I've only seen a slight decline in the quality of my photos on my computer. And, it's hard to tell if it's my monitor or the monitor's. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The problem with this product is that it is difficult to open, but the "key" is too small and easily falls out of the case. Other than that the sound quality is good.   Rated 5 out of 5 by james from very good product I use these in my office. It has been very good.  4 out of 4 found this review helpful This product works fine, though I am not sure I would pay more money for it. . It's a very nice looking key holder, that is lightweight and easy to use. The key itself is a bit flimsy and the key can be easily removed by a finger. The only issue is that the key falls out when you try to open the case...  5 out of 6 found this Review helpful The product works great. No problems. Easy to install, works well with keyboard and mouse. Only thing that would make it 5 stars is if the key could be inserted a little more easily, but otherwise it is a great product.  of 5 Pros: Nice looking. Feels good. Fits nicely in my palm. The quality is excellent.Cons: Key is too wide in the key hole to fit in keyboard with out wobbling. Not worth the price.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the Apple wireless keyboard in 2010 because I had been looking for something in the same price range as my PC keyboard and after looking for a few months with few good alternatives I decided to go with the keyboard.  I have had no problems with it, however it was slow and unreliable for my usage. I bought the bluetooth keyboard in January of 2012 and I had no trouble with it.  The bluetooth is very easy to use with my smartphone.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the E-Book of books for my Kindle to start reading. But I found that it was really difficult to make it work, due to the hard hard drive of the Kindle. The reader itself is really good, but with the hard drive, it is hard to save and transfer books. I also found out that it can't connect to other Kindles or PCs, so I had to purchase a wireless Kindle and then use the USB dongle, which I would recommend to anyone with a laptop.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the S5 a year ago and it has been a bit of a disappointment.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The headphones had been working great for quite some time when my friend came over and bought them. We played some music and listened to some songs on the headphones. He was really happy with the sound, but one of the headphones didn't work. We looked online and found a replacement, but the sound was poor and distorted. The replacement didn't seem to fix the problem. After contacting the company, they sent a replacement that worked. We finally decided to go with the original headphones.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The keyboard was terrible. It is hard to type on. The "keycap" on the keycap is not in the proper position so the caps do not act like a keycap at all. The key switch felt too soft and the key switch did not work.  One of the key switches on this keyboard broke. I sent this back for repair and they said it was okay to send it back to me with a replacement key switch.   I was very disappointed because this keyboard was not good quality. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is my first wireless mp3 player, and it has been less than perfect.  I'm a big fan of portable music players like the ipod and the    i mp3s, but I have been looking for something a bit larger, so that I could have two of them.   So far, the player   does not play music   on the same album twice, but it does let me choose what I want to play.  That's a good feature, but the device itself is very heavy, and I feel that I can barely play a song with my arm, even if I put my arm in the correct position.  For the price, I expected better, and was not surprised by this disappointment.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a very nice and inexpensive wireless router but it is over priced for what you get. The setup was easy and the wifi connection speed is great but I was very disappointed with the quality of the wireless range. The range is so bad I can't use my laptop in my kitchen when I am home.   I tried to install my router into another network card but the connection is bad, not sure if I can get it to work in my house. I also have a laptop in the basement which has wifi so I think I will be buying a separate router in the future.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device for use in my basement.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have only had this tablet for two weeks and have had the "wow" moment of "wow! This is amazing, I love it!" but then I notice that it is a slow reader and that I have to reread what I read to find my thoughts.  The only use case I've seen is to do "ebooks on the go"    Product:  I just used it for the first time and had an awesome experience.

But, once I get used  to it,  I love using this 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only reason I bought this is because I saw the great reviews for this.   I was very surprised to see the price tag, which is a lot higher than most other USB powered speakers.  I've heard that others have gotten a bad unit, so I'm hoping the reviews will be pretty good.  It sounds great, and looks great too.  However, the problem is that the volume is too loud and sounds too much like a loud laptop.  So far, I've got it plugged into an ipod touch which has a built in subwoofer and it sounds amazing.  The only issue I have is that they are not cheap as others. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these to replace my aging Sony PX-3 digital recorder, which had gotten to the point where it would occasionally skip or lose audio. After using them for a few months, I decided to get a new Sony Px-2.  The audio quality is better, but the Px is a lot more comfortable to use in my hands (plus, they're so cheap that you can buy extra cables/headsets/pads/etc.)   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I use my computer for work. I can't find the key to the safe from the start. I'm not sure if this is a defect in the product or if it will be easy to get into once I can find the right key. The fact that I've already lost 2 keystrokes trying to get in has gotten to me. I don't think I will be buying this product again.  Rated 5 out of 5 by David from Very helpful, inexpensive and handy! As a computer technician, I bought a couple of these for my home work computers. It was quite a deal, and for a few dollars I had a number of functions. I would use one as a mouse pad for my work laptops, and I now have a great way to quickly find the function I want to press to open a document, e-mail, or search a file. I recommend these over the cheap ones that come in a box at Radio Shack or other computer stores, because there is more functionality and ease of use with these.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When the computer was being repaired on a Saturday morning. The technician couldn't figure out why a new hard drive had failed. When the technicians suggested that the new drive, which is almost brand new, must be the culprit. It was working fine. We then found that the drive's magnetic stripe was also bad. I called Tech support and was told that it was a rare failure and that the technician would return the computer to me tomorrow. Not long after, the technician returned with a new drive which was not brand new. He said the old drive's problems were common and were due to wear. I was advised that I could still return the machine tomorrow and have it repaired. I thought the drive would wear out.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product is OK for what it is. I bought this to replace my old laptop, which I had for 8 years. It came with the exact same components and performance, but the price was a bit higher for what you get. I don't know why there were two upgrades on one unit (1 TB hard drive), but my old machine was only 3 TB. This is great if you have older computers or older software, but I don.t think I will use this again.   The product is okay for what I need but for the price, I would choose something more high end. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have been looking for a good USB hub but this one has all the wrong things in it.   The hub has a USB port but has two screws on the front so you can't access the internal electronics.  This is a very frustrating purchase.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've been looking for a portable radio for a long time, but I've always been disappointed.   This portable can only get around in a specific area, which isn't enough to listen to a bunch of stations.  So, this thing is worthless for any travel I'd have to do.

Works as advertised.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing that will happen to this laptop after a couple of hours is a light flashing on the screen (and my screen is very bright). After several hours of being used I'm ready to give it up. This laptop was not worth it. The problem I had was caused by a defective keypad, which was annoying and difficult to use. I tried a replacement keypad but found the replacement keys were hard to locate, and the original keypad didn't work for the same reason. So, to be fair I'll give this laptop a one.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the Apple iPhone 5c on sale. I am using it primarily for my business and my kids' games.  The sound is nice, but it is so noisy.   The built in GPS is good, but my wife and daughter are never satisfied with GPS in their car.  It seems like it would have been much better with an external GPS since the phone is so heavy.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The best part of the controller is the "toy mode" that lets you put it in a little box and play it like a kid. I had the controller for a few weeks before I realized I should have gone for the real controller. That being said, it is a great controller.   Overall, I am disappointed with this purchase. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   A lot of people used this to listen to music. The problem is the speaker is too small. I used to listen via bluetooth and the quality of the sound was great.  I tried switching from bluetooth to analog and it became very bad.   The problem was caused by poor power of this product. This device can't even be powered on. It's as if the speaker was dead when I got it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought these in August and they arrived in February and they worked fine but I have not tried them out yet.   They look cool and I have a few other cheap electronic devices like ipods, but these are just too big to lug around everywhere.   Good but...   This was a pretty good buy but I feel like they are a little on the heavy side so I would not buy again. I wish the battery was smaller but it's nice to have them at my disposal. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit has no battery and it's very hard to get all the settings.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My computer has been very very bad. No matter what kind of software or programs it is running ( Windows XP/8, Mac OS,...), I have to use a mouse and keyboard.   Very annoying!   The screen is tiny and the battery life is not very long. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only thing I like about this is the fact that it is always on.  I like having my music with me all the time, and when I want to go for a walk or ride my bike I can turn the volume down and play music.  It is just very easy to connect.   This does not support my music collection  I've had a number of issues with this. The first was when the remote didn't work. I tried the same remote and remote control but the one I got from Amazon worked flawlessly, so I returned the one from Best Buy (Amazon didn't send one until 4 days after I ordered it). But, it's still not working.  The other problem is that the cable that goes into the computer isn't very long. I got the shortest one and it doesn't extend enough for me.  A little bit of extra work on the cables would have been nice. I also have a Bluetooth keyboard that I use to control the computer without having to plug in the keyboard, but the computer doesn't recognize the keyboard and the only way to get it to work is to plug the keyboard in, or to have the Bluetooth controller on the computer.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had a very bad experience with my computer for over a month.   It is just a horrible machine.  It's almost impossible to get it to do anything useful.  I don't know if my mother was trying to help me or what.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this thing a few months ago and have used it a couple of times now, but the one time it did work I had to reset it and now every time I try to turn the TV on the power light comes on but the set isn't on, and if I turn it on all the lights go off except for the tv and the power switch. It's really weird! I was so excited to get it because I have a Sony DVD player which works really good and is pretty easy to set up and use. This set is a bit more complicated to set it up and I'm hoping to get a better one in the future.   Good item, but a few issues:  There is no remote!   This set was easy to figure out and setup. I had trouble getting the power cord and the remote to fit into the console so I had some trouble getting everything to work. It was a pain to put it all together. The only bad thing is that it doesn't come with the remote. You have to get the Xbox remote.  I am really pleased with the console and this is a great way to bring your PS3 over to your Xbox 360. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was extremely disappointed with this purchase.  I bought this for my daughter to play with when she was younger, and she loved it but I've had much better electronic devices for much less.  It has been working for about a month now, and everything is great except for the fact that the sound is horrible.  The only solution I found is to buy a new one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The power supply on my TV had been out for days, and when I turned it on, it turned off and froze all the way through. When I finally took it apart, I found out the TV only turned on when it was plugged into a wall outlet. Not only is this a terrible problem, it's an expensive one, as the entire unit is just an add-on, which takes up a lot of space. I'd pay for a separate power supply instead.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was extremely disappointed when I was looking for a new computer to replace my laptop.

I'm sure I could get a decent used computer for about twice the price. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I recently replaced my old Sony A35F with a new Sony A5000. The quality was great, as well as the sound, but the control of the new unit was not as good as my old unit. I bought it from ebay, and had a good experience. But, after it shipped, I received a message from Sony that it would be returning the unit.  The problem was that the battery was dead, so the unit no longer worked. They said they were sending me a replacement, but it has already been 2 weeks and no replacement has been sent. So, I'm paying to have the unit replaced again.  I replaced my Sony A6000 with a Sony A6500, and it works better than the A35... but the quality is a little worse.    The Sony A5500, I thought would have a nice sound quality. Well... the quality isn't very good.  I purchased this system as a replacement for my Sony R6500... because it is a great budget option.  This was the system I was hoping it would have the sound quality of. But it was way below what I was expecting and has been worse than my other system.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is a good product, but the problem is that the software is not up to date.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a terrible, bad piece of junk, i got it because i got an iPhone SE (i think) and i needed a new keyboard, it comes with a wireless keyboard. but i really dont want it. i dont like the fact that it has an eraser but not an ergo, so the keyboard becomes a crummy crummy keyboard with an erasing function and not a regular ergo. the keyboard only has a few keys, so it doesnt have enough to do anything. the other thing is the software on it, i dont even know how to use it. and the battery life is terrible. it was almost 2 years and i couldnt get it to charge for like an hour and a half when it had about 3-4 hours of battery left. i have a laptop and a samsung galaxy s4 but the only way i could get this to work was to charge it while sitting on the charger.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It is really a horrible device.   This is not my first PC, so I was expecting much more.  It has many issues, most of which I could not solve myself, I had to call support and they gave me an RMA ( Return Merchandise Authorization ) to have a new one sent out to me and then they gave the old one to a customer that they did not have a RMA for.  This has to be the worst PC I have ever had, it does not even have a back-up CD or removable hard drive, and it runs the same old crap.  I have had the Dell desktop for a while and never had any issues with it, but now I am going to wait until Dell fixes the system. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have a problem with my new LG bluetooth headphones. I'm a music lover who loves the original ones, and the newer ones, but the sound is so terrible, and it always fails in a few seconds. It's really bad, and sometimes it takes about 10 seconds. But now it's not as bad because I bought this. It sounds better, but it's still terrible. It doesn't fit well, so if I put the headphones on, I can't get them off. And I still have to put them on, because the cable gets in my way, and I can see if it fits or not. I bought the headphones because I thought that I could put them in my car to use, but I can never get it in the car because the cord is so long and so thick, that if I don't have my phone on me, I will never get the headphones in the door. The headphones themselves are ok. But that's about it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the product after reading reviews by others but I can't give it more than 3 stars.  The product only lasts a week.  I have a Dell Inspiron n7300 that I bought at Best Buy.  It has survived my 5 years of daily use and use it every morning before work, lunch, before bed and during the day.  My Inspiron has never died after more than 2 years of being turned off and on and is still very reliable.  But I bought this laptop because of the high performance and amazing battery life.  Unfortunately, my laptop would no longer power on if I were to turn the machine on at night.  When I tried to reattach the battery, it would still not power on.  In addition to that, it's very slow and the system will not go to sleep.   The Dell laptop is great for someone that wants to keep their PC alive.  This product needs to be much better or discontinued for my money

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have a Lenovo Z40 laptop that was given to me as a free gift by my friend, who worked at a school where I used to teach (I would rather they have kept the computer but I'm happy with the quality of the product). It has the usual problems, some of which I've had before with this laptop but the screen isn't so good (not bright enough), and it has a lot of bloatware. I don't know whether I'd buy a Lenovo device in the future but I guess I'll have to wait till I can afford a better screen. The keyboard feels pretty good but I still wish I got a different laptop keyboard.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a very new PC that I was going to buy just for gaming. I was impressed when I opened the box and found the full-sized graphics card and an integrated CPU. I got everything I expected and then some. I even got a 2nd monitor. I didn't expect that much, but I can't say I was disappointed. The video card is pretty bad (although still quite good, I'll get to that) and the integrated CPU, although fast, is not as powerful as my Intel desktop. The speakers are pretty bad but overall not that bad, maybe a B-. The only problem I have is that the touchpad is very slow and has trouble detecting my finger when I do not want to press it. The only reason why I gave it 3 stars is because the keyboard is pretty good. The key spacing is not very good (not even a D grade) but the keys are very sharp.

It says that "the app for your Samsung may not be compatible" with the "new app" (i.e. new SmartThings App) that is being released soon. I tried all my harddrive drives but they are all the same. I have to wait for the new SmartApp to get updated, but I think it would be really helpful if the "old" app could be updated to work with the new app.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The battery would die after 2 days but they still had to charge it every few days.  It's too bad the price wasn't cheaper.   Rated 4 out of 5 by Nalil from The battery worked good after a week or so I purchased this unit to replace an old model, the original battery would not even last one month. After I replaced the battery in my original model, I used this one. I have only had it a week, but so far so good. It works just as it did in the original model. I am very satisfied with the design of the product, but I will definitely purchase the original one when it becomes available again.  Customer Reviews Rated 4 out Of 5 by Cp from Nice Product and Great Price I was so sad when my old unit failed, but after seeing this in store I finally decided to buy it. It took less than two minutes to replace the battery. I like the fact that it can use AA or AAA size batteries. And, the price is very good. I'll be buying more in the future. -David.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this in order to play an old Nintendo DS game.   Unfortunately, the game is only compatible with the new Nintendo DS and not the old DS.  I'm not sure if I would have been able to get the game if I had a PC that could use an external Nintendo DS controller, but the only thing on the DS is a button for saving your game and the game just saves and gives you the option to start over.  My Wii just plays movies on my TV.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPod classic had an annoying habit of getting stuck in the loop, only playing one song.   One day, while using the shuffle, I was just flipping through the album list and I had a brilliant idea: "You know, there's only two songs on this album. Why don't we just play them every time we start the iPod?" It took me a few tries to get it to work, but eventually it started looping all the way through the disc.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought these for my 16 yr old daughter for Christmas, and she has been a die hard Apple fan since the early 80's. The problem with the Touch Bar is that they are so expensive. They should have come out with one for the MacBook. It makes no sense to pay extra for something which isn't really that useful. There is also the small issue of the Touch Bars and keyboard taking up space which could have been taken up by a single USB 3 port. They are not as fast as a full-size USB 2 port, so if you have the space, go with the MacBook and save yourself a lot of frustration.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was my third Sonos. This is the second one that is just a little too quiet. I expected this to be way louder. My Sonos plays the same playlist twice daily, at exactly the same time.

The first time I bought it, I only had the controller and the power adapter. After that, I purchased the Sonos app.

The one good thing is the battery life is quite long but I have seen some reports where it will run out in two weeks. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device as a replacement for my old TV.  Unfortunately, it is completely useless for anything besides TV, and its sound quality is terrible (the sound is a bit tinny), and it has no HDMI input.  It's also very small, and when I plug it into a HDMI port, the video and audio signal get scrambled and garbled (this happened only a few times and I don't remember the source of the problem).   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The unit was not very helpful when you had an issue with the audio. It would just sit there for a long period of time and would not answer my call or even respond to my text message.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This thing is worthless   I got this as part of my deal with my friends who bought a set of headphones for me. I'm not really big on headphones.   It looks nice and I'm sure it's going to last a long time, but I'm going to get some new ones.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only thing i can see is that the design was bad for the price and the sound quality is very bad.  I purchased this system because i heard great reviews and i was on the fence.   I received it on a saturday and it was on my doorstep the next day.  The system works great with the  iPhone 4 and works just as good without.  For the price i was pretty surprised and was more excited that i would be able to play my  iPod and  The price is definitely a big plus if you are looking for a new system.  It comes with everything you need for an efficient home entertainment system.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been looking for a good keyboard and I bought this one and after using it for a couple of days I have to say that it has major flaws.   First off it is hard to turn the keys on the right side, so I have always been on the left side of the keyboard.  Second, the keys aren't all the same color, there are some that are gray and some that is black, and most keys have multiple color.  Third, the switches feel really cheap and don't have a good feel, and I think they break quite easily.  Finally, the power switch is really hard to find and I always lose it, so it's not that good.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality is good, however the audio port does not always work.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Dave from Works for some and not for others. I have used this for several years, and the sound is great. Some people like it, and I know I do, but it has a "thunk" to it. I thought that would go away, but alas, it does. I'll probably get a different unit, but for now it's OK, especially if you want to keep the sound, but not the thunk.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just got this device and it took forever to set up. The instructions were not clear enough and I had to call the tech support to help me set it up.  It took way too long to set it on, and I was too lazy to plug it in and wait for it to power on.  I think I should've waited a few days and returned it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this because I wanted a wireless speaker. I did not find any of the controls on this to be that easy to use or intuitive. The controls are just too small for my thumb to grasp, and I have to use my index finger to adjust the volume, instead of the knobs on the remote.   The speaker is very loud, but it does not have a bass boost, so when it's quiet it sounds really boomy. The remote has an issue with it not working correctly. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this after reading all of the good reviews and I have to admit I didn't know what to expect when I ordered it. I have had a few problems with this device, but one of them is the size, as the cable that came with the unit is pretty short. This would be okay if it was an optical cable, but it is not. The other problem is that the unit itself is pretty small, the top of it is just a little too small for my tastes, the power button is on the back of the unit, but the power indicator light is on top of the power switch on the front, which I don't like. When I turn the unit on, it is loud, but at that time, I'm usually looking for something with a higher volume. The sound quality is okay, the music that came on was OK, but I didn�t know it was prerecorded so I wouldn�t complain about that, but if you're looking for good quality music, this isn�t it.   Other than that, the price is ok, so for the price, I like the unit enough to give it a go, but for the same price, you could get the HD-P60-CD.   Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Does not compare with other recorders I've used, however it does what I need it to do. There is one problem though. There are no buttons on the side of the device to do anything other than select tracks or the pause menu. This makes it hard to use if I have multiple devices. Also, I had to buy a new power cord because it didn't come with one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The speaker is a little too big for my speakers and I don't like the plastic.

The sound is great and it works great!  5 out of 6 stars from Bill from Georgia Purchased this speaker as a replacement for my old stereo system. I replaced the speakers because my old ones were wearing out. This new set has been fantastic. I highly recommend these speakers.  it does the job  3 out of 4 stars from jay from Washington Bought these speakers in hopes of replacing old speakers that were starting to wear out. While they sound fine in comparison to my old Yamaha speakers, I have a feeling the sound will get worse as they age.  " I have tried the new model in two other locations in a store and they work. It is definitely a good speaker but needs a lot of work. "  2 out of 3 stars from Toni from Minnesota I thought this speaker was going to be great, but to my dismay after playing the first song through I realized it sounded like a small transistor radio. The highs weren't punchy enough. The midrange wasn't full enough either. I am glad I did not buy it.  (Posted on 7/10/2011)

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The speaker is really noisy, and the sound quality isn't really bad at all, it just lacks the soundstage and imaging I would like for a subwoofer.  I have been using this sub for over 6 months and have yet to have it crack.  The soundstage is very spacious and the bass is just a hair bit over the top.  It would be nice to get some sort of wireless/remote/audio control system so you can turn the sub off if you don't want it on. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the TRS-80 microcomputer from an old guy for $5 and after a week or two the keyboard would not work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this to replace a bad iPod so that I could listen to my own music on a much smaller screen.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had the S-100 on my TV for a couple years.  I get that it is a TV, and it is great that it lets me watch shows on the big screen, but the sound is just not as good as I would have liked.  The sound is not that bad, it's actually a little better than the S2000.  It does not have the quality of my DVD player, but it is much better than what I get from my Satellite or Cable.  A friend of mine bought the same model and loved it.  But this S-1000 is a ripoff.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The power of the USB-C plug is very limited, especially when compared to the older USB-A (Type A) standard, which is much more efficient and powerful than the USB 3.1 standard that this device is using.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this thing a few weeks ago and am just now getting it back in order.   Well made, just a tad small and flimsy.  This thing is a cheap copy of a much more expensive unit.  My old one (now defunct) had an LED indicator that showed current status, and the sound quality was great, but I couldn't tell the difference in this one.  The only way I know of to determine if the sound is good is to put the unit in my car (it has a cassette player) and listen to it in the car (a nice pair of speakers).  A better interface would be better for the price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this one to use as a keyboard and mouse for my tablet. It works fine for that. The device is a bit flimsy, and it's just not sturdy enough. When it does make noise, it's rather loud. It's not loud enough to drown out the other sounds that are in my office. It does make a nice click when you click on something, and I like the fact that it has a very quiet backlight.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The iPod isn't that bad, but it's still a waste of money. The problem is not the audio quality but the fact that the entire thing is made of plastic, so it has the same feel as the plastic iPod Touch.  The only good thing about this is the fact the iPod is really cheap and you can get a decent-quality portable player for about the same price. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased two of these.   One was defective.  The other was working fine. I did call the manufacturer, and was told that the problem was due to the power supply.  When I called back to ask why the unit I purchased was defective, the manufacturer told me that it is common to hear the unit will not power up and will be a dead unit until you put in the wrong cable.  It would be nice if this problem were addressed before I bought these, but I bought them anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you are looking for a good gaming keyboard, don't get this one. It does not have the key travel on a pro keyboard. I got this as a spare for the Xbox One so that I can play PS4. The first thing that I thought about when I received it was how big the keyboard is compared to my standard keyboard. However, the second thing that struck me is that it's not even close to pro quality. The keys are really mushy and the switch on the back (that I use) does not feel as good. For a cheaper keyboard it would be OK but for a pro product this one is a huge letdown.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a set of the EH-6 amp's, which come in a variety of colors, in the hopes that it would improve the sound of my existing set of amps, but it hasn't. I've had two set of these for about 3 months now, and it sounds worse in most situations. First, the tone controls are a bit too aggressive in the upper mids and lows. The highs are way too high, and I have to turn them down quite a bit to sound decent. Second, the amp's volume control is so hard to hit, you have to really push it to get any sound.   This is the second time I have had to replace the E-H6's, so I am wondering if there are better alternatives out there. This is an excellent upgrade over the EJ1220 with a slightly bigger cabinet and new speaker, but the EHP6 is not much more than an amp that's slightly louder and louder. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The sound quality of this device was not up to par.

It comes with a   keyboard dock, so if you want to use your keyboard or mouse, this is great.  For $25, I expected much more.

It has a big blue LED on the front that is always blinking and when you turn the phone on it says it's good to go.  But the LEDs are not always on the inside or it would just power the phone up and then you would be on a 3 day charge.  It would also stop working when the battery is almost empty.  Also the battery does not charge fast and you have to turn the screen on and off frequently.  I use it for voice calling but the battery will die in a month or so anyway and i think it was designed for phones.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I bought this the first thing I did was hook it up to my old laptop. I was worried at first as to whether it would connect to the lm and what I would have to do to make it work.

I had a bit of trouble connecting the ls, the buttons do not work and the screen is very small. I don't think the box should have a sticker on it with the directions to connect it with a pc. I found it easier to connect the lms through the lite switch of the lmt.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After 2 years the light in my unit stopped working on the front panel. I bought the replacement for $10. It works fine, but the front of the unit is flimsy and cheap looking. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As long as I can find one in stock it works well, but a few of the USB ports on the other ports don't work at all. It would be nice if the ports were numbered or at least made to feel like they were. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this with hopes that the high quality would result in a good product. I was very disappointed.  The battery and connection were not as good as the picture on the website showed.  They do not come out of the box or even when they are plugged in. I did not know this.  I had to disassemble them and solder them to the circuit board.  So much for being able to use with no connection.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The thing is a big pain to use. The buttons on the front of the machine are difficult to press and you have to really hold the switch on the back.  The screen seems to be very poorly made and with all the bluing and chipping of the screen and the buttons it is very uncomfortable to use in my opinion. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought two of these, and they were terrible.  When I got them, the first thing I did was to remove the protective film that protects the screen. I then proceeded to break the screen while inserting a floppy disk into the drive. I am using an Intel Pentium II 100 MHz with Windows NT 3.x, and it did not show me a single problem while I had the product installed. The unit has no problems when it's running.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this for my 14 year old daughter for her birthday. She had the older model but my daughter is too old for the newer model. I don't care much for her current phone (smartphone), so I decided to get the newest one. As I was installing it, I noticed a very weak battery that quickly drained to zero. When it was nearly dead, I got up to do other things and the phone wouldn't turn back on. I contacted the company and was told that the only way to fix this was to get a new battery. Needless to say, I couldn't do that. Instead of calling the phone company I called a local phone shop to ask for help. I gave them a call and when they arrived, the tech took the phone apart and looked at the circuit board in the back of the phone and the battery which was damaged. This was not a cheap phone. I tried it in a car, on my bed, and at least two feet away from the wall. At least two times, the phone came back on but was dead when the battery was being changed. I would be willing to pay extra for the latest model, but I have already spent nearly $300 on this device so I'm not sure how I'm going to replace the battery anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I love the design and sound quality, but the fact that you can't use it while charging is a deal breaker. It would be really cool if you could plug it into your car charger, or some such, but for now it just sits in a drawer.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    i bought this for my girlfriend and it never came with an adapter, so she ended up buying a dongle from eBay to use with it.   It worked fine for a while, but the noise it made when her computer came on in the morning was intolerable.  Now it's so loud that she doesn't bother turning it on. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It worked well for a few months until the power adapter would fail on my computer.   I would have been fine if my computer worked with this product, but it has failed twice now, one after only two months of ownership and one after 4 months, and not worth the price or hassle for me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If you have a smart tv this is the only thing that matters. It doesn't look or feel anything like the last one I had. It is a shame I have to throw out this TV because I can't use it. The only reason I have kept my old one is because I keep my old tv. So this TV is a waste of money for me. It looks like a computer that's been abandoned and a waste.  I ordered the LG B6 4K TV for my son (17) and he loves it. It has great picture quality, and we are very happy with our purchase.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In the early 80's, this was one of the best devices. Unfortunately, the screen was badly scratched when I was using it (a couple of weeks after I got it).   I bought it for the music and video library on my TV.   After watching a few programs I just had to get rid of it.  The good: The sound quality is OK. The unit is small, but it is very easy to operate. The remote control is small and well designed. I am happy with the design of the unit.  The interface is easy to use and the remote control gives good feedback if you press the wrong button. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I use the HP Elite x3 and the keyboard is very hard to type on. This is a very expensive product and I am not using it as my main computer but just for a few personal applications. I don't like that it is so heavy and requires a laptop keyboard.   When I use a laptop, it is easy to type using one hand because it is on a mouse. I think a touch-screen laptop will be better but this is a waste of money  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My son's Samsung Galaxy S4 was defective when we first got it, but his Samsung Galaxy Note 4 was not.   It worked pretty well until this summer. I ordered this phone to replace my Note 3 that is no longer in use.  They are supposed to ship all new devices within two days of payment, so I bought this device as I was waiting for a Galaxy Note 7 to arrive.  Well, I was very disappointed when my Note 4 didn't work for the first time. I have the phone with a case, but the screen goes white and the volume buttons do not work.  It's a shame that Samsung continues to not care about the quality of their products.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really like my new iPad. I got it last week. I didn't buy it for the graphics. I bought it for it's battery life. That was disappointing. It lasts 6 to 8 hours, sometimes less.   If you don't have one yet: Get one. I use it on the airplane to read the news and other electronic media. The best part of it is that it comes with an SD card. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After the purchase I received a defective CD player, I returned the defective unit and the new one will not work properly.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality of this is very, very bad.  I purchased the device on the recommendation of a friend. I really like the concept, but I'm still trying to make use of it.  My initial installation was difficult because of the volume. After a few times of doing it, I got used to the volume, but the volume isn't high enough for me at all. I tried to turn the volume up on the tv, but it still made me sound like a small child when I used it. I'd recommend a different set up.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this monitor for a project and had to use my own laptop in order to use it. I decided to spend the money on a monitor instead of buying my own. The screen is very small and the resolution is very low. I had a few problems with it but the most noticeable was that the connection to my laptop would not work. I tried several cables and the problem remained.   After many phone calls and emails, this company eventually sent me a replacement for free. I do not recommend this company.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   A bad Apple computer was purchased as a replacement for a destroyed iPad which was not functioning.

It would be nice if this computer came with an HDMI cord and not just an USB cable. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The screen is not very good. The brightness is poor and color reproduction is very bad.

It worked but is very limited to that.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device because I was not looking to spend $150 on something that I would need to remember the password.  The first time I got it I was happy with it, but I was very disappointed in the batteries.  They are not that powerful, and when I try to charge it for a few minutes, I end up getting a dead battery.   The second time I tried to charge the device, the batteries would not get enough charge and died.      It's just a bad product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this unit to replace a defective iPod. The iPod was broken when I got it from my old dealer. The first week I used it, it did not play music. I did a little research and learned the unit is supposed to work with the Apple computer system. I contacted my local Apple store and they said they could replace the iPod but that I would be charged for shipping.   The next week it started playing music and I've been using it for about 2 months now. I have bought another unit from another Apple store but this one has no problem with iTunes and other software. I'm considering buying the new model of this unit and buying another iPod.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was really looking forward to this as it was a great price for a really nice device. The product is really well built and sturdy. It came with a nice usb cable and the unit itself is quite small but I've gotten used to it and it seems very sturdy.  The only real downside to this product is the fact that you cannot change the memory card because it is pre-loaded.  It's a bit annoying but it does what it's supposed to and does what I need it to.  I also wish there was a way to change the resolution of the memory cards since they don't work right in 720p.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have an older model Mac Pro that I purchased several years ago, and I am constantly using it.  Unfortunately, it is just not as fast or power efficient as the newer Mac Pros.   This Mac is so frustrating that it is making me quit using computers altogether.  I am currently on a long-term vacation, so I have not had much time to investigate the hardware, but I see a few new Macs at my local Apple Store.  They don't have these older Mac Pros at the Apple Store, so that tells me there are no issues with them.  It doesn't look like these Macs use the same chips as the new ones, but it's hard to tell.

It does have a small rechargeable battery, but it was pretty flimsy and it's very loud for a portable player. The battery lasts about four hours. I will probably use the iHip for music while on the road and if I'm at home I'd probably just use the small mp3 player.

Rated 1 out of 5 by josie from Poor build quality, poor sound quality & awful price! Bought these as part of the B&H promo a few months ago - good quality, but cheaply constructed. The build quality is very poor - pieces of the speaker cable are broken off. The sound quality is also poor - the bass isn't very good. I'm going to have to replace the speakers. The price is also awful! It's much more expensive than I expected - I would recommend the Bowers & Wilkins VS7, which are way more expensive.  A really good speaker... The sound is very rich with detail, and the bass response is good, if not overly forward. Unfortunately, the sound is a little harsh for the price point. The quality of the build is very good, but I am disappointed. ... but not as good as the BWR or the VS7. This one is a good speaker, but if I were to spend $1,500 or more on a B&W speaker, I would most likely go with the BWS model.

The buttons are so small that it's hard to reach them. Secondly, I'm a music guy and I still find the song list to be limited. I would suggest a larger screen.

The audio is very choppy on my bluetooth but works perfectly fine on my android  The usb one is ok for music and internet surfing, but has some issues. Sound is not as clear or defined as my blu.   Also, the usb cable is really cheap and flimsy.  When trying to connect to the blu to play the music, the software wouldn't allow me to connect. I ended up using my phone as my source, with the blu plugged in.  This is an awful piece of junk, and if I could return it, I would. I'm so glad I bought it, but I won't be buying anything similar from this company.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these two cords to hook up a digital video recorder.  I have a digital camera. The camera is fine.  But I wanted to keep the digital video camera cord around.  The second cord will work just as well.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I replaced the original Toshiba DVD player that my parents bought, it died in 3 years.  It only reads DVD's, not DVD+R and DVD2's   It also has an audio out.  I could not get it to read my LPs,  It has an AC adapter but I use a lot of watts   The battery lasts so long, that's a good thing.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device last week for my son as a Christmas present. The device was very nice, I think its the only one of that kind that comes with a sound card, but it was not connected to my sound system. I tried to set it up, but was not able to find the sound card connector. After I returned it, it was shipped back to me with no warranty. So, it is like the guy who bought it at a Goodwill. He was going to pay $10 for a brand new computer, so I was expecting him to do this, and then after reading all the reviews online about what bad reviews people had been giving the device, I asked him if he would recommend to me for someone else. He said no. I think the product should be refunded to the seller.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was not impressed with this tablet. I purchased this tablet for a variety of reasons. I wanted a full size Android tablet. This product did not satisfy my desires.   The screen is great, but the buttons on the side of the screen do not work well, and they are not very easy to get to. The display is great when viewed from a distance, but when you are using the tablet from your hand it gets very hard to use with a full grip.  There was no way I was using this on a desk at the coffee shop or in a meeting, and I would not recommend this to anybody. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased an AVR because I wanted the features that I saw on other models. But it took a very long time to set it up!   After the first time I plugged in the power cable, I thought it was dead!  The instructions say to unplug it and turn it back on, and nothing happened. Then I plugged it in again, but it refused to work.  After that I took it to my local Radio Shack and bought a $10 adapter to try to fix the problem, but the adapter didn't work either. After reading the comments on other reviews, I figured out the AVR had the wrong kind of power cord and I am now stuck with two cords with three different sizes.   It was also too large and took up too much room in the room.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this item because the other   cheaper   models I had had sound issues. I was pleased with this   item   until a few months   later   when I realized that the volume   wasn't the problem. The speaker   is great   but the problem   was the speaker cables.   After the initial troubleshooting of   this  product,   it   finally solved the   problem.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A horrible computer that will never be upgraded again.  The keyboard would be nice if it didn't use the same keys over and over again. ( I bought one and it was a pain trying to figure out where the keys were, when I put in the CD player it was so hard to use, I had to find keys on the back of the CD, and the CD drive is just not worth the effort. It also just sits there, and when it isn't being used it clanks and sounds like it's broken, it's just such a pain to use. )  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was looking for a small Bluetooth device to use with my iMac. I couldn't find one that would work for the price. So I got this to replace the $100 iMac bluetooth. The sound quality is pretty bad in comparison to my iRadio bluetooth but that is expected when it is Bluetooth. It comes with a USB cord so it can be used with computers. I would give it a negative if the sound quality were better. It would be more pleasant if there was no way to adjust the volume of the sound.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only good thing is the battery life, which is only 2 days with heavy usage, but then you must charge it every 2 days, which can be a pain with the crappy battery life.   Also, the only negative thing about this product is the lack of software customization (i have no idea why a $60 product doesn't have a few extra features) and the lack to connect the USB port with the computer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The audio quality is great!   But the software   that comes with it is awful.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was a very expensive and bulky device that took up more space then it was worth.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was my first Apple device and I'm glad I got one. I was happy with my previous purchase but the new iPod isn't really all that. I bought the iMac but that was an old model, so the new model is just a bigger iPod and not much else.      Incompetent design:  I bought this for $199 thinking the design would be better than the previous models but I was wrong. I tried to plug it in and it said "No Power to iPods" and it was very hard to get it to work. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I recently bought a new TV for my HDTV. This set was made in China, and I have not been impressed. It has been a hassle to get it connected to the Internet. Every time I try, I get a message from someone saying that there is a problem with the TV's wifi. After trying every other method and getting no results, I tried connecting to the internet with the tv's wi-fi, and got the same message. The remote control works okay, but it doesn't work as well with the remote than the tv itself. The audio quality of the TV is bad, but the sound is better with the wi- fi than with the old analog tv speakers. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The first time I bought this I thought it would just work and that the quality would not be affected at all. It did not. I have had my computer for over five years and this is the first time it has not worked well. I had to use the original battery for the first several hours of playing as it was too tight, then the replacement lasted about two hours, then I had problems.   It is the worst product I have ever purchased from this company. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device to replace my old, cheap plastic one that stopped working.  It arrived quickly, but the unit started smoking after only a few months.  Eventually it gave up the ghost and was returned to the store for a refund.   This is definitely a better price point and product, but it has to be in a very small (if any) box, not something that could fit in your pants pocket.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After installing my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 on my house, it began to work as intended, and then something went wrong and the phone would not turn on or connect to wifi.   Called Samsung customer service and the person on the phone said she couldn't repair it because I wasn't at home.  Samsung never responded to me after I made a complaint on this website.  I have a Samsung S3 and I can't say anything bad about it because it's working great. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the S5 and was excited for the S6's features, but was disappointed with the S4. The S5 is faster, but the S3 feels smoother and has a wider camera.  I still prefer the S2 and S3, but they have come so close to the S 4 in speed.  The S6 seems to be lacking the features I want out of a phone.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    When I bought this I was expecting an amazing gaming machine but I was so disappointed!

I'm sorry but I just don't recommend this to anyone considering its price and poor quality components.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I used to be a diehard Sony fan, but my new Sony S Converts had a hard time playing my older Sony CDs. So, I bought this and it's now playing my old music again. It's just so nice to have something small to take on the plane to Japan.    Good value, very good quality:  A good deal for $40. I'm glad I was able to find this product online for less than half the price I paid.  In my opinion, this product is not worth the price. I would have paid twice the price for a Sony S-convert to replace my old Sony S3. I used this to play music on my iPod for several years. When my iPod was destroyed by water damage, I ended up purchasing this device instead of my new S3, even though I had a different brand. Unfortunately, the quality of the audio is quite poor. It does not even remotely play my iPod music, nor does it have a tuner. I did some research and found this product to be sold on Amazon for $20 less than the MSRP. If you are only going to use this for your computer, then save your money and buy the S-CONvert instead.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product was junk. My kids could play the video games, but the controller and the power supply were in such poor shape that the power button would not work, and the joystick could only be used to rotate the video game in the video.   The control buttons on the bottom of the case have been broken, the power cord had several breaks, and on the side of the computer there was a broken plastic cover.  I tried to use the computer but it would not run.  There were other electronic problems with the controller but they were easy to repair, just bought a new one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've owned my Zune since its release back in 2007, and I had been using it for several years prior to that, as well as using my Sony Walkman for music listening. In the last couple years I've come to realize that I have to switch my music to this device. The Zune interface is not user friendly at all, and it is not intuitive. I am using this device as my main music player. I purchased this device to replace my Sony mp3 player as it was too big and awkward to use.  I was disappointed at first when I tried it out.  The Zunes are made of plastic and are hard to grip.  If you have ever used an iPod, you know what I mean.  Also, the speakers are pretty poor.  My only other complaint about the Zune is the fact that the MP3 players are made out of wood and are just a bit cheaper than the Zunes.

Very annoying that the screen would be off and not work with my keyboard so I went to an electronics store and was told it would be no problem to replace the screen. They charged me $50 and told me it would not take a week to ship. It didn't even take 2 weeks. Now the screen is back to normal.

I bought a cheap remote control that I always use.  However, this remote has a terrible mute button which is incredibly annoying.  It also has the same problems as the cheap remote. You have to constantly press the mute button to stop the TV from talking. I use an iPad.  This remote is a complete waste of money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a very good, if a bit pricy, wireless speaker and I am very glad I bought it. The fact that it is Bluetooth is a huge plus. I have my wireless speakers and headphones set up in my car as well but the speakers are very good. The sound is clear and there is not much distortion. The only thing I did not like was the fact that the button on the side of the device had to be pressed three times for it to turn on. The speaker is definitely good but the Bluetooth is definitely not, and that's a real bummer for someone who needs to charge it and want to be able to listen to music when it is powered up. Overall I'm very satisfied with this purchase.  Rated 3 out of 5 by bamw from Very Quiet, but does not do as good as I expected.  The sound quality of these speakers are amazing, but the volume is way to quiet and the Bluetooth volume is almost no louder than a cheapo radio. The wireless volume is just to loud for my liking, it's not nearly loud enough to enjoy music without someone else being around.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a Sonos play system and the installation was extremely difficult.   The Sonos instructions are terrible.  The problem is that the USB cable goes from the device into the hub, so all of the settings were lost.  I was not able to use the sound controls.  My music was playing fine, just not my sound.  Also, the Sonos is very sensitive to vibrations.  If I get the hub out of my way for a second and move my foot too close to the hub then the sound quality is affected.  Otherwise, it works great for a cheap $15 device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The problem is that the monitor only provides 1080P resolution, not the other two resolutions that the unit is supposed to support. The monitor is not compatible with an HDTV.    Rated 5 out of 5 by Joe G. from Very good. Very good and bright monitor. I've been using my laptop with the previous monitor as a secondary monitor on my main screen and I found that the contrast ratio and color depth was not as good as it should be. I needed a new monitor. As soon as I received this one I was very happy with it. The light and clear resolution is very good and you can now view the content without having to be so close to the monitor.  Review of DJI Mini Quadcopter - DYS 6DOF (2014) I bought the quadcopter because I was looking for a cheap way to get into aerial photography, something to make a quick video, or maybe for aerial work. I also just wanted to get some aerial videos up quick on my phone, which is all that the old drone I had was good for. I got the DJI Inspire 1. I am extremely impressed. I'm flying it in 3 dimensions (left, right, up) and it stays very stable. The range is really nice. The camera is fast and really good. I like the way it is able to shoot in a 3D space. It also has a lot of modes which is pretty cool. For those who aren't familiar with these types of quadcopters, the front facing camera gives you good video, especially for a price point like this. As far as how well the flight controller does, it does a good job. My only gripe about it is that it does not record flight details in 4k like my DJI Mavic does. Other than that, it is a good unit. I was also impressed by the quality of the videos. The sound is not very loud and it doesn't bother me. I have been using it for about a month now and I am still a bit in the learning stage. It is still very useful. It just does not do everything the Mavics do. The only thing I can complain about, is that I wish that they were easier to install. The instructions are easy enough but I wish they were more concise, like a one page manual instead of having to read about 10 pages to figure out what you are supposed to do.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This monitor has poor image quality. I had to remove the keyboard and use the mouse and I had issues with the trackball not working. This is the second computer I've bought and had problems. I bought it for $120 and I am not happy with the purchase.    I've had one of these for 5 years. This monitor is great. I've had nothing but great experiences with Logitech products. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this as my first computer, and I'm glad I did. I purchased it to do some programming on it.   It works well for the price, but the monitor is terrible.  It uses the same type of LCD panel as my old, cheap computer monitor, but it is not that bright, and it's not easy to see the different color codes on the screen. The other issue is that there is no way to connect the controller to the computer. This would have been fine for what I wanted to do, but I'm really looking for a way to make sure that I can turn this on.  I really hope that this will be updated with a newer LCD screen, so I can be happy with the product, but that doesn't seem to be in the future, so at this point I'm just going to go ahead and return it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only good thing about this piece of hardware is that it has a micro USB port which is good for transferring pictures and files on my computer. However, the design was a pain because it's impossible to put the phone into the charger without unscrewing the back cover of the case. There is no way to charge it while it's in the case, so I had to remove and reattach the case after each time I wanted to use it. Overall, this product is a great idea, but I don't think it was done right.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After a few years of use, the volume knob in the iPod gets annoying. It turns out to be the only thing that really breaks the magic of owning a compact disc player. I bought a cheap Chinese iPod (the old style), because of the cost. It has worked fine until now, but I bought another one just so I could use it for the first time. The last time I used the iPod, it made a popping sound and was noisy as hell. I also noticed that my music would sometimes not play, even though the device is still connected. This time, I had no problem connecting it to the computer and then getting it to play. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this after my iPhone was lost or stolen. I was concerned about a new Apple device but was really excited about a great device that I wouldn't have to buy an expensive new iPhone to get my music.   After using the device for a few days, I was a bit disappointed that there was no way to transfer my music to my other phone and that it didn't allow me to listen to music on the phone.  I'm disappointed because I really like the product and the music is great, but I would never recommend this device to anyone

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is one of the worst purchases I have made.   The device is ok but the sound is very weak and I cant use it to my satisfaction.  I have the sound volume set to 100% and have found that the sound on the iPod is not great. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Purchased a new desktop monitor a few years ago to replace my aging CRT, but it was way too small. Bought this for my other desktop, but the monitor is far too small to do any gaming or anything. If you're going to use a monitor, it should be at least a 23" (maybe 27"), not this.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A couple of years ago I bought this stereo-system from Amazon because I saw it recommended on TV. I ordered it online and was excited to finally get a stereo system that sounded decent. However, I have to agree that the sound is very lacking. I couldn't understand what the artist was saying in the CD, I didn't know if the CD was the original vinyl or if I needed to buy a new one. However this didn't matter because I never want to buy another CD anymore. I just wanted to listen to my stereo system. So I went to Best Buy to order a new CD and a used CD player. But Best Buy doesn't sell used CDs. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these earphones as an upgrade from my original headphones. After listening to them for about 2 hours or so, the bass was extremely over-stated and distorted.   The bass on these earbuds is pretty good for the price point, but these cans need a lot more bass output to sound like proper subwoofers.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only thing I would suggest for an iPod is to take out the headphones and turn it to the left or the right to better hear the music.    As the headphone jack is on the bottom side, the volume is way to low and the sound is very bad.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was an extremely disappointing purchase.   I needed an MP3 player for home, but couldn't justify buying one with an interface that was slow, limited, and difficult to use.  With the purchase of this unit I purchased, I received one that wasn't even connected to a music source.  It was still connected to the network but wouldn't play music.  I emailed them to tell them that it was faulty and they told me to wait for it to get fixed.  This took a long time and I was told it would be the end of their 3 month warranty.  All I get is a one month warranty as well as shipping it to me.  Not worth the trouble at all.

That being said, the speakers also sound terrible.  The CD player plays CDs, but only in MP3 format.  Also, the CD is hard to read even in that format.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very disappointed in the sound quality and overall performance of this device. I bought this to have my wife hear me read the newspaper while I work from my computer.   The quality of the sound is not good and the speakers are very poor.  It takes about half a minute to get a good sound.  The volume is very low and you have to put headphones in to hear the sound. The computer on the back is not very powerful.  A lot of the time I would have to wait a minute or two for my computer to start up or do something when I wanted to do something.  This is not a good product.

They seem very well-built, though the older one, the one with the screen, has a small bend to the back.  The newer one, however, has no such blemishes.  It's definitely bigger and heavier, but still easy to set up.  When my younger son plays with a computer, he's able to hold it and use it without any assistance.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing I noticed about this unit is that it's loud. You're not going to hear the speakers over your music, and while it doesn't cause any problems with my speakers, it is kind of loud.   When I plugged this unit into a Bluetooth device it was barely able to play the music (it sounded like it was playing a very compressed version of it), and when I used it in my car it only worked to play a few songs.  I have a lot of devices that use Bluetooth that have better audio capabilities.

I tried the original iPhone charger, which charges at a faster rate, but it only charges one hour. I've seen more people on the internet that have the same problem as me.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this for my daughter's birthday present. I wanted her to have a compact phone that was small and easy to take with her. Unfortunately, she has problems reading a large screen, especially if she is sitting in front of a large TV. She ended up with a large and very bright screen and is very frustrated by the size of the screen, as well as the fact that the phone is so small.   The only way I am able to see out of the phone's screen is to lean in so that the earpiece is directly behind me and I can't see what is on the other side. I don't think a cell phone is meant to be that large for a teenager. I have an older Samsung model that is much better made and a lot lighter. I bought this phone because I thought it would be a good compromise for my family but I am very disappointed with it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My computer is terrible. I had been using my laptop for a few months before it died.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The best part of this is that it takes a lot of time and it sucks all your batteries at the same time. Also, the design is awful as it is, I'm sorry but the plastic is not that durable and the speakers make a really annoying whining sound. This is a good for when you only have 2 or 3 hours of battery, but otherwise not worth it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the HP Elite x3, which I thought would be a great value because it's cheap. I'm very happy with my purchase but unfortunately, the laptop has a number of problems. First, it's hard to turn off when you're not in use, especially with the Touch Bar. Second, the keyboard is very unresponsive, and if you have to touch the mouse, the mouse just won't respond to you. Third, it has a very poor battery life: 6 hours and 30 minutes, and I'm not sure why. And finally, there's a bug where it's impossible to put the screen on when the battery is low, and a few hours of screen-on time is all it takes to kill the battery.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this in January. I was very disappointed in the quality. The screen was very poorly lit, the unit was very heavy, and I can't see how this thing would stand up to heavy use.    Rated 4 out of 5 by Miho from Good, but... I bought this product a month ago and so far so good. This has a lot of ports and has been very easy to use. However, I'm having problems with the USB ports, I have not been able to charge this device as it can't power the USB devices I plug into the USB. Also, it's noisy.  Review of DJI Phantom 3 Standard Quadcopter from Phantom 3 Professional $2,899.00 I got the Phantom 3 Quadcopters for my GoPro and X4 for my Canon G7x. It is awesome. The quality is great and the flight time is incredible. But they come with a lot and are expensive. The 2 batteries can hold a lot.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've had the iMac for about 3 years now. It works fine on my PC but is a bit slow on my laptop (i7-2600k with 16gb ram, no SSD, 1tb hdd). I've also had an iMac before (the previous model). It ran at 3x the speed of the current one. I had to spend $200 on an iBook and get the new one. Overall, this is a quality product but at this price range, I expect it to be much better.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Brienne from Very Good I purchased this monitor as soon as it was available. After reading all of the negative reviews, I didn't think I would like it as much as I do. I've used a few different monitors in my time but this one is definitely the best out there. My only criticism is that it comes with the only 3 year warranty. Not a big deal to me but to others, it may be. It's also not included in the box, which is a slight inconvenience for me. But the monitor is beautiful and I have no complaints.    Rated 3 out of five by Tom R. from Pretty good monitor, but a tad pricey... I've been using an older AMD Radeon X1950XT for several years. It has served me well, and this new 27" monitor has been a great upgrade. The performance has been great as well. I'm not a gamer, but this is more than enough for casual gamers and those looking for a good gaming screen. The built quality is great, especially with the glossy black finish. The only downside I've seen so far is that the colors are washed out at the lower end, and the contrast isn't as good as some of the higher-end screens. That said, I'm just hoping that it has the same resolution as the X1950 so it can provide better performance than the X1800XT.  the 27" XGA panel is a nice improvement over the old standard 17" LCD, especially the 1ms response time. The lack of a 4k display unfortunately means I won't be using the display for gaming at all, even with the upgrade. Still, I like the sleek design and the built in speakers.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have this thing, I really need it, but I've used it like a dumb phone for the last year and it hasn't improved anything. The volume doesn't seem to work properly for anything, the screen has that annoying scratchy look to it (and a crack where the button used to be) and it is very hot and you get the feeling that you're holding a microwave oven while you're using it. Also, it seems like this phone will die with the battery low and that I would have to go out and buy another if I want to use it for anything longer than a few minutes.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a cheap device to replace my old Dell machine. It was horrible. The keypad wouldn't work on most keys, and the display was very bad. The only way to get the keypad to work was to put the battery in and plug the USB cable into a powered USB hub. There was a big red mark on the screen for when the battery died. I have since tried several brands of mice and no matter how good they are I just can't get my fingers to type on these bad mice.

I had bought this tv so I could finally get my music in the living room without using my car stereo.   For being a "beautiful" tv, it's pretty lousy in sound. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just bought this because of the "great" reviews and I was very disappointed.  The sound was really bad and the volume was almost too loud. It doesn't even have an XLR jack so it couldn't get an extension cord to my receiver. I'm using my Audio Technica AT-LP120s so that might be why the sound was so bad. I was going to get this but since they are on sale I'm glad I didn't.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's a great gadget and comes with several apps on it. However, the battery doesn't last very long. In order to avoid charging it twice, I have to unplug it from the wall to put it in the charger. I'd recommend buying a battery charger 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The buttons are too small for my hands and are often in a bad position. They can be turned so they are facing me but with this much effort, it just feels like a hassle. I'm also pretty sure the buttons are not fully backlit, so I have to hold the device over a light source in order to see the text, which is a bummer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought two of these devices a while back. I was really excited to try them out, but I've been disappointed so many times. I bought the 1.8 inch and 1.5 inch, but both were defective in some way, as was my original purchase. They had a tiny crack or ding where the little spring meets the metal. Then one of the pieces had a metal bolt that got stripped from the socket on the end of the piece, so it would never go back together correctly. This is a very cheap way to have your phone fall apart on you. They were also too heavy, so the screen would bend back and forth, making the phone difficult to use. I'm currently looking for a replacement (I have a lot of stuff laying around). 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I just bought this one as a replacement for an older one, but the battery lasted 2-3 days.  It has the usual issues with the battery.  One day it was fine, and the next, the screen would get really bright, but then would go blank.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The old laptop that I used to work on had a terrible hard drive. It would take a month or two for me to load my work files and then be stuck with junk data.   It was horrible and had to be thrown out.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I am very disappointed with this.   It is so slow when trying to do anything that the sound isn't that good.  The mouse is very cheap and flimsy.  I think the fact that the mouse is made of plastic makes it less durable.  It would be nice if they would make them out of metal so that it would last longer.  In the end I will probably throw it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was very unhappy with the product, even though the features were all there. The problem is that I can't even use it because the batteries run out in a few months. The touchpad can't keep up with my fast fingers. It is also noisy and slow when writing.  Rated 3 out of 5 by Anonymous from Not great I have a Samsung Series 7 550 in my iPad Mini 2 that I use for music. However, my laptop battery died last week. My old laptop was just about to die, and I was so upset that I gave it up. But after checking the Samsung website, they said I should be able to have the same computer with the same battery with a new battery. I tried it on and it was an even bigger deal. I didn't buy it because I thought it would be a good laptop, but because I really wanted the same batteries that I was on my previous laptop with. I was wrong. The Samsung was a huge disappointment. I will be purchasing a new laptop in the future, and my expectations are very low. "Great value" I used this for about a month and I am very happy with it. It has nice quality with a great warranty (I bought a new MacBook Pro with similar features and didn't get a replacement). I also love the fact that it doesn't come with the hard drive. It saves me some space. I have only used it on my home network and haven't needed the extra space.  is it a good buy for the price? This is a great portable computer. I used it at the school and it does a lot. It can do everything that a laptop can do. It supports Windows, OS X, and Linux. It comes with 3 months of free updates. The only bad thing I have is that it is not the same price as the MacBook or the MacBook Pro. It's the same as a low-end Macbook but the keyboard is horrible, and it has no optical drive. I wouldn't recommend this to someone who is trying to buy their first laptop, I don't think they should go for this product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I first got the iPad, I was really excited. I used to have an older Apple computer, and I was sad to see it go. This thing is so great!    It's small, and it's portable.   Unfortunately, the speakers are very tinny. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Very good for its price, but the sound is way off.  The sound is very good, but its like a very cheap CD player. So for the price it's very good. However, the quality and sound is not good, so if you have a good set of speakers, this one is not for you. I was a happy customer because the product was shipped to my country in a very fast manner.   Great Sound for the Price   The sound quality is good enough for me, I do wish the cord and connectors came in a longer length but overall its a great sound quality for the cost.  I would recommend this product to a friend if they're in the market for a cheap player, but also because it's a decent sound quality, it's not one of the better ones out there.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When it works, the unit is great but the software is terrible and the fact that the display isn't multi-touch is a deal breaker.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had purchased a new keyboard (with Apple Keyboard) and it was very bad.   There were all kinds of issues.  I sent it back to Apple and got a brand new one.  That being said, I had it for about one month and then it just stopped working.  It would only do one thing, and that one thing was taking power.  If you need the power to get things done, this one is not for you.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I own the Yamaha CLD2000. After owning and playing the Yamaha GX900 and Yamaha G5, I found myself more and more attracted to the CLD. It had a better sound than the GX and a nicer control. But after I installed the CL.2000, I realized that it was more than just a change in sound. I had to change my attitude about this little device. The controls are nice and the sound is good but the CL has a hard time picking up and holding the right notes. I've found the CL to be a great deal if you don't know what you're doing. But it has a strange habit of not playing at all for minutes at a time and you can't get it to work. You have to get it working at a decent speed to play anything but the lowest notes. In the end, it's a pretty good little computer and the Yamaha controls are excellent. If you want an excellent compact stereo or a small but decent computer then you should consider this.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this unit with the goal of using it in my home theater and having it work well. But the fact is it worked perfectly in my TV room for a month, then I noticed it was making the same noise over and over again. I thought maybe I needed to reset the device or something but the unit would not shut off the noise. I have a nice stereo system but it is very noisy. The noise was gone when I turned the unit off but the noise returned after I turned it back on. So, unless it is not working well and I need to have it fixed, I wouldn't purchase this product. I purchased this from Best Buy because I figured it was going to work. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product was a piece of garbage, and when it was delivered, the label was covered with dried up plastic.

I have always used the remote for the TV and I thought that was the problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this laptop with the intention of using it as a secondary computer for a personal project. I used it for about 5 days and then discovered a security flaw that made it unusable. I was unable to log in to my work account using the laptop and the USB hub also did not work. I contacted Lenovo about the problem but was told it is a known issue. I also contacted ASUS and they told me it is not a big deal since their laptops do the same thing.   It has been very frustrating to use and expensive in the long run.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This was a great gift for my dad, I was very surprised that I got a new model, I am a huge fan of his, but the software was really sloppy and would sometimes randomly reboot. Not to mention, there was no way to turn off or shut off the printer. This is very frustrating because when I have a computer with a similar type, this is the only one that worked in my house, so I was pretty upset. The product is definitely worth the price though.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The computer was very slow. We had to use a thumb drive as the data was not transferable.   We have been going to this company for several years but the last computer had to be returned as it wouldn't read.   Rated 5 out of 5 by K.K from Excellent Computer - great customer service I bought this PC a few years ago and had a few issues. I ended up with the computer sitting on the bench for a few months because I didn't know that I needed to take it back to the store to get a replacement (I had used it as a laptop at home and it was fine). Now, I just bought a new PC and I decided to get the Apple one instead of the Asus because of the Apple customer service. After the repair was complete, I sent the laptop to Apple for warranty replacement and it took them about 2 weeks to get back to me. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this company!  Good buy This machine works as it should. It has a solid frame that holds up. The keyboard works well and is easy to type on. The screen is good quality, however, when you do play games it gets a bit dim. This computer runs a lot of software. It can be upgraded.  Very pleased with the purchase! This is my first computer purchase and the Apple system is a great choice. The only thing I'm not too impressed with is the size. The computer does not come with a case, so I ordered one off of Amazon. However, even though it's only about the size of a CD case, it feels really bulky compared to a laptop. The warranty is excellent. All the technicians I've worked with are very nice and responsive. The sound system is really nice and the screen is bright. I'm still a bit hesitant about the weight of this computer. I purchased the 2GB of RAM and I can't wait to test it out.  I'm very pleased with this computer, especially the sound system and screen. My only issue with it is that it's a little on the pricey side for what it is. .

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This device works very well and only has a few problems.   There is no screen in the unit, which means that it is a bit awkward to use.

The controls on the unit are good and the menu system is easy to use with the option for adjusting the volume on the remote.  It is just a shame that the unit is so big. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    After having one of the first models of this I have been very disappointed. It is very slow and is not powerful enough for the video I wanted to record. If I ever decide to get a newer model, this will not be it    Nice and reliable product.  I use this to power my camera and record videos with a DSLR. It works great. Only two things I would change about it are: 1) if I ever need to remove it from my computer to clean it, it is very difficult to do so without damaging it.  2) the cable that the HDMI input goes to is very hard to remove. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item with the intention of replacing the internal speakers on my stereo.  But, the sound was horrible.   It was also a pain to get the wires plugged in to the speaker cables, especially with the small size of the cable.  It also took forever to turn on/off.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The thing I didn't like about this keyboard was the poor build quality. This keyboard uses rubber, which is not a very good material for a mechanical keyboard.

The keyboard itself is very solid and the switches feel nice to press and they respond nicely.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device for home use and was very disappointed.   It does not have a memory function.  I had been using it in my computer for about 3 years at my regular job, which also uses a desktop PC.  The power cord was a little weak.  It has no CD-ROM drive either.  While it does allow for an external CD-Rom drive, the CD's are only in 1.8-inch format which has little room for songs and videos.  There is no modem included either.    The other problem with this machine is the cost.  You get a good computer with a good case but the price is ridiculous.  If you use the internet on your own then the price to buy the machine and a modem and a CD-R and internet connection is about $120.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The power button on this phone is the first to go in my house.   My only other phones that I've had worked with a single button.  The only way to turn it on is to hold down the Power button and the phone goes into standby mode, which is fine if you have a laptop at home or work, but if you don't, the screen turns off, and all the lights in the house turn off.  I would not buy this product again 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have a HP laptop and I bought this as a replacement. I had been using my iBook with the wireless card for a few months and it stopped working when I tried to download a movie from YouTube. The iBook has a built in wireless card that has worked for me since the 90s and I had hoped this one would be better. It is not. The bluetooth functionality is buggy, doesn't work on a regular connection and you can't use it if you don't have the latest firmware update. This one is an absolute waste of money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It works but has a few bad points.  I bought the bluetooth version and the first thing it did was crash while searching for a game.  The bluetooth works, but if you don't have a headset it's really annoying.  Also it has only 2 USB ports, 1 for the battery and 1 for your usb device.  Very disappointed because it's pretty good for $150.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After buying the Sony Walkman, I was impressed that they included the extra battery.  I didn't really use it that much but still, I thought I would replace the battery with one that I could charge from the included wall adapter.  But the Sony battery is only about 6 months old and the wall adapter I found on ebay was over $10 (that I don't remember the price)   I've had the Walkman for a year and a half now and I'm beginning to think the extra charge is a gimmick and the battery just isn't good enough.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The quality of the device is good, but the buttons are difficult to use and are constantly jostling with each other. This makes the device cumbersome to use, which is not at all what I expected from a Bluetooth device.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this machine because I wanted a more portable device. I've had a couple of these devices, and I was very disappointed. First off, the design is crap. It's a piece of shit. It doesn't fit easily in my hands and requires a ton of force to use. If I use the keyboard and mouse at all, I'm just going to have to carry this thing around with me. The USB port is also too far away from my laptop to use with my peripherals, like a mouse or USB drives. It would be better to put an SD card reader somewhere on the back so I could stick an SD with media files on it in, but the thing looks like a piece off a toy that should be thrown out. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this after searching high and low for a replacement for my laptop but couldn't find one in my price range.   It is pretty good but I feel the USB slot could be bigger and a bit more useful.     The only way to charge the device is using a micro usb power bank, but even then it requires a power cord as well.  I am looking for a way to power my phone from this device as well but don't have a cord to plug it in. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this keyboard and the case for my PC back in 2012 and had it for almost two years.   It's fine in certain situations but the keyboard itself feels like it's going to break down at any time.  The casing and keys are a little thin and cheap but it's still a nice and sturdy keyboard that is pretty good quality.  I bought this keyboard to replace a mechanical one and this thing is better than it would've been.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've used this device for almost a year and love it. I'm a college student with limited space, and a lot of my stuff (school, work and things on my desk) has to be organized into a few folders so I can find what I need quickly. I do my research and organize my stuff. I use this to organize my folders so when I need to find what is needed in a hurry I know where to find it. My only wish is that it came with a couple of extra USB ports, but overall I've had a good experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was expecting more out of a high end product, but this one disappoints. The device works well but has issues like the screen will not turn on, the speaker will not work or turn on when I press the button to the right of it (not sure if it is an issue with the device or just the driver). I have bought a few products that have a different color or feel to them but this is the first device that has had so many flaws on the inside.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the wireless hub a year ago. This month I decided to go with the wired option. Not only was the wireless a pain, but it was also so slow. My family is very happy with my wireless router, but I just don't like the idea of paying an extra $40/month for wireless. I can only imagine how slow it would be if I had to use the wall.    Good product, poor installation:  The hub seems to be well made and has worked well for us so far. The installation of the router was very easy and we had it up and running the first night.  We are going to have to buy another one of these for our home office, though, as the original one has had some issues. We've had one go out and the other one that came with the router fail on us. Hopefully this one will last longer.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I recently received my LG V20 and I absolutely love it.   It was one of the first devices to support Google Assistant so it's always been a "must have" item.  My only complaint is that the screen and build quality feels a little cheap.  This doesn't have to be a deal breaker for most people, just something to be aware of when choosing a device. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product doesn't work. I have used this product, in the same way it works, in my home for about 5 years and it never had an issue. It has no problem with the power cord or with the usb. I use the cable for my phone and laptop (both of which work fine) and it works perfectly. I thought maybe a "hardware replacement" for a different computer was available for this model, but it doesn't seem so. The cable is a shame, because I would be happy to give the product 5 stars, but the product itself is not up to par with my expectations.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was really excited to get this piece. The quality of the box is perfect. The item was well packed. The packaging is easy to use and the product works well. The product is just not as powerful as a lot of the other options. Also, the color of the unit is not that great. I would rather pay extra for something that would be more powerful.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My wife and I purchased these for Christmas but had to return them because the battery died during the first night use. We had used these to power our PC for a month before and loved them. We have since replaced our laptop with one from Dell so these are useless for that.  Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from Worst I bought these for a project that was supposed to last 1 month and I found that the batteries died after about a month or so of use. They were cheap so I bought another set. The batteries had already lost some juice. This is the worst case scenario I can think of that the battery would have run out on a set that was supposedly going to last a month. I will never buy these again and will only buy from other stores. I hope you find a better quality battery

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've been using this for awhile and I had problems with it a few times. Once when the power cord plugged in, the power went out. The unit would then stop working, but I had to wait 5-10 minutes until it would restart. Sometimes there's no battery. I've got a lot of games on there and sometimes the battery wouldn't last the whole game.  Also, this thing is not very durable. One time I left it in my car for 3 hours. It wouldn't even start it up.  Overall, this is a bad unit for the money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit is extremely old and slow. I used to have a PC on a laptop before, so I knew exactly what was needed to get up and running on a computer. This is a much bigger pain in the ass! The display and buttons don't even work as they should. The touch screen only works with a stylus. It takes much longer to connect to the network because it just takes an extra second to do so. This thing is so old, I'll probably be looking for another computer once I get this one.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Excellent Product! This product is as advertised. I was a little nervous about purchasing this particular computer, but it was worth the price. I did have to call customer service to make sure my issue was corrected. The service representative was helpful and pleasant. The installation process was straight forward. My only complaint is I wish there were more memory cards available at this price.  in addition to the two internal and two external memory slots, the unit comes with two mSATA ports, a couple of USB ports, and two Firewire "hot slots" (one for external devices and the other for internal). It comes with a one year warranty. It's been running perfectly for several months without any issues.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this monitor and it has only one thing going for it and that is that it works and looks like it is a good monitor   It is a decent screen, but has some annoying problems   The first problem is that in both of my monitors I found it difficult to tell when I was in the middle of the picture because of all the colors it is showing, so it makes me think it's a bad picture   Second is that the input lag from the monitor is horrible. It takes so long for it to even start to move. I have a normal computer and even if I press down hard to see what's on screen, it doesn't even turn on the monitor for about 5 seconds, so I think this is just a cheap monitor that has problems 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It took me 5 months to finally get a working computer.   The last one I bought did not work, so i decided to go to Best Buy   and see if i could buy this one at a cheaper price.  I waited 5 months for a new computer, which took a long time.  Then i decided i did not want to wait and got this one.  When it finally turned on it had the same problem as all the other computers i've bought.  So, i went back to Bestbuy and they gave me the computer at half price.    I can't believe i wasted time on this.

I have the old Apple TV which plays video games and just about everything else you can imagine.  This was not cheap, so I bought it for the video game console.  It has a really low resolution, especially when compared to my old Apple.  I had hoped that it would be better because of the video games, but it's still just an inferior TV.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is my second Macbook Air.   I originally bought this from Amazon for $399 when they were on sale.  The keyboard is nice.  It's got an extremely sharp screen.  However, it has two problem, namely, the display is completely dead when the battery is low, and the trackpad is useless.  A friend of mine bought this as a gift.  When the batteries start to get low he takes the machine out, plugs in a new one, and it works fine.  But it wouldn't do anything with the trackpads, so he ended up going back to the one he had.  Now, he just buys the model with a refurbished battery.  I also have the original keyboard, but it's horrible and you can't press the buttons.  At any rate, the machine is not cheap and you should really get one you like.

I have a   MacBook Pro but it   is pretty fast so   it would be a very slow laptop   if it could keep up with my   work.  It   also   gets   hot if I sit too long.  (If you are going to buy it make sure you   can keep it off the table with your feet.)
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    These things are overpriced and flimsy. The only good thing is that they don't work if you run out of batteries.   I used to have this on all the time until I got this   replacement   but it's so flimsy that I can't even tell if it's wired or not.  I still have a very similar old one, but I hate the smell. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When it comes to portable music players, the Rokit X1 and Rokidox X1 are the best.  The buttons are easy to find and to use, the controls are easy, and the controls for the Rolodox are similar to the one on the iPod.  They both have very good bass response, and when I listen to music on them, I can usually tell that I am listening to it on an iPod or an MP3 player.  But both these players can be a bit noisy.  One thing I have noticed, though, is that I feel much more comfortable playing my music with the Riolodox than I do with the X1.  My ears can't take as much of a pounding as the X-treme is able to give them.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The battery lasted only one month so I replaced it with a new one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This laptop is so poorly built that after 2 days of use, my keyboard stopped working.   My mouse would randomly freeze up, and the touchpad froze up too.  The sound card does not work, the battery life is horrible, and all the keys are too small.  I recommend this laptop to anyone who needs a portable but still powerful computer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I used an apple computer for about 6 years. I can say that it does not hold up. The display does not work. The sound is very bad. The keyboard is terrible.   It should have never got out of the box. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The quality of the speakers was good. The sound quality was not. The speakers did not have the high frequencies you'd expect to find in an audio system. The sub woofer was not very loud either, nor did it project a large sound stage. I have listened to a lot of headphones and it's always nice to listen to music through the speakers.   This product is excellent. I had to return it because the unit would not turn on. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There is a small fan on the side which was just enough to blow the dust off the screen.  The only issue I had with this unit is that it takes too long for the sound to start playing.  There are some problems that can be fixed if you have a good quality amp that is used on a sound system.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It is difficult to replace the LCD screen in the computer because the screen is not designed to be replaced. When I want to change the LCD and it has been more than a year, the screen does not come with the cover. I bought a replacement but had to pay for shipping, so I returned the whole thing. I can tell it is difficult replacing a broken LCD but it is still a nice computer.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The batteries for my phone died two days ago. The phone is just too big and too heavy to carry with me everywhere. I will not be buying another Apple device.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this as a portable player and to be fair, it's great. However, the battery life is terrible, I have tried all the tricks in the book to get more hours of usage, nothing works, my battery has nearly died and I am really pissed off about this. I bought this so I can use my iPod without using my phone and now I can't even do that because my battery dies so fast I have to replace it every few months, which is really expensive and I really should have just bought another battery. This product doesn't belong in my music collection and should be returned to the store I bought it from.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the first product I have bought from this company, and the quality is very good, but the battery has an issue, in that the power button starts to go dead after an hour or so. The power button on the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch can be pressed a few times to re-set the battery. However, not the Samsung. Not the Samsung is dead after about 6 hours of usage and after a few weeks of constant use, the battery is dead again, and it is only after the battery gets very hot in the pocket that it finally shuts off.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this TV after seeing all the positive reviews and I was hoping for a quality product. Unfortunately, I find that it is very flimsy. I had to use a screwdriver to make it go.  The stand is really cool, but the TV seems to be on the weak side. I tried to mount it on a wall, but I couldn't get it to stay put.  I would recommend this TV for a first time user. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I'm not a very tech-savvy guy, but I used the Apple iphone 4 because I couldn't find a iphonelike computer that was as compact as the iphones. But I bought this iphono cartridge and it was way overpriced and the sound was crap.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had a problem with my Sony Bravia TV for 4 years. I finally called Sony and they told me that they will repair my TV or replace it and then charge me $200.00. I told them that I could not afford that and it was costing me a lot of money. I would never buy a Sony product again.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It worked, and it was easy to install and use.   The problem was that once the software was installed, the screen would randomly switch from black to white every couple of minutes, forcing me to take it off and on again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It took me forever to get my wireless router to work. I used the store-bought version and they eventually gave up and replaced it with this one.   I don't recommend this router to anyone.  The quality of the product is great but the customer service wasn't either. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It works, the USB port has two wires coming from the back, it looks cool, and it does play CDs. However, the problem is that when you put the cd in, the volume control starts to skip and you have to turn the volume back up, which is annoying and takes up space.  I was very disappointed with this product because it looks great but is a poor performer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I had the original LG dm8 which i love and i still have. The problem is that the touch screen starts dying after 2 years, so i am going to have to buy a new one. Not a huge deal. I got this one as a replacement, and i'm not sure how well it works.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought these speakers on a hunch that they might be useful and the box is very nice.  The only real complaint that I have is that the speakers are a bit louder than my home speakers.  That being said, they are great for listening to music and have excellent sound quality. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It worked great for about a year. It became defective and it has become unusable. The keypad no longer works. This is the third time I have bought this keypad from Best Buy. I have returned it three times because it broke.  I hope that the store doesn't do it's job and charge me for the return.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this product with a very low expectation and am not sure I made the right choice.   The problem is that the unit does not always lock up from the remote when I press the power button.  The remote also is difficult to control when you do press the button. After trying to correct this on several occasions, I ended up buying the D-Link. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I own two of these. The first one works perfectly and doesn't have any problems. However, the second one, which was purchased from a reputable retailer, stopped working a few weeks ago.   It is a very expensive piece of technology, but I am not buying it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have a Sony Bravia SZ9-C1. I have always purchased Sony Bravias and have been happy with them. The SZ series has always been high quality and reliable. However, the latest model I purchased does not work properly. It has issues with the volume buttons not working, and the sound coming in loud and out softly. In addition, the screen on it constantly cuts out on me, with no apparent reason. It's a shame because I would have really liked to use it to play a game on my Xbox 360, or do something I haven't been able to do on my PS3.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This item is not as advertised and has several small flaws. First of all, the cord isn't in the right place to plug into the device. I had to push it a little to get the plug in the proper place. Second, when I first plugged this into my tv, I had a really annoying buzzing sound as the cords moved from the socket to the tv. When I turned the sound down, the noise was still there. The noise also comes from all directions and isn't constant. It is not a good quality product.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPod is no longer in production and it is too heavy to hold on to when plugged into the computer.   I have to carry around the original iPod for my music.  It was good while it lasted, but now that it is no more, I want a new one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this after seeing the reviews and was expecting a good product. It isnt a good quality product and I'm very disappointed with the quality and service. I ordered this with the expectation that it would be a great piece of music gear but it isnt. It takes 3 1/2 years to get any sort of return on my money so that is disappointing.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been looking for a good wireless keyboard for a long time. The ones I have had so far were just terrible. I finally decided to buy one of these instead. It worked just fine until it started acting up recently. It is supposed to have a one-year warranty but so far it is just a worthless piece of junk. It has a built in eraser, but no eraser eraser. It even has a small eraser key that the eraser doesn't have. It doesn't do much better than the cheap ones out there.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I used this product to make a couple of songs, but the problem was the battery life. I would usually get about 20-30 minutes out of it.  I bought this to play on my computer and I have a hard time getting through the tracks I just made, especially the ones that require a lot of sound editing.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this in hopes of saving me the money on a new computer. Instead, I have a total mess and I hate it. I wanted a computer that I could keep clean and working. The screen and speakers are horrible. I just can't use it. It is so slow, the keyboard is hard to type on, and the memory is terrible. I hate this little computer. I would have gotten a better one if I had known what I was getting. I am going to have to go through every part of my old computer to see if there is a piece of memory that is working and can be removed.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first I used on my PC, the keyboard took up too much of the screen area and it was very noisy and noisy and very annoying. The second I used it on my new MacBook Pro, it works well. It's nice to have the space for a mouse, and there's even a USB hub built into the mouse. It does take a little getting used to, but it is a great keyboard replacement, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a great, full sized keyboard with a great feel and look.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The quality of the unit is good, the sound is great, but the unit isn't as easy to use as I would like. It doesn't have all the buttons, and there's no "push" feature. The main buttons on the unit are located in the back, and they are very difficult to push when wearing gloves. I would prefer if it had a push on the front of the power switch like most other units. Other than that, the unit works well and I really enjoy my old iPod. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It's terrible - terrible    I got this about a month ago and had to return it as I was getting sick of the poor audio quality and the fact that it was so slow to start up and would run off the wall if I pressed a button twice.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device as part of a group buy that included an apple TV, an apple watch, a vino, a ipod, and two apple laptops. I bought the ipod because I want to play a game on the ipad. The ipod does not play a video that I want. There are only a few video sources that I can play.   The apple watch is a good looking watch, but the screen is small, and the only way to see the time is by looking at the watch face.  A few of the others, the vino has a small screen, and I have had to look at the screen to see what time it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It has been less than 2 years since I had an original Dell Powerbook T-300. While I liked the power, the design and performance weren't the best.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is my 2nd laptop from the brand, and both of them are absolutely junk.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It took me forever to find a quality portable charger that would fit my mobile phone. Then I discovered the iOo. This little gadget does everything a charger needs to. It charges my phone (my iPhone 5) and it can also power my camera.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is a horrible piece of gear.  I replaced it the same day that I bought it.  Now, the device has started to act up.  It randomly stops working, or starts working again on the next charge.   I've been told that this is a standard issue problem with this product and will be fixed when it gets fixed, but it has never occurred since I purchased it.     The fact that the unit is built in to the wall unit and requires the use of a wall outlet to power it is really disappointing.  As a business owner and a parent, I'd rather my business spend that money on better things. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I used to have a pair of the original Game Boy's, and the Game Boy Advance was my first true gaming system. However, the GBA does nothing to improve the system. Everything is either a bit clunky or too buggy, and its screen just isn't worth the hassle. You can play games on the console, but there's no joy in seeing an old game in black and white.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this because I've read good reviews about this product and thought it was a great idea. It came with the headphones and I plugged them in and used them for 2 months. I got the 8GB flash drive that came with them. I had to buy the 5GB usb version on amazon (the 7GB is free with the flash drive) because I needed it for the phone and to sync the USB to my computer. When the first phone I used these for died the usb memory was full so I had a lot of difficulty finding new phones. This was the first time I bought an item and they worked well but I wanted to use them for more than 2 months but they died on me before I could sync them to my phone. This is a good idea to sell you can buy them but you are going to pay for that 5gb. I did buy the 8gb flash drive and the 4gb usb because it was cheaper.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only thing that would've made this product a 5 is if they made the cable more comfortable to use. I had to wear a bra to use this unit. The unit works fine. I just wish they would put in a couple of more features. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The screen is very easy to read, but the picture is terrible and the screen auto rotate does not work.   No matter how much you turn, there is always a little gap where the screen would be. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the first gen of this bluetooth speaker for my car and it didn't work. The second gen worked fine. After 2 weeks I gave up and bought the first generation for my phone. That's when I discovered that bluetooth was not compatible with my iPhone. I spent the next 3 weeks troubleshooting to figure out why I couldn't connect to my phone and trying everything I could think of. I thought it might be the new firmware or my phone, but I was unable to get the same connection. The speaker did what it said on the tin. It was loud and bright. I'm just not sure it would have been as good if it worked. This was my second bluetooth device purchase from Audio Technica and the worst experience was when I purchased my first. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality of the "ELECTRONIC CLAMPER" is very bad. It will not play even a single song of the CD that came with the device.  The plastic case is thin, and when you attempt to get a plug/connector for the CD, it breaks.  I can't believe that they even make these products. The sound is very poor, and I have had to go out of my way to get an analog source and use the player.

The buttons don't sit perfectly on the device but they're good enough.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this a few years ago to use with an old laptop which is no longer supported by my laptop maker (Toshiba) as of September 2013.  I have no problems with the sound quality on this unit.  The volume and quality of the sound is ok.  But, the lack of an SD card reader (I use a Toshiba miniSD card reader) makes this unit unusable for long distance music listening and music storage.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this product for about a year now, and after having this unit for awhile, I have discovered that its not the best.   The first thing I noticed about it was the quality of the sound that it puts out.  I used to use a HiFi system, and the quality was just not there with the Pioneer.  The subwoofer output was just too weak.  Another thing that bothers me about the Pioneer product is its size.  It's not exactly a portable, and I would prefer that the subwoofers had a little more output power than it can handle.  There is also no volume control on this unit.  All of this is bad enough, but then there's this:  I would like to have gotten a Bluetooth Speaker with this, but it's only got 2.4 for $100 more.  Hopefully they come out with a Bluetooth Audio with this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    As far as I know, this device is the same type of product that the Philips Hue can be purchased with a Hue Bridge and you will need to install your own Hue bridge separately.  The only thing I like about this lightbulb is that you can dim the lights to a lower level. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item at the recommendation of a good friend, and I would like to say it did what it was supposed to do...but it did not work well.   The buttons for volume and song controls are on the top of the unit, and you would think they would be at the bottom.  After reading the instructions (which were clearly written by a person who does not work in electronics), I found that they were not located at the proper height, so after a few tries, I was able to use the buttons just fine.  I was also able to get the volume button to work after a little more messing around.  Unfortunately, the buttons do not have the same shape as the ones on my   LG E6 (not really a good thing for me to say about a   $200 device)    However, it is a very good product that I recommend if you are in need of a new portable music player.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A very large black brick is a real pain to move around.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It works great for a very short period of time, however, after a few months of usage I realized that there is no remote for the control panel. It has a switch to make it function as a tape deck, which is a shame since I've always liked the sound of the tape decks.   My only other complaint would be the lack of power. I have to plug it in to get it to record. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was very disappointed in the new Apple TV. It's still great and has tons of content, but the Apple Remote doesn't have the same feel as the one that came with the Apple TV (as in, the buttons and the touch pad feel different). 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these speakers to replace the stock speakers in my MacBook Pro. They sounded nice.

I have been using it for the past month and a half. I use it with an ATX to PC power supply with the included AC power cord. It has enough juice for my system.

The two included cables are fine, and I don't understand why they bother to make the cable, but it's a lot of work to put them on.  I've had these headphones for almost a year now and they've never given me a problem. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This device works but its extremely unreliable and hard to use. I bought one as a gift for my husband and it was a horrible experience. When it arrived it was broken and very dirty, so i took it back and exchanged for another but the second one was bad as well. I will have to live without it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The monitor came with a crappy built in speakers that sound awful when you play a CD or listen to music. The speakers don't have any adjustments so they are just as loud as your home stereo system.   After a few days of using the unit I gave up and sold it. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The unit works for a day or two, and then it's no good. The cable is terrible - the connectors on the unit are too small and don't have a way to secure them.  by Ryan S. on 06/18/2017 byon 06/17/2017
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product has several issues: 1. When plugged in, the battery has trouble staying fully charged. When the charging indicator lights up it will stay at that level until it drains out. 2. The speakers sound weak and are very boomy. I bought the speaker to use on my desktop PC and it's terrible for such a small portable device. I just wish the speakers were bigger and they sounded a little better. 3. The device has a really tiny battery that is too small to power a high end device like my PC or a laptop. The battery life isn't the worst I've seen, but it's definitely not worth the $35 price tag.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This was one of the first smartwatches I bought but it took a while for the apps to be updated. I bought a leather version and it didn't work that great. I tried to send a message via Bluetooth but it just said, "Connected to another device" and then couldn't send anything.   The watch is great if you want to watch movies, play games, or read emails but be warned, it's a bit pricy.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The cord is too short.  I've tried using an extension cord that was a little shorter but still, the cord gets in the way when you're using it.  The other problem is that the "up and down" feature to change the volume on the remote isn't working.  It still moves the volume up/down, it just won't make the volume change properly.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The design of this is terrible.  The buttons are so tiny that you have to make a little effort to find them (there are two) and the buttons are almost impossible to press with the right hand.  It's impossible to get a full and complete charge.  After using this for a couple of days, the battery life of the device is abysmal.  I used it to watch YouTube and my Internet connection is almost never enough to get decent streaming speeds on Netflix, Hulu, etc.  You are lucky if you get 8 or 10 hours of screen on time.   I'd rather get the XM or the iPod Touch but I have a feeling it's going to be a while before anyone buys these.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I received a Samsung Chromebook for Christmas and I have to say I have been extremely disappointed.   The first thing I noticed was the fact that the keyboard was really bad. It feels like it would easily fall out.  I tried using it on my lap but I couldn't use it for anything.  There was no way to plug in my mouse or keyboard so I used my phone which works perfect.  The screen is a nice quality, but it is also very easy to scratch.  All the extra buttons were hard to find.  But most important: It does not run Chrome OS, so I can't use Chrome or use Google Docs.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this device for my daughter as she was going through an old PC and wanted the best of both worlds (I have the PC too and I like the feel and ease of use of the pc; also she loves the laptop).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My iPod was a piece of junk. I could hardly use it at all. The batteries were old and the sound was awful. I also hate that there are no buttons.   The product does the job but I hate that they have to change the batteries. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this for my 14 year old who has used it almost every day for the last three months. He has a very sore back from using it and is now out of it.  I wanted a power tool that would not need charging, but would provide power, but I didn't want to buy one that was heavy and bulky.  The   the power cord is just like the last Power Tool, but the power tool itself is a big  and heavy piece.   The cord is made with rubber, but it does not look like it was used or well.  After a week I was going to return it until I found another brand that I like.  My son and I are going to buy another one now, but not because of the cord.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A bad electronic gadget that I purchased a while ago is no longer useful, although I had purchased it to provide me with the ability to keep in touch with my family via the Internet.  The sound of the keyboard was very harsh and the keystrokes had no feedback or tactile sensation as it did not vibrate like my other keyboard does.   The battery life is too low to be truly useful and it is a shame because it had an LCD screen, so I would have been able to see the time and date. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The unit I purchased in February is still not working.

It's not.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I ordered the first version of this monitor in early August. I've been using it at home for several months, and I've had no problems with it. However, at home, I'm not looking for the best picture quality, so I ordered a second one to see if it would have any different features.  This is the second version I've purchased.   It has the same features as the first, but the display is more grainy and the picture colors are a little weird.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is not a good thing if your in a hurry or you have a very old device. The buttons are hard to find on some keys and it takes way too much time to get to the buttons or enter the password when you have to push in and then hit the button again to get back into the right application.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The new "Bolt" I purchased was faulty.   First the AC power supply did not work.  Then the disk drive "sliced" itself in half.  The CD burner worked flawlessly for a few months, then stopped working.  After a couple of months of this it became obvious that the power supply and CD burner were not compatible.  I have not had any problems with the new power supply.  It seems the power board is to blame, but the only thing that worked was the CD player. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this monitor for a small project, since my current monitor is only 25 inches.   The screen size isn't as big as the one I was going to use, but it looks much better.  The buttons on this monitor are smaller than those on my monitor.  You also need a mouse with this monitor. The monitor is very bright, and it's easy to see your entire screen at a time. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It worked fine for the first 3 years, then the battery went bad and the screen would turn off for no apparent reason.  The screen would be on the screen for a second or two and then go off again.  If the battery isn't connected to the device, the battery will die.  It took me a day of using it every day to figure out what caused this problem.  This is one of the first things I look for when I purchase new devices.  You have to be careful what batteries you buy! 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Very poor sound quality. I bought this as a replacement for a broken iPod Touch.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Very slow and clunky to use, so much work to setup, and if you have any problems, you can't call for help. If you do use it as a music player for your iPod, you are going to regret it.  Rated 4 out of 5 by David from Very well built This is a very well built product.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Purchased this product and it took me some time to find the battery. But I eventually found it. It is a good quality battery, and the battery life is good. I found the sound too high, and I think it is because I am not using a high quality amp to power the unit. I use a stereo sub, and it is not loud enough to get good sound. I guess I just need to invest in a good amp to get decent sound from the device. I recommend this device to people who have a budget.

It works and looks good but it's not for everyone. It will get you on youtube, but when you want to watch movies it's going to be pretty bad. I'm a big nerd and the blu ray player was so big I had to turn the player to portrait and adjust the volume. When you first turn it to portrait it's a little hard but after that it starts working. After the first couple of weeks I'm glad I bought it but I hope the company fixes the volume problem. I've had it a month and my tv has had issues as well so it may be a faulty one. .  I own this television and the sound on it is not good. It's like you're in a movie with no sound. I bought a different brand tv and they sound better so I'm going to try the blu-ray player as well.  the tv also only comes with one remote. you can use it with another TV or your phone but then it's expensive  i bought this for my son to use as a computer for when i got back from work. i just wish it had sound. it does have an HD tuner, however, that's about it. it's only got one remote and there is no other buttons on the remote. this is not a problem when using it on the tv, however. my other computers only have 2 knobs and buttons, and that's what i wanted in a home theater.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device is an absolute pain in the ass to use.  There is a tiny little window that shows the temperature, but once that's off you can't actually see the temp.  This is why it gets an "F" when it is cold.  I have a big metal grill and it took two days to put my grill on it and get it on.  The handle gets super hot because it doesn't fit flush with the grill, so I have to put it on the grill upside down.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product does exactly what it says on the tin, which is to connect a phone with a Bluetooth headset and speaker.   Although I have a few headphones, and I have used them for years, this is the only one I'd ever recommend.  I found the plastic housing to be flimsy.  The other issue is that the remote has a very narrow range.  If you're trying to use it to answer a call, for instance, your phone is usually within the room you're in, but with the remote you are at the other end of the room, and you have to wait for a speaker to be turned on before you can get through to the person who is on the other line.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought two of these with the intention of using one as a music player for my phone and the other as a portable speaker for when I'm in the car.   It's so big that it takes up two of the two small slots in my iPhone's dock.  It took two attempts to get one to work properly, but it finally did after I swapped out the old one with a new one.  One downside is that the mic won't connect with any computer with a USB connector - the mic is connected to the headphone jack so you have to use a mic adapter for most computer (and some phone) devices.  But the size is so big it makes it impossible for my music player to be portable anyway.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device is a joke. I purchased this to play the Xbox on and when it was time to hook up the controllers and get a game to play. No problem, I get the controllers connected, power on and it works. Then a couple hours later I get an error message that it can't connect. I had to use a cable for all of the controller connections. It's so hard to get everything to work together.   The controllers don't work well.   Rated 1 out of 5 by Anonymous from Not very reliable I bought this for a friend to play a few games of Battlefield 4 together with my Xbox One. I've had the controller for about 2 weeks now, and it has not worked at all. I sent the controller back and sent it back again, but it keeps having trouble. I thought it was the cable but I got a new one from B&H and it still won't work. It just wont play any more games, and when I try to do anything, nothing works. Not very happy with this purchase.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    In retrospect I wish that the audio interface included in the unit had been a 2-band, 1/2-inch line level jack like the other digital interfaces that I have bought over the past few years. I would have preferred a pair of the Line-Level digital interfaces (such as the SONIC or SC-80 ). I bought this product because of the small size and compact design, and the audio is okay, but not good enough to replace my CD player, or even my cassette player. The only way I could recommend this product is if you want to use it to mix in the car and are already used to mixing with the CD player.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased two of these units to use as a computer monitor for my two computers in my bedroom.    The first one worked just fine with no problems, but after using it for a little while one of the connections on the monitor would not turn on the computer and no matter how hard I pushed on the "connect" button it would not come on.  The second one worked perfectly, but this one made me very nervous because I was using a $100 monitor as a personal computer.  They do not come with the power adapter that comes with the monitor, so you will have to purchase this yourself.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    A few months back my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 battery died in my pocket. It took about 30 minutes to find out the reason why. In that time, my phone was completely dead. When I went into the store to get another one, they charged me for another. It's not a cheap phone, so I figured, why not go with the new one.   It is very much like the Note 3, and while it is not as well rounded as the Note 4, the improvements are negligible. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the original Thinkpad X200 and I love it.   It has a great keyboard.  I love the touch pad that comes with it. The buttons on the Thinkpad were very easy to use. But, this one has awful keyboard. It's hard to find the F and F key without accidentally hitting one of them. And, it's not the best feeling keyboard. The Thinkpad is not a terrible computer. The keyboard is pretty much perfect.  For a laptop, the Thinkpads are pretty fast. The battery life is a little worse than that of an ultrabook.  There are better laptops out there, and I can't recommend buying this over other laptops.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The computer is so unreliable.  This is not a good product.  I have already lost two sets of files and the warranty has expired.   It seems that Apple is trying to sell you a computer with the same kind of issues that are out of this world, but at half the price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased the Panasonic VAIO e-Book reader for my PC and found that it worked well but the battery ran down quickly. It took an hour and a half to charge the battery. I didn't have the option of purchasing a new battery for the e-book reader and when I was done with the book I noticed that the batteries had run out. I couldn't buy the book from Amazon or Barnes and Noble because they do not carry the e book. I thought it was my computer's problem but I've never had any problems with this e-reader.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for a portable music player and it sounds good, but it's hard to plug in because it doesn't have any power cords. The cord gets caught on the plug and you have to use a paperclip to get it unplugged. Also the controls are a pain to use. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the 3rd I have purchased from this company, and they have gone the wrong way. I thought I was getting a decent sound card but ended up with a crappy preamplifier.   Also, the product itself was of bad quality. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This device is a joke.  The thing just randomly starts running at any time, regardless if there is a charge.  I have had the same thing with another brand, and it would not even shut off when I turned it off or turned it on.  Also, I have found a small screwdriver that will not get inside.  It doesn't work.  This is a piece of junk that doesn't even come close to the quality of the Samsung.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device and my old laptop died of old age so I bought a new one and this one works. The first thing I noticed is the sound is terrible. It's a horrible sound. The second thing I realized was that my old computer would never start up again. I had to get a new computer to use this laptop.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am very satisfied with the new laptop, except that the battery life is extremely short and that the keyboard is much too sensitive to my mistakes. I tried to buy the one from my local computer store, but the computer store staff made me change the batteries. Also, the keyboard on this model is much more sensitive than my laptop's.  Good value for money:  I really enjoyed using this laptop, but my previous one is a long time ago and it was very hard to keep up with my work and studies. The new one is much better. It has a nice screen and is fast, but is a bit sluggish for my tastes. The keyboard is also very good. I have to give it 2 out of 5 because the memory is rather lacking, but that is just a quibble.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I've purchased a new computer every time I needed to upgrade. I've always wanted to upgrade the sound, and the Pono comes with this option as well.  I'll have to pay more for the same audio quality, but that's OK.   The Pono is really not a high end product, but the sound quality is good, and it does include a pretty nice looking case.  A bit of a shame that it doesn't come with a bit of color.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this unit for my wife.   As a gamer, she needed something she could play with for her computer, and that's all this is really good for.  It doesn't come with the soundcard and its a total pain in the ass to get it working.  You need a special cable and you have to use a screwdriver to get the sound card in. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So I bought a refurbished ipod and it lasted about a year. After that, it started to get rusted on the bottom. So I got a new ipod, but the sound was horrible. It's a really good sounding mp3 player, but it's too loud, the bass is weak, and it's pretty small.    Rated 5 out of 5 by jimbo from Great sound, great battery life I bought this because I wanted a small, compact speaker for my car. I can get about 30-45 min of good audio out of it. It also has a good battery life and has an auto on function that makes it easy to start listening to music. If you are looking to make a small or compact portable speaker, this would be the best buy.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I really didn't see the point in paying for this thing. I bought it because I wanted to replace an old device that kept getting lost, but the quality of the cord and how easily it was cut with a knife made it a pointless purchase. I've now replaced it twice with a similar product and it still gets lost, so I guess the cord is really no better than the first one. If you want to save a couple bucks, buy a good cord with a good, long cord. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this because it said it was waterproof and water resistant but when I opened my Kindle in the rain, the screen began to go black and the paper began to fall out.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only thing I like about the new unit is that the battery is now replaceable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I received this as a free item. It was just not as advertised. The buttons worked as advertised, but they have problems with the "on" and "off" buttons. The unit works, but it is very hard to use. The instructions are not clear enough. I tried to adjust the unit for different distances, etc, but the unit will not work when mounted to a surface. I had to mount the unit to the wall and use the unit as a cordless "keychain" like device to make it function.

However, they took forever to answer my question about an order I had placed. When I finally got an answer, it was so late that I went back to get my check. Then, it took me another week to get another question answered. This time I had to call back and have them give me a new question. I have called other brands and there is no difference.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this machine for a project and I must say, I'm disappointed with it.   It's not that it's poor quality or that it doesn't work.  I just found the instructions and software to be confusing at times, and it took me way longer to configure it than I'd like.  It worked great, but I would have much preferred a manual or an easy-to-follow video on how to use it.

I tried a couple different laptops over the years and they all worked great, and I was always disappointed when I had to replace the screens, hard drives, or keyboards. This time, I thought I would go with the one that looked better and was about half the price.   But I just bought a better and better one   When you look at the price, you're going to be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this for a job interview, and it would not work. My boss was having to call my number repeatedly, I was calling back with the same number, and eventually she hung up on me. I asked the person at the store if they could fix it, but they were completely unhelpful and didn't know anything about it. The person at Home Depot was also completely uninterested and not helpful at all. I could never return this item!  Rated 5 out of 5 by KV from Perfect I was using my computer at my office computer. I had an old Apple with a floppy disk drive. My old computer is an Apple II, and I can't seem to get my old computer to work with my new Apple. My new computer is a Macintosh, and the Apple IIIx has no floppy drive. This worked perfectly for me. The floppy drive doesn't work, but the computer still has power. I am so happy to have gotten a second computer, one that is functional.

The quality and reliability of this product has not exceeded my expectations.   The hard drive tray is broken and will need to be replaced.

I would recommend this product to any customer who needs a new computer.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When the   LCD screen on the  USB dock   goes blank every time I plug in the  cable.   It's a horrible    design.   Rated 1 out of 5 by JKH from Disappointing. After searching on several web sites for some kind of cable I decided to buy this one. I was disappointed to find out that the cable is not interchangeable with the one that came with my LG 34UD94D. The LG cable is very flexible so I expected to be able to bend it out of shape. The cable that comes with my phone was already in perfect shape but I could not bend it. I ended up returning it. The problem I have with this cable is that when the cable bends it does not flex as much as I would expect from a $5 cable. This is a serious drawback. I'm extremely disappointed and I would not recommend this cable to anybody.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only reason I bought this keyboard is to use as a computer and now that I have, it's a total waste. I have tried all of the USB-C keyboards that I could find. They all feel and work exactly the same. The only real improvements are the USB Type C connectors, but they are hard to use.  For the price, you can't get much better. This was my first USB-B keyboard and I can definitely say that it's worth the price.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This was an extremely poor design. I had to look at the back of the unit to find where the power/volume buttons were and was then sent back to the store for a brand new unit.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this because it sounded cool but when I got the machine, it was broken. When I contacted their support, they responded by telling me to pay $300 to get a replacement and then said I was going to have to pay another $150 to get it fixed.   They should really sell machines that are working well and have no problems, instead of making you pay to fix something that doesn't break. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I recently purchased this stereo receiver because it had the option for USB and I was tired of using my computer's built in audio port. I bought it online and it arrived very quickly. The unit came with a USB cable and the remote. I installed the USB cord and inserted it into my computer but couldn't connect. I contacted the manufacturer and they sent a new one and I haven't had any problems with it since then. Overall, I like the remote and the sound of the system. However, it doesn't seem to have a decent connection to my computer and it makes the sound distorted and harsh. I would not recommend this product.

He wanted a better sound quality, but not as loud. However, I found the set of speaker to be awful, especially at higher volumes. These are loud. They are way louder than anything I have ever owned. And it's a pain trying to plug them in, because the connector is so tiny. If you're not the type to have an iPhone or a portable player, then these may not be for you.

This one has the remote, but it's a pain to use, and I can't find a remote that's easy to use.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Bob S. from So far so good I have 2 of these, and they've worked great. They come with all of the necessary cables and the remote.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is the WORST case for the   Samsung   Touch   The whole unit   has the power   to make a good   laptop if it had   a battery that lasts longer.    It's the worst   computer   I've   ever bought.   There is no   upgrade   that   can replace the      Battery.  I really hope   you don't   pay for it   the battery   is a joke  . 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It was slow and jerky. I have a laptop and desktop computer so I am usually pretty quick. The keyboard is very easy to type on and I was able to use it for about 3 years until the batteries got low. It was an easy upgrade for me, but I have some old school mouse joysticks so I'm not sure if this will be an upgrade for everyone.

After reading the troubleshooting guides on this site, I called GeniusBar and they got me up and running with no problems. The quality of the product is much better than the iPad 2.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got my Dell laptop in Dec 2013 and just now tried to install Windows 8. I have used a Dell desktop/laptop for 15 years now and have had only great results.   This laptop is horrible.  I was looking for an ultrabook and this laptop would not work with Windows 8!    I bought this laptop on sale and it does work but the battery is very bad and after using it for a week the battery went dead.  I would recommend this laptop for a novice user only, I would have thought if it was a low cost laptop then it would have more good features, like an extra port or a keyboard cover. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device for use with my computer. It is a wonderful device, but there are a couple of issues: 1. The audio quality is terrible. The only thing that it can be used for is the old fashioned way of plugging in an audio tape player, because the stereo is terrible to begin with. However, if you use this to play old 80's rock, then this is a great device. 2. The screen quality is not as good as the original Tascam. This one doesn't have the light on the back of the device to make you know where the screen is. I wish this device had better audio quality and a brighter screen! Overall, a great product for people who like to have their old media and music.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from Great for the price I bought one of these to replace my old CD player. I liked it so much that I bought a second one to have on my car. The sound quality is just as good, but the CD player is much more powerful, and is much less expensive. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good quality cd player, but can't afford the expensive one. I've listened to music for more than 30 years now, and I still enjoy the music on a good cd player better than the old CD players from the 80's. I can also play songs on my iPhone, and my computer without changing out the cd player or the sound card. If you are looking for an inexpensive CD player, this one is a good choice.  "The best way to listen to music on the move!"  Reviewer: mnb from NY. USA. Posted on December 19, 2015  I bought this to replace a cheap cheap old cd player that broke. I use the CD players for music collection on the road with my iPod. These are so easy to plug in and play your music, you can't believe the sound quality.  ofc you get that old CD quality with these but there is a new problem.. i lost my remote cord,i tried using a new one but it didn't work,I tried going the wireless route but i was having the same problem...and now i think i might try to put my cord into my ipod as well but if it works for me that would be nice,i would say that the best way i can use this device is with my ipad,but i have no clue what to do
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After my first time using the Tascam DR-40, I immediately realized that it is the absolute worst piece of gear I've ever bought. I bought it from eBay, since Tascams.com had not been able to deliver my order due to poor communication. The item arrived broken and in very bad condition. The Tascamation of the DR-80 is not as good as the DRV2000, which I own and recommend. This Tascamp is the worst Tascap I have ever bought! First of all, it looks bad. The pictures are not even close to the actual product. The only good thing is the sound is excellent. I do not like the Tancam's, I think they are so flimsy and cheap looking and the sound quality is horrible. I will not buy again and I will be returning the T-80 for the DR40. I'm not a fan of the TMC25 and this Tascape DR-30 is actually better and cheaper.   This is a good product if your in the market for a quality Tascaped to C2K.  For the price, this DR-60 is a steal and definitely a great value!   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is my first time trying to use a computer. I have a very nice Asus laptop and I wanted to go with a laptop. This was not an easy choice. I was very disappointed in how poorly built the laptop is. The screen is just too dim and it has a bad build quality.  It has an LED backlit keyboard, but the keys are not backlit and they do not register when I press down.  The screen wobbles with each movement of my finger and the laptop has some minor wobble in the center.  There are no usb ports on the back, and I have to buy a dongle to connect my pc.  I'm not happy with the keyboard. The space bar is too high, and it's hard to press with one hand.   I bought this as a gift for a friend. She can't use it because the keys don't register when she presses them.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I replaced my old wireless earbuds with these. They were fine, but the audio quality was so-so. After replacing the headphones with my old pair, I got the same poor audio. After listening to music with my current earbud setup, I was disappointed. I tried them on two different iPhones and they sound pretty good, but you really need a good pair of headphones to hear a difference.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Overall   The sound is not bad and the sound quality is good, but for $99 (or a bit less if you get the pro version) it's just not worth the money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I had a few problems with my EDSAC.  One, the unit was always very cold, even after adjusting the controls.  Two, the volume control is very hard to find.  Three, the power switch often did not work at all.   The EDSASCAC is very cool to use.  I think a much better unit would be better but I did not buy it because I was looking for an EDSASIC.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Bill from Does what it's supposed to do. Works great. No problems. The unit is very well built, very reliable. I had to replace the power cable after a couple of years, however the unit works just fine, and I'm very pleased with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only problem I found with this was that there was a faulty power cable on the back of the unit.

When I finally "fixed" the software to work with my Mac, I had to spend a good 30 minutes trying to use the touch screen and then after several hours I got the same results. I can't believe they would sell a "pro"-type item for this price. I'm not sure where I would buy this device now.

I have always liked Cherry Blues, and I've used my old keyboard in the past, so I figured I'd give it a try.  Well, it's a pretty bad keyboard.  The keycap design is pretty terrible, and the switches are horrible.  It's also very loud, and since it comes with a USB hub, the hub is also pretty noisy.  Overall, not worth the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is my second unit, my first one was a Sony Z- series I got for my wife. I was so excited to get this one and it doesn't even have an iPod connection and just the headphone jack. The sound quality is ok but the buttons are hard to use and I have to constantly push the button on the back to stop it from changing. I hate the fact that the only way to change tracks is on a USB stick or through a computer. The only use I have for it is to play music but if I have the ability to use the iPod connection I would have bought this.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It took 2-3 hours to get it working, I got frustrated at the lack of a bootable USB key, and the fact that the screen went black when i was setting up.  This is not a bad product it just needs better support 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I own several of the Apple Watches, including the new stainless steel Apple Watch Series 3.   They are very nice watches, but they are very noisy.  They do have a great feature, however, that allows you to do a quick check of the time without having to pull out the watch.  I just put my watch in my pocket and run to the store and back.  So I'm always looking for a quiet way to check time. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this device and it is NOT a good product.   First of all the button to turn the lights on and off is on the other side of the unit.  So i have to hold it in my hand to turn it on and when you turn it back on it stays on.  When it was running I had to take the power cord off to change batteries and it didn't work at all.  I then purchased an  external charger to power it.  It does work when you plug it in.  The batteries also last the amount of time you are using them.  But after i charged my device they quit working.  Very unhappy and will not buy this product again. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This thing is just an old computer! I got this for my computer when I bought it. After a few days, I realized that it is a horrible piece of junk! When I turned it on it would constantly get hot and not turn on! It would not turn off, I had to use a screw driver on it. The screen would be too bright and it would make the computer sound like a tube radio. I could not use it and the batteries didn't last very long. I got rid of it.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this for my wife who likes to play the computer games like Starcraft 2 and Diablo 3.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    If I'm not mistaken this is the second time this has happened to me.  This time the problem started when I plugged the battery back in.  The screen went black and a loud noise started. I was then told by a store employee that the battery was dead and he told me to buy a new one for $5.  I said ok and paid $9 for the replacement.   I've purchased several Apple products and it was by far the worst.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This keyboard is not very good.  It doesn't feel as good as a regular keyboard.   I wish I could use it to type on a computer as well, but I can't because the keys are too small and the size of the keycap is too small.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My old phone, which I have been using for 5 years, has a bad battery life problem that has caused it to die almost every week.  The battery is supposed to last at least 3-5 months, but now it barely gets a few hours before going dead and needs a charger.    It's not that I don't use the phone - I use it every day - it's just that I'm trying to figure out a good way to get rid of this old phone before it dies. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So far, this product seems to be ok, but the software is just buggy.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these a week or so ago. They are fine for what they are, but they are so far from being good they are unusable. It takes more power to turn them on than it does to turn it off.   When they get warm they don't work.      The battery has no voltage indicator, so I have to manually switch them on and off with the micro usb cord (it takes a bit of time).    Also, the battery will only hold about a week's worth of charge.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this for a year and have nothing but problems with it. First of all, the headphones were not rated well by sound quality. When they plugged in, the sound was OK, but there was no bass or sound depth. Second of all the device has the "clicky" feel of a cheap mp3 player that needs to be recharged regularly. Thirdly, I had an issue with my "old" battery that broke after about 60 days.   These headphones are worthless to me and I will be replacing them with anything else in the near future.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Maddy from Great Sound! I bought these about 2 months ago and I'm so glad I did. I can listen to a full audio book or listen to any music and not worry about being distracted or fatigued. These headphones will keep me entertained until my next audiobook! They are definitely the right price for the quality and sound!  Review for Bose QuietComfort 25 I bought the Bose 25 in 2014 to use in a commercial (for home TV) for people who are on the couch. It was just what I needed! Well, I can't remember what movie the commercial was for, but it was so good it made me want to buy one. The Bose has been wonderful for watching movies. It keeps my ears comfortable and the volume is good. The bass and treble are very natural and balanced. The only drawback is the cord, which is long and hard to work with. I'll have to find some way to keep it from getting tangled!  The B-Comfort II (the 25th Anniversary model) is so good that I can hardly believe it was released in 2014. I use it regularly for podcasting, music watching and just general entertainment, and it still sounds fantastic! The bass is very nice for watching music videos, and the treble is a great amount of detail without being too warm. It also has the convenience of having both a microphone and a noise cancelling ear bud so I can adjust the volume. If you want to get comfortable headphones without being limited by what your budget allows, then get the B-COMFORT II. It's well worth the $50-$60 price tag. . The QuietComforts sound amazing! Great for podcasts and TV shows too, as it helps me stay focused while listening to podcasts or watching TV. The noise canceling ear bud and microphone are nice

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item last year in the hope that it would last longer than the 1-2 years I had been using my previous one.  However, the next time I used my old Sony to do anything besides watching tv I realized the speaker and mic were pretty bad and the sound quality was horrible.  I guess I can't complain too much about the new one, but I'd be much happier with a much better quality item for my money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have had this product for over 2 months, it is not very good for music and it does not work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I got this for my laptop, and it's terrible.  The laptop, by the way, runs great, so I don't even know why I bought this one.  This thing is a monster.  It's an ethernet device, so it can only send and receive packets.  To use it, you have to run a cable to the back of your laptop, which is really annoying.  I'll take my chances with my ethernet adapter, but I wouldn't buy this for that.  You might as well just buy a cheap ethernet dongle for your laptop or desktop.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The product was not that great.  It doesn't have any special features that are necessary or helpful, and it is very difficult to use.

The CD-ROM drives are unreliable. I would like to get rid of it, because the $200 price tag was a big deal in 2005.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I have to give it four stars because of the design. It is just ok, and you are going to have to spend a lot of money to get something better than this.  I bought this to replace an old Dell that has been downgraded from a 7600 to a 7200.  This thing is much bigger and has a better sound system than the old Dell and the screen is great.  The only problem I have with this system is the power brick is terrible.  For some reason I thought it was going to work until it died on me and I had to buy a new one and that was a big waste of money.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only good thing is that the keyboard is back. I can't believe the $50.00 price tag of this. I'll buy another one of these for my Mac. I got this as a gift for my girlfriend's birthday, because I got one when my old Mac died. I'm hoping it works as well as the old one. But, it sure doesn't. I've read about it working well for other people, and so far, it seems like it might be the same way for me. This is one of those things that just needs to be bought because you want it, then once you get it, don't read the reviews online. It does seem to work well enough. The only thing is, there's only one way to switch to Windows using this keyboard. You have to flip up the keyboard and unplug the power cord. So, it's either buy an adapter for it, or buy a separate adapter, or just buy a laptop that can do that for you.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this set for my computer in the 90's and it worked well until recently. Every time I wanted to use the computer I had to find another mouse/keyboard combo. The fact that it's wireless makes it so much more convenient, but I always lose it. It was fun to play with at one point but now it just gets in the way.  Good Product, Bad Design: I bought these for my kids. They both have these so they're both familiar with them. The first time they used them, they both had no problems. But after they had used them for a while, the buttons on the joystick started clicking back and forth. This was especially annoying to me because both of them had used mice before. One button would click for a short period of time and the other would stay clicky for a longer period. The one they lost their control on the first time happened to be the left one. They are using the right one now. Not sure if they'll ever get it to work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I've been looking for a good laptop since i got the Macbook Air. This was the best. However, i wish it had a bigger hard drive.   I have been buying this laptop for a while now. It works flawlessly. I love the size and I love that I can use it with my iPhone.  It works great but you have to get used to having the volume at the top but it can be adjusted easily. I also think that the bluetooth on this laptop is a little too hot for the room I'm in.  I'd like to use it but it doesn't have an internal battery to charge it. I'd also like to have a better screen.  It's a great little laptop.  However, the design is awful and the screen is tiny (although I guess its good that it's only 10.1 inches).

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this to replace my aging (but still working) desktop computer.  Unfortunately, I am very disappointed in this purchase.  The product was defective within a few days of arrival,  the screen does not work.  I was extremely concerned when the customer service representatives informed me it would be 2-3 weeks until the computer would arrive.  While waiting,  I searched online and found others that were experiencing the same problem.   It appears this was the result of a manufacturing defect.  It is difficult to find a replacement for a brand new computer.  Rated 3 out of 5 by B.S. from Decent product, but it's hard to use I bought this product to replace an older computer. I bought the refurbished model and it came with a pre-installed CD. I installed the product and all worked great for about two weeks, I think. On the 15th I bought a new hard drive and it was not a CD-ROM. Then I called Microsoft and explained the problem, which is that the CD-Rom drives that come with computers can get defective. They tried to replace the hard drive, but I wasn't interested in paying $150 for a CD drive. I ended up getting another computer and this is my backup.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a piece of junk. The buttons are hard to hit with the index finger because the plastic is so thick.    I used to use an old Dell laptop for many years, and that's where I got the idea to get one of these.  But they're very, very slow.  Even when connected to a USB hub, they're not really a USB-type device.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this keyboard to replace my mechanical keyboard, and it really has a lot of positives, but also a few negatives, such as the fact that the number pad can be a little difficult to hit due to the layout.   Unfortunately, it is a mechanical keyboard which does not have the option for macro keys, so it really doesn't feel like a true gaming keyboard.  I have been using this keyboard on and off for a while now and I am very satisfied with the keys and the switch. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was skeptical at first, and I guess I was right.  The build quality of the device seems really good.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality is not great. This is the only device I have owned and I have had to upgrade several other devices from this one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only reason it doesn't work is because it only has one USB port, which I'm glad it only needs because of all the other cables you can use with it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have only had this product for a short time, but it has given me some pretty big headaches. The first two times I used it, it worked just fine. I had some pretty loud clicking noises, so I opened it up, cleaned the unit and used a few times before I found out that I needed to use a special tool to fix the problem. The third time I used the same device, the clicking went away, but the same thing happened again. I finally did the same as above and discovered that I had the same issue in a previous version of the device. I tried a couple more times, but no luck. I will probably wait for some other device that works before buying this one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After I replaced my old Sony BVM with a new ASUS N55N, I got it working flawlessly.   First, I had to download a firmware update.  I was able to use it just fine but after that, I just got a message that said "System Firmware Updater v1.0"  Then I had a bad shock:  I unplugged my BVM and plugged it in the same way I plugged in my PS2 in 1991.  At that point, the system wouldn't even boot up.  It wouldn't let me run any program, and the screen was blank.  The only way to run the BVM program was to restart the computer or use the eject and power button.  After that, all the system says is "Your computer has been upgraded and is not compatible with your Playstation system"  That's it, no further troubleshooting needed.  If I ever need to replace that BVM again, I'll have to go to Best Buy and buy a new PS2. The good   The screen is big and clear and the sound is very loud!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This item did not work as described and I returned it back to the retailer.   I was really hoping that the product would work well for me as it was supposed to be and not have any problems.  The box was the same color of the packaging (black) and was not damaged.  If it did not fit well then I have no idea why it was a $99.00 item when you could get it for $75.00 in the same size.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this in hopes that it would be ok to play music.  I had purchased a cheap, flimsy, cheapo MP3 player that just never worked for me. The unit worked perfectly for a couple weeks until my MP3 came to a sudden stop. When I checked it at the end of the day, it wasn't plugged into the dock. Then I had to pull it out and wait for it to charge again. When the battery was nearly dead, I realized that my car stereo had started working just fine. This is another example of a poor quality product. I will not be buying this product again.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   When I purchased my new laptop, the keyboard had a little bit of a learning curve. I found out a couple of things when I went on the Internet for help: The first was that I had a very old keyboard. There is no way I could possibly be typing with this keyboard now. The second was that my key caps were not compatible with the new keyboard. They were old and chipped from use.  It was a little difficult to figure out where to get replacements for the keys.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I am currently using a portable e-reader for the first time. I am very disappointed in this unit. It works very well, but the pages are very fragile. This is a major disappointment since I have a higher price point and high expectations for this device.   The company claims that there are no problems, but I don't know how much of that is a cover up for the fact that the pages that I purchase do not adhere to the book. I wish the company would look at this as a possible issue so that I can avoid this purchase.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was skeptical about buying an LCD TV in 2012.  But in 2017, after buying three LCD TVs from Amazon, I'm disappointed in the picture quality.  It looks like there was a mix-up when they were ordered as a set.  I would have rather paid more for something more reliable.  The first two sets that I bought were so-so (mostly blacks, but the picture looked good).  I had some issues with the screen that required the TV to be returned.  This second set (I just purchased) has worse picture quality (bluish) and I feel that this set needs to be replaced.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased the first generation wireless keyboard for my new iMac. I was looking for a similar product for my aging laptop. I received my new keyboard about a week later and I'm very impressed. The keys are much deeper than the first one, and it has a lot of travel. I like that you can customize the keyboard. The only bad thing about this keyboard is that the wireless connection only works when plugged in to the power strip. It's not always a problem because the wireless mouse is a great accessory. But if you need to type on your wireless keyboard on the go then the mouse is much more convenient and easier to use. The product itself is very well made and has a long lifetime.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is NOT an audio book for audiophiles. I bought this book expecting it to be an interesting mix of physics, astronomy, mathematics, and more, and it completely fell flat on me.   The book contains a number of references to physics, but it is mostly just describing things the reader already knows and doesn't really add anything new.  A couple of times the author references a few physics articles, but never explains why he/she thinks these things are interesting.  This book is best enjoyed with an audio player, like the ones that come with the CD version of the book. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The unit is extremely loud, but the price and quality is acceptable.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the worst laptop I have ever owned!   It was extremely cheap, very poor quality of materials, and was very hard to repair or replace when I eventually did want to upgrade it (I have an HP laptop, which works better and lasts longer, but this is the second laptop I've owned in the past year that has been just as hard to use and unreliable). I tried the replacement parts, but they did not work. I also tried changing the motherboard, but it was a complete failure.   I am a computer scientist and have used expensive and hard to fix laptops and this was far beyond my expectations. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased the HDX 7, a high-end audio/video system for a friend's home, with a sound bar for the rear. The system, which includes 4 speakers in the front and rear, and a subwoofer in the back, was easy to set up and it sounded very nice. Unfortunately, after a few months, the sound bar has completely warped, causing some high-pitched, tinny, rattly sounds. The sound bar itself was very cheap and the sound was terrible. I'm not sure why the product itself is so bad, but since my speakers were not faulty I am going to return it.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this item to replace my old Motorola mp3 player that gave me cancer, I replaced it but it was too slow, after 4 months I decided to replace it with the mp3 version of this cd player. Well I thought it is a great product and I really like the sound quality, but it doesn't work very well at all. The player is very loud when the music is playing and it is very annoying when the album you are listening to is in another song and you need to turn the music on again. I am a very loyal customer and this is the third mp3 Player I purchased and every time I find out that the mp4 player works perfectly.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this about a year ago for my office. It's an amazing productivity machine, but has a few bugs that I've experienced. 1. When it's cold outside and you need to charge the device, it takes 10 minutes to find the right socket 2. The power button takes 3 seconds to turn off 3. It can't take the device off when in standby mode. 4. A little annoying that you have to turn the device on and off to access the screen 5. The only way I can access the power button is by pushing the power cable 6. The cable is a little too long to keep the cord out of my desk. Overall, it's a great device, but I wouldn't call it worth the money and will be looking for other options.  Rated 5 out of 5 by David from Brilliant Product! Bought this a year or so ago for a job that required lots of input from several different devices. I needed to run a computer that also acted as a printer/scanner. This was a necessity for the task and it was very useful. I was impressed at the performance. I would definitely recommend this product. .

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first thing that you do wrong with the keyboard is the size of the keypad. I was having problems with some keys not registering correctly, but that problem would have been solved with a standard key pad, which was much smaller. If your computer is having problems, it might be time to replace the keyboard and try again.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Mark from Great Keyboard For the price it's not bad at all. A few tips that may be useful: -I had trouble using the function keys (F1 to F12). In order to change functions I had to depress the key and move the slider at the back of the keyboard to the down position to make it click. -I found that changing the volume and mute buttons is harder than it should be. I could get them to work by pushing on the slider, but this is too big of a task to do that quickly and easily. -the bottom row of the keys is very small for the size and it's a pain to get any more keys to register without using some sort of modifier. This unit works great for the price. I bought the unit to replace an old one that had been in my son's computer for years. I liked the way this unit is, however the problem I had was that a part of the unit broke at the base of the "C" key. It seemed like I didn't notice it when I had it connected for about a week until it started leaking on the underside of the bottom of the case.

I used the digital cable from the store to get this one but the analog cable is much better and just as good  Nice addition to my home theater, great sound for an excellent price. My wife's car stereo does the same thing. Great buy!  It's easy, and it is cheap. But it's not a great sound quality, not by a long shot. Not a very good sound when you want to get great sound.  and the only thing is that it's a little tricky to connect to your car stereo. And its cheap...

I am just going to replace the keyboard with a USB keyboard, but for now, the whole system is in tatters. I also have a MacBook which is way better than the current one. I'm not sure why Apple doesn't sell these laptops as a couple, and you can't even plug them both in at the same time. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    There are only two things about this device: one is the design, and the other is the fact that it does not work at all, as it is always in standby mode.   It's nice to be able to turn on the screen, but the only option is a single-press and the screen goes black.  It should be able to turn on  the screen and it should be capable of turning off the screen (but only if you are on AC).  This is a piece of junk.  I would return it, but will probably return it again when I rebuy this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this for my son to help him with his math problems. It took me 3 weeks to get him his device because I thought I got a good deal. Now I'm not so sure. This thing can't make sound. When he plays music the speakers just barely make sound and when he plays a video it makes no sound.   This is a cheap device and if you are using it to make noise it will be just like an old radio that is not working.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   A good thing about using a CD player is that it has a large variety of tracks to choose from.   I purchased a few tracks of this and it is really a hit or miss as far as quality goes.  The tracks are mostly terrible, including the cover art for "Giant" and "The Golden Age of Rock & Roll".  The first 2 songs are OK, the rest are poor.  Even with the bad tracks the overall quality of the music is a good one, although the cover design for "MTV Video Music Awards" and the music video for "Bad" have some issues.

It was a little bit hard to set up, as it's a Windows PC, but once it was all set up and I figured out how to navigate, it was pretty easy to use. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought the product, and it works great, but it's a very flimsy product.  The design is so cheap, that I could break the unit very easily, as I did the day I got it.  So if you want an easy to use device for a very reasonable price, this is a good choice. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It works fine as long as you do it manually. There are three settings for each control - "Normal" "Bored" and "Tired". Normal turns off all features. Bored takes a lot of time to find the control on the screen, but then you get bored. Tired is the worst. It turns off everything except for the screen. I have tried all of the other settings and they do not work as they should. I will not buy this again.   5-star purchase and very satisfied! I bought a used version of this mouse a while back and have been using it ever since. It is so much more comfortable to use than my old one. The design is very elegant and the way it reacts to the way you move your hand on the mouse is brilliant. I've been using the mouse for about 3 months now and I haven't had any issues with it.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was looking for a wireless keyboard and ended up buying this. After a few days of using it, it started to die. The key presses don't register. The cable comes apart very easily, but it takes too long to put it back together. I had to put a ton of pressure on the key switches to get them to register.    When I was searching for a replacement, I saw this and thought, "Hey, this might work." It's not bad, but the keys don't work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I was very impressed with the quality and value of this set.   The only thing I can do with this set is add my own custom graphics.  My first thought was the sound quality was average.  I am not a audiophile and was not willing to pay the price of high quality. However the other things in the set were very nice. I bought these because of the sound and the fact I already have a set of speakers that look the same.  The sound is not as good as I expected but it is good enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased this laptop for the job I have right now, and I was very happy to be able to transfer files from a desktop computer I had been working on for many years to the new laptop.  The problem I had is that the screen was always off (it was connected to a monitor, and the monitor is connected to another laptop), and when I was on the desktop I couldn't use the keyboard and mouse because the screens were always off.  Since I needed to move my files from the desktop to the laptop, and wanted to use my mouse and keyboard, I had to use the mouse at the cost of the laptop's screen.  This was a big disappointment.

I could not find a service center where I could get a call transferred from my old phone to the new phone. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this for my kids. Well, the sound is terrible. The whole thing is built like a brick shithouse and a good old flat-screen TV.    So I got an old CRT and I'm thinking about putting a TV inside.  So if you don't like a loud soprano voice over a boring black background that has a "cathartic" sound, it won't bother you. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The first time i tried to use this unit was for the first time with an iPhone which didn't work in the first place and i had to call a technical support company to get it to work.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I purchased this for a trip to Hawaii.   When I got home, I found out that the power cord had been soldered in backwards, the buttons would not work and it took almost two weeks to get it working.  To be fair, the phone is supposed to be for emergencies and travel, and for a business traveler, it should work well. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   It has no control for temperature. If you don't use it often, you probably don't need a fan or any other cooling device. The fan is pretty loud so I have to leave it on in order to hear anything. The cord is a pain because it is too short.     Rated 5 out of 5 by TheAbleShark from Great product. I bought this for my PC and it works well. It is compact enough to place on the shelf next to the cable box. It fits on the case with a few snips. The built in cord is very well made. The only drawback was that I bought the AC adapter and my computer didn't like it. After the computer had heat from the AC unit, the adapter went flat and didn't work. Luckily, I remembered to order a replacement for the adapter.  The AC adapter is a nice addition to this product and I really appreciate the ease of which it is to use.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought these to replace my older units because they were too heavy and noisy.  They were fine for a few months until they started getting really loud. They're not as loud as my old ones, but I have to turn them down on my stereo to hear music (and the volume controls are hard to turn down).   It's nice that the unit only draws about 1.6 amps, but the noise bothers me. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was thrilled with the size of the box and it came in an excellent shape.  I purchased a Samsung 4GB sd card, and the memory card is no longer usable.  The SD card is a bit small, and my device seems to work fine but there is no way I can return it as the card is now unusable.  It's now been two days and I can't return it because the sd card is already full.  This is the third time I have purchased a card from Samsung and they always have to charge me $1 for the return.  After two days I can no longer recommend Samsung's products, but the $1 charge will help cover the cost.   Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from Good, but not great The sd card has 8gb. This is a good size and does not take up much space. I recommend using a card that is at least that size. I can use it without using the sd or usb ports, but if you want to use it with the sd you need the adapters (SD card adapter and sd card cable). The sd is a little slow, so I am only giving it a 4.5.  Good, but you still need a little help. The card is okay but not something you would use all the time. It is quite small and the case and card are a little flimsy. I would not use it on a daily basis.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have been a long time fan of this device. I have the 2.1 version and love it. The audio is very good, the interface is very flexible, and the interface software is easy to learn.   Unfortunately, this model seems to have a major problem: The headphone jack is the only port on the board.  It seems like if your device only has a single port, you will have a problem with this device because it is unable to support headphones.  I am considering switching to the 2x1 version, but I am still happy with this one.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   After opening my package, it was a little stiff and I wasn't sure how I wanted it to work. I was just looking at it to figure out how to get into my car to drive. That said, the sound is nice. It's not that bad. I'm not a big audiophile so I don't really need it but it is a nice little tool for those of us who need to do something with our sound system that is not a car stereo.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought this device and when I got it, the speakers had been replaced with inferior, cheap, generic ones that sound like they've been cranked. This is the first device that has had a major malfunction with these speakers.   The sound quality is OK.  They do get loud and full but the bass isn't as deep as I had hoped for. I still listen to these occasionally and I can understand how this might be a good choice for someone who likes audiobooks. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this product to replace my older Toshiba DVD burner, and I'm very disappointed in the experience. The disc reader is just okay, the DVD drive is a poor choice, and the software is... a mess.   It runs so slowly you can't turn it on, and when it does start, the screen is just a little too low resolution.  I tried to change the DVD speed from 'auto' to'slow' because I like to watch movies at a slow, but still reasonably fast, speed, but the default was auto anyway.  But, as I said before, I really wanted this new DVD drive, so I'm disappointed that I wasted my money on this. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I purchased these to replace a broken Samsung SGH-T999. After installing these I installed a SGH CX600 which is a much better sounding CD player but I can only get the CX 600 to play music. The sound quality is so bad I can hear every single thud and click of my fingers as I'm pressing the CD player buttons. I think I am going to get a S-880. This is a horrible product. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The unit is OK, but it is very loud. This is a really important feature because you can't put on a CD or listen to music if there is any noise.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The old model was fine for what I needed, but the new one, while nice, has issues.  The "click" sound is extremely loud, and it's loud enough to be noticed, so I usually turn it down.  However, since it's in "always on" mode it's almost impossible to get a good sound through speakers.  As a result, I can't really use it at home for anything except media.  I also feel like the batteries don't last very long, so that the noise isn't even a problem.  And, to top it off, the buttons don't seem to be very sensitive.   (Edit: The new model is definitely better for what it is: It is quieter, lasts a lot longer, has better buttons, and has more advanced features.)

If the dongles are free and it is only for use with a certain device like an android or a iPhone then you can get a donguell if you want that, but for what is billed as a "universal phone dongler," it is very expensive. Also, if you don't already own an iphone or a ipad, you can't use the iphones, ipads, etc. as phone dongs.

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The original iPod and the iTunes Music Store are pretty great. The iPod had the same basic function as the iPod Classic, but with more content. It also plays music, videos, and podcasts. But, if you want to transfer all of your iTunes music onto the iPhone, the only way to do that is to purchase a new iPod. If you have a large library of iTunes songs, you may have to buy an entirely new iPod to get all of that music onto your iPhone. If the iPod was designed for your iPod Classic rather than your iPhone, it would not have the same problems.

Noise level: Very noisy. ...  Overall: This is an excellent unit. It has all the features you want, plus the great sound quality. I use this when my Sony turntable isn't doing the job. It works very well for playing music. 2 of 2 customers found this review helpful The BEST turntables  January 16, 2016 By: J.B from San Francisco, CA United States This turntabear is great. It is very solid and the sound quality is fantastic. It doesn't distort at all, it's very quiet. I'm a big fan of the Sony stuff and the Walkman is just as good. It really makes me want to buy a turntablism. Thanks
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The screen is very tiny, with no function.   It's the exact same old, same old.  I'm sorry. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought these to replace my old Motorola cell phone. I love the fact that I can control my music by just talking to the phone, but the fact is that they only play a few songs when you say the volume.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It's a very cool design. The battery life is terrible. You are better off paying the extra $ for a nice, full size USB keyboard. This is the reason I didn't get a good keyboard.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The cord for this product is ridiculous.   They could have used a standard length plug for this.  The device will not even charge it's own battery.  They should make the cord the same length as other devices. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The cable is long but the signal it receives is weak.  It could be a good value, if it is used correctly. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this item a few weeks ago. I just needed a few songs and I just want to say how disappointed I am with the performance of this computer. The sound is terrible, the mouse can not be changed, and the CD player doesn't play the same cd every time, which is why I bought it. The problem is I just bought this to play my computer cd, so I just used the same music for it.   This is a huge waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The unit is a bad design and is too heavy to take to the airport.   When you pull the plug off, it takes 30 min. to charge up.  The sound is horrible and you can't control it at all. The unit does come with a remote control and it works well but the remote is small and hard to use with one hand. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I was looking for a nice, compact, light-weight hard drive to store my PC's files. I was using a 2.5 inch drive, but it was getting a bit tight.  I searched for something better and found this.  It is not very convenient to use, but if you are using it to keep a few hundred songs on it, it works great.   If you want something to store large files or you use a laptop, this would probably be my favorite. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the first time I have owned the Lenovo T61p laptop (t61p is just a new model). It's very basic, the keyboard is too small, and the track pad is so small, that I have to use the on-screen keyboard.   Overall, it's a good computer, but I really wish it had some more useful features. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This thing is just annoying. I can't play the game at all because I keep getting kicked out by the game server because it keeps crashing. The mouse is slow and clunky.   I don't like it much but it does what it's supposed to do and it costs less than the Xbox 360. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This is the worst product I've ever purchased. It took a week to break in and then one day I plugged it into my laptop and it wouldn't work. It kept resetting. After a week of playing around with it I decided to send it back.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    So what the hell is this thing anyway. I have a Toshiba DVD burner which takes care of my DVD library well, and I'm using this one to burn CDs but I can't seem to burn a CD or DVD. I get about 8 to 10 hours of play time before I have to restart. And I'm having to play the CD in a different device and in the CD player to get any use out of it. I don't get much out of watching videos, as I'm a bit picky and have trouble with crappy sound and a lot of the videos are badly lit. This just seems like more of a waste of money.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only reason I gave it three stars is because it has a built in sound system which is great, but if the battery dies it will take hours to charge up.   It would make a great gift for someone who likes music, but who has never owned an mp3 player, but they are on the lookout for the ultimate digital experience.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    This   Is   awful   It   doesn't   do   what   I wanted it to   Do   to    me. I purchased it  because   my   desktop   computer   had   a  bad   sound   and   screen.   The   mouse   isn't    that   good   but   its   all   the   thing   that    matters   when   you   play   games   on   this  . The   mouse     can   be   changed   for   more   better   sounds   than   before  ,  but  the   thing   is   the  main   reason   of   buying   it      the first   time   because   I   really   prefer   using   an   external   speaker   like   Apple  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I have a brand new LG Electronics Vivid 5, and so far I'm very happy.  The screen has a nice clear picture and has great picture quality, the speakers are good, the microphone is not great, the battery is adequate, and it's nice and light.    This is the first of the Vivid series I have bought, and I'm glad I got one. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The computer was so slow that I had to use it for a short time. I ended up getting a cheaper, more powerful, and more reliable machine. The problem is that the computer is so slow there is no way to save work. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This is a good looking product. I bought this to use as a secondary computer for the TV and for watching my DVDs on it. I have a Windows computer and this is much better than the Windows system I have now and does everything it can.   It only had an update for the remote ( I don't use the remote) and the remote only plays music with the Xbox 360, not all movies and tv shows. I use it to surf the net and play games. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   This product does not work well for the most part.  It has the capability to work for 15 minutes, but it takes 2-3 hours to start and 5 hours to stop.  I tried the USB adapter for the iPad 2, and it works fine.   
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   My laptop is a beast. The quality is very high. However, the keyboard has a strange click sound when you hit it and it feels as though it has an old school plastic feel. I have purchased a couple of new laptops in the past, but this is by far the worst. I bought this laptop on eBay, and it was a steal.   I got it for about $500. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The iPod nano, at least in my opinion, is a bad iPod.   It's small and not very portable.  It does the job of music listening, but it's a huge pain to play music because of the way the button is in the middle of the device and difficult to access.  The remote does work, but the interface is very clunky and hard to navigate.  In addition, the fact that the remote requires batteries and is extremely flimsy makes it rather inconvenient. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The sound quality is the only thing that bothers me about this piece.   I'm using my computer for editing music and the sound quality just isn't right for my needs. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The only thing I didn't like was the fact that it doesn't play CD's.   I would have bought this product and not gotten another one for another year. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The sound quality of this device is excellent, but it gets very warm to the ear when using it at full volume.   This is caused by the ear pads being made of flimsy plastic, which can get quite warm to touch. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought this in the hopes of getting a decent digital clock for the money. The box has a picture of a hand holding a pendulum. This makes no sense for a digital clock, it is so hard to keep the pendulum from swinging around. I got the clock for Christmas but my daughter was disappointed with it as the pendulums were not in the right positions and the numbers were not the right sizes. It was really hard to put the clock together, I had to put it together with a screwdriver for the second pendulum, which was a pain, and a very annoying time consuming task.  The other two pendulum positions are a little better, the only thing I don't like about it is the number of steps it takes to complete the operation.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    Very poor build quality, it is very difficult to clean. If it had a back light it would be great. It is very easy to lose track of where you are and the lack of a rear light is annoying. The batteries are not rechargeable but instead are built into the case making them difficult to replace.      (3/13/2014)   My wife and I love our   Apple   iMac and our  iPad, both of which were replaced this year.  After buying a  i iMac for my brother-in-law,   we  found out that the   battery of our  i  iMAC is a bad   design.  We  are both   so disappointed in the i iMAC, the iMac that we purchased from  Best Buy and then replaced with our  new  i Mac is more reliable, better built, easier to use, and the  LED backlight makes the  Mac and iPad easier to read in low lighting conditions. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The only redeeming quality of this   was the fact that   you don't have to use   your keyboard and mouse and still get the   best of both worlds.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The product is amazing and the best product I own. However, the cord is terrible. The cord has 2 strands of nylon and a cord tie. One strand goes inside the case while the other goes outside. When the cord goes inside, it can get tangled and I have had to pull the cord out of the case every couple of times I wanted to charge. When it comes to cord tie, I am so glad I have a different color than the black. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought the blu ray for a friend as he was a big fan of the original series but it was a lot of work to actually watch the blu rays and this thing just keeps freezing up and doesn't display the artwork and the sound is terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I received this as a gift and I was so impressed that I used it every day for two weeks.   The problem is that it was just terrible to use.  It's like it's not working at all.  This was a deal where you pay for it after 2 weeks and it's crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   The first thing you notice about this is the cheap feel to the metal.   Even though it is well made it is still plastic.  I bought the white one to replace a Black model, but I got a black one instead.  When I tried to power on the unit, there was a problem where the light would come on after a few seconds.  It would be nice if the unit was able to power up and down with a button instead of a light. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My laptop battery was dead when I received it, and I went out and purchased a battery in the same size and type. It is about 2 weeks now, and has not run out even though the computer is plugged in.   If you want something with a "wow" factor, get a battery that is more powerful and lasts longer. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    The old portable iBook had terrible battery life, and even when connected to a computer, it would shut down for no good reason.   I now use a wireless eReader from Barnes and Noble called the Nook HDX 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    My old iPod was too cheap to be good, but its screen got fuzzy after a few years. My new iPod will not be repaired for about 1 year unless someone decides to take apart the screen. I am very disappointed in the company.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Robert from Good for portable use but poor sound I bought a second one for portable recording. The sound is acceptable. It has a decent battery life. The problem is that the sound quality is poor. I've bought other portable players that were much better in sound quality, like the Sony PDR-750, which is the player I am replacing. I would buy another one if this one was a little bit cheaper.  The speaker quality is much better on the newer model. The previous model had poor sound quality and was loud. I just don't know why I bought the second one.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought two of these a month ago, for my work desk and a room where I use the computer, and they are absolutely useless. They are both very noisy, very expensive, and only work if you use them while on the couch. I purchased the two in blue because the red ones were too red.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought two of these for my iPad mini. These are just terrible. They are extremely slow and take forever to charge. The first one was faulty. I was able to get it back to my local Apple store and have it replaced. The second one didn't work out either. The customer service agent at the Apple store said I was being too hard on the device. The problem was with the charger I bought and I should have not used a different type of charger. I guess you can be hard on your computer if it doesn't work!

Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    It takes a very long time to get a good connection and even longer for a bad connection.   If you really want to save your life, this is NOT the device for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:    I bought a Tv mod from a friend a couple of months ago and it just doesn't work. I have 3 other brands of the same product and all three are working as well. I bought this one from Walmart and I have to say it doesn't look like it has any circuitry in it at all and the cord looks like it came from a cigarette lighter.  
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I bought a used Toshiba Qosmio for $100 (it was on sale at the time) and it died after a couple of years because of a faulty USB connection.   It also made a loud sound that was annoying.  I looked online and found a new one for $200.  Not too much of a good price for what you get.
Write a negative review about a bad electronic device:   I love my MacBook Pro but the TrackPad doesn't work when i'm using it as a mouse. It's very sensitive but you have to be very precise when you use it. It also doesn't seem to like to be closed. It stays open all the time.   The only good thing is that the screen is beautiful.
